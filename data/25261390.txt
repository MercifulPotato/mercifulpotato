Marly&#x27;s pursuit by Virek in Count Zero springs to mind here.&quot;</i><p>But that&#x27;s an exception, only made possible by Virek&#x27;s virtually limitless wealth.<p>When Marly becomes aware of this surveillance it&#x27;s a shock to her, because she and most people in that world are not used to that level of surveillance.<p>Contrast that with today&#x27;s world, where most people know they&#x27;re being tracked and surveilled, but are ok with it, or even willingly participate in surveillance of themselves.<p>No one today would be surprised to be told they were recorded in public (due to ubiquitous cameras in public places) or that someone knew where they were (due to the tracking built in to their cell phones).<p>Gibson did not foresee this.')
