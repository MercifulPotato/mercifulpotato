Item(by='eigenvalue', descendants=None, kids=[25346251, 25346390, 25348419, 25347879], score=None, time=1607438319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345134, text='Besides assuming that Apple can’t match those other (very small, likely undercapitalized) audio companies in terms of sounds quality— something I sort of doubt considering that Apple probably spent more in R&amp;D on these than those companies have had in total cumulative revenues combined— it also assumes that it’s all about the sound quality. As someone who just ordered these, I wear noise canceling headphones (currently Bose QC from nearly 5 years ago) for several hours a day while I work, and I can tell you that I care much more about comfort and noise canceling performance. I just assume great sound since that has been available for decades now in decent headphones. I remember buying Grado SR80s back in 2002, and they sounded great. Unfortunately, they hurt my ears after 30 minutes and everyone around me could hear my music. Also, they had a thick, heavy cable. Sound quality isn’t everything.<p>Considering that Apple just made Intel look like a bunch of fools despite Intel making more processors for longer than just about anyone, at this point it’s silly to be so skeptical of Apple when they introduce a product like this after years of effort.')
