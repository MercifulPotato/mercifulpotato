Tesla FSD drives like a human, looking through the cameras and trying to figure out where the car is supposed to go in the lane. Waymo relies heavily on super precise mapping to determine where the road is. In theory Waymo should be able to drive correctly with no road markings at all.<p>The reliance on maps means Waymo can drive in Wayless places, but more reliably in those places.')
