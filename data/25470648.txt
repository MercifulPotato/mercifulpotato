The 1.92TB drives I mentioned are SanDisk CloudSpeed Eco II, and they have been pretty good. What&#x27;s really impressed me are the Dell&#x2F;Toshiba write-optimized 1.6TB drives I picked up. Pricey, but excellent performance.<p>I have a few I think 240GB Intel drives I picked up as well. They initially had some of the problems you&#x27;re referring to, which for me was not showing up after a warm reboot, but they haven&#x27;t done that for a while, so I&#x27;m thinking it may have been fixed by an OS update.')
