Item(by='adolph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602601185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764755, text='<i>how do we measure if we are succeeding?</i><p>I think of these devices as part of a long term, broad based parenting strategy aimed at opening mental access to a variety of human activity that includes but is not dominated by technology. The measures of this are very person-specific. It could be engagement, attainment, development, etc. I don&#x27;t think there is a measure for all of &quot;we.&quot;<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware there is no &quot;call home feature&quot; and I am very glad that there isn&#x27;t as my goal is to clear many paths for the kids to choose from and not excessively encourage any particular one. If one were to have a measure, you can connect MakeCode to a GitHub account and track commits. If that became the measure, I&#x27;m sure the funnest kids would find a way to break it with negative 2000 lines of code [0] or the like.<p>Having tried Raspberry Pi, micro:bit and ESP8266 with my kids at various points I&#x27;ve found the micro:bit and MakeCode package to be at a sweet spot of simplicity and &quot;batteries included.&quot; It contains many features like Bluetooth transfer of code that is brilliantly easy and enough sensors and lights to see something real without much yak shaving. There is a sufficient ecosystem of micro-bit slotted servo drivers and complete kits to fit different learning experiences.<p>If a person is interested in more sophisticated programming then a full Linux machine is great. If they want to sprinkle sensors everywhere then the Arduino universe is great. For someone who is curious but not committed then the micro:bit is an accessible path to develop a budding interest.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.folklore.org&#x2F;StoryView.py?story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.folklore.org&#x2F;StoryView.py?story=Negative_2000_Li...</a>')
