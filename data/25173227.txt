Which could happen.<p>But that would also imply they&#x27;d have to allow Firefox, and Brave, and Tor Browser. Which would certainly be worth the &quot;cost&quot; of allowing Chrome.<p>&gt; Some of the &quot;antitrust&quot; stuff getting tossed around is already starting to get exploited by entities like advertisers, and not just big ones like Facebook, there were those EU ones recently.<p>All political coalitions work like this. If you&#x27;re against DMCA 1201 then commercial pirates will be on your side. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re your friends. They&#x27;re not, and in fact are costing your side goodwill, even if your side is right in the end.<p>&gt; Like all power, Apple&#x27;s focusing of its user&#x27;s collective power can be used not just for bad stuff but for very good stuff as well. But that nuance doesn&#x27;t seem to be present in a lot of the last year&#x27;s discussions<p>Because it&#x27;s true of anything.
