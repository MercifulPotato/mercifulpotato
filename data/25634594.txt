First you set up nginx with the rtmp module[1]. Then you can use OBS to stream your desktop to the RTMP server. I set OBS to send a keyframe every 1 second.<p>On the client side you have two options:<p>1. For low-latency game streaming, I would suggest watching through the RTMP stream. The RTMP module for nginx will re-broadcast your RTMP stream to all the clients that connect. I was able to get a latency of around 1 second by watching through:<p><pre><code>   ffplay -fflags nobuffer -loglevel verbose rtmp:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-servers-ip-address&#x2F;live&#x2F;test\n</code></pre>\nI would expect better latency from a webrtc solution like Lightspeed but 1 second latency is pretty good for only having to install nginx.<p>2. HLS&#x2F;Dash. The nginx RTMP module will also expose the video stream as HLS&#x2F;Dash which is just cutting the stream up into files and serving them over http. Personally I set my segment size to 1 second and my playlist size to 4 seconds. Through this I get approximately a 4-second latency. Not great for competitive multiplayer games like Jackbox but if you&#x27;re playing something like a world building game with friends then its acceptable. The real benefit to HLS&#x2F;Dash is you can easily watch it through an html5 web video player or even a chromecast[2].<p>Bits you can add on top:<p>- I put my HLS&#x2F;Dash directories in a tmpfs mount for speed and reduced wear on the drives<p>- I put the nginx stream module in front of my rtmp module so that it can handle TLS (making it RTMPS)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arut&#x2F;nginx-rtmp-module" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arut&#x2F;nginx-rtmp-module</a><p>On FreeBSD it was just a checkbox in the nginx port, so the work involved may vary by distro.<p>[2] I haven&#x27;t attempted to play the RTMP stream through chromecast so for all I know, that might be supported too. All I&#x27;ve tested so far on chromecast is an HLS stream using the &quot;castnow&quot; CLI program. The Shaka player, which is a web player, will support chromecasting an HLS stream from your browser but I&#x27;ve only tested their demo videos, not my personal streams, and I had to use official google chrome, not chromium, but it worked on both android and linux.')
