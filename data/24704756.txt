I cook a lot, and love not having to think about how many pots&#x2F;pans&#x2F;dishes I&#x27;ll use and how I have to scrub them later. I don&#x27;t do any prewash either. Everything goes straight into the dishwasher and comes out sparkling every time. Maybe I&#x27;m just really lucky with my machine&#x2F;detergent.<p>It&#x27;s also great because I don&#x27;t need extra space for a drying rack.')
