The &quot;Appetizer&quot; on the website begins with:<p><i>Especially at turning points in life, people ask questions like:<p>Is there any purpose at all in living? Or is everything completely pointless?\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nHow can I choose among the many ways I could spend the rest of my life?\nDoes everyoneâ€™s life have the same purpose, or does everyone have their own?\nWhere does purpose come from? Does it have some ultimate source, or is it just a personal invention?</i><p>These seem like questions without answers. Or, alternatively, the correct answer is whatever you decide it to be.<p>Imagine a dog or dolphin or octopus asking this question. We&#x27;d think: &quot;Why are you asking such questions? You&#x27;re a dog&#x2F;dolphin&#x2F;octopus. You do dog&#x2F;dolphin&#x2F;octopus things. That&#x27;s all you&#x27;re supposed to do.&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t it the same with humans? We do human things. Take care of ourselves and our loved ones. Help others who need help. Try to better ourselves.<p>Does it need to be any more complex than that?')
