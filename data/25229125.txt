Item(by='jac241', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606488870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227693, text='In my experience it&#x27;s faster for learning because you will recall more after a study period if you do the flash cards vs. rereading things a few times. Not an either or thing as well. I would put a lot of my lecture notes in the extra section of the flash cards, then if I want to get more context I can scroll through my cards sorted by created_at in the browser.<p>Ideal workflow is watching lecture online at 2x speed with Anki add card window open along side lecture window, pausing when it&#x27;s time to make a card, write the text for the card and use Lightshot screenshot to quickly grab any images or text (or for image occlusion if you&#x27;re using that, rebind screenshot capture to F4 so you don&#x27;t need to use your mouse hand to press PrntScrn). Once you&#x27;re done adding cards, go through them once that day. Or, if you&#x27;re using a premade deck, watch the lecture, unsuspend cards relevant to the lecture, then go through them right away.<p>Not sure if you&#x27;re using it for school or not, but I think the process will work the same either way. Works even better if you&#x27;re using it along with a memory palace kind of thing like SketchyMicro or Pixorize. Those images will be burned in your brain and your recall will be insane.')
