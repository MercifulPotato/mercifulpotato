I&#x27;m fairly certain the correct pronunciation is two distinct syllables (almost word level separation) &quot;Oh&quot; &quot;oth&quot; it should never have one syllable and sound like &quot;oath&quot; or &quot;oh ah ooth&quot;.  While i&#x27;m sure there are some languages where the &quot;oth&quot; is an odd phoneme it&#x27;s pretty hard to confuse &quot;Oh&quot; &quot;oth&quot; with much of anything else in English.<p>Sure people might not know about it, but there are tons of tech things people don&#x27;t know about. That&#x27;s a separate issue.')
