The basic argument is that the Amphetamine app has been able to slide for so long that the ToS provision it violates should be treated as a dead letter, or as if some statute of limitations had expired; the Amphetamine brand has existed so long (and under such favorable conditions) in the app store that the developer now has an economic interest in the brand, gained through a reliance on Apple&#x27;s non-enforcement of this ToS provision.<p>The developer could try suing Apple on the basis of <i>laches</i>, the legal doctrine whereby if one party has &#x27;slept on their rights&#x27; so long that the situation changed, they can&#x27;t suddenly decide to enforce a term later. But there&#x27;s no hard and fast rule about this, and since it would tie Apple&#x27;s hands they&#x27;d probably fight it tooth and nail, throwing enough legal resources at it to wear out any opposition.')
