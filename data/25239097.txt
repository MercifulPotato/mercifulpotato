This seems to be optimized for portability and consistent mapping to the input, not optimized for size, so there&#x27;s a lot of stuff like [1]:<p><pre><code>    typedef enum CRC_SRC_SEL {\n    CRC_SRC_0                                = 0x00000000,\n    CRC_SRC_1                                = 0x00000001,\n    CRC_SRC_2                                = 0x00000002,\n    CRC_SRC_3                                = 0x00000003,\n    } CRC_SRC_SEL;\n</code></pre>\nThis might seem silly and redundant, and there are arguably better ways to express it, but the explicit approach makes a lot more sense if you skim the other definitions and see that some are 1-indexed, some have discontinuities, some have non-obvious reserved or otherwise special values, some have a totally distinct meaning for each value, etc.. Some of the definitions do look questionable, but on the whole I don&#x27;t think any amount of macro magic could actually make these definitions <i>small</i>; the feature set of a modern GPU really is massively complex.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux&#x2F;blob&#x2F;c84e1efae022071a4fcf9f1899bf71777c49943a&#x2F;drivers&#x2F;gpu&#x2F;drm&#x2F;amd&#x2F;include&#x2F;navi10_enum.h#L1092" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux&#x2F;blob&#x2F;c84e1efae022071a4fcf9...</a>')
