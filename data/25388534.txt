Because they were niche - to choose Apple was to signal that you&#x27;re different from the masses.<p>That&#x27;s still <i>somewhat</i> true - they do not yet dominate laptop or desktop markets, and outside the U.S. they are not (as) dominant in smartphones.<p>But they do dominate some of the newer product categories, just as they dominated portable music players - tablets, smartwatches.<p>I&#x27;m unsure how much of the headphone market they harvest.<p>My point of all this is that many got the pleasure of feeling unique and &quot;smarter than the rest&quot; by getting the novelty Apple items that most people were too ignorant to value. But it evolved over time and now maybe it&#x27;s something else?')
