Those who answered with the online answer (because they went to the bathroom and found it on their phone) got a zero on the test.<p>There are so many details lacking (e.g. when and where did this happen?) that I question its veracity, but if it <i>did</i> happen it seems pretty inconsiderate to the non-cheating students to put an unsolvable question on there.')
