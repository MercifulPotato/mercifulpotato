And then, of course, `git add` would be need to be added to the list too.  To add untracked files you could use interactive mode `git add -i` and forgo reading `status`.  But you can also `git commit -p` if you only modified files and forgo the `add` step.<p>And to give yourself a sense of the commit graph, these aliases come in handy<p><pre><code>    [alias]\n        lol = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit\n        lola = log --graph --date=short --pretty=format:&#x27;%C(auto)%h %C(dim)%ad%C(auto)%d %s&#x27; --all\n</code></pre>\nThe only &#x27;advanced&#x27; thing I commonly do is `git rebase -i` to squash a bunch of WIP commits.
