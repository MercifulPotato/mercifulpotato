For cases like neighborhood groceries, customers do develop some knowledge of where to find things are (stores change the ailes but not so much) so not much of repeat usage either.<p>- for grocery and shopping, isn&#x27;t it good for the Shop to have customers spend more time in the store? &quot;walk through the full store and pick what you want...&quot;  I would say some customers also enjoying browsing through the wares (the so called retail therapy)<p>There are definitely some real problems like helping passengers navigate through different gates&#x2F; terminals, large office buildings, finding the right department in a large hospital building and so on.<p>However given the investments needed in setting up the different IOT sensors to help the mapping + navigating effort, I really wonder if this indoor mapping can ever have a sound business model?')
