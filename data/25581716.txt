We charged $1 &#x2F; person in the pool. Made about $1,500 in total for the event.<p>- I paid about $400 in ads to Google: they have a much better business model than us ;)<p>- I competed against free offerings, and I still had clients, because I could afford ads, they could not.<p>- It was a very strange, happy feeling when the first customer paid us. They decided to give actual money to us, some complete strangers??? To a website that looked totally amateurish, with no design whatsoever? Felt weird.<p>- I would have made way more money by working at McDonalds for the same amount of time. But that was not the point.<p>- It did not make sense to continue after the event, not enough $$ to be made.<p>Overall a very, very positive experience. I helped with my programming skills, and gave me confidence that people would buy something that works, even if ugly and unknown people.')
