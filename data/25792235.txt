Her spokesman said Monday the German leader found it “problematic” that corporate managers could deny someone access under rules not defined by law.<p>&gt; Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, later called for new regulations that would govern the use of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in the European Union.
