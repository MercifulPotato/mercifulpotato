Making a stupid analogy doesn&#x27;t help it. There are no dragons, just individual people making decisions about how much to save and for what purpose, and when to spend it, based on their individual circumstances.<p>Holding on to savings is neither positive nor negative, and should be a personal decision based on individual&#x27;s circumstances (that&#x27;s where the most detailed information are available about what&#x27;s good for the individual), not something forced&#x2F;influenced from the top by blunt whole market manipulation via forced depreciation of value of money, by some committee.<p>All you&#x27;ve achieved by forced depreciation is forcing people to make needless risks, just to keep value of their savings, while they&#x27;re trying to save up for something (like starting a business, or buying a flat, or safety of mind). Whole class of brokers, and traders, and lenders, who pray on this situation benefit, of course.')
