Sure, computers are already really fast, but the big thing with the M1 Macs for me is that they&#x27;ve finally came out with a laptop that doesn&#x27;t heat up like crazy when I&#x27;m using it for moderately demanding tasks.<p>Also every laptop I&#x27;ve had prior, would get pretty hot or the fan would get quite loud when connected to an  external display.
