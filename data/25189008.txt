The folks doing serverless work at University of Wisconsin-Madison generally do a good job, but they really whiffed on that one.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a reasonable sense in which KVM&#x2F;Qemu moves more functionality to the guest kernel than KVM&#x2F;Firecracker does. Both depend on the guest kernel for VM setup (KVM), low-level virtualization operations (KVM), and doing the actual IO below their paravirtualized device drivers. On the other end, Linux containers don&#x27;t have a guest kernel (unless you use some kind of library OS). So those boxes should collapse together. If you look at it one way, gVisor <i>is</i> a guest kernel, which depends on the host kernel in fundamentally similar ways to what Firecracker or Qemu do.')
