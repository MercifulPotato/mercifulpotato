Looking out for each other is built into the makeup of our countries, systems and society.<p>In the US, it is literally &quot;Me vs. You&quot;, &quot;Everyman for himself&quot;, &quot;Pay your own way&quot;, etc. It is simply not in the makeup of their society to help others. While of course there are extremely kind and generous people who do, it&#x27;s not the way the systems are setup, so it&#x27;s not the default way people think about things.<p>Also because tens of millions of people are within a millimetre of bankruptcy&#x2F;starvation&#x2F;living on the street, they literally have no head space or ability to do anything other than meet their own basic needs.<p>Here in Canada tens of millions of people have been getting $2k every month since March. Same in Australia.<p>In the US they got $1,200. ONCE. That changes a lot.')
