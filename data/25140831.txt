Item(by='jstummbillig', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605725891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137459, text='&gt; This is not to say that a company should do anything it wants, far from it. It simply means that if you accept that you live in a market-enabled society, your salary is at stake, too. You want to pay $2 dollars for milk, instead of $20? That&#x27;s thanks to competition between companies. That&#x27;s market forces at play. You want it there? Accept it on salary negotiation too.<p>So, what exactly are you saying then? Should there be checks in place to ensure salary negotiations between an employer and employee be treated differently than two big companies hashing out milk prices or not?<p>If not <i>that</i> would certainly be a very naive position which gets increasingly problematic, quickly, the more lopsided negotiation power and money is distributed between the two parties. A human centric society has to provide checks for that. An understanding of what we want can for example be driven by articles such as the one linked and is instrumental to the process.')
