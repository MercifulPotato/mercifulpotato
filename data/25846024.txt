Most of our stack is JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;Flow, so no one can just jump in and work on it very easily - they first have to learn ReScript and all of it&#x27;s different concepts, approaches, and nuances (or refresh themselves if they&#x27;ve done that but haven&#x27;t worked on the project in a while). It&#x27;s a HUGE context switch. At least TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript so it&#x27;s very easy to get up to speed on for a JavaScript developer, and switch between.<p>For a side project this is fun. But I would never consider this for a &quot;real-world&quot; project (i.e. something you get paid for). At least not anytime soon. Maybe in a few years if there&#x27;s wider adoption, but that&#x27;s a long way off.')
