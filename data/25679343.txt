Regarding deniability I personally would consider it as an anti-feature because the one receiving the message can&#x27;t prove to the wider world that they received it from a certain person and similarly someone who is falsely accused of posting a certain message can&#x27;t go and say &quot;show the signatures of the messages or you are lying&quot;.<p>By the way, do you know if the one receiving the messages can force messages that are marked as &quot;disappearing&quot; to be kept?')
