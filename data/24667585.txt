To be honest it&#x27;s a bit of chart&#x2F;graph overload for me. If you&#x27;ve got the moment I&#x27;d appreciate and find helpful your take on this -<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;for-most-us...</a><p>Is the article talking about something different? Would you say they&#x27;re incorrect? Is their data old? Etc.<p>To me it seems they&#x27;re arguing real wages haven&#x27;t increased that much in the last 40 years.<p>Also I just want to point out, that the very end of your article about wages increasing for low-wage workers, says:<p>&quot;That&#x27;s not to say that low-paid workers have it easy. According to the Tax Policy Center, the bottom 20% of households are earning typical annual income of about $13,300. By comparison, the top 20% of U.S. households earn about $221,000 annually, or nearly 17 times more than the lowest quintile.&quot;<p>My interpretation is, who cares if there&#x27;s a 50% wage increase from $10&#x2F;hr to $15&#x2F;hr if neither of those is a decent living wage to begin with, and the folks at the top of the pyramid are just making staggering amounts of money? The top 20% averages $220K, the top 1% ... much much more.<p>Which is a bit off-topic, but, at the end of the day economics itself is about <i>people</i>, otherwise there&#x27;d be no point! : )')
