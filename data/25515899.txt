Before this, they had a share of 2$ worth of assets. Now they have a share of 1.5$ worth of assets.<p>Or, from another point of view. If you own shares in a company, you want that company to do well. Having the company raise more money (for the same dilution) is going to help the company do well.<p>Or, from yet another point of view, all these new shareholders are going to be taking a share of your dividend. You&#x27;d like the company to be able to use the new assets to grow quickly so they can pay out more dividend in total.<p>My point is, shareholders have reason to care about more than just the share price of a company.')
