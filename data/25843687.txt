I certainly appreciate your moderation and how quiet a place HN is in comparison with the rest of the rowdy world &amp; internet. It&#x27;s certainly a special place and I don&#x27;t want to disturb that.<p>As you can see here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25843540" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25843540</a>, I do try to reach out where the opportunity is available, even with those I might disagree with.<p>--<p>It seems you think this issue is particularly inflammatory to me (and others) because of &quot;nationalistic interests,&quot; but for me it&#x27;s much more about friendships. I have a group of Falun Gong practicing friends in Amsterdam, my math tutor was Taiwanese and had family who disappeared on the mainland, and I know a <i>lot</i> of people who were lucky enough to get out of China, including a very good family friend.<p>On the other hand, an opthamologist who almost treated me and whose clinic I regularly visit stepped down after being ousted as a member of the Thousand Talents Program (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesofsandiego.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;08&#x2F;ucsd-doctor-resigns-thousand-talents-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesofsandiego.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;08&#x2F;ucsd-doctor...</a>).<p>--<p>With respect, I do think there is a lot of gaslighting in this thread (from my side as well, perhaps).<p>I&#x27;ll refrain from posting such things in the future.')
