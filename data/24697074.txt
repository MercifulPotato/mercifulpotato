After reading the incredibly rich, beautifully rendered world of The Anubis Gates, I expected more of the same from his other books, but no, not quite as good, oddly. That book however remains the single best time travel fantasy novel I&#x27;ve ever read to this day.<p>The blend of nearly phantasmagoric horror, fantasy and a touch of science fiction is unique too. If anyone knows of any similar novels from other authors, i&#x27;m all ears.')
