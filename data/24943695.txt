In the Table 2, the line for mortality at 28 days shows a cut by a factor of 0.54 on HCQ. The difference is not at the standard 0.05 significance level, with a p-value of 0.22. However this does not mean the result is false. It could just as well be the sample size is not large enough for the significance to reach the 0.05 level.&quot;<p>And some of these studies are having a hard time because the Covid mortality rate has dropped tremendously:<p>Internet survey RCT subject to survey bias. There was no death or ICU admission. Low risk healthcare workers, median age ~40. 494 1x&#x2F;week dosing, 495 2x&#x2F;week dosing, 494 control participants (1x and 2x participants received the same overall dosage).<p>They studied 1500 participants with no deaths.<p>One that shows as &quot;Negative&quot; : Early terminated PEP RCT comparing HCQ and vitamin C with 781 patients (83% household contacts), reporting no significant differences.<p>`Therapy started one day after enrollment and study supplies were sent to the participant &quot;either by courier or mail&quot;. So the arrival time of the medication is not specified. In Boulware et al., the shipping delay was up to 3.5 days, if the delay is similar here the overall delays may be:\ntime since first exposure - unlimited\ntime to enrollment - up to 4 days\ntime to telehealth meeting - 1 day (3 days if Friday enrollment?)\ntime to receive medication - up to 3.5 days\nMost results including the primary 28-day PCR+ result has not bee reported yet. The study uses a low and slow dosage regimen, therapeutic levels may only be reached nearer to day 14, if at all, so day 28 results should be more informative when available (although labeled a PEP trial, with the low dosage and continuous exposure for most participants it is more of a PrEP&#x2F;PEP trial where benefit might be seen later as HCQ levels increase).\nEndpoints were:\nPrimary outcomes:\nPCR+ @28 days - NOT REPORTED YET\nPCR+ @14 days - aHR 0.99 [0.64-1.52]`<p>Right, so this RCT took up to 7 days for medication to arrive. Most people completely heal from Covid before 7 days is up.<p>This is why science is not some popularity contest where you can scan for counts and average the results together. It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s nuanced, it&#x27;s difficult to find the correct answers and there&#x27;s hundreds of confounding variables that are difficult to control for.')
