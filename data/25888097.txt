Thirty seconds will displace the air in a nearly empty wine bottle threefold. The tank will last years.<p>One stops worrying about bottle boundaries. One buys magnums. (&quot;A difficult size, too much for one but not enough for two.&quot;) There is a faint mellowing effect by the next day, but nothing like the effect of oxygen.<p>We sometimes deliberately skip argon. In Italy you know you&#x27;re tight when friends serve yesterday&#x27;s wine. Those wines need the abuse. Most wines don&#x27;t handle the abuse of an open day well.<p>Scale matters. There are $300 units made of cheap plastic aimed at wine &quot;connoisseurs&quot;. The cartridge is the same size I&#x27;d carry mountain biking, to fill one inner tube on an emergency basis. That&#x27;s supposed to last 50 bottles? How stupid does the manufacturer think I am?<p>Yes, argon is heavier than air, but there&#x27;s this thing called diffusion. There&#x27;s argon in the air around us; if argon cleanly separated from air and formed a bottom layer, we&#x27;d all suffocate when we lay on the floor. Obviously, we don&#x27;t. Put it together.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of Thomas Keller&#x27;s Bouchon Bakery cookbook taking heat for proposing 350 ml of water for bread steam, poured onto 30 lbs of thermal mass such as an aluminum disk in a cake pan. That also generates enough steam to displace the volume of an oven threefold. A commercial bread oven depends on serious steam for the first few minutes; this is a home approximation. People liked the idea of spritzing 10 ml of water from a plant spritzer, and were offended Keller did the science. They were just genuflecting.<p>One can wait months to obtain medical grade argon. It&#x27;s the same process, only tested to confirm the fact that the process doesn&#x27;t introduce toxins.<p>My wife is a practical engineer; she indulges every exploration like this. Some take. This one took. A standard after-dinner question is &quot;Did you argon the wine?&quot;')
