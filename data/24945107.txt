In general though, gRPC is not for browser-&gt;server calls (grpc-web notwithstanding) but is designed for server&lt;-&gt;server communication.<p>There is some tooling out there for development (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fullstorydev&#x2F;grpcurl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fullstorydev&#x2F;grpcurl</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fullstorydev&#x2F;grpcui" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fullstorydev&#x2F;grpcui</a> are pretty nice) but it&#x27;s still much less mature than the massive amount of mature tooling available for HTTP-based services. And that is both an artifact of gRPCs relative youth compared to REST and also for some more fundamental reasons (binary wire format, mutual TLS based authentication, etc).<p>All that said, I&#x27;ve been working with gRPC over the past 6 months or so and overall the development experience is much nicer on net I think.')
