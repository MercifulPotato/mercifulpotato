It hasn&#x27;t been on Fox. It hasn&#x27;t been on OAN. It hasn&#x27;t been on Newsmax. What&#x27;s been presented has been uniformly debunked in ways that I find completely convincing. If this is as big as it&#x27;s claimed to be, you don&#x27;t shut up just because a judge says you don&#x27;t have standing.<p>I haven&#x27;t found a statistical summary, but I&#x27;ve just surveyed the status of all the cases on several neutral sites (ABA, Ballotpedia and others). I don&#x27;t see how it is possible to draw any conclusion other than a deeply incompetent legal team with no convincing evidence failed to get a single in-place ruling that supports their wild claims.')
