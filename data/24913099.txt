If you could do anything to every generator, what is the worst thing you could do? If you use this technique you could probably blow out some percentage of generators. Would that take down the grid? For how long? How hard would it be to recover? We already know power grids can be taken down by cyberattacks, just look at the cyberattack Russia did against Ukraine&#x27;s power grid [1]. The main difference is that they were probably not trying to permanently take down their grid. If you could do something that would destroy enough capacity to keep the grid down for months the casualties would be immense. There would be immediate consequences like the loss of heating and cooling resulting in exposure deaths, but these pale in comparison to losses of fresh water, fuel production and thus food transport, fertilizer production and thus food production, manufacturing and thus goods, cargo port throughput and thus shipping. Modern society in the developed world utterly depends on our power grid.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;russia-ukraine-cyberattack-power-grid-blackout-destruction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;russia-ukraine-cyberattack-power...</a>')
