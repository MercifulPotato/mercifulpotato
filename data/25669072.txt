And rather inconsequential taken in isolation.<p>What technical and legislative means might be effective in limiting the network effect around group chats? For example requiring in law that groups be accessible to an open federated hub and spoke messaging protocol to allow messages to flow from syndicated groups established on other systems (like matrix or signal or whatever) to WhatsApp groups.<p>What technical and legal prior art is there here? I would be interested to hear some ideas.')
