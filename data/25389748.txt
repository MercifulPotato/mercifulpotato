This is already in for built-in arrays and traits but user traits currently require nightly.<p>I agree with you about the orphan rule being annoying and wish theyâ€™d relax that, but I <i>much</i> prefer traits to C++ duck-typed templates, if only because it makes error messages from passing an unsupported type to a generic function clear and concise as opposed to the thousands of lines of confusing output you often get in C++.')
