It was because the specialist said that since I could pay attention to the things I &quot;liked,&quot; a diagnosis was not appropriate for me. My life could have turned out a lot differently if I was medicated sooner.<p>I believe that people should no longer treat AD(H)D as an acronym. It isn&#x27;t accurate to call it a chronic &quot;deficit of attention&quot; and hyperactivity isn&#x27;t necessarily a symptom. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the name has to stay for the purpose of recognition in the face of the new evidence we&#x27;ve gathered in the past few decades.')
