As a result a big company can&#x27;t hire only the best of the best, as there are simply to few available! (Smaller companies can be much more picky in this regard as they don&#x27;t have to fill as much positions). As a result you will have in a large workforce a large amount of at best average employees, meaning &quot;the majority are drones&#x2F;codemonkeys&quot;.<p>Additional there is cost. You can usually choose to hire one top dude, or respectively a small team of codemonkeysâ€¦ For a lot of (most?) tasks a team of drones will do just fine when given the right instructions. So having only a few top people (giving instructions to the less experienced &#x2F; talented) will work out mostly just fine.<p>G is especially know for building their process around that reality. They put some effort into handling the fact that most of their hires will be young inexperienced people. They even created a dedicated programming language in which their large amounts greenhorn hires could be potentially productive. That this language is &quot;dubbed down to the max&quot; is a hard business requirement for exactly that reason.<p>I think dealing with the fact that the majority of people in software are (and will indefinitely stay) just codemonkeys is actually a huge part of a software business&#x27; success story as it develops into a larger enterprise. An important factor to successfully grow is the ability to make good use of the &quot;average majority&quot; your workforce consists of I think.')
