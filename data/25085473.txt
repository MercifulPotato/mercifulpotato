If you only look at requests for user information, the numbers are 10,197 for Apple and 26,186 for Google.<p>Interestingly, the rate at which both end up turning over data is nearly identical (85% for Apple and 83% for Google).<p>---<p>EDIT: nostromo points out that Apple does report the preservation request numbers in a separate section on the detail page. So inclusive of preservation requests, the comparison would be 12,719 for Apple and 38,042 for Google. However, I think Apple is right in not including these in the main number since preservation requests are asking the companies to preserve data that they might otherwise delete in anticipation of a future data request -- which would be counted.')
