Have you ever found any vulns in bank API gateways? We tested authorization boundaries with our own accounts, we didn&#x27;t ever find a bug like that. I found a total of two bugs quite low impact. One was unsafe object deserialization that could potentially lead to RCE, we obviously didn&#x27;t try this. The payload was signed so it most likely would have been difficult to exploit provided the signature was verified before deserializing the object. The other one was an authentication bypass, which potentially could have given you read only access to the user&#x27;s accounts. You could then call up customer services and use recent transactions on the account as a knowledge based 2nd factor to be given a code to upgrade the read-only enrollment to write access. This would require some knowledge about the customer (account number, telephone number, etc) and sloppy CS, so would probably say that was also low risk. We reported both to the respective bank via internal contacts.<p>&gt; When you talk about &quot;breaking&quot; banks in the US space…<p>Everything this thread refers to countermeasures banks employ to keep third parties from leveraging their private mobile API gateways. When I talk about breaking things I&#x27;m talking about breaking these countermeasures.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m aware of your thoughts on this, though I respectfully disagree with the &quot;modern&quot; characterisation…<p>The content encoding of the underlying persistence layer is a tiny part. Their technology is broadly speaking very good. I am probably the world expert on the state of these systems because I have very deep knowledge of a large number of them, whereas even bank employees would only about their employer&#x27;s systems.<p>&gt; Monzo have at least never wasted time on obfuscating the fuck out of their API comms…<p>Monzo did other stuff to effect the same result, i.e. they only allow one device to be logged in at a time. So you couldn&#x27;t use Monzo&#x27;s app AND access your account via Teller at the same time.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t use Monzo as an exemplar of technological capability. Barclays absolutely smokes them.')
