Mostly unrelated hits on 6mwe crystal structure, and a small number of news articles explaining this term&#x27;s meaning because of that guy in his shirt. Even if I search 4chan &#x2F;pol&#x2F; archives, the hive of scum and villainy, there are fewer than three pages of hits and the earliest reference to 6mwe is 17 Dec 2020,<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.4plebs.org&#x2F;pol&#x2F;search&#x2F;text&#x2F;6mwe&#x2F;page&#x2F;3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.4plebs.org&#x2F;pol&#x2F;search&#x2F;text&#x2F;6mwe&#x2F;page&#x2F;3&#x2F;</a><p>It seems unlikely that anyone standing with that guy would have known what his shirt meant or would share that view. It seems far more likely that this guy is a plant, who is there for the specific purpose of generating those news articles about &quot;evil&quot; Trump supporters.<p>If you have a better source regarding origin and proof of widespread knowledge of that term, feel free to leave that in the comments. Otherwise, let&#x27;s consider this one debunked.')
