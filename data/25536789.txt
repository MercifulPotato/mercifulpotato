So here is my small contribution to the discussion:<p>2013: &quot;Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert&quot; begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And terrifyingly, it&#x27;s happening to about two-thirds of the world&#x27;s grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI</a><p>2014: Global Greening Is Firm, Drivers Are Mixed - Harvard &quot;Evidence for global greening is converging, asserting an increase in CO2 uptake and biomass of the terrestrial biosphere.
