I have numerous long-term friends who have become school teachers, many of then had to move quite a distance just to find schools with openings.  Most states have teacher certification reciprocity with Pennsylvania, which gave them a leg up in this regard.  Even so, searching for open positions was clearly stressful for them.  But for them it was worth it; the work is rewarding and socially important.  They like working with kids, and they like getting several months of vacation every year.  There is no other job quite like it.')
