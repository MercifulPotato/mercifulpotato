I&#x27;ve never used ActiveRecord, so I can&#x27;t speak to it directly, but in my experience when dealing with large numbers of records in an ORM (and author easily is working with hundreds of thousands), things grind to a halt, even with eager loading.  There&#x27;s a lot more overhead to create thousands of ORM objects than it is to serialize an equivalent chunk of BSON.')
