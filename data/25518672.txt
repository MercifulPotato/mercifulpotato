Item(by='vlang1dot0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608737945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25518496, text='I have tried this before and generally the response to my issues has been &quot;this will be fixed&quot; with no further explanation that would allow having a discussion and thinking through the soundness of the idea of even letting someone other than the author take a stab at implementing it.<p>Even for critical things like the memory management strategy, no one other than Alex has any idea how it is supposed to work (beyond some references to Lobster). Even when it&#x27;s pointed out that Lobster makes some concessions that V does not so that the memory management system can work, there is still no discussion.<p>The V community and team seem far more interested in generating hype and publicity than actually doing the hard parts of language design.<p>I don&#x27;t actually think the community is trying to be malicious. If you hang out in their discord, they&#x27;re generally quite friendly. What they lack is focus.<p>The language and canonical backends aren&#x27;t anywhere close to complete and there&#x27;s already attention bring split to build an x86_64 backend and a wasm backend. Neither of these are anything more than toys even in comparison to the C one. At the same time, std is lacking critical things like a map type that doesn&#x27;t require your keys to be strings. And yet they&#x27;re working on a discord client and a websocket implementation. V-os and v-browser are seriously discussed with promises like &quot;we&#x27;ll start on that after 0.3&quot;.<p>V is sort of the ultimate yack shave. The author wanted to make a thin discord client but first they needed a new text editor so then they needed a language to write it in. It&#x27;s really only a matter of time before the next project comes up and the author leaves V in the same state as his other projects.')
