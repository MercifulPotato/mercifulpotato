People obviously trust google, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be switching their emails to google, doing all their private searching on google.<p>They willing give google EVERY bit of personal info about their lives (between emails, search history and phone &#x2F; android).<p>When firefox defaulted to yahoo, most folks (70%+?) switched to google - on an OPEN SOURCE &#x2F; freedom focused platform like firefox!
