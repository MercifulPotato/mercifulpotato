I&#x27;ve downloaded&#x2F;purchased about a dozen of HTML&#x2F;CMS&#x2F;static site themes for my own projects over the years, and modifying them to get rid of Google&#x27;s Fonts is the very first thing I have to do. With various JS&#x2F;CSS libraries, there&#x27;s a chance that they&#x27;ll be self-hosted. For fonts, they&#x27;re always loaded from Google Fonts.<p>I then have to occasionally re-do that work when there&#x27;s a significant update to the theme that I want to have. It&#x27;s really annoying.')
