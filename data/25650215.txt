I&#x27;ve been a customer since it went live and their business model is very straightforward. You pay $99, you get email for a year. Their track record running Basecamp instills confidence in the longevity of the service and that they won&#x27;t sell out their customers.<p>I honestly think it&#x27;s a much better approach to email. One of the key issues with having an email address is that anyone who knows it is granted permission to get your attention, whereas with HEY you get rid of that problem for the most part but without having to &#x27;program&#x27; your inbox.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hey.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hey.com</a>')
