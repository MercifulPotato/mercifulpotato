The complaint accurately identified a song that was part of a massive torrent from which I had downloaded a single song. If memory serves, I downloaded &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; and was accused of downloading &quot;Hotel California&quot;.<p>I concluded that they were happy to make accusations without even having any evidence that I had done anything wrong. (Technically, I had... but they didn&#x27;t appear to have a clue what it was.)')
