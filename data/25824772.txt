I&#x27;ve been using a custom domain for years, so it was just a matter of changing MX records to Fastmail. My wife only used her @gmail address, so it was a bit more involved. Essentially:<p>- Set up new email at your service of choice<p>- Import whatever old email from gmail that you want to keep<p>- Go through whatever list you have (password manager, your brain, etc) and update email addresses (as a bonus rotate passwords while you&#x27;re at it)<p>- For a few weeks, regularly look at both your new and old email. As something comes into gmail, either unsubscribe or update your email for that sender, and delete it.<p>- A few weeks later, nothing remains to switch over (at least nothing of importance).')
