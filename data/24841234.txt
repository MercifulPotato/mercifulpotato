IPv4 is not going away anytime soon. We’ll be dependent on IPv4 for a long time.<p>IPv4 scarcity only hits in certain segments. It doesn’t hit the major players.<p>The real problem is the hoarding by the major players. AWS will most likely never use that many IP addresses. I know that sounds like a stretch based on what we’re led to believe about running out of IPv4 addresses. I don’t know their IPv4 utilization, so it’s a guess. My guess is based on how we deploy internet facing services these days. It’s less dependent on needing lots of public IPs.')
