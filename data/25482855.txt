Because you will die without food, and shelter, and the other things which you can&#x27;t magically summon from nothingness: in the current society, you <i>need</i> to work to get them, or had to work in the past to amass appropriate wealth, or someone else has to do this for you. Few are lucky to be gifted it from their birth. As are those who can get those necessities incidentally from play, without deliberate planning in fear of not succeeding.<p>That&#x27;s basically what this philosophical essay has to tell about the (non) “choice” that you are given: you work, or else you suffer. You do have this choice though, for sure. The play is when you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to choose.')
