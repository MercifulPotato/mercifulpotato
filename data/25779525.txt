The common farmer might want to come back to the land - but his younger brother needs to leave the farm because it can&#x27;t support him! Thus those younger brothers have nothing to gain by coming back to the farm.  Their gains can only be found in being really great at something the city needs (cities are less than 5% of the population because farms don&#x27;t have enough surplus to support more than that, so this is worse than farming), or winning a war and making a farm on the enemies land.  If the war is fought to a stalemate, but only one of the two brothers returns back to the farm that is okay too.<p>The sexist language is historically correct. Sorry ladies, history wasn&#x27;t kind to you in general.')
