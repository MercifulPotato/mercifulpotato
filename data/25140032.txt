If I&#x27;ve got any files worth keeping I put them on GitHub.<p>Don&#x27;t have to worry about filling my own machine with rubbish, I can load the VM without it impacting my own machine, and I can generally be fearless (and incautious) in the knowledge the machine is of no real consequence. It&#x27;s also a good way to try out an unfamiliar distro, or an unfamiliar Unix.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also a gateway to developing working proficiency with linux<p>And also with cloud computing. It&#x27;s a good excuse to play about with EC2 firewalls, for instance.')
