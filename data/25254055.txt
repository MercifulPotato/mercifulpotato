But throwing away good appliances is just unthinkable for me. I use them all until they fail, fix them and use them some more, until they&#x27;re unfixable :D<p>Worst case, I&#x27;d try to sell them for cheap or give them to someone who needs them, there&#x27;s plenty of people in every country.<p>The efficiency of washers and dishwashers has been the same for about two decades now. There&#x27;s simply nothing that can be improved inside.<p>Dryers have had a decent improvement with heat pumps, other than that, it&#x27;s the same design that&#x27;s been around for decades.')
