Its just that the policy people <i>responsible</i> for monetary policy tend to have something of a coherent vision and are located in a single decision making body, while fiscal policy requires either supermajority support in both the House and Senate or concurrence of all of the House, Senate, and Presidency. And the visions of the &quot;correct&quot; fiscal policy between the two major parties have almost no overlap anymore. There&#x27;s a whole lot more focus by policy people collectively on fiscal policy than monetary policy, just not nearly as much <i>effective action</i> because of the structural impediments.')
