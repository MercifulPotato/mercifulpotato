You sold something for $15, which is more than $0 and a proof in a way that you can produce something of value to someone and sell it. Can you sell that again?<p>How irritating is that problem for those who have it? How expensive is it, as in, how much time and money are those who have this problem losing? How much would they stand to make in time and money? How frequently do they have that problem: is it only once in a while, regularly, or multiple times per day? Is it time of a highly skilled &#x2F; expensive role or profile? Meaning: is it time of someone paid $$$&#x2F;hour or $&#x2F;hour?<p>&gt;<i>I don&#x27;t know how to ask for gobs of money.</i><p>You have conversations in which you ask for gobs of money and keep your lips closed.<p>&gt;<i>I also setup someone&#x27;s server (minecraft , gitea, docker compose, etc) for $30&#x2F;hr - because I didn&#x27;t think he could pay full rate ($66&#x2F;hr) I got a few hundred on that.</i><p>You can&#x27;t really know if you don&#x27;t ask. I remember when I was in college listing my rate for a service that was 15x what others were charging. I was called by art galleries, jewelry stores, and companies to solve that problem.<p>One person could buy your &quot;server setup&quot; service because they don&#x27;t know how to do it. Another person would buy it even though they know very well how to do it, but they wouldn&#x27;t be doing something that is more valuable than $66 [either an activity that generates more, or napping, or anything], or that they &quot;dislike setting servers up more than they like having $66&quot;, or that&#x27;s just a distraction for them.')
