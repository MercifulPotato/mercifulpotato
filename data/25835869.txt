Nobody wants you committing felonies, but, if you do commit a felony, you&#x27;re incentivized to avoid causing potentially deadly situations. (<i>setting aside the actual efficacy of such incentives, that&#x27;s just how the law currently is</i>)<p>To put it another way, you probably won&#x27;t be charged <i>just</i> for selling drugs over a radio frequency. You&#x27;ll be charged for the regular crime of selling drugs <i>and</i> an additional charge of using radio to commit that crime.')
