You can literally type in &quot;vc&quot; in your terminal (after installing their cli) and it&#x27;ll build and deploy everything you have locally in seconds (think React or Nextjs, a React framework).<p>You can also use their serverless functions; which add &quot;backend&quot; functionality to your existing frontends. You can deploy these serverless functions in a bunch of languages (see docs) but personally I&#x27;ve used them in Nextjs&#x27;s baked-in functionality of api routes to basically add an endpoint for mutating&#x2F;querying to&#x2F;from my DB for example.')
