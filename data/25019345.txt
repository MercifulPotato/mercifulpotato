A &quot;progressive bubble&quot; or other media-created marketing phrase is not a factor, it&#x27;s a pure transaction: Trump has to go. People rose to the occasion this time.<p>&gt; <i>You cannot imagine someone actually liking Biden without being soft in the head</i><p>This isn&#x27;t a fair interpretation of what they were saying, nor realistic. People are going to lament that a big part of Biden&#x27;s support was functional, in order to get Trump out, but people complain about unchangeable things all the time. It&#x27;s not significant.')
