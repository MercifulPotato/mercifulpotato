Domino’s is actually throwing quite a lot of money and effort at their tech strategy. This is reflected in their app, (amazing) website, and a (still nascent, but still improving) tech culture that didn’t exist before.<p>NOTE: I don’t work at Domino’s, and I haven’t used their services in over a year.<p>Understand that quick-serve restaurants are typically as conservative as retail when it comes to anything not core product because of their low margins.<p>I do agree that Domino’s has done quite a lot to cost-optimize their product, including significant investments in line automation and process improvements.<p>If you need proof, tell me another pizza quick-serve that has a Terraform provider for ordering pizza: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndmckinley&#x2F;terraform-provider-dominos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndmckinley&#x2F;terraform-provider-dominos</a><p>And they’re running AWS: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;dominos&#x2F;case-study&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;dominos&#x2F;case-s...</a><p>And from what I can tell Kubernetes based off of some headers from their store locator service.<p>Now, other, not-Dominos, companies are making some&#x2F;all of these moves. Using the tech is easy. It’s Domino’s commitment to reduce delivery times to 10 minutes from first order that makes them different. Management realized that they would need a massive investment in tech to make this happen. So they microserviced their API and worked on the delivery process. That is worth giving them some credit.')
