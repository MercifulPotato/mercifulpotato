Los Angeles ... would pay less than 2 cents per kilowatt-hour ... the lowest price ever paid for solar power in the United States, and cheaper than the cost of electricity from a typical natural gas-fired power plant&quot;[1]. This includes the cost of production and storage.<p>But what about other parts of the country with less sun? &quot;solar and wind energy will dominate Americaâ€™s new generation in 2020, making up 76% of new generation ..., while coal and natural gas will dominate 2020 retirements with 85% of plant closures.&quot;[2]. And this was 2020 while Trump was helping the fossil fuel industry.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;start=1h44m03s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wW1lY5jFNcQ&amp;start=1h44m03s</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;story&#x2F;2019-08-27&#x2F;los-angeles-solar-energy-storage-cheap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;story&#x2F;2019-08-27&#x2F;los-ang...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;energyinnovation&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind&#x2F;?sh=564609e52c84" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;energyinnovation&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;21&#x2F;ren...</a>')
