Use a long random password for the account and don&#x27;t 2FA it. Share that with your family. That&#x27;s probably all they need to gain access and reset your other accounts.<p>If you 2FA the email account, you risk locking you and them out permanently for many services. I&#x27;ve written some about this. If you care to read it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.go350.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;now-they-have-2fa-problems&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.go350.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;now-they-have-2fa-problems&#x2F;</a><p>Also, if you 2FA other things and aren&#x27;t really careful, you may lock them out even if they know the password and&#x2F;or are able to reset it. That is by design.<p>This problem is growing larger every year as more sites enable or mandate 2FA. It&#x27;s impossible for humans to manage this at scale.')
