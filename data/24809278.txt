Started with games like Ultima online and Meridian 59 in the mid 90&#x27;s.<p>We were getting mods, level editing tools and dedicated servers until the public started buying into the mmo scam of the mid 90&#x27;s.  AKA they were just regular RPG&#x27;s rebranded mmo and had their networking code stolen.   Games like quake had their networking code integrated into the game.  Everyone was expecting RPG&#x27;s to go the quake route and one did make it out before all rpg&#x27;s were rebranded mmo to dispossess the computer illiterate PC gaming masses ... (neverwinterNights 2002) on gog.<p>They killed dedicated servers and modding after they figured out the public had no idea how computers worked.   Ultima online, Guild wars 1, Everquest, etc.... any client-server piece of software means you&#x27;re being sold an incomplete piece of software.<p>AKA it&#x27;s just a game with the files and networking code held hostage on remote pc&#x27;s.  The public was too braindead to get the message and the whole tech community went wild to dispossess the masses and back-end all future software to remove control of software from the end user.<p>After the coup Richard garriot pulled with ultima online,  Microsoft, Adobe, and everyone in the industry was going to try and force all software client-server and steal software on mass.<p>Why the hell would anyone buy an incomplete piece of software that required a remote computer in order to function unless they were braindead?  Software as a service is the same as simply stealing the program files and adding some malware back end to remove ownership of the software.<p>Microsoft saw what Valve got away with, with steam, and uplay, EA, ubisoft and now rockstar got away with social club and now Windows 10 has forced updates and client-server aspects where it requires a remote computer.<p>The whole thing is fraud on a massive scale and the fact that even many people on hacker news have been eating up means many of you have been oblivious to the obvious fact we&#x27;re being robbed.<p>For those of us who were aware of the great incomplete software as a service scam by forcing us into the mainframe, dumb client terminal model.<p>You can call the FTC.gov and blow the whistle on the last 25 years of game theft, and the fact that Microsoft is now trying to steal aspects of windows files and hold them hostage on a remote pc.')
