I don&#x27;t think he (or any President) is very relevant at a local level, at least not on a short time-frame. The influx of people probably has something to do with it, although in Utah (where I live) there is not much anti-housing response. There is lots of construction going on both in Salt Lake City and in the surrounding areas, and lots of political support for it.<p>The real problems I see are more cultural ones. Homelessness is rising (as it is throughout the US). Utah had handled homelessness much better than other places due to a unique balance between the local government, the police, and the LDS church (I&#x27;m not a member FYI), but changes in the mayor and chief of police disrupted that balance.<p>I also perceive an arrogance on the part of some of those moving here. The idea that they can just start changing things without understanding how&#x2F;why things were the way they were before. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m against change--it&#x27;s impossible to stop it in any case--but I also don&#x27;t think coastal values are right for every area.')
