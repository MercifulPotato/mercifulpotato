I tended to work a full day for one company then a full day for the other to lessen the context switching. It was hard work, but it was fun and very beneficial to both organizations. You really do focus on editing (what projects matter, what solutions matter, which candidates do we offer, coaching w 1x1s) which has much more of an impact than IC work. In fact, the only issues I ever had were classic time x resource tradeoffs, since I so little time for IC work.')
