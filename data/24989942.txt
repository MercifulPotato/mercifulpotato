I should have said that with respect to which language pick up next and which language has a bigger future potential. Rust is so omnivore and hits on so many critical aspects that it is hard to deny it. Given it had rich and mature ecosystem now how many would pick Scala? Those who prefer GC pauses and have a hard dependency on JVM? But even then you are pitted against Kotlin and Java itself. I would say quite tough times are awaiting Scala 3 and not only on individual level but on company level. It is still unclear how much the migration will take and whether it is worth it in the first place.')
