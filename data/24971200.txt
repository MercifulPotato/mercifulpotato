If it isn&#x27;t modelled yet we can make something up to model it. Math is just axioms and theorems so yeah, you&#x27;re not wrong.<p>I&#x27;m speaking in less technical terms. For example in general mathematical equations or axioms represent immutable concepts. In programming, variables mutate and change... very different from what math traditionally represents. Haskell is an attempt to segregate the immutability (the math part) away from the less &quot;mathy&quot; part (the mutations&#x2F;IO).<p>Maybe math is too broad of a term. I probably meant to say &quot;algebra&quot; can&#x27;t model all of programming, or whatever more suitable word that may or may not exist.')
