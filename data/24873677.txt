It&#x27;s got some weird UI choices (Apple conventions, I assume - I&#x27;m on Android), but I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it, and it&#x27;s more or less sold me on investigating how far an android user can invest in their cloud services ecosystem.<p>I avoid Spotify because I&#x27;m leery of their podcast play, especially given their employee&#x27;s protests over the Rogan contract. Just because Rogan&#x27;s too valuable an asset to compromise, doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t go after smaller podcasters.<p>Apple by contrast has been a fairly responsible steward of the podcasting ecosystem with its publicly available index, and hasn&#x27;t attempted to exert undue control over individual podcasts beyond delisting them from their search engine.')
