You go into it accepting &quot;sure, it&#x27;s super hard work, I know what that&#x27;s like, I can do it!&quot;. We thought of hard work by drawing from experience, thinking back to difficult degree programs, or working for a fledgling startup, etc. But in all of that experience, after crunch time, you always get to take an afternoon off once in a while, a couple hours here and there, even if it&#x27;s just an evening of doing nothing every few weeks.<p>Nobody had &quot;Well, what if there&#x27;s a pandemic and you just <i>can&#x27;t</i> drop off your toddlers at a sitter&#x2F;parent to get a few hours break?
