A lot of overtime payments, sure. But he never had any free time, and was &quot;on call&quot; all hours of the day.<p>We would be drinking a couple of beers, and halfway through his first one, his phone rings; duty calls, gotta go.<p>Thankfully, he quit back in May. Now he drives trucks for a furniture company.')
