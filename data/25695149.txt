I&#x27;ve heard people say that all summer long about those afraid of the &quot;peaceful protests&quot; turned violent riots that burned down cities and devastated business. This violence was encouraged by all types of politicians on the left and all the big media networks as well:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1eQzLcO5qhY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1eQzLcO5qhY</a><p>A small number of people at an almost entirely non-violent rally, a rally where the president encouraged people to &quot;walk down to the capitol house&quot; .. walk, not riot or loot or burn, a small number of people did something horrifically stupid. Most just walked around, a smaller percentage destroyed stuff. Everyone one of them should be charged if they did.<p>But you know what I also saw? &quot;Pearl Clutching.&quot; Every senator and congressman afraid out of their mind because the villages had come into the castle. The peasants were in the kings court, and the village idiot with a racoon on his head was sitting at the seat of The King&#x27;s Hand playing with her royal gavel.<p>You cannot possibly talk about the violence on the 6th, without addressing the fact that the media went on and on and on about praising all the violent &quot;peaceful protestors&quot; all summer long.<p>It did not matter at all when it was the business owners, the minimum wages workers who lost the jobs at stores now condemned, or those losing everything in lockdowns while Pelosi showed America her ice cream collection in her $14k kitchen setup.<p>But now that they were causing some minor damage, 1&#x2F;1000 of the damage the democratic left supporters did on inauguration day 2014:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BXR3d22BhHs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BXR3d22BhHs</a><p>It&#x27;s suddenly the worst thing on the planet! Unprecedented even!<p>America has a long history of its citizens taking federal buildings. The Black Panthers, with an armed militia, took the California Capitol in the 1970s and no one died.')
