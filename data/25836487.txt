I don&#x27;t like cities, but most tech jobs are in cities. I get to live in a nice quiet suburb now. I loathe commuting in any form, and now I don&#x27;t have to do that. There used to be work-from-home jobs, but they were the exception, and it was hard to be treated as a normal, engaged team member. Now nearly everyone in tech works from home, and even after the pandemic, it&#x27;s going to be more widely accepted. It&#x27;s tragic that is took a pandemic to get to this point, but it&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to my career.<p>I&#x27;m burned out from the lack of social contact, though. I don&#x27;t mean coworkers; I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to interact with coworkers beyond Zoom. I mean the lack of family-and-friends get-togethers; the inability to pop down to the pub for a quick beer with friends; the lack of new friendships made because of the distancing; having to treat everyone and everything as though they&#x27;re radioactive; the constant doomscrolling. Everything non-work-related is stressful and hollow.<p>Work from home would have made my life better under other circumstances. I&#x27;d have gained all the commute time back; I&#x27;d be living near family, friends, and activities that I enjoy; I&#x27;d be far from cities that I dislike. I have some of those things, but in this perverse alternate reality, I feel like I&#x27;m being teased and can&#x27;t have it.<p>One of the biggest downsides to the past year is the lack of vacations. I took a week off for a break, but spent it at home doing nothing. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m getting on a plane before I&#x27;m vaccinated, nor going to a restaurant or bar, and I&#x27;m not keen on staying in a hotel.')
