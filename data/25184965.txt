Definitely the way to go, if you want to get the most functionality from limited hardware, without going all the way to assembly.<p>I highlight that. In fact, Rust is another kid on the block that is very promising for embedding.<p>In the other hand, sorry but I simply don&#x27;t get why JS for interactions on such highly constrained devices. Probably as you said, it&#x27;s intended to do very simple things with less effort as possible.')
