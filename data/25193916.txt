In my city many development projects went ahead because of various promises (low income housing, cultural venues, etc) and the developer didn&#x27;t follow through in any meaningful way - i.e. a theater was built, no shows ever took place there. Or low income housing was transitioned to market rate housing within 5 years.<p>But at least these things happened in public, through a semi-transparent process of development permits with public consultations. The process is semi-fixed, the incentives are off, but it&#x27;s not a straight up bribe behind closed doors.')
