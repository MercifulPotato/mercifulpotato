I swear I’ve read this article at least twice already over the last few months.<p>As the article’s interviewees quip, the way this is being handled is for the most part an abysmal failure due to a lack of leadership.<p>You might wonder what leadership means in this case. It doesn’t mean lockdown or making sure there’s adequate masks or scolding people who don’t stay at home. It means not jet-setting across the country non stop to hang out with your in crowd while you’re telling the populace to stay at home, which is exactly what politicians are doing.<p>Hypocrisy from the top that is visible to everyone is one of the worst things to come out of this.
