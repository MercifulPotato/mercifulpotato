Many HN users probably do run their own servers, even discussion servers.<p>The real problem is how to attract the right people. YC is a fascinating case, actually. WHY are we here, and not on some reddit forum?<p>Even though it seems PG is not very active here anymore, it seems the seeding community has stuck to some extent.<p>Of course they also have their theory of how to maintain a community and did some coding and moderating to try to maintain it.<p>To my personal taste, they have overdone it, and ruined it in a way, but I haven&#x27;t found a good alternative yet.<p>The next iteration of online news and communities will perhaps take more than dedicated servers, it may require a usability leap. Maybe some convenient way to filter messages, that is not centralized (Twitter&#x2F;Facebook algorithms don&#x27;t optimize to my benefit, but to the benefit of their owners).')
