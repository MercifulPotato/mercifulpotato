I do not understand the math, but is this similar on how integrals always have a constant as a free parameter that need to be determined by other means?<p>I assume that Einstein originally set the constant to exactly balance the expansion, but later set it to zero. In bot cases you are picking arbitrar values but the actual value need to determined by empirical observeations.')
