Italy has abysmal IT wages, a 30.000 euros wage in Italy is probably for roles that would get an 80.000$ salary in the US. That&#x27;s not even 3x but then:<p>* there&#x27;s 7% extra that is paid as a lump sum when you change employers, and 33% paid into a retirement account (vs. perhaps 20% for a 401k; employer&#x2F;employee proportion of 25-75 vs. 50-50 for 401k matching)<p>* you don&#x27;t enter work with any debt, because university is paid by the state if you&#x27;re poor. I have seen directors from America (easily $200k salary) saying they can&#x27;t afford a vacation in Europe because they have two sons&#x2F;daughters in grad school.<p>* you don&#x27;t have to pay for healthcare (and taxes are comparable for lower income tax brackets). If you have a child, pregnancy+delivery costs â‚¬0.00.<p>* nowhere in Italy are you going to have a real estate market as crazy as Silicon Valley<p>* childcare will cost 150-500 euros a month depending on age vs 1000-3000$ in the US<p>Putting everything together, <i>maybe</i> you&#x27;re paid twice as much. Go to Germany or Finland and there&#x27;s even less difference.')
