Oh, and the roads: Some places, I couldn&#x27;t take a direct route because bikes weren&#x27;t allowed on those roads (I lived a couple miles outside of town). The country roads that were available to me took longer. Not to mention that I had to share the road with cars (laws) and the cars didn&#x27;t have my safety in mind.<p>And then you get into hygiene and weather. Few places had somewhere I could dry off in the rain: I didn&#x27;t know studded bike tires (for snow) existed until I moved to Norway. Few places really and truly accepted a sweaty employee showing up for work either - and again, no place to freshen up.<p>Sometimes I would be lucky to have room to store snow&#x2F;rain shoes.')
