I had previously worked on Docker so I had a bunch of accumulated knowledge about what makes a good CLI, but I wanted to make Replicate <i>really</i> good, so I looked for some design guides or best practices. Turns out, nothing substantial had been published since the 1980s.<p>On this search I found a superb blog post by Carl about CLI naming [1]. He must be the only person in the world who cares about CLI design and is actually a good writer, so we teamed up. We also were joined by Aanand, who did loads of work on the Docker CLIs; Eva, who is a technical writer, to turn our scrappy ideas into a real piece of writing; and Mark, who typeset it and made a super design.<p>We love the CLI, but so much of it is a mess and hard to use. This is our attempt to make the CLI a better place. If you’re making a tool, we hope this is useful for you, and would love to hear your feedback.<p>Some of it is a bit opinionated, so feel free to challenge our ideas here or on GitHub! [2] We’ve also got a Discord server if you want to talk CLI design.
