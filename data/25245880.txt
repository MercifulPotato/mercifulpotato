After they came out of the literally largest incarceration system of the planet. Locking people up under circumstances that in most of the developed &quot;Western world&quot; are bluntly considered torture [1].<p>But torture is apparently a-okay as long as it&#x27;s described in euphemisms like &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;, just like assassinating US citizens is a-okay [2] as long as it allegedly keeps the &quot;homeland safe&quot;.<p>Just like involuntary servitude, aka slavery, is still very much a thing in the US, it the race based variant of that may have been abolished as an &quot;institution&quot; but the practice still very much exists as punishment for crime.<p>That&#x27;s just domestic, that whole can of worms only gets nastier foreign policy wise with wars of aggression and the casual and regular disregard for other countries sovereignty.<p>As such, these are not events from some far-flung past we judge with completely different standards, these are very current and still on-going events being judged with the current standards.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;perspectives-on-politics&#x2F;article&#x2F;testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens&#x2F;62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;perspectives-on-poli...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-rights-un-usa-torture-idUSKCN0WA2B8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-rights-un-usa-torture-idU...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;obama-killed-a-16-year-o...</a>')
