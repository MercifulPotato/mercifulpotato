Yes, of course, when the project has the attention and the funding and the time and the political support it needs it will work! I know that and you know that. But if you&#x27;re waiting for, say, a high-speed rail in California, or the 2nd avenue subway in New York, or in New Orleans[1] you might be forgiven for being skeptical.<p>I was struck by the same line, but for the opposite reason. I think it&#x27;s rare, today, for large scale projects to work out exactly as expected. These projects, even when executed well, require enormous amounts of money and time and skill to pull off. Many things can sabotage them. I don&#x27;t blame people for being surprised they worked.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;after-a-14-billion-upgrade-new-orleans-levees-are-sinking&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;after-a-14-billio...</a>')
