This &quot;open letter&quot; comes across as DDG uncovering some Google conspiracy or exposing a dark pattern, but I don&#x27;t think this is the case.<p>DDG is a private company seeking profits, just like Google. I&#x27;m a happy customer of DDG but empty marketing like this isn&#x27;t going to move anyone. It feels like one company complaining about it&#x27;s competitor. You don&#x27;t see ProtonMail complaining that Gmail comes pre-installed on the OS.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of other reasons to criticize Google, changing default settings doesn&#x27;t seem to be a hill to die on.')
