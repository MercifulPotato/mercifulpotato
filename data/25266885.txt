It has to get down from the ivory tower somehow, and storytelling is a great medium. Most Quanta articles are not &quot;void of any science;&quot; rather, I find them to be great lay explanations of high-level concepts that most scientists (including myself) would struggle to articulate to non-academic family and friends. If you want &quot;just the science, ma&#x27;am,&quot; you can go read the papers themselves.<p>Also, not to nitpick, but I thought the crypto article was well-written and covered the subject properly. It seems you are the one misunderstanding the science if you believe that iO is just a form of FHE, which makes me doubt your whole enterprise of discrediting Quanta&#x27;s work ;) Speaking as a (former) cryptographer here.')
