Folks should eat fresh local meats and produce and make their own preserves. Less reliance on mass-produced products and support local farmers&#x2F;producers. Back before the garbagization-of-food you&#x27;d go to the butcher and get high quality meats. You&#x27;d go to the market to get produce. And, you&#x27;d make your own preserves for the winter WITHOUT PLASTIC. Simple, and in fact they taste much better if seasoned well!')
