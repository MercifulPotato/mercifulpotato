This is a minimum usable product that does things that don&#x27;t scale. If you email me, you&#x27;ll get a Ghost install you can log in to and an invoice on Stripe. I&#x27;ll walk you through everything, Collison brothers style, and give you ideas on how to set it up for your team and do low-key editing for you, early-airbnb style.<p>If there are over a 100 people who want this, I&#x27;ll build out a self service dashboard that automates everything, and get a designer. But I do think it would be idiotic to start this project by hiring a designer and writing thousands of lines of dashboard and automation &#x2F; system state management code. Doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t do it (have done it professionally enough times).<p>Regarding it not solving a problem the market has, that may be the case, in which case I&#x27;m down a landing page, will think up a new idea next month. But the world is a big place, and the market is bigger than we all think.
