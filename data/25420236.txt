Sure. You can reduce almost any exploit to &quot;compromise system or org, leverage compromise to go after another system or org&quot; and any stealth measures reduce to something like &quot;hide your own efforts among legitimate signals, and use cutouts to make them harder to trace back&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you think counts as &quot;sophistication&quot;, but thinking up the specifics of multiple stages, and executing each stage without errors that would expose the other stages to detection isn&#x27;t easy, and takes time and patience by many people with diverse skills  working in concert.<p>Sure, each <i>specific</i> link in the chain may not look difficult, but those were just the solutions that worked in isolation when tried in whatever testing environment(s) the threat-actor operates (not to mention funding the &quot;blue team&quot; that operates it, because you don&#x27;t want your unsuccessful attempts to tip your hand), and then deployed in sequence.<p>Or were you under the impression that this whole effort was created de-novo and worked (correctly, might I add) without being detected the very first time each component was tried?')
