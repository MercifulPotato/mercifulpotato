It doesn&#x27;t matter that he lies about election results - he was not colluding with Russians.<p>This is quite literally the opposite of the stated conclusion of the Muller investigation. It&#x27;s not clear to me how you get &quot;absolved him from any Russia shenanigans&quot;. There were clear links between the campaign and Russia (up to and including Trump Jr. meeting with a Russian Lawyer for &quot;dirt&quot; on the Clinton campaign), likely in return for changes to the Magnitsky act. That&#x27;s all plainly stated in the muller report.<p>He ultimately didn&#x27;t charge them because while there may have been intent to collude, it didn&#x27;t pan out.')
