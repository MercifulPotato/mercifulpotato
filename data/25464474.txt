OAuth2Proxy, which is a popular way to protect generic HTTP resources, is one convenient way to demonstrate that functionality, but you could leverage that same functionality in a completely different way native to your application if you don&#x27;t want to have to build that same workflow for your app.<p>For the borderless network use case, an access request workflow really changes how you use protected resources because getting access to something becomes simple and routine. In a VPN setup, you&#x27;re unlikely to share with users outside of your organization because of the overhead from provisioning and setup. Consider how you can easily share a Google doc with an outside contractor, but it&#x27;s not worth the effort to give them access to a JIRA ticket.')
