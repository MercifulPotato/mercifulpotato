Just because it turns out that old 90s arguments about DOOM turning us all into violent murderers was wrong doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t effects that might be harmful.<p>I think we should have learned our lesson and first gather some data before we ban war games, RPGs or Sims because some person has an hypothesis that maybe somewhere, someone would    be &quot;transformed&quot; by the media into a criminal. I really don&#x27;w want some government or american christian dominated companies to start banning stuff.')
