Our general strategy is to stay in Airbnbs for at least one month at a time, triggering a discounted rate. All fees included, the monthly rate for the 2br&#x2F;3br places we&#x27;re renting is roughly the same as the monthly rate for a 1 year lease of a 1br or small 2br in a San Francisco. I&#x27;ve found people to be really friendly, including after they find out what we&#x27;re doing. We don&#x27;t lead an extravagant lifestyle, drive a fancy car, or generally rub people&#x27;s faces in our nomadism.<p>I personally enjoy the forced minimalism of having to fit my whole life in a car, but I could see that being tough with a family.<p>I miss seeing my friends in person, but I wasn&#x27;t able to that very much before leaving, anyway. And several of them are out doing the same thing, so there are opportunities to meet up.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s not that different from living in a city long term, so the same things are important: choose your housemates wisely, optimize for the common usage (work, sleep, exercise), and don&#x27;t pay too much attention to what the internet thinks.')
