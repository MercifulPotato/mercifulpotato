The one thing that is severely lacking is the experience when analyzing a capture. You can only follow one tcp&#x2F;udp stream at a time which means most of the time spent is just going from one stream to another and no ability to clearly co-relate from multiple streams. Just having multiple tabs for various streams would make it so much better.<p>Is there any other tool which supports this?')
