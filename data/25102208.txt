Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25104038], score=None, time=1605456672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25101841, text='It&#x27;s so interesting...there is this well known phenomenon where ~everyone has <i>at least some</i> bias the vast majority of the time, and in a forum thread where this phenomenon is the specific topic of discussion (say, a psychology paper discussing subconscious bias, and the associated psychological&#x2F;neurological phenomena that enable it), any significant disagreement (including whether each one of us suffers from it) with this general notion is typically very rare.<p>But then switch over to a different thread where the topic of discussion is not some <i>abstract</i> idea like this, but rather an <i>object level</i> idea, say just for example a news story about conservative leaning people switching to a new social media platform to escape what they consider to be censorship, and something very curious occurs.  In such threads, it is rare to encounter much talk about this phenomenon of psychological bias, and if it does come up, it is ~always only about the <i>obvious</i> bias suffered by those who are in the ~&quot;general outgroup&quot; of the forum community.  In those cases, it is common to read numerous anecdotal observations of how people in the outgroup(s) are cognitively flawed in that they exhibit signs of &quot;living in a bubble&quot;, and &quot;just(!) won&#x27;t listen to reason or consider ideas that are contrary to their worldview&quot;.<p>But then if one is to initiate a conversation with a person in one of these threads, and make a reference to the <i>formerly</i> non-controversial <i>abstract</i> idea (from the psychology thread) that ~all people suffer from some bias, at ~all times, it seems as if all knowledge of that phenomenon has somehow become <i>cognitively inaccessible</i>, that the individual has no knowledge whatsoever of the phenomenon.<p>Conversely, if one is to mention (say, in a different subthread in the same overall thread) this exact same phenomenon, except switching <i>the object of reference</i> away from the person (who was making a biased comment about their outgroup), over to <i>members of the outgroup</i>, this formerly inaccessible knowledge then becomes accessible once again.<p>Just for the sake of discussion (a mental experiment of sorts), let us <i>imagine</i> that there is some significant truth to this theory - let&#x27;s (temporarily) <i>assume(!) it to be True</i>, at least to a significant degree.  In this <i>purely</i> hypothetical scenario, might this phenomenon offer some logical explanation for the amount of extreme polarization of opinion that can be witnessed in the world, this &quot;crisis of epistemology&quot; we talk about where different tribes seem to live in completely different realities from each other, with each reality having significantly different sets of facts?  To me, this seems not only reasonable, but quite consistent with <i>objectively observable reality</i>.')
