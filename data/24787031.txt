I have not heard of this.<p>I understand the obvious point that there are people screaming at the camera saying it&#x27;s part of the globalist trans-dimensional vampire plot to reduce the world population, led by the regular cast of rich characters - but what&#x27;s wrong with saying that? Too many people believe it? In my country people perform idol worship, why isn&#x27;t that banned? Poor people donate their paltry savings to temples, mosques, churches, etc. whose corrupt trustees often enrich themselves. It&#x27;s not harmless.<p>I also understand that to successfully beat COVID-19 we need everyone to be on board - but has anyone gamed out what happens when you censor the people who have these views? Do you think it becomes easier to convince them to vaccinate or wear a mask? I am not impressed with the competence of the decision makers at YouTube.')
