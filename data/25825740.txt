Item(by='1337shadow', descendants=None, kids=[25825772, 25825897, 25826476, 25826132, 25825819], score=None, time=1610999162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825568, text='Make a complete list of things to develop in a spreadsheet, &quot;complete&quot; means <i>every</i> <i>single</i> <i>item</i> the customer wants to see in the product, not only every single button but also every single label, that should be definable by reading the project specs or mockups. I think &quot;forgetting things&quot; is the first big mistake leading to under estimations.<p>Add an estimate that you multiply by three in front of each, ie. if the dev thinks 1 hour then they should put 3. From my experiments: no multiplying factor turned to nightly and weekend work, multiplying by 2 turned to long (10 hours) work days, multiplying by 3 turned into comfortable work hours and quality work.<p>I&#x27;ve had success delivering quality code and respecting deadlines since 2012 or so with this system, but YMMV<p>Only problem: the customer might not like what he gets, even if it works exactly as planned.')
