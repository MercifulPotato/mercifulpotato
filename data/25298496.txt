That is the message being sent - it&#x27;s unproductive! That is my exact point. Our leadership sends unproductive messages all the time -and when half the country doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal, they see rich people doing whatever, their confirmation bias kicks in and says &quot;see if it was bad they wouldn&#x27;t be doing X&quot;<p>&gt; concretely: hypocrites will exist for any principle or situation imaginable, so you can take it as a given, reason about a situation independently of them, and ignore them.<p>You can&#x27;t ignore hypocrites if they have influence. If Trump was pro-mask a good deal of this country would have been too.')
