Especially games that required tracking your opponent with a mouse, such as aiming a hit scan weapon like a lightning gun where your goal is to keep a continuous beam on them while both of you move unpredictably.<p>It was especially apparent in Quake 3 back in the day. If you didn&#x27;t run at 125 fps with a 120hz refresh rate you were at a disadvantage at competitive levels. Not even world class competitive, but enough to be good enough to play in tournaments with thousands of dollars in prizes.<p>If you ever want to see hardcore technical analysis of hardware from a gamer&#x27;s POV, try reading forum threads from the early 2000s when ball mice started to transition to laser and optical mice. Or using after market Teflon pads on your mouse feet to get more consistent friction.<p>Fortunately most of these things were only a few bucks. Most competitive gamers in Quake would also use config settings that reduced the graphics quality[0] of the game to maximize visibility and get consistent frame rates.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.esreality.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;inlineimages&#x2F;2011&#x2F;82175-config.PNG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.esreality.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;inlineimages&#x2F;2011&#x2F;82175-conf...</a>')
