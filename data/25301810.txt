I like todoist because it&#x27;s got a nicely polished interface and an excellent API.<p>I use an AWS Lambda to define and push repeating tasks into Todoist at set times, it also moves tasks from certain lists into my inbox at certain times of the day&#x2F;week. Basically I don&#x27;t want to fiddle with setting times or scheduling in todoist except for one off scheduled tasks. I just want to put tasks into the right lists and let the lambda move them into the inbox when I need to do them.<p>This is effectively a kind of timeboxing so I generally do all my work in the morning till early afternoon and then do research&#x2F;admin for the next days tasks in the afternoon.<p>For notes and project management I use Roam Research which I found suited me best.')
