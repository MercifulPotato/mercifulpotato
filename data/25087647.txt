The word <i>antigen</i> doesn&#x27;t even appear in the article you linked.<p>Rather, it claims:<p><i>&quot;In order to do that, you have to first figure out what&#x27;s causing the decline: Is it stress? Is it microgravity? Is it radiation? Is it a plethora of things? When we figure that out, we can try to find ways to directly target those factors and mitigate them.&quot;</i><p>Having said that, we know for a fact humans can&#x27;t survive long term in a completely sterile environment as babies wouldn&#x27;t have their integumentary system and digestive systems populated with commensal organisms shortly after birth in a completely sterile environment.<p>So it&#x27;s seems at least <i>plausible</i> to me that living in a increasingly sterile environments is likely to be a net negative on overall health etc etc.')
