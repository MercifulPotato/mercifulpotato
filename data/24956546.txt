In fact, I would argue that it is even not an IDE. Simply because, &quot;I&quot; (&quot;Integrated&quot;) in IDE implies <i>lack of external dependencies</i> or, in other words, <i>self-sufficiency</i>. Install PyCharm, Rider or any other <i>real IDE</i>, for that matter, and you have a truly fully featured development environment (yes, you can install some optional plugins, but it is largely not needed). Install bare-bones (i.e., without any extensions) VS Code and you have just a nice development-focused editor, but definitely not an IDE.')
