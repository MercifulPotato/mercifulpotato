Or is it specifically when AWS does it that it&#x27;s not okay?<p>Either way, is there something specific at play that makes it fundamentally different from say WPEngine running hosted Wordpress? Is it purely a function of scale?<p>If a startup decides that Kubernetes is worth providing a managed service for at what point does providing that managed service become &quot;AWS nonsense&quot;? Is there a revenue watermark beyond which what they&#x27;re doing becomes unfair? Or is k8s ok because it&#x27;s backed by a mega-corp already?')
