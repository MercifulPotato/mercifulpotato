Can we have your email address? (You can email it to me at this handle at stripe.com) Depending on the specifics of your use case, we may be at general availability.<p>There are no particular revenue or scale requirements; we tend to roll out features to a few users across the spectrum because supporting users from startup-in-a-garage to publicly traded customers is what we do.
