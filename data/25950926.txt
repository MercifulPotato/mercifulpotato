Manipulating prices to cause a short squeeze is illegal, but that&#x27;s not what happened here. Some people bought GME because they liked the stock. Others bought because they thought a short squeeze was coming.<p>If I think the price is going up and buy, that&#x27;s legal. If I manipulate the price to go up after I buy, that&#x27;s illegal.
