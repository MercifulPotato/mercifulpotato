Something that I think people don&#x27;t appreciate is that as a patient, you want a real person to take responsibility for your problem because that is the basis for a favourable outcome and a satisfying interaction. This applies to every service in the end, whether you are ordering food at a restaurant, trying to get a plumbing problem fixed or being treated for cancer.<p>Any corporation, for-profit or not, generally seeks to obfuscate their responsibilities where possible (one could argue that this is the explicit purpose of a corporation - to be a virtual entity which cannot really be held accountable). Tobacco companies are the best and ongoing examples of this. Creating legal protection for AI such that accountability is somehow removed or diminished is not desirable in my opinion. It will lead inevitably to a situation where healthcare becomes analogous to trying to get technical support for your printer. Contrast this with the what happens currently, where you walk into a clinic or a hospital with a problem and meet a bunch of real people who listen to you. Of course there are massive problems with healthcare, and many people have unpleasant or dangerous experiences, but it can definitely be made worse if we aren&#x27;t careful.')
