This is just example how progress works. Not that long time ago Apple had to be saved by some pennies thrown by Microsoft. Not that long time ago Apple was moving from Motorola processors to Intel ones.<p>There is nothing bad that someone stayed behind. Someone has to stay behind if we want progress. No reason to insult predecessors.<p>Planc and Dirac weren&#x27;t making fun of Newton. Minitel was used in France as some simple version of Internet years before Internet was created. Was Minitel bad? Should we make fun of it?<p>Was Minitel standing in its underwear in front of Internet? Has Dirac stolen Newton pants?<p>Intel made a lot of great stuff. Now Apple is making great stuff (or, to be precise, TSMC does). Next year someone else is going to make great stuff. Maybe Apple maybe not.<p>Intel and AMD chips are not that far behind, depending on what benchmark is used, even though they use older 14&#x2F;10 or 7nm technology.<p>I also really hate the concept of not being able to upgrade  RAM - If I use Mac and I need more RAM I need to throw away my old Apple laptop and buy a new one. So I have to spend way more money, not to mention impact on environment.<p>So, today, I am still choosing Intel&#x2F;AMD computer, I can install whatever operating system I wish and upgrade my system to whatever configuration I dream about and I can afford now or in future.')
