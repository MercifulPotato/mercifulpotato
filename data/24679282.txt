That is not a problem for normal user but for someone who spends the entire day stairing into the screen, it adds up.<p>So you jsut have to do the following(it takes hlaf an hour to an hour to get used to these but then it becomes normal):<p>- take you brightness and contrast down to 50%, no more than that, this will be weird for a while, stick with it.<p>- scale your DPI up by 1&#x2F;4(125%) or more, until you feel like you are an old man that needs reading glasses<p>- make all your fonts larger, don&#x27;t be affraid to go nuts, you will fine tune the size in short time - this is most important for your editor, use the font for half an hour, then see if different size fits you better. you should end up in the 15-18 range.<p>- put your monitor at a distance where you can&#x27;t touch it with your hand when your back is touching the chair and you sin in comfportable position<p>- use f.lux for later hours, it removes the blue color, no need for glases, it totally works but you also need proepr light source in the room(ie. warm, not white&#x2F;cold)<p>- never work in a dark room, always have a light source on, beside the screen itself, more is better but you have to have a solid contrast on the screen so too much light is bad.<p>- never sit next to a bright window, use drapes or blinds or whatever, always sit in a way that a window is sideways to you, not behind or in front of you<p>-  don&#x27;t use screen without antireflective coating or have polished plastic, if you have this monstrosity(apple&#x27;n&#x27;shiet) trow it in the bin and get a new one(dell for example)<p>this alone will ensure your UX will be good. there are other things for ergo like chair and desk but this is about eyes so there you go.')
