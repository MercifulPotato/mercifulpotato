The thing is, that a language like Nim is &#x27;competing&#x27; with other languages like Java, C# or Python where interactive debugging is a given. I would highly prefer a language which compiles down to C code, but it&#x27;s hard to give up an IDE like Visual Studio or Eclipse.<p>I know that many strong developers do not care that much about debugging or can use GDB without thinking. But unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them. And I fear that Nim will stay a niche language because of that..')
