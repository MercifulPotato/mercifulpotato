Not all drug users are addicts.</i><p>1. If you are a drug user, not even necessarily an addict (in which your need to consume the drug gets in the way of other life functions), then society is already accepting. Cocaine use, for example, is far less stigmatized in the US and UK.<p>2. If you step back from your biases and view addiction as a &quot;sickness&quot;, then throwing addicts in prison makes as much sense as throwing someone in prison for a broken leg. Sure sometimes it <i>might</i> work, but it&#x27;s clearly not the most optimal solution. Other countries that have taken this approach have far fewer recidivism rates - which is the metric that should be judged.<p>Finally to answer your point &quot;<i>summary offense with a punishment of education on rehab options create more crime</i>&quot; is not at all what happens in the US today. Drug use &amp; possession carries prision term, in which cutting cold turkey (or, likely more commonly sneaking drugs into prison) is the only option. After which, you are likely to lose your job and turn to more crime to make a living once released from prison. A more realistic counter to your point however is that the current American criminal justice system has little flexibility for nuance, and without major police reform, leaving this issue to police simply does not produce the intended results.')
