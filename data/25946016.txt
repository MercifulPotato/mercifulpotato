If my understanding about the initial involvement of the Reddit crowd is correct -- that it was really about &quot;let&#x27;s pump this stock up to screw hedge funds that are shorting it&quot; -- that group is presumably okay with losing their investment. But I can&#x27;t help suspect that over the last few days, that group has become outnumbered by investors who figured they could take advantage of this weird pop by buying and selling within a very short time frame, which it sounds like you&#x27;re in, and possibly even by investors who want to <i>hold</i> the stock, not understanding that -- even without Robinhood&#x27;s interference -- it&#x27;s likely set up for a fall just as quick as its rise.')
