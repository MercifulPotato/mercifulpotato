I have worked on a couple online dating sites, including one that was fairly popular (Let&#x27;s Date - which stiffed me for my last invoice before they went belly up grrr). Unless you&#x27;re storing images in the database, it&#x27;s really hard to generate 600k for a dating workload - even with indexes.<p>The only thing I can imagine generating 600k per user is putting something like &quot;hit tracking&quot; in the database.
