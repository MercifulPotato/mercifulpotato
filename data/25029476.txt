Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25029537], score=None, time=1604872708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029072, text='&gt; Governments have all sorts of things like machine guns, tanks, and battleships that (rightfully) aren&#x27;t allowed for the general public.<p>You have listed three things which are all really the same thing. There is no objection to private ownership of motor vehicles or ships. You object to the weaponry.<p>But we can put aside the whole right to bear arms debate in this case because there is an obvious way to distinguish it. Encryption is a purely defensive technology.<p>It is totally illegitimate for a government to prohibit things like armor and electromagnetic shielding, even if some of them do, because these things only defend, they do not attack.')
