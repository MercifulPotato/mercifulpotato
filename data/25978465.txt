If you remove it, you won&#x27;t have a functional human. &quot;Junk&quot; DNA does quite a bit:<p>Shield from damage, change spatial conformation of DNA in 3D space, change histone wrapping offsets, provide a basis for gene duplication and mutation (which is fertile ground for evolution), etc.<p>The spatial effects have a nonnegligible impact on gene transcription.<p>Imagine gutting your PC and throwing just the essential components into a cardboard box and expecting them to work. A better analogy: do the same to an automobile factory, because that&#x27;s a better proxy for a cell.<p>&gt; A full 8% of the Human genome is just viruses.<p>Which have contributed to our evolution. The placenta has been theorized to be of viral origin. The immune system, which in places uses complex gene rearrangement, also benefits from viral genes.')
