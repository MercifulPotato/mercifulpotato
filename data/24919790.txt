That being said, I feel like if nothing else, Rust serves as a great way to teach you the importance of memory safety. This is a skill that translates very well if&#x2F;when you want to learn C&#x2F;C++, as well.<p>If you have memory safety issues in Rust, it just won&#x27;t compile (with extremely to-the-point compile errors). In C&#x2F;C++, you might have to debug for a while (especially if you&#x27;re new) as to why your app is inexplicably misbehaving.')
