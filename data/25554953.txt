(This can be denominated in either cash&#x2F;points value within one game, or in expected match-win value across a match of multiple games.)<p>The swing of backgammon is in the imperfect moves, and in how much expected value each one costs you.  It&#x27;s not that hard to study checker strategy well enough that you&#x27;re rarely losing more than 1% or so of a game&#x27;s value; even if you make imperfect moves, they&#x27;re generally still pretty good.  But the doubling cube can account for much greater swings; a mistake like doubling too early or incorrectly responding to your opponent&#x27;s can easily cost 20% equity or more.')
