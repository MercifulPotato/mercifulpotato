Let&#x27;s say that a fork is created, and adds some substantial new feature. It&#x27;s properly tested, and perhaps even proven in production. So Ben decides he wants it to be part of the base project, and starts pulling the pieces in. Now which is the OG and which is the fork? Which should people trust more? It will be interesting to see how that plays out, in this or some other project organized in a similar way.')
