There are a couple of nice Youtube videos - recordings from the computer history museum on the history of semiconductor fab processes. Might scratch your itch to understand how it works (it started out &quot;simple&quot; but today is insanely complex .. the physics phds are really pulling their weight on the latest process nodes). The few responses you have gotten here are gold. Only thing not mentioned is FPGAs .. if you are a software person, you can learn a ton by playing around with cheap FPGAs. Oh .. if you meant you just want to learn high-level electronics, I have to recommend an incredible course on Udemy by Andre Lamothe. Good luck.')
