That aside, many other news sources would find Sen. Cotton&#x27;s opinions pretty mainstream (certainly these opinions may have even had majority across the general public) and publish such views just fine, without advertisers pulling out.<p>&gt;&gt; In the country where you live all news organizations are forced to publish everything a politician says?<p>Of course not. They publish on their own accord, and extremists get an outsized exposure because they are <i>interesting to read</i> (just like click baits, right?). It&#x27;s how I&#x27;d have expected most news organizations to work, you know: reporting on the unusual and unexpected. \nFor me, NYT stopped being a news organization the moment it decided some opinions are forbidden from being published: not because they are fringe (a significant part of the American public agreed with Cotton), not because they come from fringe sources (he&#x27;s a Senator after all), but because they are contrarian.')
