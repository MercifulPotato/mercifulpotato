He admitted he mostly fabricated the claims, i.e. it was disinformation, and he pulled it from contacts in Russia.<p>Curiously, he was working at Brookings, home to people like Ben Wittes of Lawfare (a good friend of James Comey), who was a major proponent of Russiagate.<p>Now if he actually was a Russian spy, he’s a very good one, as he managed to trigger ongoing surveillance of a campaign and a sitting President (&amp; it was acknowledged this wouldn’t have been approved without the dossier), which led to a massive investigation and ultimately an impeachment (thanks in part to Mueller holding back the report until the Democrats took the house). And all this continues to echo in the division and anger we see today. That would have to be some of the most effective Russian meddling ever.<p>One source re Danchenko (there are others):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realclearinvestigations.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;dossier_source_was_russia_spy_suspect_and_the_fbi_knew_it_125358.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realclearinvestigations.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;...</a>')
