A consultant comes in to the police dept. and does a powerpoint showing an average annual amount of drug money they can confiscate in order to fund the police&#x2F;town budget. And the consultant probably has numbers from other towns who did the same. Boom-- you&#x27;ve got yet another civil asset forfeiture program in yet another small town.<p>So you get this town&#x27;s police pulling over a larger and larger set of people who fit whatever description they&#x27;ve taught themselves rakes in the dough. There&#x27;s a big incentive to do this, <i>and</i> to enlarge the set of who can be pulled because-- until relatively recently-- there has been very little risk.<p>I&#x27;m going to rankly speculate that the value of the OP&#x27;s <i>stuff</i> he was lugging was high enough for such officers to take the time to pull OP over. But since OP didn&#x27;t fit the drug runner description and the officer couldn&#x27;t find any other pretense, they let them go.<p>I&#x27;ll also rankly speculate you&#x27;ve carried stuff of much less value visible to an officer who sees you drive by.<p>Race almost certainly plays into this as well, but I haven&#x27;t read a study to know the numbers on that.')
