It&#x27;s not explicitly described, but having the protagonist (who is admittedly a dick, but not really portrayed as an anti-hero per se) commit multiple rapes might not be for everyone.<p>Despite this, I love Vance&#x27;s work (AFAIK I have read almost all of his work except the detective fiction and his one book for teens), but there&#x27;s really some hard stuff to justify from a modern perspective about assault, gender and race in there.')
