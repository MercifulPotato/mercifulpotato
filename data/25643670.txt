Since it is a considerable technical challenge, there is still some work to do to get to a stage where the tool is practically usable by customers. So that means that it would be hard to sell it at this moment. Moreover, since I&#x27;m working solo, improving the website, writing articles, going to customers, or other sales-related activities, means taking away time from working on the tool itself. Similarly, I could spent my time doing services to have some income, but then the progress on my product would slow down a lot as well.<p>What is a good approach to having some income, with a product that is not yet an MVP, and still be able to continue programming to get to an MVP?')
