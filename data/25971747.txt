Or at least part of it.<p>I&#x27;ve long had a nagging feeling that there was a deep connection between the current state of our &quot;post truth&quot; society and the continuously widening scope of &quot;IP&quot; (digital monopoly) protections.  Cory disentangles some of those connections and shows some of the ways IP has become a tool for restricting freedoms.  But there&#x27;s more: I think that those same mechanics are narrowing the overton window and putting all thinking that&#x27;s outside on the same level... and we end up in a world where the ordinary person can&#x27;t distinguish between the credibility of un-approved ideas.')
