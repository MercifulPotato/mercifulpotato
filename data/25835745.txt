They even had rolling vans with directional antennas.  You even had to go to the local FCC office to sit for the license test of all but the novice license.  I still can remember the sound Morse code made in the room with glass on all four sides.  They looked in at you and for a kid it was like being in a fish bowl.<p>But in a cost cutting move they handed over most of the monitoring of the ham bands over to volunteers organized by the ARRL.  Testing was also turned over to volunteers and you no longer had to go to the local FCC offices.<p>As a result the FCC personnel lost contact with hams.  This in my mind is the only reason that this letter could have been sent.  If they have proof that these communications are taking place they should say so.  Hams do a lot of volunteer work in their communities and it&#x27;s like the federal government all of a sudden feels they are untrustworthy.  This did not sit well at all with the hams I know in our local community.')
