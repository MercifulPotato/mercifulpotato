At this point, I can only see poorly but it’s still good enough to walk around safely in the world. Glasses don’t help.<p>Yet, I am not disabled. One day I’ll be legally blind and then I’ll be disabled.<p>I think if there is a spectrum issue then some people will be in the spectrum but not count as disabled. Autism is a poorly understood disorder at least when it comes to determining how it affects your life. Maybe in the future it will have a legal definition that can be easily tested for.<p>I suspect that the author is closer to the norm on the spectrum since they went for 42 years of success without knowing the problem existed. That’s how it was for me with my eyes.<p>My brother in the other hand is autistic non verbal, and there never was any doubt he was disabled.')
