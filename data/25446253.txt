Were a <i>very</i> tiny part of the overall Mozilla budget<p>2.

That&#x27;s a much better argument than &quot;nobody needs Rust.&quot;)<p>Also, the main executive pay people complain about is paid by the Corporation, not the Foundation, so, suggesting your donations would go towards that is <i>also</i> incorrect.')
