Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605734457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142290, text='&gt; honestly reminds me of a bunch of climate change deniers<p>What does this have to do with climate change? Ever consider getting help for your climate change addiction? &quot;My daugher was a creative genuis, and then we introduced her to climate change.&quot; Apparently for some people, climate change isn&#x27;t a science, it&#x27;s a religion.<p>&gt; So you have someone showing signs of addiction after using a device that was specifically designed to be addictive. Occam&#x27;s razor really doesn&#x27;t give a lot of room for alternative hypotheses here.<p>Could be that. Or maybe it&#x27;s something else...&quot;My husband and I said she could have a phone when she turned 14...&quot;<p>It could be that the mother controlled her daughter&#x27;s life and once she&#x27;s hit puberty, she got a little bit rebellious. She wasn&#x27;t so interesting in sewing as when she was 8 and needed her mother&#x27;s approval. But now her priorities is friends, boys, etc?<p>It&#x27;s a tale as old as time. Every child is a genius, angel, perfect until they hit puberty. Then we find &quot;rock &#x27;n roll&quot;, &quot;rap music&quot;, &quot;radio&quot;, &quot;MTV&quot;, &quot;television&quot; or other culprits for corrupting our youth. Today it is social media. Tomorrow it will be VR. God knows what comes after that.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s climate change. That&#x27;s what causing these teenagers to become moody and rebellious.')
