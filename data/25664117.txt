The only video I have seen is people &quot;armed&quot; with flags, signs, banners, phones, and cameras.  Has anyone been beaten to a pulp?  Have buildings been looted, vandalized, or burned down yet?  &quot;BLM protests&quot; gained a well deserved reputation before the police responses became aggressive.  I don&#x27;t recall the police doing much of anything until after they allowed &quot;peaceful protesters&quot; to storm and burn down the police precinct and the rioting&#x2F;looting began.')
