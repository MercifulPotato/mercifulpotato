Item(by='xur17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607275174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25324772, text='&gt; I can tell you that even as a European, I often hit a paywall where I couldnâ€™t even pay if I were willing to go through the hassle of paying by credit card.<p>And even if you can pay, you have to give your full name, address, phone number, and credit card number in order to be able to pay. Then the merchant has to pay a ~3% fee to accept the payment, run your personal data through some machine learning algorithm to try and prevent someone from using your stolen credentials, and still receive chargebacks some percentage of the time.<p>I really wish there was a widely adopted payment system that acted like cash on the internet (instant, irrevocable, low fees, privacy preserving, stable value). Crypto actually has a chance at solving this, but nothing so far actually checks all of these boxes as far as I know.')
