The success of the startup depends on the quality of the founder.<p>2. The quality of the founder is determined by whether or not their startup succeeds.<p>I think some people would argue that they aren&#x27;t judging the quality of the founder by whether or not their startup succeeds.  But I don&#x27;t know if I buy that.  If some &quot;low quality founder&quot; creates a billion dollar business people will just say &quot;I mis-judged him.  He&#x27;s a great founder.&quot; If some &quot;high quality founder&quot; creates a startup that fails people will say &quot;He just didn&#x27;t have what it takes as a founder&quot;, until he eventually succeeds then they&#x27;ll be back to &quot;He was a great founder all along&quot;.<p>In other words, every founder of a successful startup is a &quot;great founder&quot;. But only because that is baked in to the definition, despite the implication that you&#x27;re actually judging their merit as a founder in some other (mysterious) way.')
