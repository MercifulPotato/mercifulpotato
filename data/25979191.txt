Traditionally the reason to use batches has been because GPU-style parallelism makes them cheap. If you take away that reason by making the computation sequential, large batches become much harder to justify. Moreover it&#x27;s not clear what you gain by making the computation sequential in this way -- do you think Adam actually has trouble keeping up with mean&#x2F;variance of gradients so it needs more frequent updates? I would be surprised if so.')
