We needed to be connected with our team more often and simply because we were building new software from scratch and needed lots of communication to make the team&#x27;s consensus. But there were no ways to connect our team instantly. Zoom was for a scheduled meeting, and it was too formal, and Slack was for written communication, which was not dynamic enough to bring everyone on the same page. We needed to be connected instantly to clear our issues, get feedback on new features, etc. So we started building one for our team. That is how Tappy was born, and we are still on a mission to make remote work communication even more efficient than offline communication. \nTappy replicates the experience you get at your office with live status, one-click to talk. We just opened our public beta service, and you guys are welcome to get early access. Get your team talking on Tappy. With features like one-click join, and screen sharing, teams can communicate more quickly, instantly.<p>Through your feedback, Tappy can provide a better remote work experience. Thank you.')
