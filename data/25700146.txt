Personally, I&#x27;ve sandboxed it by buying an el-cheapo Android and exclusively running it on that phone (using it mostly through WhatsApp web).<p>It&#x27;s too late for the world now, though, 99.99% of people will give in to the FB threat, FB will be free to use that data - which takes 3-5 years to become stale. So as far as FB is concerned, they have received everything they need, and have that many years to manage the next fight for dominance.<p>But perhaps if Apple somehow introduces a &quot;contacts&quot; sandbox (e.g., have a contact chooser like the file chooser) and google is forced to follow suite, there won&#x27;t be another one like it.')
