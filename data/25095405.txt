I&#x27;d highlight that conceptually, there are two entirely separate concerns here:<p>1) the front, if you so will - the emails which you give out and to which people (or algos) send you stuff<p>2) the back, where you receive and read your emails.<p>For many people, for example:<p>1) abc@gmail.com<p>2) gmail.com web mailer, or gmail app on mobile, or native OS app on the computer<p>You suggest a complete revamp:<p>1) catchall at own domain: anything@mydomain.com<p>2) one (or several) protonmail&#x2F;fastmail accounts<p>But it&#x27;s worth highlighting that people can get many benefits already by<p>1) catchall at own domain: anything@mydomain.com (as you explained)<p>2) keep whatever you&#x27;re using now.<p>Just forward 1) to 2). Then you can start handing out the new email.')
