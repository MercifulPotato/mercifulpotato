Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610604434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770983, text='&gt; At one point saying “We shouldn’t own slaves”, or “the Indian has rights to the land they live on”, or “women should be allowed to vote”, or “no taxation without representation” were all insurrectionist comments.<p>Uh, I don&#x27;t know what you think &quot;insurrectionist&quot; means, but those are definitely not what it means. Actually, one of those comments was actually the law of the land at the time, as adjudicated by the Supreme Court--it was merely a popular politician who said that the Supreme Court had no actual power to enforce its will against him and did it anyways.<p>In the interest of pedantry, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that the anti-slavery comments weren&#x27;t the ones made by the insurrectionists, and even in the states that seceded, the unwillingness of Northerners to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act was arguably the more pressing threat, since it is highly unlikely that the federal government would have been enable to effect mandatory abolition on unwilling states but removing any codes enforcing the return of runaway slaves would have been well within its remit. That said, there was one notable abolitionist who provides half the cases in US history of people tried for treason against an individual state.')
