The earliest knit goods are ~1000CE and Egyptian.<p>The time period for these finds are ~&gt;800 years earlier.<p>Naalbinding existed then, and works fine for fingers with its regular tools, and is actually very different from knitting in its technique.<p>I’m not convinced. I’m more concerned with the honest qualification of uncertainty in claims made about artifacts, though. The language of speculation and likelihood is a lot more intellectually honest than either the “ivory tower knows all” crowd OR the “folk wisdom knows all” gang’s respective positions.<p>fwiw i’m also immediately suspicious whenever druids are invoked with any certainty: we know so shockingly little about them at all that the confidence interval on anything to do with them is super wide.')
