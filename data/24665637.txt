Is this a form\nof money laundering, or a deal at a distance - contraband is\ndelivered in country A, artwork in country B?  I don’t see\nhow “collateral” plays a part, unless one party “loans” drugs\nin exchange for artwork, and the second party pays off the loan and recovers the artwork after selling the drugs onward.')
