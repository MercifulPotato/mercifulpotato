One important thing would be the role of teachers in doing exercises and Q&amp;A instead of plain lecture recitation from the books.<p>Having had a roommate that used to be a researcher in the university i was attending at the time I was able to see a lot of the back-office side that most people don&#x27;t see.<p>Long story short, most researcher and professors are evaluated on the basis of the output of their research (number of publications, journals, h-index and that kind of stuff).<p>Teaching is really an overhead, and a lot of researchers&#x2F;professors game the system by making things as standard as possible in their own interest (and whatever about the students).<p>I had seen this myself during a surprisingly short exam (circuit theory): taken in the morning, the professor had corrected ALL of the exams before 3:30 pm. The trick was in using simple numbers (the computations were not the hard part of the exam), skimming briefly the piece of paper and then checking if the numbers in the solution matched his own numbers in his already-solved exam. Duh. I had to go there, ask to have the exam evaluated in front of me, and for an important part of the exam he candidly said &quot;I haven&#x27;t understood what you did here so I didn&#x27;t assigned any points to that&quot; -- which is really bullshit.<p>You&#x27;ve got a phd in this shit, you&#x27;re supposed to be a world-class expert on the matter, how could you not understand this? It&#x27;s not that you haven&#x27;t understood, it&#x27;s that you didn&#x27;t bother spending 30 seconds to look at the piece of paper. (I had learned from the book instead of his lessons because I had a full-time job -- and thus he hadn&#x27;t recognized the procedure)<p>Anyway, I had to keep my temper and explain. He agreed and assigned me the points.<p>To come back to the original point: somebody might think he&#x27;s just an asshole (and btw they wouldn&#x27;t be wrong) but if you know about the back-office dynamics you&#x27;d understand that he was&#x2F;is just minimizing the overhead. In a wrong way, but still, that&#x27;s what he was&#x2F;is doing.')
