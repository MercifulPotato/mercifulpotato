Item(by='chaostheory', descendants=None, kids=[25497898], score=None, time=1608568721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496042, text='&gt; settled != colonized<p>So we&#x27;re playing the semantics game now? Let me guess, you didn&#x27;t make a racist comment. Instead you made a comment about ethnic pride? If we&#x27;re playing this game, let&#x27;s be clear on the definitions:<p>settle -  to establish in residence<p>colonize - come to settle among and establish political control over the indigenous people of an area.<p>&gt; They are the same people.<p>According to the Californios article you referenced, they are not the same people as the Native Americans who first settled in CA.<p>&quot;Californios included the descendants of agricultural settlers and retired escort soldiers deployed from what is modern-day Mexico. Most were of mixed ethnicities, usually Mestizo (Spanish and Native American) or mixed African and Amerindian backgrounds.&quot;<p>Otherwise, (using your own language), the Californios wouldn&#x27;t have colonized California<p>&gt; And for what it&#x27;s worth the massive anglo&#x2F;white immigration into California has been tantamount to ethnic replacement - not just in California but all over this continent.<p>Thank you for confirming my suspicions of your comments being racist and no, I am not white yet I do find it ironic for one descendant of colonizers to complain about the descendants of other colonizers. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if you considered Asians and Pacific Islanders as &quot;invaders&quot; as well. Also you&#x27;re proving your ignorance yet again. Since you&#x27;ve mentioned your imagined &quot;ethnic replacement&quot; of Hispanics in CA (which the majority of I&#x27;m pretty sure are not as prejudiced as you - and let&#x27;s not confuse ethnic cleansing with population changes from immigration &amp; migration), let&#x27;s go over CA&#x27;s current or near current ethnicity statistics ordered by the largest:<p>* Hispanic 39.29% (This has increased from 36.6%)<p>* White, non-Hispanic 36.64%<p>* Asian 14.525<p>* Black 5.51%<p>* Pacific Islander 0.36%<p>* Native American 0.35% (they are not Californios, and they are still here)<p>* Other<p>&gt; So excuse me if I don&#x27;t cry a river over fewer transplants.<p>I&#x27;m not going to excuse and condone what I feel are posts from a racist reminiscing about ethnic purity in California. You do NOT post this type of garbage on HN.')
