I absolutely need the possibility of quickly jotting down a task when I&#x27;m on the go. As well as getting a quick overview of the day in the morning or late in the evening without having to use the computer.<p>Todoist is actually one of the few apps I pay for and feel happy doing that. For me it&#x27;s really money well spent as I&#x27;m pretty sure I recover the yearly cost in productivity gains in a few days max.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s always nice to see good open source software being actively developed!')
