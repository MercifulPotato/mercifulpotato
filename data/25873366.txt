This is the color that is more often reported to be the one with the biggest difference between sexes.<p>Another factor that I wish was covered: makeup usage. I feel that a lot of women are able to distinguish colors because of the experience that comes from using makeup. Go to any store and look at the rouges - you will find every single possible shade of it with a different name. Similar to the anecdote that humans didn&#x27;t have a word for &quot;blue&quot; until blue dye got common. Would men who use makeup also be able to perceive those individual shades?')
