This has been going on for at least a billion years and will likely continue for another billion.<p>How short-sighted do you have to be to think that this is it? Why do we need to &quot;conserve&quot; any species? Didn&#x27;t dinosaurs evolve into birds? Didn&#x27;t some underground mammal evolve into us?<p>Aren&#x27;t we going to evolve into something else? Or disappear and some other species will take over? Or most animals will disappear and just plants will continue? Or everything will go extinct?<p>Who came up with the idea that we need to make sure that the species we have remain the same? What is the thought process behind it?')
