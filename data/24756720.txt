That means special training, special deployments, special oversight.<p>That is how it is done in most civilised nations and it works very well. Regular cops rarely even need their handarm in most western nations. The <i>whole</i> German police force fires roughly 35 bullets at people in an average <i>year</i>, with an average of 8 deadly ones. There are cops in the US who shoot more bullets at people in a week than the entire police force of a nation with 80 million people in an entire year.<p>This so <i>obviously</i> due to bad (and too short) training, a misguided police culture (rather than neutral enforcers many US cops seem to think they <i>are</i> the law) and of course a lack of hard consequences for the &quot;bad apples&quot;.<p>Of course it has to do with weapons in general, but the Austrian village I grew up in has a Glock factory in it, every second family has rifles in their locked rifle cabinets etc â€” yet Austria and other Nations with a lot of guns (Canada, Finland) don&#x27;t have comparable problems.')
