But all the elements are there, just some of them are hidden, so they take _more_ time to remember how to reveal each one.<p>When they&#x27;re all visible, you can use simple 2-D memory, and &quot;reach for&quot; the area that a given control is in, even before you&#x27;ve found it, because you know it&#x27;s in that general area. Get the mouse moving there, find it, zero in on it.<p>When some of them are hidden, you have to remember which hiding place they&#x27;re in (object permanence), then wiggle the mouse over in that area, wait for them to reveal themselves, then find the one you want, and start another motion to hit it.')
