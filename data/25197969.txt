They attempt to force thoughts and beliefs on others, “cancelling” anybody getting in the way. When was the last time you saw a republican NOT getting screamed at by some liberal on any of the popular sites? Even now your comment reads as though you don’t want the parties to work together.<p>&gt; We are now in a situation where the president is openly attempting a coup on the popular vote<p>We don’t use popular vote though. We use electoral college. And the media is overplaying this to induce panic from people like you. He’s not going to stage a coup, and if he did, even the republicans would stand against him. Calm down.')
