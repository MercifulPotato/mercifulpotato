Item(by='bzbarsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611932768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957516, text='&gt; In the last 10+ years fiscal spending has been half-hearted and anemic<p>See, this is one of those claims that is interesting to me because I never see anyone proposing what a &quot;non-anemic&quot; level would look like.  No matter what gets proposed for fiscal spending, the response is &quot;that won&#x27;t be enough; we should spend more&quot;, without quantifying more.<p>As a scientific claim, it&#x27;s unfalsifiable, fundamentally, which makes it hard to work with usefully.<p>&gt; Austerity does hurt economic growth:<p>First off, there&#x27;s a lot of cherry-picking going on.  The US did &quot;austerity&quot; things, people claimed the result would be disastrous....  and it wasn&#x27;t.  Europe did austerity, but _also_ very tight central bank policy at the same exact time; results were not great, but it&#x27;s hard to blame this on just &quot;austerity&quot; given the central bank behavior.<p>Just to be clear, I am not claiming that austerity _improves_ economic growth, which seems to be what the wikipedia link you post is about.  I&#x27;m claiming that the specific predictions made about austerity by adherents of specific economics intellectual movements in the last 10-15 years did not in fact match what actually happened.<p>&gt; but once you hit zero rates, then what more can you do from that angle?<p>Tons, if you want to, because you are not limited to short-term rates as your policy instrument.  Those rates are correlated with monetary policy (in the short term; anti-correlated in the long term), not causative.<p>Note that at the point when we hit &quot;zero rates&quot; central banks were doing all sorts of monetary tightening (positive interest rates on reserves!, the Fed raising its policy rate 9 times over the course of a few years and consistently missing its inflation target on the low side in the process, etc).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Negative_interest_on_excess_reserves" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Negative_interest_on_excess_re...</a> is absolutely a thing you can do to increase V when you hit &quot;zero rates&quot;.  But more importantly, a large part of monetary policy is expectations management.  If people expect you to undershoot your inflation targets, they act accordingly and it actually gets harder to hit the targets.<p>&gt; Who is writing publicly on this topic, either in weblogs, articles, or Tweets?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themoneyillusion.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themoneyillusion.com&#x2F;</a> has been writing about it for a while now.  Less recently, as the idea has gained more widespread traction; a lot more around the 2008 financial crisis and aftermath.<p>Is the real question here &quot;what is this and why is it supposed to be a good idea&quot; or &quot;who are these people who are making better predictions&quot;?')
