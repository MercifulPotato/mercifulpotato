When asked to change something like the language they use to describe something, some people interpret that as an attack. They tend to then overcompensate with a bit of “but I’m not a racist and anyway this is so insignificant it doesn’t even matter” bluster which seems like it probably takes more effort than just <i>doing the thing that’s so insignificant to them anyway</i>.<p>Life for me felt a bit brighter after I started reflecting more on the language I used, and realised that using an idiom like “falling on deaf ears” or “he’s a bit mental”, or even in some cases technical terminology like “master and slave” might carry different shading with different people that I wasn’t immediately aware of. The people you interact with are all going through their own shit all the time, and it’s nice to be mindful about things you say having an impact on them that you’d rather avoid.')
