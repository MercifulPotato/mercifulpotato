Fox News (and specifically people like Karl Rove and Frank Luntz) invented this weapon around the time of 9&#x2F;11, but it&#x27;s now commoditized technology and the Nash equilibrium seems to be that it just eats the entire media, at least when it comes to mainstream newspapers and television news networks.<p>A sure sign you are probably under its influence is if you see a clean partition in the way you mention. Those of us who see the propaganda for what it is, will try to convince you that you&#x27;ve lost the ability to recognize it in the narratives you agree with. It&#x27;s hard to do, certainly, and nobody&#x27;s perfect. And you don&#x27;t have to believe us. I would say to apply Occam&#x27;s Razor: could it be the case that the outlets you disagree with are transparent liars, but the ones you do agree with are the ones still applying, at least in general, journalistic standards? Or could it be that the incentives point in one direction, and the Fox News model has in fact eaten the world, but you haven&#x27;t yet woken up to it? If one were brainwashed, seeing the world the way you do is exactly what you should expect. It doesn&#x27;t mean you are, but you can&#x27;t rule it out. It&#x27;s a lot easier for me to rule it out when I can point to transparent lies from both sides, regularly, and dispassionately.<p>We&#x27;re going to keep trying to explain it to you since if we don&#x27;t become critical thinkers again we&#x27;re fucked.')
