Here in the Bay Area, pretty much every casual dining has a wait on Fri&#x2F;Sat&#x2F;Sun (pre-pandemic of course).  Places like Chilis with an average $25pp and places like Korean BBQ, where it&#x27;s closer to $40pp.<p>Same thing in Seattle, Los Angeles, Portland, NYC, Chicago, pretty much any major city.  Which is also where a lot of economic activity comes from.')
