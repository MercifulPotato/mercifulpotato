Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25520641], score=None, time=1608747824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520163, text='The premise of your argument seems to be that investors are entitled to the best possible <i>price improvement</i>, rather than the RegNMS NBBO, and that any sliver of a penny they get less than the best available price at any brokerage is a &quot;fleecing&quot;.<p>That argument doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me. People trade slivers of pennies for all sorts of things across the economy. Literally just liking a UI color has a value you can denominate in some sliver of a penny.<p>The SEC&#x27;s problem with Robinhood isn&#x27;t that they weren&#x27;t offering the best available price improvement. It&#x27;s that they knowingly weren&#x27;t, but told customers otherwise. The implication is that if they&#x27;d simply been up front about it, and said &quot;we don&#x27;t charge commissions and have a snappy UI, and we make up for it by taking a bigger share of the rebates our upstreams offer to retail traders&quot;, they&#x27;d have been just fine.<p>(Robinhood is bad, but the reasons have very little to do with PFOF).')
