In Enterprise world when software grows the hard thing to do is integrations and data management. Take some of the major offenders in these 2 categories - SAP and Salesforce - the challenge is how to make these systems talk to other systems AND get some meaningful analytics out of them. SAP can&#x27;t even talk to itself sometimes due to incompatible deployments across subsidiaries (this happens a lot when companies do m&amp;a). I don&#x27;t quite like serverless either but there is an area, databases, where it&#x27;s going well and it might push companies to take better care of their data. Having 1 scalable Aurora (Postgres) database in AWS serving multiple microservice applications is a data analytics dream - entities, tables, users would be all automatically integrated by default. Running databases is super hard, so maybe removing friction with serverless can push companies to reconsider the absurdity of spending millions for crap like SAP and Salesforce whose main goal is to lock your data in their systems.')
