On the other hand, if they&#x27;re available but one can only extract a small amount at a time as a byproduct of mining, then Mars might still be pretty attractive where those things are available in inexhaustible quantities with low effort.<p>I&#x27;m assuming that huge amounts of methane (or other suitable fuel) and oxygen will be wanted for propellant, though maybe ion propulsion makes that less essential.')
