Most emulators use these heavily. But I think it does give an idea what is going on behind the scenes. There are a number of ways compilers could implement this based on the number of cases and how dense they are. I know that go will organize sparse case values into a sorted array and do a binary search to find where to jump. I think Perl uses hash tables for the same purpose.')
