Item(by='cl42', descendants=None, kids=[24773295], score=None, time=1602649951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24773073, text='In &quot;Superforecasting&quot;, it&#x27;s a bit clearer. What they end up doing is asking you to predict an EVENT by a SPECIFIC TIME. In other words, what is the probability that &quot;x&quot; will happen by &quot;DATE Y&quot;.<p>In this case, by the time DATE Y takes place, you have a clearly verifiable binary outcome, which you can use to judge whether the forecasters were correct or not.<p>There is some art to this -- the &quot;event&quot; in question needs to be very well-defined... I think the example they&#x27;re using is a bit odd and they have much better examples in their book. The example of a counterfactual event (i.e., &#x27;if X happens then estimate the likelihood of Y happening by DATE Z&#x27;) adds a great deal of confusion here because you&#x27;re predicting conditional probabilities. Still possible to verify but to your point, much more difficult.<p>At this point, you&#x27;re asking forecasters to build a probabilistic graph and estimate causality, which is becoming more of a science (e.g., Judea Pearle&#x27;s work) but still lots to do in that space. Anyway, I&#x27;m digressing.')
