I was told by pg that the current round was closed, and to try next cycle. It was in &#x27;08, if I remember correctly. That was near the beginning of the YC program, but that&#x27;s different from &quot;never.&quot;<p>You know pg better than any of us here. Does &#x2F;apply2 sound like an endpoint he&#x27;d make for the general public? The naming practically screams &quot;special case.&quot;<p>Why don&#x27;t we just ask pg? He&#x27;d reply to you. I trust pg implicitly. He&#x27;s been many things, but never a liar.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I completely agree with your points --  it would be dumb to reject their application due to timing, especially when you&#x27;re getting such a strong signal from a YC founder that this application is worth paying attention to.')
