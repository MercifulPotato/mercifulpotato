If by, &quot;ultra-low sulfur distillate&quot;, they mean diesel fuel for road going vehicles, that increases the percentage dedicated to motor vehicle transportation to 75%.<p>That is pretty staggering.  If automotive transportation consumes somewhere between 50-75% of crude oil production, then the fallout from the reduction in that market is going to be very significant.  There&#x27;s no way that growth in the ammonia and rubber boots sector is going to be enough to capture the production excess left by EVs.<p>Your link has me pretty well convinced that the gasoline market collapse will be swift and extreme.')
