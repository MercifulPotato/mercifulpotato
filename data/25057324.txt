Unlike InfluxDB where you can only do efficient range based queries on one time value, in IOx you will be able to apply predicates efficiently to any column. That means you can have several columns for different times (e.g., time created, forecast time, expire time..).<p>You will be able to do efficient range queries on any of these. Most use-cases will work best when you partition your data into time chunks, which commonly would be the time you inserted the samples into the database (created time in your   case I guess).')
