One isn&#x27;t better than the other. In particular, formalism isn&#x27;t about hazing (though I think some people abuse it this way).<p>Books that claim to appeal more to intuition or rely on visual arguments certainly help a lot with motivating ideas and establishing context, but at a certain point we need to be clear about what exactly we are talking about.<p>When learning a new topic in math, I personally prefer to start with a more formal, terse text. For me, the texts that focus too much on examples and motivation tend to be chattier -- I have to read an entire paragraph to understand what it is they are getting at, making more challenging the process of chunking the information into digestible bits that I can hold in mind as I shower or go for a walk (and generally less fruitful). Compare to say working through Rudin or Kolmogorov, where I can read a distilled sentence where each word is carefully chosen that I can easily recall and munch on. Part of it is that I have ADHD -- texts that are more formal and less chatty make it easier for me to focus.<p>That said, I do think Courant had a point with<p>&gt; Mathematics presented as a closed, linearly ordered, system of truths without reference to origin and purpose has its charm and satisfies a philosophical need. But the attitude of introverted science is unsuitable \nfor students who seek intellectual independence rather than indoctrination; disregard for applications and intuition leads to isolation and atrophy of mathematics. It seems extremely important that students \nand instructors should be protected from smug purism.<p>Basically, math doesn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, and I think part of the reason there are so many people with low emotional intelligence in math is this belief that it can. But that&#x27;s another story')
