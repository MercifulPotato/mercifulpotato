A 747 burns 10-11 tons of fuel per hour and carries about 360 passengers.  For a 12 hour flight, that is about 350kg of fuel per passenger. Starship&#x27;s tanks hold approximately 250 tons of fuel and 950 tons of liquid oxygen. In order to match the per passenger fuel efficiency of a 747 they would need to carry about 700 passengers. Starship has about 20% more internal volume as a 747, so it seems likely that they would be able to fit at least the same number of passengers. That puts them at about 50% of the fuel efficiency of a 747.<p>In addition, methane combustion produces 2.75kg of CO2 per kg of fuel,  while kerosene produces 3kg CO2 per kg of fuel. If they are able to fit 20% more passengers than a 747 due to the larger internal volume then they would be within about 66% efficiency on a CO2 emissions per passenger basis.')
