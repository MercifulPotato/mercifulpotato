They tell a story of a nation state adversary who has been behind our lines for months. If true, I assume we have known, but reporting up the chain and especially to the public has been...prevented. Now is the first calendar time- at the cusp of the electoral college vote- when these reports reaching the public may lead to positive action in response.<p>If these reports and this surmise bear some resemblence to reality, I look forward also to seeing more reporting about steps and countersteps taken in response to these breaches. The timing for this reporting is too neat to not be intended to spur some stronger response.')
