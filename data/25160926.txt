I don&#x27;t fully understand it.<p>I have in a NAS a RAIDZ1 of 4HDDs on which I set a recordsize of 1MB, currently full at 50% and so far performance has been good with both big and small files... .<p>I&#x27;ll probably create in a future a RAIDZ2&#x2F;3 by using ~8 HDDs and I&#x27;ll test various record sizes but I just wanted to know if anybody had already any positive&#x2F;negative experiences with some combination of record size and RAIDZx... .<p>Thx')
