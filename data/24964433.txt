The impractical alternative is to extend the language so that its type system implements the feature you want. (For example, adding bounded integers.)<p>I don&#x27;t see how that helps, though, because there could be bugs in your language extension, and it has to be maintained. It&#x27;s just going about it the hard way. It would be sort of like avoiding &quot;unsafe&quot; in Rust by extending the compiler instead.')
