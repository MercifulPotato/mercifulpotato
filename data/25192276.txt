Don&#x27;t trust self-driving anything, don&#x27;t trust wireless&#x2F;remote start, don&#x27;t trust half-baked services like OnStar... if it gets to the point where ICEs are outright illegal, then I&#x27;d sooner convert an old beat-up Tacoma or 4Runner to an electric drivetrain than buy new.<p>The only exception is if I have full control over it, including the ability to lock it down.  No OTA updates; if I want to install security patches, it&#x27;ll be through Ethernet or USB or some other wired connection.  But preferably, there wouldn&#x27;t be a whole lot of software to update in the first place.')
