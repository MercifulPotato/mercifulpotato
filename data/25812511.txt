It&#x27;s the equivalent of a freelance developer who charges $100&#x2F;hr spending 5 hours on Amazon trying to save a couple bucks on an iPhone cable. Cool, you saved $3. But you spent $500 to save it!<p>Of course, if you haven&#x27;t found product-market fit, frugality can help give you more time to find it. But once you have a proven business, frugality is a death sentence. While you&#x27;re trying to save $20&#x2F;month on your email marketing tool and $50 on cheaper coffee for the office, your competitors will be spending their time and money to acquire your customers.<p>Generally, you get what you pay for. So if your gut is to always pick the cheap option, you&#x27;re going to be using bad tools and hiring bad people, and creating bad products.')
