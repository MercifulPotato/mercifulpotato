I fight this one all the time with a local park. It is a park that is not city owned public, but privately operated and open to the public. They have a very strict photography policy, and their &quot;employees&quot; will interfere with you if you do not have &quot;permission&quot;.<p>I believe shopping malls are private spaces open to the public.
