This is the reality on the ground. It is not a fox news narrative. The bullshit narrative going around is that they are abusing peaceful protesters. The fact that you attempt to minimize it by pretending it’s a garbage can on fire and that you pretend that police are opening fire on peaceful protesters is so far from reality I don’t know how anyone can still even pretend that is the case.')
