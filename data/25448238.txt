Companies with scale tend to integrate with a handful of payment processors, gateways, and banks to manage payment inflows and outflows through a distributed architecture. On top of integrating across many payment systems, companies need to manage cross-border conversions, payment failures, transaction immutability, and many other issues.<p>We are building a cloud-native service serving as the undergirding infrastructure for payments.<p>If you are handling payment for a company using multiple processors &#x2F; gateways and you are facing problems, ping me at maxime.manseau (at) hotmail dot com<p>Would love to have a chat with you and show you what we ve built so far.')
