I find that GUI IDE&#x27;s tend to try to be too many things at the same time. I like having nothing on the screen that isn&#x27;t directly related to what I&#x27;m doing, and I strongly dislike ribbons of things I could click on but rarely, if ever, do.<p>BTW: depending on your workflow, and the type of code you are writing, you might find gaze interesting. I occasionally use it when programming something meant to run from the command line. That way I can see the progress without a whole lot of clicking to another window and &quot;up-arrow&quot; to repeat the same steps over and over again. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wtetsu&#x2F;gaze" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wtetsu&#x2F;gaze</a>')
