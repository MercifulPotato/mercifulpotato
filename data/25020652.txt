For example:<p>* If Biden will be weak on China, do we expect Chinese tech companies to perform well and if so, how can we get exposure to that? Some China tech ETF?<p>* Biden will likely support a lot of green endeavors, and so Green ETFs could be a good BUY.<p>* If there is a blue sweep, then there could be a massive stimulus, which would mean lots of money slushing around in the market. Maybe QQQ is a good BUY.')
