After racking up a bunch of monthly phone bills of several hundreds of dollars each, the extra phone extension I had ran (under the house) to my bedroom had been discovered by $parental_unit and promptly yanked out -- effectively DoS&#x27;ing me off the Internet for a long while.<p>Fortunately, I also had a 286, KA9Q -- [0], not [1]  -- a KPC-3 TNC [2] [<i>EDIT:</i> Actually, it may have been an MFJ-1270 (?) at that time], a handheld 2m transceiver, and a ham radio license whose ink was still wet -- having first seen this combination demonstrated to me in 1992. It may not sound like much -- and it certainly wasn&#x27;t -- but it was enough to get me connected to AMPRNet [3]!<p>Thanks to the technological wonders of 1200 baud, half-duplex packet radio -- with something that just barely passed for &quot;collision detection&quot;) -- I was able to chat daily with other amateur radio operators all over the world, send and receive mail, and even download files. (Understand that <i>this</i> &quot;1200 baud&quot; was nowhere close to the speed of a 1200 baud modem on a phone line -- which I would have been grateful for at that point!).<p>It was also my introduction to TCP&#x2F;IP. Nowadays, I&#x27;m a network engineer. No surprise there!<p>Interestingly, six or seven years ago, perhaps, I randomly ended up on a phone call -- out of the blue -- with Phil, KA9Q. I worked for an ISP at the time and can&#x27;t remember what the call was about (something work-related, obviously) but the owner walked in, handed me a piece of paper with a name and phone number and asked me to call the guy to discuss $deity-knows-what. (I did, obviously, and of course I had to ask &quot;Are you <i>THE</i> Phil Karn?&quot;. He was. I&#x27;m sure he would never remember that but I certainly do!)<p>A few months ago, KA9Q -- [1], not [0] -- created an HN account [4] and commented [5] on a thread (about the sale to Amazon of a &#x2F;10 of 44&#x2F;8) and I took the opportunity to thank him in a reply, even though I assumed he probably wouldn&#x27;t see it.<p>(Somehow, ~25 years later, I still have 44.48.0.105 although it hasn&#x27;t been &quot;active&quot; since I don&#x27;t know when... maybe I&#x27;ll resurrect it someday!)<p>--<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KA9Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KA9Q</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phil_Karn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phil_Karn</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kantronics.com&#x2F;kpc-3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kantronics.com&#x2F;kpc-3&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AMPRNet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AMPRNet</a><p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=KA9Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=KA9Q</a><p>[5]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24758472" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24758472</a>')
