AMD is certainly part of Intel&#x27;s headaches but their loss of relevance also has to do with an overall move away in the market from X86. They never mattered on phones or tablets and Apple just replaced them on their laptops with an in house ARM based design and is apparently outperforming them. That&#x27;s something that others are likely to emulate. ARM was something for cheap under-powered hardware in the past decade. Not any more. It&#x27;s now a high end option.<p>I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a great opportunity for Nvidia to step up and cut out the middleman (Intel and AMD) and put together some great ARM based hardware running Windows on consumer oriented hardware and Linux in data centers. Given that they just bought ARM, that probably is something they are actively planning to do. Apple just showed us all that the M1 can run circles around Intel and AMD. That&#x27;s a trick others can pull off too. Certainly Nvidia.<p>I&#x27;d say both Intel and AMD need to make a move away from X86 soon or risk being marginalized. In AMD&#x27;s case, RISC-V might be a nice lateral move to make. That paired with their GPU as an SOC might be attractive for a wide range of devices. The alternative would be having to license chip designs from their main competitor and making them richer in the process. Sticking with X86 is long term a losing game. People care less than ever about binary backwards compatibility.')
