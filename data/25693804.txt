So if any whackjob reads a politician&#x27;s statement and subsequently commits a crime the politician should be held responsible by the media and removed from office. I&#x27;ve reviewed a transcript of Trump&#x27;s 6th January speech and there is no incitement to commit crimes in it. I am not intimately familiar with Trump&#x27;s tweeting history but my guess is there is no incitement to commit crimes in that body of text either.')
