However, not all of these studies involved the same groups of people, the same type of exposure, or the same PFAS. These different studies therefore reported a variety of health outcomes. Research involving humans suggests that high levels of certain PFAS may lead to the following:<p>- Increased cholesterol levels<p>- Decreased vaccine response in children<p>- Changes in liver enzymes<p>- Small decreases in infant birth weights<p>- Increased risk of high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia in pregnant women<p>- Increased risk of kidney or testicular cancer<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atsdr.cdc.gov&#x2F;pfas&#x2F;health-effects&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atsdr.cdc.gov&#x2F;pfas&#x2F;health-effects&#x2F;index.html</a>')
