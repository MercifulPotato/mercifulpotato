But context bridge etc... basically requires cloning all objects that need to be passed to the renderer&#x2F;browser window from another context (the native module). If your message passing is frequent and objects are large this can have an adverse impact to performance.<p>Our video rendering implementation needed to copy frame buffers to the renderer. Doing this over context bridge would have been quite expensive.<p>A more ideal approach which the team is working on keeps the buffers on the GPU - which should solve all the performance woes and more.<p>More on this here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronjs.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;context-bridge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronjs.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;context-bridge</a>')
