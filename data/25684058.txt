You can create a pair of entangled photons in a lab, send one to another lab using an optic fiber, and if you use a polarizer to see if the photon pass it, will get the same result in both labs. If you arrange everything carefully, you have a 50% chance that the photons will pass in both labs, and a 50% chance that the photons will not pass in any lab. (Ignoring noise, error, and other nasty real life problems.)<p>The main idea is that the pass&#x2F;no-pass decision is not made at the creation time of the pair of photons. It is made when you use the polarizer in any lab to measure them. So it is not possible for someone else to see the photon during the transmission, make a copy, and send the original photon or the copied photon. So you are safe from MITM at acts.[1]<p>So you get one bit that is generated in both labs and quantum mechanics assures that no one else has a copy. If you generate more bits, you can use it as a one time pad for an encrypted communication.

You can cite me. (Penrose proposed the idea that consciousness is related to quantum effects, but nah.) (Also see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1240&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1240&#x2F;</a> ) There are some quantum local effects in molecules. To have a global quantum effect in someone of the size of the brain, it must be very cold, like almost 0K cold. Otherwise the noise is so high that it shadows all the global quantum effects.<p>[1] Or to be more precise, if someone MITM that you can detect it. The idea is that you can measure the polarization in the official directions and get the same result that they get in the other lab. Or you can measure the polarization in other directions. If the direction is very similar you most of the time get the same result, but there is a small chance that you get a different result. But the amount of times you get a different result is different if you have a pair of entangled photons or if someone has measured it and make a fake photon with that direction.')
