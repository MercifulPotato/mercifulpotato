Have played around with this a bit and it&#x27;s great.<p>Unfortunately, adopting BTF and CO-RE won&#x27;t be possible for us any time soon. We still have a lot of VMs out there with Ubuntu 16.04&#x2F;18.04. The 18.04 Azure kernel is based on 5.4 I think? Which is still too old to properly support all of this functionality as far as I know. So we&#x27;ll have to do runtime compilation or per-kernel specialization for a while yet.')
