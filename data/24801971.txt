Rather its a good portfolio item for oss developer.<p>Next thing which developer can do is, check if amazon is up-streaming new updates and bugfixes to their product, are they contributing to the existing open issues for bug-fixing,if yes that&#x27;s win-win for both.<p>if you are planning to leverage the project for commercial product, I would suggest future dual-licensing clause which is like &quot;Any contribution to the project will be licensed under AGPL, and XYZ LLP will get its copy as a full ownership with WTFPL license exclusively&quot;. Add an enterprise plan for your product where big corps can purchase its code license directly from you for fair price to get it under GPL&#x2F;Apache license. \njust my 2 cents.')
