Creating requires risking resources which is incentivized by the potential monetary gain. Without that potential, it&#x27;s hard to imagine competitors risking their resources. Another point about collaboration in this case is that it only happened because all parties benefited more. If you don&#x27;t adopt new things that optimize operations then you&#x27;ll be left behind by your competitors who are operating more efficiently and have wider support for the customers everyone is competing for.')
