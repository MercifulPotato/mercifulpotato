Or just get a 4K one but in a smaller size?<p>The whole point of this thread is people complaining that, outside of LG&#x27;s fragile Apple collab, there aren&#x27;t any 5k options widely available.<p>Go on amazon and search for 5k 27. There&#x27;s the Apple collab LG UltraFine, and then nothing.<p>Ditto for 22&quot; 4k, which would provide the same DPI as your laptop screen for that given size.')
