It&#x27;s easy to just regurgitate press briefing, but that&#x27;s _not_ what their job should be. I&#x27;d argue they could at the very least impose some form standards (don&#x27;t publish &quot;x% success&quot;, ask for exact metrics before publishing the press briefing). Asking them to vet that the study methodology was sane is too much - but asking them to use specificity &amp; sensitivity instead of &quot;success percent&quot; isn&#x27;t too much to ask.')
