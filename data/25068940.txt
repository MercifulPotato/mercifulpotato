In fact, the whole SHUTDOWN&#x2F;WARM START&#x2F;CKPT START subsystem is just full of bugs, especially in I&#x2F;O error recovery. The VM community is subjected to altogether too many cold starts as a result. The bugs stay there because IBM provides us with no means of diagnosing problems in this subsystem. When there is a failure in shutting down or starting up, CP is too sick to take a dump of itself. IBM doesnâ€™t provide its VM customers with a standalone dump facility, so it gets very few dumps of shutdown and startup failures. If you begin seeing failures of this subsystem, I urge you to get hold of a standalone dump program from one of the other SCPs and take dumps and report the problems to IBM.&quot;')
