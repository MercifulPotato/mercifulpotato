We are a 95% on-prem enviroment so I deal with the watering&#x2F;feeding of Splunk from the forwardering tier to the dashboard creation. There&#x27;s some other security stuff thrown into my workflow but Splunk would be a big chunk of it.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about the next step career wise, and I&#x27;m stuck between two interests. I enjoy working with Splunk creating useful dashboards and overall dealing with data. A Splunk Engineer would be the logical progression from where I am now, but my concern lies on being a product guy. I&#x27;d for sure be working with other technologies (AWS, Azure, etc) at the next gig, but it&#x27;s still a concern.<p>Apart of my job is applying (not gathering) cyber threat intelligence. I enjoy reading all about CTI, the intelligence side, as well as the geopolitical landscape and how that could affect cyber threats. I&#x27;ve been planning out setting up a honey pot in the cloud, writing about it, going deeper with MITRE&#x2F;Kill Chain&#x2F;Diamond Model, and building my skill set that way.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d like to move to the DMV area and work for&#x2F;win the government since my area isn&#x27;t super techy. CTI jobs can be remote&#x2F;with the fed, and Splunk has a big presence in the public sector, so I&#x27;ve been going back and forth internally on what I&#x27;d like to focus on.<p>Any advice would be awesome, thanks!')
