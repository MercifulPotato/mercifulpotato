As for changing it?  Same priority discussion.<p>Without our people being able to express consensus in a potent way, we basically ignore them right now.  No judgement there, just hard reality.<p>How do we want to play it then?<p>So far, these kinds of conversations have been super interesting!  They often go pretty well.  The core idea is being for something we have majority consensus on rather than burn time on things we don&#x27;t.<p>Expressing all this stuff in terms of priorities could be a way to get past how toxic it all is.<p>What I will say is quid pro, pro.
