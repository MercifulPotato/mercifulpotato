Item(by='mook', descendants=None, kids=[25240471], score=None, time=1606594828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25239947, text='I&#x27;ve only used Bazel in anger (in a medium-small sized project); I&#x27;ve found it really frustrating because it effectively has two separate languages (inside build files and in custom rules), even though it&#x27;s both Starlark.  It&#x27;s especially terrible for doing things that Bazel didn&#x27;t already know about (i.e. running shell commands to generate things, even if you could tell Bazel all the inputs and outputs).<p>We wanted to switch away from Bazel because of the mismatch; it looked like Pants and Buck had the same issues. At the time Please didn&#x27;t have sensible documentation so it was skipped.  From what they have now it seemed like it&#x27;s more reasonable in this respect, but I don&#x27;t actually know yet; perhaps somebody who knows can chime in?')
