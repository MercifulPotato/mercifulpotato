That reasoning has no bearing on why Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell them.  Amazon is not a moral agent, it&#x27;s one of the largest corporations in the world with a profit imperative to expand into as many product categories as possible in its goal to dominate e-commerce.  Those government regulations make those product types conflict with Amazon&#x27;s way of doing business and complying with those regulations reduces profit margins to a level where these products are unattractive to offer.<p>There&#x27;s a moral-political argument which can be made, sure, but that argument isn&#x27;t the basis for why Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer these products, and &#x2F;that&#x2F; was the assertion underlying the grandparent&#x27;s analogy.  It&#x27;s simply false.')
