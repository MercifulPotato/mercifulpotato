Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24874088], score=None, time=1603484948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873290, text='&gt; The ACTUAL TRUTH is that...<p>No, the actual truth of what Qanon -is-, <i>is what Qanon is</i>.  There is that which exists in reality, and then there is mankind&#x27;s best efforts to measure and describe it (what you read in Wikipedia, history books, <i>scientific textbooks and papers</i>, etc).  These things are related, but they are not the same thing.<p>&gt; If you want to claim that there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t a firm consensus around Qanon supporters about the exact definitions of this conspiracy theory, I&#x27;m still going to go ahead and say anyone in this vague ballpark is missing a few marbles.<p>The difference between you and I is that I base my beliefs on what is <i>known to be true</i>, rather than on what others tell me is true, or on my subconscious heuristic predictions of what is true (ie: what I &quot;want&quot; to claim).  What the &quot;firm consensus&quot; of what Qanon (or anything, for that matter) is may be interesting, but I am more concerned with what is actually True.  If the &quot;firm consensus&quot; of global warming was that it&#x27;s not happening, would your mind willingly accept that with no complaints?  If not, <i>why not</i>?<p>&gt; Qualifying that Conspiracy Theory != False is not a valid argument to deny that this theory<p>a) I have not denied this story.<p>b) Is &quot;Conspiracy Theory != False, <i>necessarily</i>)&quot; logically correct, or incorrect?<p>&gt; and many others, <i>are obviously false</i><p>&quot;Obvious&quot; falseness is a heuristic prediction - it has not been objectively established what is known(!) to be False (or True, or <i>Unknown</i>) in many instances - rather, it has only been <i>asserted</i> (typically with little if any evidence) what is False.  Again, apply your same logic to climate change and see if your thinking changes.<p>&gt; Debating the semantics of what a theory is or isn&#x27;t to each subjective viewer is tiring and false and not a real debate.<p>It would be interesting to see what would happen if you took this philosophy into the workplace when implementing software, or if a new hire brought it to you.<p>&gt; I say missing a few marbles, and that&#x27;s rude, because most conspiracy theorists are genuinely suffering from a degree of paranoia and extreme distrust. They believe that others are lying to them, and affirmation of that belief is appealing.<p>You have no way of knowing what most conspiracy theorists are, or are not, or what they believe, <i>just as</i> a racist has no way of knowing the same about people who have a different skin color than them.  This should be fairly easy to realize: <i>ask yourself what the literal source of that knowledge is</i>.  Is it a broad, accurate survey of a large number of conspiracy theorists, or is it a subconscious heuristic operating on a dataset of some anecdotal personal experiences combined with large numbers of news articles and forum conversations <i>that are also not based on direct evidence</i>?<p>&gt; But they&#x27;re still terribly incorrect.<p>If you were to attempt to compile a substantial list of their beliefs and their correctness <i>that is consistent with measurable reality</i>, I propose that you would immediately notice a problem - a severe lack of specific content.<p>&gt; This happens on every type of definition, from Feminism to Socialism, to Nazism.<p>Indeed it does, including right here on HN.<p>&gt; If you want to have a nuanced discussion about aspects of QAnon in the context of what it means to you, you need to recognize that there&#x27;s not point in pushing the brand.<p>Completely agree, and I do realize this, and I am not &quot;pushing the brand&quot; - rather, I am discussing abstract principles like the value and importance of truthfulness, and the possible consequences of a culture that decides to turn its back on such principles.  These are not exactly easy conversations to have, but that&#x27;s why they are so important.<p>&gt; You need to state specific issues with their own identity.<p>Actually, this is what I am requesting of others who are asserting that reality is composed of a specific state - my disagreement <i>should not be considered an assertion of the opposite</i>, because it isn&#x27;t - that is undisciplined, non-logical thinking.  In fact, I am simply following the &quot;critical thinking&quot; advice suggested by the media: do not accept things you read at face value - ask questions, challenge assertions (<i>especially</i> those that lack evidence, <i>especially</i> when their proponents are opposed to discussing evidence, preferring instead to use rhetoric), etc.<p>&gt; All the logic in your great wall of text is nullified<p>Oh?  What was it nullified by?<p>&gt; and is more or less amounting to a reverse straw man.<p>Pure rhetoric.<p>&gt; Implying that an outrageous claim has merit because a severely watered down version of it might be accurate.<p>Implying <i>that I have implied that</i> is yet another example of the very thing I am protesting:  <i>a lack of concern for what is true</i>.')
