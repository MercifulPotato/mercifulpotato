Depending on where you live, it&#x27;s not uncommon to take 15-20+ minutes to drive to the closest store.<p>With the return trip time + parking, you can see how it&#x27;s much more sensible to plan your shopping ahead of time to optimize for the fewest amount of trips possible.<p>Even if you currently live in a borderline walkable area, there&#x27;s a solid chance you grew up in an area where driving to the store was a norm and thus contributes to the decision to walk vs drive.')
