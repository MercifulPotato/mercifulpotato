(disregarding the many small hardware-management cores like SSD controllers, GPU management, modems, ...)<p>Why not have many more cores with different performance profiles,  that then are dedicated to various tasks. Like a bunch of low power, in-order cores for background OS management or  background apps like Slack that just check for new messages and send notifications, ...<p>Naively I would assume:<p>* the increased hardware complexity (wiring, caches, ...) makes this both cost and power budget prohibitive<p>* current operating systems are not really built for that world<p>* the benefits compared to current big&#x2F;little designs with two hands full of cores are not worth the effort<p>Maybe someone knowledgable can offer more insight?')
