People in software development seem to not realize at all just how abysmally awful git&#x27;s UX really is. Explaining git to a non-developer person who just wants me to assist with a python issue always feels a lot like explaing thermodynamics to someone who just wants to boil a kettle of water; yeah, sure, not interested, I&#x27;ve just sent you the file by email, please have a look.<p>I feel like making collaboration less painful has been the greatest innovation driver in the last few decades, and has paid off absolutely enormously. Imagine where a git&#x2F;Github for other disciplines could take us. Given software developers build such tools, and given software developers overwhelmingly know how neat git really is, it&#x27;s actually kinda strange that there&#x27;s still such a dearth of good solutions in this space.')
