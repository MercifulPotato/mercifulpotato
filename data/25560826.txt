Your last post to me was a complete troll and the moderator killed your post because of how vile and rude it was. Do you resort to insults when you can&#x27;t admit your wrong? You certainly did to me.<p>&gt; I almost wonder if it&#x27;s a rite of passage for engineers.<p>Its flawed to think of the world as a reflection of yourself. It&#x27;s definitely not a rite of passage for engineers. This is more of a rite of passage for you and your fear of being wrong.<p>Math to me was the same as any other subject. I never had an issue with being wrong or right. If anything english was my best subject. My math skills developed later in university. I have a greater talent for formal math then I do for the applied math they they teach in highschool. But this has nothing to do with any fear of being wrong. I like formal math because I find the philosophical implications of the subject interesting. I derive no other comfort from it and definitely can&#x27;t relate to your or the parent posters ability to derive comfort from the exactness of the answers. It&#x27;s just puzzles and solutions I can&#x27;t derive &quot;comfort&quot; from that anymore then I can derive comfort from a rock.<p>I think both you and the author of this original article are making misplaced judgements on character. Don&#x27;t assume that others think like you have the same qualities as you or have the same weaknesses as you. Everytime you make this assumption you&#x27;re actually revealing more about yourself to others.<p>Your last post to me. The one that got killed by the moderator was strange. I was sort of curious where all that made up stuff came from. Then I realized none of it was made up. It&#x27;s just a reflection of your own horrible life. For that I&#x27;m truly sorry and I hope you can find a way out of your miserable circumstances.')
