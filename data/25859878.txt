They have a strong tendency to be homophobic&#x2F;transphobic&#x2F;misogynist.<p>Last year I fired an off-shored team of 10 otherwise excellent Egyptian engineers because their homophobic statements on LinkedIn and in Slack made people in the company uncomfortable.<p>If your company&#x27;s engineers lean more right-wing&#x2F;republican, then middle-eastern engineers are probably a great untapped resource.
