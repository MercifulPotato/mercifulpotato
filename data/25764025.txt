That&#x27;s what makes it different than mainstream investing, which invests in &quot;Black businesses <i>rarely, if ever</i>.&quot; (And controversial! See other comments here.)<p>&gt; I don’t think many VCs have that as an explicit policy.<p>Search for VCs explicitly saying they look for entrepreneurs who &quot;pattern match&quot; or &quot;look like Mark Zuckerberg&quot; etc. They are as explicit as possible without breaking the law. Regardless of intent, even accidental disparities create gaps that bring opportunities.')
