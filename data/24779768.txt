Harassment, bullying, vulgarity, NSFW&#x2F;NSFL content, viral memes, brigading, etc. The gender disparity is also alarming (like 90%+ men!). Many feel unwelcome.<p>I think Facebook wants to make VR fun and appropriate for everyone. One way to do that is to tie in people&#x27;s real identities. Facebook threads aren&#x27;t great, but they are better than twitter threads, and A LOT better than interactions in VRChat.')
