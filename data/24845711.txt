I would assume by default that anything involving graphs should not involve SQL<p>A schema may have only one, or anyway, comparatively very few instances, of recursion.<p>In this case, using two separate data stores would be too much overhead; if the CTE doesn&#x27;t do anything particularly fancy, that is, if it just retrieves records recursively associated via keys, it&#x27;s not implicitly hard to debug (actually, there isn&#x27;t much to debug).<p>A point in case is GitLab&#x27;s users management, which dropped MySQL also because of the lack of CTEs (at the time).')
