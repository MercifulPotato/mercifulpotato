The same is true for making good friends and being good friends with others, I believe. I think the former is somehow more appealing because it is tangible and embraces a lot of quantifiable metrics that enable comparisons. This appeal makes everyone compete for a better career. And this competition is making us inflexible, having less time for the help that is going to bring benefits that are intangible and less capable of being good friends to others.')
