Just clicking through didn&#x27;t seem to have any download links available.<p>For context, I&#x27;ve been trying to learn color theory and put it into practice in photography. One of the things you could do to train yourself is to look at how the great artists of the past used color - of course if you have a great eye, maybe this comes naturally to you, but for me, I&#x27;d have to upload it to some site like color.adobe.com and have it extract the color scheme manually.<p>Ever since I started, I&#x27;ve been having so much trouble downloading photographs of the art work that I just started taking screenshots and using those instead. Kind of sad that what is our collective cultural history cannot be widely used because the photographer who took a photo of the art work didn&#x27;t chose to make their high-res photo widely available.')
