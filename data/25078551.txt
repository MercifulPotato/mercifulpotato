More women are taking more responsibility, but plenty of dads are too.<p>The result of articles like this one is that Dads becoming primary caretakers during learn-from-home face a triple-whammy. It discourages exactly the kind of behavior it pretends to want to see. Dads are disadvantaged in the same way Moms are, but then they&#x27;re screwed over at work more (since expectations are set by articles like this one that it&#x27;s the mom&#x27;s duty). They&#x27;re screwed over a third time in custody battles, when thanks to stereotypes like these, they will invariably get the short stick on custody. Best a Dad primary caretaker can hope for, unless the Mom is a drunk psychotic, is 50&#x2F;50. Typical is Mom gets custody.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to write an article like this in neutral terms &quot;primary caretaker,&quot; and point out the majority are women, and there&#x27;s a disparate gender impact. It&#x27;s an article about primary caretakers. By implying by correlation that it&#x27;s 100% women, it does a ton of harm.<p>As a footnote, that problem is pretty common. We don&#x27;t have domestic violence laws. We have a &quot;violence against women act.&quot; I&#x27;m not even sure how that&#x27;s constitutional, but the result is that law enforcement ignores domestic violence against men.<p>That&#x27;s not to speak of the whole LGBTQ community, whom the author thinks it&#x27;s okay to f- over by assuming a family is a husband and a wife.')
