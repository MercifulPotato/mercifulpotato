I fundamentally lack trust in modern medicine and society in general to the point that it doesn&#x27;t matter what &quot;scientific evidence&quot; says. Modern medical care gives us robotic, heartless nonsense like &quot;routine&quot; circumcision. Humanity cannot be trusted to act intelligently and empathically on a collective level.<p>I&#x27;m a skeptic asshole who second guesses claims just because I have access to Google scholar and sci-hub, a good for nothing contrarian made dangerous by the internet. Adult hall monitors trying to shame people over anything covid-related are disgusting people. I&#x27;ll take the firing squad before any injections.<p>To some degree it doesn&#x27;t matter what sort of revelations or facts I come across, not that they can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t change my opinions.  They will, and I can admit being wrong. I&#x27;m very much interested in an empirical worldview. This is different, however. It&#x27;s &quot;fuck you, I don&#x27;t trust you to work in my best interests&quot;.')
