The performance&#x2F;power usage from the M1 is amazing. Developers are jumping to the devices and this will spur dev tools to support the new platform more quickly.<p>I have a new personal MBP 16” and a work MBP 16”. They are great devices but they run really hot and the fans seem like they’re almost always on.<p>So, I’m taking a few hundred dollar hit and trading in my MBP 16” for an M1 MBP.<p>If you do go for the MBP 16”, don’t worry too much.
