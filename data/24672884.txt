Supposing each algorithm is an experiment and each experiment is independent, if you target a significance level of p = 0.05, you can expect to find 1 correlated feature out of every 20 you test just by chance.<p>Can you automatically correct for this? Sure. But this is just one possible footgun. Are you confident you&#x27;re avoiding them all? In theory automation could do an even better job than a human of avoiding the myriad statistical mistakes you could make, but in practice that requires significant upfront effort and expertise during the development process.<p>At a certain point doing this automatically becomes analogous to rolling your own crypto. It&#x27;s not quite an adversarial problem, but it&#x27;s quite easy to screw up.<p>I agree that cross validating would work; that&#x27;s what I was gesturing to when I was talking about making an assessment of the data and partitioning it. Either the provided sample should be partitioned for cross validation, or it should prompt the user for a second set.')
