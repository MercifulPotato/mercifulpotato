You also send a picture of your ID, and record a video of yourself saying &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m $NAME and I want to open an account with $COMPANY&quot;.<p>The Barclay&#x27;s part is just an old practice. How I ended up doing it after two months was by having a letter from my employer stating that I&#x27;m registered with them at a particular address. But what I learned from somebody else that went through this, after those two months, is that they could have said my &quot;home&quot; address was the address the company is registered at instead. This is how they&#x27;ve used to do it with other people that have hit this problem, it just didn&#x27;t occur to me to ask for something like this, and it didn&#x27;t occur to them to suggest this either since they assumed I had everything in order (since I already submitted my Monzo account for salary payments).')
