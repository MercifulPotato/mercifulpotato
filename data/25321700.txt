Item(by='istjohn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607237756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320552, text='&gt; I would argue that the most important questions for most people are not scientific or mathematical questions, but philosophical ones -- such as:<p>&gt; - &quot;what should I do with my life?&quot;<p>&gt; - &quot;what is the purpose of my life or of the world?&quot;<p>&gt; - &quot;should I help someone in need or help myself?&quot;<p>&gt; - &quot;what subject (including mathematical or scientific subject) should I study or work on?&quot;<p>&gt; - &quot;who should live or die, be punished or rewarded?&quot;<p>&gt; - &quot;how should we structure our society?&quot;<p>&gt; - &quot;how should we as a society or as individuals spend our money?&quot;<p>And yet philosophy offers no practical help to the student seeking answers to these questions today. Sure, a philosopher will happily produce a mountain of pages addressing any one of these questions, but you will be no wiser for having read them.')
