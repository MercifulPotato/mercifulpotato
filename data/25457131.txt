Since the Stripe docs began recommending intents, I&#x27;ve used them 2-3 times; I found them to be more complicated (the flow now starts on the server which means exposing more endpoints on my project) and I misunderstood their purpose. I thought they were meant to be more end-user friendly since you have to basically declare on the server what a charge is for prior to taking their payment details. That might have been a foil against &quot;we have your card and can charge any amount we want now!&quot;. However, from reading this well-written article, I see that intents were actually the resolution to a crisis of abstractions. Stripe wants payments to feel unified and hence has brainstormed the best model to fit different types of synchronous and asynchronous methods. I&#x27;m curious as to what percent of Stripe usage is American credit card charges and subscriptions vs ACH, Bitcoin, OXXO and the rest.')
