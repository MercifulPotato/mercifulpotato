(Or maybe you still do! if you&#x27;re returning to your home country.) Tough luck for you, but 1 person made a mistake, and 1 person faced the consequences. With an expired certificate, the users (of which there are <i>many</i>) are the ones paying the price, and they&#x27;re not at fault all.<p>Also, people absolutely do accept expired credentials for some things. Not for others. It depends on the seriousness of the situation and the consequences (especially <i>legal consequences</i>) for failing to validate the IDs properly.<p>You simply can&#x27;t just pretend visiting a website is anything remotely comparable to crossing a border or producing an ID for law enforcement no matter how much you insist on it, so I&#x27;m not going to entertain this anymore.')
