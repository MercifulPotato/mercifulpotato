Your &quot;money quote&quot; is about whether there were was concrete evidence of the hackers exfiltrating data from the DNC, not about &quot;Russian hacking of the DNC&quot; .<p>What Shawn Henry is saying there is that they have evidence of the hackers preparing data for exfiltration, but no \nconcrete evidence of the data being transferred out. Unless the malware used by the hackers stores detailed logs, this is to be expected. It would be unreasonable to doubt that the exfiltration happened on this basis.<p>&gt;In fact, there was a smoking gun to a disgruntled ex employee<p>There wasn&#x27;t. None of your links substantiate this claim.<p>The wikipedia section consists of uninformed clowns like Sabu and hilarious quotes like &quot;State-sponsored attackers don&#x27;t create cool names for themselves like &#x27;Guardians of Peace&#x27; and promote their activity to the public.&quot;.
