I love the simplicity and the fact that HN doesn&#x27;t suffer from the &quot;obesity&quot; that plagues modern websites, but I felt it could use some features.<p>For instance, the ability to filter it by time (it does have that filter already for days, months and so on, but not hours), or have an official app for the site could be awesome. Or a notification system. I already solved the first two of these issues by using 3rd party solutions (hckrnews.com and Materialistic) but supporting them officially would be great. I didn&#x27;t find a solution for the 3rd issue, though; at least not one that I felt was useful.<p>But others don&#x27;t feel the same way. When I googled around to see why these issues weren&#x27;t addressed, the consensus seemed to be that there&#x27;s no need for it for one reason or another. Oh, well. Other benefits of HN outweigh these minor issues, though. So overall, not that big of a deal for me.')
