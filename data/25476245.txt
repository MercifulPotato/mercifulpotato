Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608369104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476175, text='Sure there is a logical reason for why you don&#x27;t want your function to be 4000 lines long. It gets unwieldy and becomes mechanically hard to manipulate or even understand the full meaning behind all 4000 lines. That&#x27;s a logical argument. I completely agree with the soft limit.<p>But you stated that this function name:<p><pre><code>   find_xy_coordinate_of_dogs_cats_and_baboons_in_picture\n</code></pre>\nneeds shortening.<p>There is no logical reasoning that can justify shortening this function yet the feeling is strong. That is the bias I am trying to illustrate. There is, in fact, nothing wrong with not shortening this function and keeping it as it is.')
