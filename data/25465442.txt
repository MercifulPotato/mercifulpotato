Item(by='Uhrheber', descendants=None, kids=[25465512], score=None, time=1608284395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459434, text='Amazon sellers keep complaining, that more and more users only bother to write reviews when something is wrong with the product, but not when everything is OK.<p>Well, I wrote three 5 star reviews during the last year, and I put a real effort into them, giving others tips how to avoid common mistakes when using the product, and correcting common misconceptions. I could do this, because I know this class of devices well.<p>The outcome was in every case, that I got a message back, that Amazon has to check and approve the reviews, which never happened.\nIt&#x27;s obvious, that they either don&#x27;t want thorough reviews, even if they are 5 star, or are just not able to understand them.<p>After that, I understandably stopped to write reviews.\nIn fact, I deleted my Amazon account, because I had some cases of defective products and dubious dealers, in which Amazon wasn&#x27;t helpful at all, and that seems to become more and more common recently.')
