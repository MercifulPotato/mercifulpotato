Also, &quot;On June 14, 2011, Google announced at its Inside Google Search event that it would start to roll out Voice Search on Google.com during the coming days&quot;.<p>If it does not count as &#x27;typical consumer to experience it&#x27;, well, I do not know what counts then.<p>9 years ago, I mind you, not 5. And I think that 5 years ago voice recognition was more-or-less good already.
