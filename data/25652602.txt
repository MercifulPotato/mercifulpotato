I have a 3 yr old daughter and have thought deeply about education for the past 18 months.\nI&#x27;ve been working on HAX (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnhax.co" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnhax.co</a>), a digital cohort-based learning experience which makes learning life skills (e.g. personal finance, relationship building, etc) accessible and fun. I&#x27;m launching a private 4-week beta to ~25 ppl in mid-January.\nThe north-star of HAX is a modern Boy&#x2F;Girl Scouts accessible to everyone around the world. \nI love sports, watching re-runs, investing, and trying to stop myself from spending too much time on Twitter.<p>If the above sounds like you and I sound cool, would love to hear from you at karthik.senthil at gmail .  Excited to hear from you.<p>If you want to read more of my thoughts on education, check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@karsenthil&#x2F;re-imagining-education-the-future-of-learning-6cb4dea5b202" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@karsenthil&#x2F;re-imagining-education-the-fu...</a>')
