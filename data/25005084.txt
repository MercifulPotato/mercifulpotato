They move by the aggregation of thousands and millions of transactions. And yeah, sellers and lenders absolutely incorporate their taxes into prices.<p>I see what you are trying to say about capital gains taxes not being in the &quot;price&quot; of securities. But they are in aggregate because taxes inevitably have to be paid. The whole market can&#x27;t go up without transactions pushing it higher. And all transactions that make profit get a portion pulled out for taxes. They quite literally act as a damper on how fast a market can move.')
