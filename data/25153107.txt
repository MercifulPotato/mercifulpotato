Reddit and Discourse are the worst offenders if only because they are so common. Answers to questions change, you need to able to leave a response years later that the info in the thread is out of date. Add to that over zealous admins that close everything as a dupe even though you the topic you want to discuss or contribute to is closed.<p>AFAIK the original reason to close old threads was comment spam but that seems like it&#x27;s a somewhat solved problem or solved enough it&#x27;s no longer a valid reason to close threads.')
