The North Sea can be pretty nasty in that area (well, the sea can be nasty anywhere but the particular underwater geometry makes that area quite dangerous even in good weather).<p>My office overlooked the main waterway and what always struck me is that if there was bad weather incoming you could see all the pleasure craft and the merchants that could make it in time make a beeline for the harbor and the locks while - not all that rare - the pilots <i>and</i> the SAR vessel were going the other way, straight into the worst of it.<p>Most impressive.')
