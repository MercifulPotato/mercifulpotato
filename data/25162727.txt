As an embedded engineer, 90% of ARM boards (including and especially the popular Raspberry Pi) are complete dogshit. Barely (or not) functional, absurd design decisions, etc.<p>A hilarious example - to deal with the poor reliability of the RPi, you might think to use its watchdog timer to reset the device if it locks up. But guess what? The WDT in the crappy Broadcom chip on the RPi doesn&#x27;t work! It&#x27;s supposed to be there, and it&#x27;s exposed to the kernel, but it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.')
