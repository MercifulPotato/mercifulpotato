You can certainly get it, and you can even pay for it if you really need it (Bloomberg terminals!). This is doubly so for local news.<p>I think we need to distinguish what specifically we&#x27;re against, and that&#x27;s hyper-partisanship. Working backwards from how a story might affect a party or candidate. Cherry-picking details to assemble a case where giving even a slightly fuller picture would present the opposite.<p>But fundamentally for news to be interesting it really does have to convey a <i>story</i>, to engage the reader&#x27;s sense of drama somehow.')
