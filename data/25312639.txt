Queensland did the same using surplus student purpose built dense housing.<p>I&#x27;m not going to pretend this &quot;solved the problems&quot; but I am told a number of the less intractable cases got put into a better situation,simply having secure shelter helped get them off drug dependency, or back into medication for treatable problems, or away from self harm situations.<p>Now covid is closing out, the &quot;experiment&quot; is partially unwinding again and this makes me very sad. People will be put back into considerably less suitable housing. People will return to a life led off the rails.<p>Sure, some want something rough sleeping provides (I really suspect few do but let&#x27;s not pretend everyone can handle housing up front) and some will continue to be drug affected and crazy will break out.<p>But for nine months we reduced homelessness and structural health problems to single digit or less and it almost certainly saved money.<p>That&#x27;s the truly amazing thing: the net budget effect on federal and state funded interventions was probably better, and they STILL unwound the programmes.<p>Collective failure of imagination.<p>Homelessness exists because we let it.')
