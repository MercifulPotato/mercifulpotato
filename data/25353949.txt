My comment is obviously following up on that.<p>I do not think it is clear that publishing a judge&#x27;s address is the kind of speech that is necessarily protected by the 1st Amendment, and certainly not the kind that would have been considered inherently worthy of protection around when the 1st Amendment was written.
