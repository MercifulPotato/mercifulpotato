They do not represent my own views.<p>1. This is an mRNA vaccine and is the first of it&#x27;s kind to be widely offered. This appears to be different than the rest of the vaccines out there for other illnesses.<p>2. There isn&#x27;t a perceived benefit for many people: the vast majority of people won&#x27;t get sick or be impacted in any way.<p>3. It apparently doesn&#x27;t stop people from getting or becoming transmissions vectors. So, if you get the vaccine and it makes you less sick, then you may take &quot;riskier&quot; actions than if you were to get it and actually have some symptoms. (IOW, why take it?)<p>4. Some people can&#x27;t take it due to allergy concerns?<p>This is just what I&#x27;ve found in my online research.')
