Item(by='gnramires', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602175000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24715908, text='&gt; Our species seems incredibly good at making things and incredibly bad at cleaning up.<p>I think it&#x27;s fundamentally an entropic phenomenon. You mine rocks (easy rel.), then you refine them into minerals (less easy) and materials, then you arrange those into complex objects with perhaps thousands of materials (difficult).<p>Obs: difficulties vary with material, product, etc.<p>Finally, reverting this complex arrangement back into materials (very difficult) generally has at least as much energy cost as manufacturing did. If you were religious about it, it would probably take orders of magnitude more energy (trace materials add the difficulty); the cost would probably scale as a function of purity (99% purity easy, 99.999% purity hard), diverging to infinity as you approach 100% purity.<p>We have a discount because the purity of rocks we can easily find is generally greater than the purity left by our complex products. So we can just discard everything. Eventually, this will catch up to us. Eventually productive mineral deposits (for some select elements first) will get increasingly hard to access, and we&#x27;ll be forced into processing our own waste to obtain it. It seems our energy costs will grow and grow.<p>What is truly incredible is that organic life has managed to largely enter a steady state into this process. Every substance used by life has a cycle (usually some lifeform plays a role in that cycle), from water to carbon, to sulfur, nitrogen, and so on. Organic life has entered a steady state of recycling its own waste, assembling itself from ashes of its ancestors. Life tolerates impurity very well. This is all driven by sunlight.<p>Maybe technological civilization can approach it as well. In time, we&#x27;ll certainly <i>have to</i> (or face perish).')
