If you&#x27;re failure, then you&#x27;ve wasted time and money and if you&#x27;re a success, the behemoth will just reimplement your work as a part of their platform.<p>Pretty much the only way to win it so make something that provides marginal revenue, which makes reimplementation not worth it for the giant (but potentially worth it for you). I suspect a lot of Unity and Unreal plugins and authoring tools reside in that niche.')
