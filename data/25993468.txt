You can be on ADHD meds and not be addicted to them, ffs. I am on low-dose adderall xr <i>on days that I need it</i> and I have never had an issue. Everyone is different, but to imply that the adderall has caused an “active physical dependency” is no different from stating that too many people drink caffeine (except that because I only take it as needed it’s not even a fair comparison).<p>You’d be right, but it does not do significant harm, especially given how therapeutic the right drug can be in the right doses.<p><i>Can</i> it do significant harm? Sure. So can Ibuprofen.')
