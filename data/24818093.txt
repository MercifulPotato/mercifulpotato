It&#x27;s not usually the good guys that are using brain washing machines.  If you are trying to brain wash people, your intentions are probably not benevolent.<p>To be fair, this has been going on, way before the Internet.  News media combined with psychology to manipulate public opinion has likely been around since the written word.  I could even believe that many civilizations developed writing as a means to manipulate public opinion in ways that were not always of benefit to said public.<p>Here is the problem for us geeks to solve now.<p>We have put powerful brainwashing machines into the hands of the general population.  We have taken manipulation of media to shape societal policy to a new level with Social Media, powerful algorithms and machine learning.<p>How do we get the genie back in the bottle?<p>Or at least get him to stop granting wishes to people that do not have the best interests of all of us at heart.')
