A low-calorie diet won&#x27;t help: when the glucose enters the citric acid cycle, the 3H will end up everywhere. 18FDG, used for PET, is also concentrated in the kidneys and bladder, ruling it out for therapy. If it were that easy to find something uptaken only by tumors, we&#x27;d be using it.<p>In brachytherapy, we do something like this, except we put a solid radiation source inside the tumor. Nonetheless, the treatment has serious side effects.')
