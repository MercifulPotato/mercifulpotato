Item(by='BlackFingolfin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606773084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259366, text='OK, I could see how one could implement a variable width instruction decoder (e.g. &quot;if there are 8 one-byte instructions in a row, handle them, otherwise fallback to 4-way decoding&quot; -- of course much more sophisticated approach could be made).<p>But is this actually done? I honestly would be interested in a source for that; I just searched again and could find no source supporting this (but of course I may have simply not used the right search, I would not be surprised by that in the least). E.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agner.org&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;microarchitecture.pdf#page216" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agner.org&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;microarchitecture.pdf#page216</a> makes no mention of this and calls AMD Zen (version 1; it doesn&#x27;t saying anything on Zen 2&#x2F;3).<p>I <i>did</i> find various sources which talk about how many instructions &#x2F; Âµops can be scheduled at a time, and there it may be 8-way, but that&#x27;s a completely different metric, isn&#x27;t it?')
