Item(by='bityard', descendants=None, kids=[25920206], score=None, time=1611688808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919471, text='I still use checks because in the US there are certain things you can&#x27;t use a credit card for, e.g. loan payments.<p>I pay contractors with checks because almost none accept credit cards and cash gets cumbersome once you start getting into 4 and 5 digits.<p>My local utilities all charge a &quot;convenience fee&quot; of a few dollars when paying online or with a credit card. Sending a check in the mail costs me only $0.50. (Even though it costs them some employee&#x27;s wages to handle my envelope and cash the check. Go figure.)<p>Checks are also convenient for transferring small amounts of money to friends and family. Yes, there is Paypal and the like and some of them don&#x27;t even charge fees but I trust my bank way more than I trust a random company with direct access to my bank account. (Paypal in particular have proven over and over again to be untrustworthy in this regard, which is why not only do I have two Paypal accounts--one for buying and one for selling--but I also have a special &quot;firewall&quot; account between PayPal and my main checking account. This is so that the most they can grab is a couple hundred dollars on average, rather than some arbitrary fraction of my life&#x27;s savings.)<p>Checks are sometimes the easiest (or only) way to move large amounts of money between my own accounts. There was a time where most online bank accounts would let you make ACH (&quot;electronic checks&quot;) transfers to any other account, but they seem to be moving away from this, I presume due to its high use in fraud.')
