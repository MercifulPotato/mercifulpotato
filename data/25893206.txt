The speed of electricity is much higher than fuel pumps and gasoline. And the regenerative braking does a pretty good imitation of a manual transmission&#x27;s compression braking when you lift.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from Car &amp; Driver&#x27;s review of the 2018 Model 3 P (which has since been made faster through software):<p>&quot;This Model 3 needed only 1.4 seconds to leap from 30 to 50 mph and just 2.0 seconds to get from 50 to 70. Never mind other sports sedans—they&#x27;re not competitive by this measure. This Tesla&#x27;s mid-range acceleration tops the performance of 700-hp sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 and Porsche 911 GT2 RS, in which there&#x27;s a moment&#x27;s delay while automatic transmissions downshift and engines rev up. And the Tesla does it without drama beyond the alarming way it pushes you back into the seat as the car closes on any traffic ahead. There&#x27;s no jerk and no roar—plant your foot on the accelerator and it simply goes.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caranddriver.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;a23685454&#x2F;2018-tesla-model-3-dual-motor-performance-electric-car-acceleration&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caranddriver.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;a23685454&#x2F;2018-tesla-mo...</a>')
