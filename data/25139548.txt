Email isn&#x27;t the best, but the other options are equally or more shit:<p>Slack, which has nonfunctional search and is miserable to navigate?<p>Github readmes?<p>Atlassian&#x27;s wiki, which has even more broken search, and follows management&#x27;s whims?<p>Google docs, which vary widely in format, is not easily searchable, and has no index?<p>Team documentation, which follows managements whims, gets moved around, deprecated and eventually stowed in unused lavatories?<p>Internal stackoverflow, which is piloted and then slowly abandoned after an intial big push my managers, who get promoted and then leave the company?<p>Facebook workplace, which suffers a similar fate to stackoverflow?<p>The problem is there is no global index or search- think Sourcegraph, and management keeps changing products&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;comms strategy every 6 months.')
