If everyone was infected (or vaccinated) and protected then it would be difficult for the virus to spread and mutate.<p>A slower spreading virus would produce more mutations over time and its possible one of those mutations could be catastrophic (though unlikely). Not only do you have more mutations but you also have fewer people protected.')
