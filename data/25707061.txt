Item(by='Steltek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610240483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25705144, text='I love the back and forth of terminology (&quot;rioter&quot; vs &quot;terrorist&quot; vs &quot;attacker&quot;) because I think that&#x27;s the key to this discussion.  The military is given access to dramatically more advanced weapons and technology than police.  When the US has suffered such an obviously violent and direct attack (vs planning or &quot;alleged&quot;), is that not a reason to loosen the restraints?<p>However, it&#x27;s hard to put the genie back in the bottle with technology.  Like we&#x27;ve seen this summer with local police using military hardware, there will always be the urge to inappropriately deploy military-grade technologies in a civilian setting.')
