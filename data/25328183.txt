For example, if I write:<p><pre><code>  theDependentVariable = theCoefficient * theIndependentVariable + theIntercept\n</code></pre>\nit is much harder to recognize than if I write:<p><pre><code>  y = a*x + b\n</code></pre>\nSo, longer variable names might be &quot;autodocumenting&quot; but they also make code harder to read.')
