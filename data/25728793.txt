They pour lots of money into lots of failures. It’s the nature of research.<p>DARPA gave up on Boston Dynamics in 2015 - BigDog and it’s like were just too noisy and finicky for use in a combat situation. I believe all the BD robots they purchased are in storage. And it’s not like Boston Dynamics was ever an extension of DARPA. The DARPA collaboration (along with the rise of YouTube!) made Boston Dynamics famous around 2007-2008, but the company has been around since the 90s and always had other projects and clients.<p>In general, robotics technology does not belong to the US, and as Boston Dynamics’s technology has applications in medicine, manufacturing, and humanitarian aid, this nativist greed is particularly inappropriate.')
