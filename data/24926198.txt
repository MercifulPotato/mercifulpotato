Just that there is no proof it  belonged to Hunter Biden.<p>What evidence is there that Hunter’s lawyer called the shop?<p>And the Biden campaign doesn’t have to deny anything, there is no discernible crime in the dumped emails. The “centerpiece” is an email where Hunter is asked to arrange a meeting with his dad, yet no emails where Hunter agreed to do it, or his dad agreeing to do it, or confirming the meeting ever happened.<p>Whether that email is a planted forgery or not doesn’t even matter when it’s not evidence of any bad behavior.')
