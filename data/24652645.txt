You can write libraries in C++ that cannot be written in Rust, that encapsulate semantics that cannot be captured in Rust. C++ library writers do, routinely. The C++ Standard Library has many components that could not be coded in Rust, that make the language more powerful for all users.<p>This makes Rust easier to learn, but it limits the libraries you can use, having learned it, and limits the libraries you can write.<p>This is a difficult tradeoff for any language design. Haskell is more powerful, too, and also harder to learn and to use well. (At the same time, its lack of destructors also limits it in ways that Rust and C++ do not suffer.)<p>The OOP -- inheritance, and virtual functions -- is a niche feature that is sometimes useful, but can often be emulated well enough with function pointers.')
