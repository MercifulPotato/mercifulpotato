AFAICT it only covers the editor&#x2F;IDE parts, though, and that&#x27;s not even close to &quot;most&quot; of what I mentioned. How does it help create linters and checkers? How does it ease integration with debuggers and build systems? Plus, you have to use JetBrains to get even that. Nothing against JetBrains, but that&#x27;s not going to help at most companies which have already settled on other tools. It looks like a slightly easier way to create the core part of a DSL, but I&#x27;m not sure that solves the problem of the result being an &quot;alien&quot; thing that other developers will develop distaste for.')
