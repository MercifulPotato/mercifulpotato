I use category theory to understand what I&#x27;m looking at around me in the world. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m even applying it properly and it&#x27;s still been incredibly useful to me. I&#x27;ve developed basic principles for myself I use in daily life, to handle my emotions, and for raising my child.<p>Practitioner apathy and willingness to dismiss things as not useful can reflect a lack of intellectual humility in their cultures and lives.<p>The generality is useful if one practices seeking subject-specific insights from the generality. It sometimes leads to new options I haven&#x27;t even thought of or leads me to reconsider decisions.<p>&quot;Useful&quot; is a judgment and most judgments like this are made on too short of a timeline. What&#x27;s actually happening is someone hasn&#x27;t found a use for the thing labeled as &quot;useless&quot; and is blaming it on the thing, themselves, or where the thing came from. Instead, a growth mindset focused on learning, accountability, and responsibility might be &quot;I did this thing and the outcome I wanted didn&#x27;t occur. I haven&#x27;t yet learned how to use it for said outcome.&quot;')
