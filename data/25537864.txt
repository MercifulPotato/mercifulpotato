It is only significantly better in China, and somewhat more generally in south-east Asia.<p>Not to mention, we have little data on actual poverty in 1920, as many of the un-industrialized nations had large proportions of their populations living off the land in ways that did not contribute to GDP, but where they nevertheless wouldn&#x27;t have been considered poor. It&#x27;s also important to remember that scientific racism was a majority position in many European and American countries, and much of the data we have was collected through that lens.')
