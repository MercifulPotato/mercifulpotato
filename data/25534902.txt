And, in some experimentations I did in the past, it&#x27;s usually easy, in a large organization, to forge a 100% legit url (like somefileserver.organization.com&#x2F;some_url_that_can_be_easily_edited_by_anonymous_users) and a 100% legit sender (because of some open relay that passes DKIM and&#x2F;or SPF). So you just need an access to a minimal-security internal network (easily obtainable through spearphishing or malicious employees) to perform a good phish.<p>The obvious attack vector is to insert some JS in the webpage that performs a redirection to an external server holding malicious data. But the user would fail IFF they entered the data there, not just by clicking.')
