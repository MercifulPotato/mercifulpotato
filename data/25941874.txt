Unless the SEC authorized these actions I think it arguably makes the brokerages liable for losses and is arguably market manipulation. Transferring securities positions between brokers is relatively costly and time consuming - takes at least a day and there is usually a $40-70 fee - so is a temporary but significant road block.<p>Robinhood may be wanting to keep their name out if the papers but unless every brokerage does this it will just move elsewhere. Just like the US was going to limit oil futures because they thought institutions were driving up gas costs - then Dubai announced they would continue to trade without restrictions, US dropped that idea like a hot potato because they would rather have high gas prices then have Dubai become the world hub for oil trading.')
