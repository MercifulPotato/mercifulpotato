Item(by='swatson741', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605987136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25168589, text='One of the biggest problems I&#x27;ve found with working from home is that your work life and your professional life start to blend together in unfortunate ways. Working without office space is common in pre-startups and it&#x27;s dreadful. I&#x27;ve been told that blending your work and professional life is simply foolishness on an individual level. Usually this isn&#x27;t the case. The circumstances tend to be different and there&#x27;s a lot of pressure to compress your life like this. It&#x27;s dreadful. Everything feels like work after awhile. Other people I&#x27;ve spoken to in the startup&#x2F;entrepreneur scene who work from home have conferred this sentiment. It&#x27;s often the case that the lifestyle work from home produces is unsustainable in the long run. In this way it is a degenerate lifestyle. It&#x27;s challenging to turn a home into a proper workspace.<p>A rebuttal to those who dislike the office. I would argue that the many of the downsides of the office tend to be blessings in disguise. You aren&#x27;t meant to be totally comfortable at work. Going to the office is like a performance. You aren&#x27;t meant to be totally comfortable while performing a duty. It&#x27;s like doing a presentation. You shouldn&#x27;t go up on stage and let it all hang loose. The office space tends to cultivate the right things for working which are not the right things for relaxed living.')
