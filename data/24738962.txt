Because it is so concerned with limitations?<p>IMO, the current zeitgeist seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to a prior idea: &quot;everyone can program (e.g. previous zeitgeist)...but, we need guard rails in tools! Put as many guard rails as we can into tools!&quot; Thus, you have languages prescribing architecture (Elm), web frameworks imposing naming conventions (Rails), etc. At least Rust&#x27;s limitations help with reasoning, vs seeming capricious.<p>I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here (parent), but Obj-C remains the most interesting language I&#x27;ve seen in a long while: dynamic runtime with a static type-checking for a great majority of code, along with very good performance.')
