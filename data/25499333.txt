The ML solver&#x2F;tooling layer has also been making progress on this front, for example Dask for limited-RAM pandas, h2o.ai has limited RAM solvers, xgboost has an external memory version, pytorch&#x2F;tensorflow models are mostly trained on SGD and only needs to load data batch by batch. It&#x27;s nice that Metaflow can integrate with any python code and thus benefit from all of the efforts made on the solver&#x2F;tooling layer.')
