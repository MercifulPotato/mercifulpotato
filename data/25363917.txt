Bill Clinton supported &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; and the defense of marriage act. They were considered moderate in the 90s, but I would classify them as far right today. A moderate in the 1930s could literally have supported Fascism, and the &quot;progressive&quot; Woodrow Wilson supported the Klu Klux Klan. I&#x27;m not saying this applies to you, but &quot;moderate XX years ago&quot; is not an argument against something being far right.')
