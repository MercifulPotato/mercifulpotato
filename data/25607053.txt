Not only that, Amphetamine does not promote the recreational use of legal&#x2F;prescribed drugs. In the United States, amphetamine is prescribed by doctors to adults for narcolepsy and to children for ADHD...</i><p>&gt; <i>...Just like amphetamine (the organic compound) can be legally used to keep humans awake and attentive, Amphetamine (the app) can be legally used to keep your Mac awake.&quot;</i><p>While &quot;amphetamine&quot; isn&#x27;t itself an &quot;illegal&quot; drug, <i>promoting</i> the use of amphetamines for anything other than the FDA-approved indications (e.g. narcolepsy and ADHD) is something that can approach illegality [0]. For example, Pfizer and many other companies have had to pay billions to settle charges of promoting drugs for non-approved indications [1].<p>The author doesn&#x27;t help his case when he asserts, &quot;<i>amphetamine can be legally used to keep humans awake and attentive</i>&quot;. Yes, that&#x27;s an effect of the drug, but it&#x27;s only official legal uses are for treating narcolepsy and diagnosed ADHD. Adderall&#x27;s manufacturer would get in big trouble if it started a campaign to convince doctors (who can basically prescribe for any reason they judge necessary) to get patients on Adderall for general boosting of performance and productivity.<p>Of course, the author (I assume) isn&#x27;t in the pocket of Big Pharma. it&#x27;s also not a stretch to see how this falls afoul of Apple&#x27; policy against encouraging the illegal use of drugs, in that the application&#x27;s very name creates an association between &quot;Amphetamine&quot; and &quot;making your computer more productive&quot;. Alcohol isn&#x27;t an illegal drug either, but as the author notes, Apple explicitly bans encouragement of <i>&quot;consumption of...excessive amounts of alcohol&quot;</i> â€“ i.e. a harmful use of an otherwise legal drug.<p>To use a hypothetical example, if a developer created an app that reduced screen glare and excessive contrast in UI elements, and then called it Fentanyl, I&#x27;d imagine Apple would have the same complaints as it does against Amphetamine, even though Fentanyl is a drug legally prescribed for severe chronic pain.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthaffairs.org&#x2F;do&#x2F;10.1377&#x2F;hblog20160719.055881&#x2F;full&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthaffairs.org&#x2F;do&#x2F;10.1377&#x2F;hblog20160719.05588...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-department-announces-...</a>')
