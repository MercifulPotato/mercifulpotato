More than once I downloaded something only to later find that it won&#x27;t play when I&#x27;m offline on a plane. Also, whenever Youtube decides to ban or suspend a video, it automatically disappears from the downloads area as well. Plus, this requires a mobile device, which is not necessarily where you may want to watch these things.')
