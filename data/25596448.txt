In some states you have to go to a doctor to get a prescription&#x2F;referral for getting blood work done.The doctor just sends you to a lab company so why not go there first instead of the current wasteful process? CPAP machines are another example. Buy one directly, illegally, or go through multiple rounds of appointments to get the same machine.<p>If someone is more comfortable going to a doctor, that&#x27;s fine. Making it a requirement is silly though.')
