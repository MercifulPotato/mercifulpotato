There are many many large predators in the US and we get along fine.  The US outside of Alaska has thousands of wolves, 10&#x27;s of thousands of mountain lions, 100&#x27;s of thousands of bears, millions of crocodiles, millions of coyotes, etc... no major problems.  And they&#x27;re not just in the sparsely inhabited west, densely populated north-east states like NY, PA, NJ, MA, CT ,etc. have thousands of bears and coyotes (though admittedly not many wolves).')
