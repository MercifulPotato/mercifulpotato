Buildbot seems to allow you to customize some steps within the build part, that will run on the same worker.<p>On the other side conducto is meant to allow you to describe your workflow in python, without forcing you to follow a specific structure. It&#x27;s up to you to decide how to parallelize things (I can think of build examples where conducto is used to build many objects (ParallelNode), then link). You just define the successsion of serial&#x2F;parallel tasks that are needed in your automation, rather than trying to make it fit in whatever the makers thought was a proper way to build&#x2F;test&#x2F;deploy.')
