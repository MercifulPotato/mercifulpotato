Or with panic attacks. Or with being an overtly anxious person who may be prone to worry. That&#x27;s a different syndrome and isn&#x27;t noticeably linked to abusive behaviour.<p>You lost me here a bit, but I agree with the rest. It depends what you judge to be &quot;abusive&quot;. People definitely suffer extreme, inappropriate worry about things that make sense to worry about. They also have general feelings of worry that cause distress.<p>These stresses sometimes manifest in testiness. Depending on the relationship or how well liked the person is, this tends to get judged as normal tension or &quot;abuse&quot;. I&#x27;ve definitely been abused by people who were clearly letting themselves be wound up. I&#x27;ve wondered if the person has pathological problems (eg narcissism, anxiety). I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d go so far as saying the person is not redeemable, but the behavior was definitely unacceptable and included name calling.<p>I think a lot of people just don&#x27;t want it to be true, but it is. That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to put up with the behavior, because &quot;they have a heart of gold deep down&quot;, or anything like that. It&#x27;s just wrong to say that general anxiety isn&#x27;t associated with any abusive behaviors categorically (it&#x27;s really one of those statements that&#x27;s the exact opposite of the truth). I&#x27;ve seen it happen.')
