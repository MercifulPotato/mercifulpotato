People wrote all kinds of automated tools etc. to replace weird BOFH shell scripts. Almost no syntactical improvements upon Bourne sh (which was a weird Algol-like in C-land), but introducing plenty of incompatibilities because other systems might have just regular sh or an older version of bash.<p>Compared to Korn Shell or yes, Perl, it&#x27;s a major step back. (I&#x27;d also say it&#x27;s a lot harder to write than read, given that once you&#x27;re reading a working script, you&#x27;ve already got most of the whitespace issues and badly formed command argument worked out).<p>The Unix commandline as a way to pipe together commands was a pretty great idea. But every inch you step away from that abstract ideal is just mired in a geological accumulation of oddities and bad design (Plan 9 probably being the closest ever attempt of making that work less painfully)')
