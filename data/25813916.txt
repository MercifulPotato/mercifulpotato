People simply refuse to take you seriously once they recognize how improperly these terms are applied and as such are effectively being redefined.<p>The fact that such an extreme proposition (someone being a fascist) is even entertained and on such flimsy grounds is troubling. Glenn Greenwald is a progressive and a critic of Trump, yet he&#x27;s suspected of being a fascist? It seems like these terms are used as ad hominems to defame character, rather than arguing based on the merits, because the mainstream left can&#x27;t stand honest criticism from their own side of the political spectrum.<p>It seems all it takes to raise suspicion of being a fascist is saying some favourable things about Trump or some things that benefit Trump politically. The problem with that is that everyone that&#x27;s honest is gonna have to say favourable things about Trump some of the time, cuz he&#x27;s simply not that bad. Trump is just a 90&#x27;s democrat with a New York attitude that somehow managed to get elected as a republican president, yet here we are talking about him and half the country as if Hitler and his movement have been reincarnated.<p>About the january 6th thing. I&#x27;ve personally heard Trump&#x27;s political strategy to challenge the election being expounded for months by the people involved and it did not involve any violence at any point. They expressly warned against the use of violence, feeling that it was unnecessary, unethical, and counterproductive. The violence was perpetrated by a separate group that acted against the express wishes of the president and did not even attend the rally, but went straight to the capitol. Trump and his confidants were well aware how counterproductive violence would be before the events of january 6th unfolded. He&#x27;s not a stupid guy. If he had wanted a coup, I guarantee you he would have had it executed properly, but his eyes were already on 2024, and for him to peacefully protest the alleged stealing of this election was gonna be a win-win situation: either he proves his case and is vindicated, or he demonstrates the alleged corruption of the system which will fuel his next run for office.<p>I don&#x27;t blame you for having such a caricatured picture of Trump, though. It&#x27;s what the media has been spoon feeding everyone for years now. Unless you go out of your way to look for the person behind the caricature, you will have a hard time understanding anything that is going on. Both sides need to stop demonizing each other.')
