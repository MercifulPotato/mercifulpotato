If they want to ensure their candidate is capable, they can administer a test (or pay a central examination service provider for such a test). A candidate looking for jobs do not require a university degree, but do require taking this test (or have taken a prior test and show the results).<p>This way, university can remain &quot;pure&quot;, rather than a gateway which people pay as an entry-fee for employment.')
