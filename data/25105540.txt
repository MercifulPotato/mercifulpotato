I haven&#x27;t passed any judgement on the code, and I never stated it was beginner level.<p>&gt; It is 250 lines because I was experienced enough to implement it in 250 lines<p>If you had written a clever algorithm I would agree, but the code seems pretty straightforward. I&#x27;m not really sure how being inexperienced would make someone unable to implement this.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s some knowledge required to do what you have done but given that the implementation seems relatively straightforwards and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much substance (Only 250 LOC + you said you wrote it in 1 day) I would _personally_ not classify this as a project.<p>I think you are reading too much into an offhand comment.')
