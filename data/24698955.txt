I&#x27;ll just stick with mobile area- we have iOS &amp; Android.  What if we didn&#x27;t have ANY big tech companies and there were 10+ mobile OSs.  Sound great for competition? Yeah I guess.  But in reality, it would never have allowed mobile to take off.  How do you put resources into developing an app when you have to make it work on 10+ OSs? All with their different quirks? It&#x27;s hard enough with 2.<p>So I think there are a lot of advantages of a small number of large tech firms.. HOWEVER.  When they are able to accumulate 100+ BILLION DOLLARS it can only be clear that they are NOT contributing back into the system to &quot;pay&quot; for their quasi-monopolies.')
