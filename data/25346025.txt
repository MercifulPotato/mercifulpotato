There are no technical benefits to over-ear compared to in-ear and yet they charge <i>more</i>.  This makes me lose hope that the Airpods line would improve over time.<p>The Airpods Pro (I still cringe at the stupidity built into the name) at least had strong technical merits.  The only step they missed on was keeping them open back.  You lose the ability to have cavity resonance for low frequency frequency response.  The phase issues associated with this are imperceptible at low frequencies.<p>If they coupled that with tuning filters with microphones (flatten response and linearize phase up to an acceptable amount of delay: ~10 ms) then they would have a great product on their hands.  Instead they made a piece of jewelry.')
