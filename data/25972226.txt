Which, to be fair, is very straightforward as long as Bank is immutable, but still kind of annoying.<p>But considering how incredibly common many-to-many relationships are in business logic and especially in SQL, I&#x27;m constantly surprised that there isn&#x27;t a de facto standard, efficient data structure to represent them. That speaks to how entrenched cyclic relationships are in software engineering, I suppose.')
