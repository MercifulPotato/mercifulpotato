Kinda like if a commercial office lease based the rent on the revenue the law firm tenant makes every month instead of rent being a flat monthly payment, say 10% or so vs $2500 &#x2F;month.<p>The idea is the posh lifestyle image contributes to the public persona a social influencer has, thereby increasing reach and effectiveness of the advertising he&#x2F;she makes and resulting in higher revenue.<p>For the influencer (typically not cash rich), it’s a way to up their credential and daily lifestyle without needing the up-front money required.<p>For the holding company, I presume they forecast the return from the revenue split of one or many tenants in the house is a multiple higher than if they just leased the property out at whatever market rate.<p>It’s a terribly toxic model for all involved. I suspect it won’t last long as a profitable arrangement for anyone and when it no longer is, lots of damage will occur to all parties.')
