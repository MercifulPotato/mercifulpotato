Do you have any recommendations for documents or a PDF that covers the JVM memory model and scheduler in any depth that makes it appropriate, possibly with applications to hard-realtime systems?<p>Again, thanks for the response, this was insightful and I&#x27;d love to learn more.<p>Also, an aside - do you have any thoughts on the use of Rust in these same systems? It&#x27;s a little bit more bleeding edge, but I&#x27;m curious to hear an expert&#x27;s thoughts!')
