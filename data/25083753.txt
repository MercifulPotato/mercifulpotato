No! If a candidate, despite being from a single-parent family performs better than other candidates, he or she should be hired! He or she should be treated as an <i>individual</i> not as the member of some group.<p>Similarly, diversity should be viewed as something of secondary importance. The world does <i>not</i> need more women in tech or more men in nursing or more X in Y. Rather, each human being needs to be treated fairly, judged based on his or her <i>own</i> merits.')
