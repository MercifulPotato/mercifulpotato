But DDG is bad. I have it set as my default search. I find myself either:<p>1) trying duck duck go and then immediately re-searching in google to actually get relevant answers.<p>2) skipping the search bar and going immediately to google when I know DDG just isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>Feels like back in the olden days when you had to try Altavista, Lycos and Yahoo to find what you&#x27;re looking for.<p>I can live without chrome, calendars, gmail, maps and all the others. But they&#x27;re still the best at search by a lot.')
