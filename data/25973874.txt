It was debated for a while, and anyone could have read it during that period if they chose to. There was none of the here is a 5000 page bill and you must pass it in 2 hours or the economy goes under like happens in the US Congress. They not only took the farmers into confidence, they took the opinions of the farmers into consideration and amended the bill. Each individual substantive line item being demanded by the protesters is already included in the bill. The bill literally cannot harm any actual farmer. It will prevent certain bureaucrats and politicians from receiving bribes from the buyers of produce and as a result will likely increase what the farmers receive by the amount of the bribe paid. They can quite literally only get MORE for produce than they get now, the bill obligates the government to guarantee this.')
