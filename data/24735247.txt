I&#x27;ve worked as an engineer on both sides you mention.<p>You get what you pay for, there are companies that charge you more and some that charge you less. There are companies that hire good talent, pay them well, have experienced engineers who have worked with range of people&#x2F;projects and consequently are generally well travelled and culturally aware. And, there are companies that just hire inexperienced engineers etc. Irrespective of which country, if you want a good team of engineers, you got to be willing to pay more.<p>And, while working with people from a different country&#x2F;geography, instead of just expecting the people you work with to be culturally aware, you got to be willing to learn and get culturally aware too. Did you put in any effort? For instance, if you go in with I won&#x27;t even care about trying to pronounce your name right or a bias that &quot;your culture is just not good for innovation&#x2F;critical thinking etc&quot; attitude, you wont get anywhere.')
