If you&#x27;re shipping a few 100k units of a desktop spec, it pays to make sure you can control costs be removing problematic components, and in their case, they often write their own firmware so they can quickly work around bugs.<p>Dell may actually be the PC provider closest to what Apple does, since I believe they source components for their own hardware in some cases (or use white label in others, but with their own firmware as I noted).<p>That said, I think the only thing that prevents Apple from competing in this space is desire and experience providing that service to enterprises at scale.  It&#x27;s not like they don&#x27;t have the money or manufacturing pipeline, and lack of experience solves itself after a while.')
