In the case of turning the tree into furniture its really what happens at the end of the furniture&#x27;s life. If it ends up buried in a landfill then the carbon is probably sequestered for a few hundred years, but if it ends up going through an incinerator for electricity&#x2F;etc generation then its not actually offsetting long term.')
