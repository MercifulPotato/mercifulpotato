I was just suggesting that ONE bad round of investments going bad shouldn&#x27;t make a hedgefund apply for bankruptcy. and my take isn&#x27;t to &quot;only take big risks if failure is impossible&quot; (Which is a paradox, you risk failure or failure is impossible)<p>&quot;then maybe this just validates their strategy.&quot;<p>Well, no, the GME stock rally made them insolvent for such a long time that only the SEC intervening might save them. (Again, not suggesting that&#x27;s the SEC&#x27;s motivation)<p>30 day non-volatile shortstocks should require significantly higher margins than they already do because debt increases nonlinear when the market goes up. but no, higher margins would mean you can invest less so the SEC better protect everyone on wall street from market gambling. The SEC operates on a complete grey area and many people who have &#x27;beaten&#x27; wall street ended up being caught and nerfed by the SEC.<p>&#x27;our mission is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets&#x27;<p>The SEC is not your friend. It does not help YOU when the market is unfair, volatile, inefficient. only when big waves form they feel the need to help big players. The SEC is just going to blame amateurs, help the hedgefunds and make no attempt to help the day-traders who many people argue ITT got caught up in the GME stocks.')
