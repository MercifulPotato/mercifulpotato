If you survey companies to understand their organizational structure, you will see the sample dominated by domain-oriented structures (eg product, business unit, etc) as opposed to functionally-oriented structures (eg skills).<p>The example you mention (Apple) is a notable one precisely because it&#x27;s an outlier in this respect. It is interesting! In particular, I understand than iPhone, iPad, and Mac are built by the same people, not split across separate teams.<p>Even then, Apple still has lots of typical domain-oriented structure. Of the 10 or so people I&#x27;vd known to work there, all of them have been in product-oriented teams.')
