Often tuition is paid for plus a stipend.<p>&gt;If you don&#x27;t come out on top, it&#x27;s a waste,<p>I don&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t get a PhD but I did spend a couple of years getting a Masters. I didn&#x27;t really use what I specifically researched but, who knows, may have helped me get a couple jobs and I enjoyed the time well enough. Of course, engineering salaries tended to be a lot lower then relative to what many CS people today consider normal so I don&#x27;t think losing out on a couple years salary was a big deal.')
