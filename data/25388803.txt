That&#x27;s a masterful IPO pricing accomplishment, meaning, FB left $0.23 per share on the table.<p>Moreover, the stock traded below the open for 5 quarters before starting it&#x27;s impressive rise. Even with that pause, buying at the open and holding till now would have yielded nearly 27% annualized return.<p>It&#x27;s just my opinion, but ABNB missing by more than 100% ($140 close vs. $68 open) is a major fail on the part of their CFO.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;facebook-stock-price-ipo-6th-anniversary-2018-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;facebook-stock-price-ipo-6th...</a>')
