Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604856174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022905, text='&gt; This assumes party identification and party goals are arbitrary.<p>No, it just assumes (which is true) that people care about different aspects of the party platform. All over the developed world, people on both sides of the aisle want to reduce immigration. Left-leaning parties in Denmark and New Zealand (the beloved Jacinda Ardern) campaigned and won on platforms calling for reduced immigration. Mainstream center-left politicians like Macron have shifted to calling for increased integration.<p>In the U.S., that left has radicalized that debate. Democrats have dismissed all such concerns are racist. The moderate candidate Democrats ran didn&#x27;t push back on any of that or acknowledge there was a legitimate debate to be had over immigration levels. And nearly everyone who ran in the Democratic primary embraced far-left positions such as decriminalizing illegal immigration and universal healthcare for undocumented immigrants--positions only 1-2 EU countries have embraced. (Due to a lack of any pushback on those positions from Biden, it was easier to get those primary positions to stick to him.) Biden wouldn&#x27;t even take the completely mainstream Democratic position of condemning illegal immigration and calling for secure borders, which Obama embraced.<p>At that point, what do you do? A party isn&#x27;t a single person or policy position; its an entire ideology (and the Democratic Party has become increasingly ideological).')
