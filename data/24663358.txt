Samsung getting into the game after SV Web taught them how to do it is making people realize, rather uncomfortably, that this is the world they’ve created now. It’s easy to abstract away commits to a repo when it comes to ethics, but remember, most of you reading this thread are at least complicit in building mass surveillance to make people who aren’t you more wealthy. You either work on it directly or sit at a company that works on it or participates in the ecosystem.<p>That repulsion you feel for Samsung doing this is exactly how the rest of us feel now that your entire vertical is founded on trading my income and breast size and pregnancy status like I’m cattle. How you want microphones in every home in case I say “tuna would be nice” to make tuna magically appear 49 minutes later in a drone delivered package. How you’re perfectly comfortable tracking everything I do <i>until</i> it touches you when you kick back to watch TV. Then oh my God it’s horrible. Fuck your hypocrisy. It’s so transparent as to be hilarious.<p>You can downvote me to silence me but keep in mind I’m just taking the time to tell you the other side. If you’d like to remain in a cushy bubble of “this is okay,” keep it up, but remember that you were warned you’re on the wrong side of engineering history and chose to attack the messenger instead of look inward.')
