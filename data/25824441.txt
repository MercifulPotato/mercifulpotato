They’re so high that some hospitals will give uninsured patients a break of “half off” without even negotiating.<p>The reason for this is that chargemaster price is a fake dollar price resulting from a broken incentive structure and process.  Here’s a setup:<p>A hospital is working out a negotiated rate for aggregate services with an insurance company. The insurance company wants to pay less, and they’re willing to put the hospital “in network” and bring their block of customers with them by doing it.  But the negotiators on both sides aren’t going to sit and figure out the “right” price of every procedure.  That would take forever (and there’s dinner at a Michelin starred restaurant to go to after this deal is done), so they agree that they will just pay some percentage of the chargemaster price, say, 50%.<p>Over time, the hospital administrators say “we need more money for this” and realize they have a lever.  95% of their customers are paying negotiated rates that are a percentage of the chargemaster price. The percentage is locked in stone, but the chargemaster rate?  Yeah. They can change that.<p>The insurance company cries foul at their Michelin two-star dinner the next month, and the hospital agrees to lower the percentage a little in the next contract. Now the insurer is feeling flush, and the hospital is making about what they were doing before from that 95%. The remaining 5% who were uninsured are hanging upside down and getting shaken for loose change.<p>The cycle continues, and, eventually, the negotiated percentage drops to something comical, like 12%, but the chargemaster rates have soared. In the end, a pair of Advil “costs” $68 and uninsured patients have nosebleeds from being hung upside down for so long.<p>But there’s a new restaurant to try out, and someone else’s personal bankruptcy is a small price to pay for no-fuss managed care...<p>(Note: Marketing and administration accounts for more than a third of health care costs in the US, which is to say that health care bloat and weight due to a multi-player adversarial privatized system accounts for more than 5% of our GDP, so the chargemaster isn’t the only reason for sky high healthcare costs in America.)')
