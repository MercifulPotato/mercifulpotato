The entire besieging army took part in that.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>I think there&#x27;s a reasonable case that the Nazi military really did have a special, virtually unique brand of evil.</i>&quot;<p>Nope, I&#x27;d say the Imperial Japanese Army had them beat on that score easily: they spared themselves the need for specialized units by simply having the entire military commit atrocities.  Much larger scale than the Nazis too.')
