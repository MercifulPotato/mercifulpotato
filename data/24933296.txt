I keep a physical notebook that I jot down ideas and draw diagrams in. It&#x27;s sort of my canvas for sketching things out and seeing if I understand the problem and solution I&#x27;m working on.<p>Like you, I have a bunch of old notebooks as well that I only ever flip through for nostalgia. I generally only review my notebooks for design notes if the notes are at most 3-6 months old.')
