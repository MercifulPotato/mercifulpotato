A common misconception is that Slippi = Dolphin; in reality, Slippi is (currently) a fork of an older Dolphin and doesn&#x27;t have the features for macOS that modern Dolphin has (e.g, a Metal&#x2F;MoltenVK graphics backend). OpenGL on macOS is a nightmare - and indeed, if you opened mainline Dolphin right now and tried to play it using OpenGL, it will tell you in bright yellow letters that it&#x27;s going to be bad. :)<p>I backported an earlier version of the Metal&#x2F;MoltenVK backend to Slippi which should hopefully be in the next release, whenever they get around to it. This provides decent performance on Intel Macs and ARM Macs under Rosetta 2, and ideally tides the (mac) community over until Slippi finds parity with mainline Dolphin.')
