We develop with Typescript and React, but our modules can be deployed in any stack.<p>Clerk is still a small company.  You&#x27;ll be joining a team of 5 and working most closely with our lead backend engineer (who is responsible for the apis you&#x27;ll interface with) and our product designer (who is responsible for the user experience and design).<p>We are well-funded by founders and early engineers of Stripe, Segment, PagerDuty, and Facebook, and plan to launch before the end of the year.<p>Please reach out to colin@clerk.dev')
