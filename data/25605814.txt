Nobody notices, and even if they do you will likely not get anything out of it. Do your job, but don&#x27;t kill yourself over it. Work-life balance is king.<p>I think this close, but a little off.  Work hard only on what matters. Join the high visibility projects and work hard on the important parts.  &quot;Nobody notices&quot; -&gt; that&#x27;s up to you.  Document and demo your achievements every few weeks.<p>Work only the good jobs. If it&#x27;s not good, switch teams ASAP. Never, ever wait for &quot;things to improve&quot;. So many times after I switched jobs, I said to myself &quot;Man, why didn&#x27;t I leave sooner?&quot;')
