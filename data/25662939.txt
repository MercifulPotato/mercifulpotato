It&#x27;s all trash pop-history talking heads, semi-trash documentaries and low brow entertainment related to cars and guns (e.g. demo ranch and whistlin diesel).<p>I recently (like yesterday) watched a semi-political talking head discuss the economics of OnlyFans after a friend linked to that particular person&#x27;s analysis so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see if the algo tries to drag my content toward more talking heads.')
