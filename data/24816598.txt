Item(by='auganov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603013741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24816189, text='&gt; I am generally a very privacy-minded person, but serious question here: is there any legitimate use case for financial privacy from the authorities? I don’t mean “ideologically, I am upset that the government can see I buy too many pastries”.<p>And the vast majority of people have very little to gain from all other kinds of privacy. The government wouldn&#x27;t find anything interesting in my IM messages either.<p>Most people who really need it are probably up to no good too.<p>I&#x27;m on both sides of this debate. I think most privacy issues are overblown by a small set of zealots. But at the same time I don&#x27;t see much difference between financial privacy and whichever other kind.')
