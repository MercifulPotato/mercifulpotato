It&#x27;s nowadays pretty common for microcontrollers that are meant for industrial and automotive use to have a separate supply for the I&#x2F;O ports, that can go up to 5V, independent from the core&#x2F;peripheral voltage.<p>The main use is to drive (logic-level) MOSFETs directly, interface to 5V buses like SENT, CAN, etc. without having to use level shifters.')
