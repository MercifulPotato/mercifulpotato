Keep in mind, an audio cable is not included in the box, so maybe Apple is sending a signal to use it wirelessly.<p>Also, he doesn&#x27;t think this device needs an off switch. This means you get to carry around the case just to put your device in standby. The case is an elaborate off button since it doesn&#x27;t offer much protection.')
