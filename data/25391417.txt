Item(by='manuelabeledo', descendants=None, kids=[25391850], score=None, time=1607722808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390354, text='&gt; So my point is, what is the point of that comment?<p>I&#x27;m going to take a guess and say that, given the facts, there are reasonable doubts about Apple&#x27;s offering, compared to other products. Mainly two: noise cancelling is not on par with Bose and Sony, as stated by early reviewers, and the lack of high quality codecs.<p>Functionality-wise then, they may be overpriced.<p>And I would be the first to admit that I like the overall design. I&#x27;m an Apple user myself. But I&#x27;m skeptical that Apple has achieved the technical proficiency to make some reasonably good sounding, wireless, ANC cans, that compete with either Bose or Sony.<p>I see this more as a luxury product or a status symbol, like Bang &amp; Olufsen.<p>&gt; Good sound is something some people care about and will pay for.<p>The people willing to pay +$500 for a pair of headphones would be even more skeptical than me, I presume.')
