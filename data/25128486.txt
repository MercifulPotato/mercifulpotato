Or even a high school&#x27;r with algebra under their belt. And then this happens...<p>&gt; “...you can’t put space (which is a measurement of distance) and time (which is a measurement of, well, time) on the same footing...”<p>...two parentheticals followed by dippy do metaphor &#x27;footing?&#x27; Feet? I’m only half kidding. The article&#x27;s first 50% starts in the best of ways, ‘shortest distance between two points’. After ‘feet’ it’s all down hill--<p>&gt; “the faster you move through space, the slower you move through time.”<p>Well. Of course. Every school child knows this is true. When the kickball is heading for your face, time stands still. But slow down a minute, walk me through this as carefully as you did for the two-points...<p>&gt; &quot;But as you approach the speed of light&quot;<p>Never going to happen<p>&gt; &quot;— or rather, ..where the relative speed between you and it is close to the speed of light — you’ll observe that it’s contracted along its direction of relative motion...&quot;<p>It relative that it and it&#x27;s--WHat? There was distance between two points and now I have &#x27;relative speed&#x27;. What the heck is that that I should be able to call it an it so quick??<p>I could go on, but my point--Why, once the subject becomes actually difficult to understand, does the author&#x27;s explanation becomes worse? More parenthetical. It and that. And tries to put me in a position to imagine moving at the speed of light or a clock &quot;defined by light bouncing back and forth between two mirrors&quot;. Huh. What?<p>Great start. Poor finish. Maybe if you thought less about name dropping Einstein, I could appreciate what is relative speed between two anything. I agree, this curious piece of math and science could use some popular updating.<p>&#x2F;END RANT')
