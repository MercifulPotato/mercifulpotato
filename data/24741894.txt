I bought thousands, of different types, on other services and I only ever had to send back two and that due to the fact the seller sent a wrong item.<p>I always do at least a very quick research regarding the seller and the item so that probably helps.<p>But the 30% I can understand is due to people who never intend to buy the product or buy a bunch of them to send some back.<p>I can sort of understand it in some of the categories (for example clothes) but I also see a lot of people proclaiming how smart they are because they surf on the wave of products they never pay for.')
