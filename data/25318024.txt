And then of course the stupidity in using it: just because a high-end CPU can do math on 512 bit integers within some 10-20 cycles shouldn&#x27;t mean that after a recompile all the chrono code is suddenly a huge register stomping inefficient mess, for no good fucking reason at all.<p>And on the other end of the spectrum, someone might well decide 16 bit is the intmax for an AVR8. Now your chrono code doesn&#x27;t work at all.')
