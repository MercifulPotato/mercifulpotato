The dominant desktop is Windows; even macOS has several times the mind&#x2F;market share that Linux has.<p>This is pretty much the &quot;Emacs modernization&quot; debate for the desktop as a whole. There is a growing contingent of Emacs users who saw their chosen editor get its lunch eaten by Visual Studio Code, and now wish it was a bit more modern and a bit less... well, less Emacs. Similarly, Wayland was pushed by a large contingent of users who want to see the Linux desktop resemble a successful desktop used by millions to get their work done.<p>Back when GUIs were brand new and the Unix community was populated by neckbeards, creativity and experimentation in the desktop space was a good thing. Today, those neckbeards have grown older. Time for them is shorter. So even they don&#x27;t want to experiment anymore; like everybody else <i>they just want to get their fucking work done</i>. Millions of people have gotten work done with the successful model of Windows and Mac, and Linux users want their desktop to resemble the most successful desktops of all time -- not something that is a large pile of hack upon hack with seams constantly showing.<p>Pushing back against the direction the ecosystem is going will only breed resentment and ill will, because you are committing time and brainpower to a dead end when you could have committed it to making Wayland better.')
