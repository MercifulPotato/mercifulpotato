Accounts being banned because of hate-speech, threatening violence, or glorification of terrorist acts is nothing new and shouldn&#x27;t surprise anybody here.<p>That being said, Trump&#x27;s Twitter account, contrary to other peoples accounts, enjoyed special privileges and protection only because he was (currently still is) the president if the USA.<p>After the riots which were started at his rally, him not only refusing to condemn the violence but actually endorsing it, and the Capitol Police&#x27;s stranfe way of handling the situation, he lost this privilege.<p>On a personal note I&#x27;d like to add, that Trump pardoning war criminals and protecting disproportional police violence reminded me of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise when he surrounded himself with dishonorably discharged military and police before he grabbed absolute power in Germany.<p>I believe USA ditched a bullet here. Without his catastrophic COVID-19 response he might have been re-elected and behaved more unhinged than he already did in his second term.')
