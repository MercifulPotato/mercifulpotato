Need to get somewhere inside Copenhagen? Just take the S trains from the train station until you reach one of the smaller stops, get on a bus, walk a few hundred metres, and get on the metro, and then change to another bus.<p>As you say, getting to Copenhagen is easy. Getting around between two points not connected by the same types of public transport? It&#x27;s a time-consuming nightmare. It&#x27;s a good thing down-town Copenhagen is a good city for biking, or it would be a total traffic disaster.')
