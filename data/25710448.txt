Trump is basically always sincere. Even when he contradicts himself in a matter of minutes. He is a master bullshitter who grew up going to Normal Vincent Peale&#x27;s church. His entire life is built on the idea that it&#x27;s all a stage, all a game. The RESULT of that is: he&#x27;s extremely practiced at coming up with stories and <i>convincing himself</i>. In other words, self-deception. He knows he&#x27;s bullshitting, but he doesn&#x27;t think a reality beyond bullshitting <i>exists</i>. He believes what he says all the time. That&#x27;s why he doesn&#x27;t give the normal tells that indicate shifty lying and deception. Unlike the other politicians who are obviously being calculating and withholding their real thoughts, Trump is transparent. He&#x27;s saying exactly what he actually thinks, and even when it is complete oxymoronic, he experiences no cognitive dissonance. He&#x27;s not really lying in the normal sense, he&#x27;s delusional.<p>Check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;radiolab&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;91612-deception" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wnycstudios.org&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;radiolab&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;91612...</a><p>Trump is the ultimate self-deceiver. That&#x27;s why his followers find him so appealing. He&#x27;s authentic in that you can tell he really does say what he thinks and doesn&#x27;t hold back. It&#x27;s just that his mind is so constantly focused on whatever will get people to like him and otherwise what serves his interest, the <i>content</i> of his beliefs is similar to what it would be if he were consciously being deceptive. But if he were <i>concerned</i> about his stories being consistent and believable in <i>content</i>, he&#x27;d get all nervous and <i>seem</i> more like a liar. He&#x27;s able to talk with <i>sincerity</i> because he doesn&#x27;t <i>care</i> if his stories make sense, even as bullshit <i>he</i> still believes them for himself, at least enough to say the things in <i>earnest</i>.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t really know, but this would explain part of how it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> for so many people to have still seen him as honest despite the plainly factually wrong things that come out of him.')
