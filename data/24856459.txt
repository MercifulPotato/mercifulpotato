I asked her about translating books: &quot;Knowing two cultures and languages in such intimate detail that you can know a book and translate it in any meaningful way for the princely sum of ten thousand pounds...no&quot;.<p>She compared it to poetry, you agonise over certain phrases and the thousands of years of history that phrase has and all its cultural meaning and all you&#x27;ve got is &quot;he bonked him on the head&quot;.<p>She conceded that any translation was better than none as there are ideas out there, hidden, that need to spread and are limited only by language and time.')
