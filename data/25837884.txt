For eg, I maintain an &quot;awesome-copyfarleft&quot; list: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LibreCybernetics&#x2F;awesome-copyfarleft" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LibreCybernetics&#x2F;awesome-copyfarleft</a><p>&gt; changing from an open-source to a non-open-source license is a significant change which, when done without the consent of the community, is wrong.<p>I don&#x27;t think consensus is possible and even a 2&#x2F;3 supermajority on a license change seems out of reach. I can imagine some are pushing for permissive licenses like MIT&#x2F;BSD, others for GPL&#x2F;AGPL, others to remain as Apache 2.0, etc.')
