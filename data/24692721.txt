I might occasionally drop a tidbit of advice about how I could be used more effectively, but ultimately that&#x27;s not my decision.  Just because I perceive it to be wasteful doesn&#x27;t mean it is to the person signing the checks.<p>Regarding long term investment.  For most people at most companies long term (more than 2-3 years) investment means moving to a better job somewhere else.  Investing in your future is figuring out how to get the next job, not maximizing one aspect of your current job that your employer  doesn&#x27;t even seem concerned about.')
