Nobody can connect right now, and their status site says &quot;100% uptime in the last quarter&quot;.  Maybe it&#x27;s close to 100%, but it ain&#x27;t 100%.<p>I think we should push for a metric where &quot;up&quot; means 100% of people that want to use the service are able to use the service.  If 1% of users can&#x27;t send messages, then that should count as a full-blown outage and should start counting against whatever SLA they advertise.<p>The underlying problem here is that apparently everyone lies about uptime, so if you don&#x27;t, that looks bad to potential customers.  I fear that we will have to push for some legal regulation if we want accurate data, and ... people will probably be opposed to that.')
