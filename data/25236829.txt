I also tell myself it&#x27;s not just OK to end it but it&#x27;s one day my duty to do it &quot;on my terms&quot; (if it is in my control to make that choice ofc).<p>it sounds morbid because it is. but only facing my reality like an alcoholic faces that they&#x27;ll be an addict for life, regardless if they don&#x27;t drink for 20 years - is why not only am I still here but am able to life an incredibly full life.<p>If I weren&#x27;t suicidal then _I know_  that it would make me more ignorant to the suffering of others. I&#x27;d rather be dead than go through life like that. life without death is meaningless and we should cherish it the same way as we celebrate being born.<p>edit: The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker, perfectly articulates how messed up our relationship with death&#x2F;disease&#x2F;dying has become in modern society.')
