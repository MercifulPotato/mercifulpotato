There is an AccessRights bit that can be loaded with the enrollment profile to allow or disallow certain actions. Certainly the protocol can be ab&#x2F;used to silently install other software: endpoint detection tooling, scripts, etc. and to suppress protections normally built-in to the OS that would normally gate background usage of apps that crawl certain file paths, etc. So on it&#x27;s own, no issues.
