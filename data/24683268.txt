If the whole world ends tomorrow I can still have a radio based transmission network and a private WLAN composed of HAM radio. Or at least that’s what it is in theory for people.<p>Its not my thing but I think it’s pretty cool to imagine a large plot of land with several cabins that house relay servers for content. Then you can camp on different locations on your property and listen to music anywhere with the right antenna. Maybe video if you use the right band? There’s a lot of unutilized potential here and in the U.S. you can do a lot with a HAM license.')
