Which many enterprises aren&#x27;t willing to do. Also, while you may be authorised to use AWS tech you may not be automatically authorised to use different tech. We literally were told to use MySQL instead of MongoDB soley because RDS was allowed and all services had to be managed by AWS.<p>I am not complaining AWS is doing vendor lock in makes complete sense, I am just commenting that is their main direction for their offering. And their vendor lock is aimed at the enterprises where they can really run wild on it and get lots of money in return. Smaller orginisations will generally never lock themselves in so much because they won&#x27;t build so many things that are so hard coupled since they just don&#x27;t have the manpower.')
