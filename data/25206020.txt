I don&#x27;t think they lie, so much as 100% is actually at 40%.<p>2) Windows installation.\nCopying Windows files jumps straight to 100%, Expanding Windows files is the only one that provides meaningful indication, installing features and installing updates happen instantly.<p>Then, it goes into a period of indeterminate loading spinner after a reboot.<p>These days, where possible (i.e. on VM, or if I&#x27;m in the OS already) I just use iStat menus or other monitoring software to check if things are using the processor by checking the CPU usage, CPU power consumption, disk read&#x2F;write, and network activity. If something&#x27;s happening, I let it sit. If not, the process needs to be restarted.')
