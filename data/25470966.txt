Glitches are so commonplace it’s clearly beta quality at best.<p>I’ve gotten to the point where I know to have the best chance to actually play a mission I need to get to the right location (use waypoints since driving crashes the game), find the NPC for the mission, open dialogue and start a mission, ensure the mission has started (usually when the monologue starts from the NPC), close the game, reopen the game, and start playing the mission. After a mission, expect a crash.<p>It got old really fast having the game crash during a mission and being forced to play the same mission over and over even if it did help me find better loot.')
