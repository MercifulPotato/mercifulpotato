The bike lane turned into a 30 foot deep sinkhole with a couple cones marking the hazard.  By the time I noticed, there was a long flatbed truck in the lane next to me.  I merged over and had what felt like an inch of space to ride in -- 30 foot drop to my death to the right, big unaware truck to the left.  The truck moved over to the right for no good reason and the tires rubbed off most of the skin on my left arm.  One more inch and my username would be talking_panckake.  (Just kidding, I&#x27;d be dead!)<p>Another time I was riding on First Avenue.  First Avenue has one of those bike lanes that&#x27;s next to the sidewalk, and parked cars separate you from traffic.  Some idiot, and I don&#x27;t use that term lightly, decided to walk their bike off the sidewalk right in front of me, and position it at a right angle to the traffic flow.  I was going too fast to stop that quickly and plowed right into the bike.  (The rider noticed me and jumped back onto the sidewalk, saving himself from any injury.)  My main memory was flying through the air and seeing my bike flying right next to me.  I landed on my arm like an idiot and my right shoulder popped out.  I popped it back in and rode 40 more miles that day... but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  I now have the ability to dislocate my right shoulder on demand!<p>I don&#x27;t think those two events were what killed bike commuting for me, but I was pretty shy for a few months after each of those incidents.  What killed it for me was the constant close calls that don&#x27;t really make good stories (and a lack of shower facilities at my most recent workplace).  I still bike early in the morning.  Very few idiots out and I can go fast for a couple hours and then take the subway to work.<p>But yeah.  I consider myself a seasoned cycling veteran, and in the last 3 or 4 years it just got to be too much for me.  I moved to New York City in 2012, and honestly, things were great back then.  But over the years, the city just got more and more crowded with cars, and there is no room for bicyclists anymore.  (When I visit places like Montreal, I feel great.  I think it&#x27;s just a NYC thing.)')
