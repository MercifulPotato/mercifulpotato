Pardon my French.  Install YaCy and tell me how you like it.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t matter anyway, because decentralization doesn&#x27;t really solve privacy any better than centralized search, besides the fact that it could theoretically provide more choices.<p>No matter what you use, privacy ultimately depends on trust.  The reason that I have more trust for DDG than I do Google is, unlike Google, its primary audience is privacy-minded folks.  If it came out that DDG was tracking users and selling that data, DDG would be immediately done as a brand.  They at least have some incentive to do what they say.  Decentralization provides no such benefit because a search &quot;node&quot; is unlikely to have any sort of meaningful brand to keep up.<p>&gt; And with DuckDuckGo&#x27;s misleading marketing, I feel that this point is lost on significant chunks of its userbase.<p>How is it misleading?  My understanding from their marketing is that they don&#x27;t create profiles of their users based on searches.  Until we have evidence to the contrary, it&#x27;s not outrageous to assume they are being truthful.')
