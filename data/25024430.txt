Failing that, it&#x27;s the closest thing to either - trypophobia triggering things, suggestive and sexy ads, miracle cures. Clickbait often has things that people would click without thinking, but upon entering the page, realize they&#x27;ve been scammed.<p>Game ads seem to be struck worst by this. They show gameplay that does not reflect the game, or some cringy bad playing, implying that 80% will fail to reach the next level.<p>There&#x27;s also things like user tolerance for login walls or notifications, which only detect the fail&#x2F;uninstall point or the amount of income from those alerts, not the fatigue from getting 5 unnecessary notifications a day which leads to someone uninstalling the app a month later.')
