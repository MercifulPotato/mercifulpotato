Unreal mode is kind of an &quot;accidental&quot; mode that was not created intentionally by Intel. Intel&#x27;s idea was that the processor would start in the backwards-compatible real mode, and if you switched to protected mode you would never look back.<p>But real mode was implemented on top of logic designed for protected mode, because that is a simpler way to do things (think of it like protected mode, but you&#x27;re not protecting anything).<p>So you go into protected mode, mess with things, switch back to real mode (all unintended by Intel) and you&#x27;re in “unreal mode”.<p>&gt; Why did developers tolerate this mess?<p>The hardware was cheap, performance was decent, and there were plenty of customers.')
