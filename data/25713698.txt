You can also just tap or lift bricks 1k, 10k times per day and be fine.<p>However it won&#x27;t end well if you use bad form, try to go max on day 1 (didn&#x27;t build up), or try to break 1k bricks&#x2F;day, every day¹.<p>Stupid running can be 1k-10k impacts per day with bad form (twisted joints), high stress (stomping on concrete), low regeneration (cartilage needs squishing for nutrients) - use it like this and you will lose it blazing fast.<p>¹ I kind of guess.')
