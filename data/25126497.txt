That&#x27;s the standard way under the SI system to separate digit groups, e.g., 1 234 567. HN just treats it as a regular space.<p>(The SI standard for separating the integer part from the fractional part is to use &quot;.&quot; or &quot;,&quot;, whichever is customary in your location. Using thin space for grouping removes the ambiguity that you get in places that use one of &quot;.&quot;&#x2F;&quot;,&quot; for grouping and the other for a decimal point).')
