Item(by='joshschreuder', descendants=None, kids=[24946814, 24947843], score=None, time=1604090906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946592, text='+1 for Thimbleweed Park, though I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a 7 year old.<p>But Tim Schaeffer&#x27;s studio Double Fine did Broken Age which I think would be great for a younger audience. Otherwise a lot of those games mentioned have been remastered in recent times, like Grim Fandango adding a non-tank control scheme or Full Throttle.')
