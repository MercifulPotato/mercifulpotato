Item(by='behnamoh', descendants=1, kids=[25723365], score=3, time=1610330081, title='Ask HN: What do you do to make you feel alive in a stressful job?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I find myself under so much pressure that I cannot control. Yet, historically I&#x27;ve always performed much worse when I was actually expected to be more productive. I think the reason for that is I feel like I&#x27;m losing control of many things in life and I just don&#x27;t feel alive if I were to do my job 24&#x2F;7 (and don&#x27;t get me wrong: I like my job, just not this much work load). I&#x27;ve thought about starting a side project, but given my result-oriented personality, I guess that&#x27;ll not fulfill me as I&#x27;ll always try to monetize the side project anyway. Plus, setting time aside for another project when I already am under stress of finishing my current job does not make sense at the moment.<p>I was wondering, can anyone give me suggestions or personal stories about how to feel alive and in control, when everything around you pushes you to the edge and constant anxiety is about to break you from inside?')
