Lower your requirements if necessary, and train your new employees on the job. Groom them, mentor them, teach them the technologies they need to know.</i><p>I think it&#x27;s great if a company&#x27;s willing to do that, but if they have the financial ability to pay employees to grow into the employees they need, they also have the financial ability to just pay higher salaries in the first place.<p>That is, this rule doesn&#x27;t hurt big employers, who can both pay big salaries to qualified candidates (of any citizenship - and often can pay big salaries to qualified candidates <i>by setting up an office in their country</i> if it&#x27;s hard enough to hire in this one) and invest in training up workers, but it does hurt smaller ones. Smaller companies, by their nature, have less funding to invest in long-term gains - they need to ship quickly if they don&#x27;t want to go out of business.<p>Now, there may well be good reasons to conclude that that big entrenched employers are good for society and startups should face an uphill battle competing on talent, but let&#x27;s not pretend this doesn&#x27;t hurt small companies.')
