They likely had 2 options:<p>1) Shut down the entire platform until they could raise enough additional capital to post the required collateral. It&#x27;s difficult to retain users and raise another round if you literally have to turn your service off on the hottest trading day every.<p>2) Shut down buy orders on the few stocks that were driving the capital requirements over the limit, at least allowing users to continue to sell.<p>Frankly, I think the narrative that Robinhood users are driving this situation has been greatly exaggerated. A few weeks or months from now, I think we&#x27;ll learn that the majority of volume came from institutional investors rather than retail users. Redditors may have sparked the situation, but hedge funds are certainly capitalizing on it.')
