I worked on a java project at a previous job and Bazel was instrumental in getting fast deterministic builds. There were some growing pains as the bazel docs weren&#x27;t great back then (this was before bazel reached 1.0), but once we got things to work it was nice to work with. We were able to leverage Bazel for our Angular application as well so it was nice to have everything building with one tool.<p>&gt; A big part of the reason is that tools suck as Buck (which, like Bazel, uses Skylark as the language, which is a very limited python in essence) avoid the general programming patterns to avoid the issues described here.<p>I also agree with this. My current language of choice is OCaml and the most popular build tool is dune [1], which uses an s-expression based configuration language, and its nice to have a more restrictive DSL that avoids some pitfalls of using a full blown programming language for configuring builds.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dune.build&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dune.build&#x2F;</a>')
