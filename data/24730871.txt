Think you&#x27;re the smartest person on the planet, unaffected by misinformation? &quot;Feed me the libraries worth of bullshit from the Internet, and I will sort through this free market firehose to come to a logical, evidence based conclusion&quot;, hm?<p>Have you ever read spam ads on Craigslist, fake comments on news sites, bots on Tinder, etc? There are patterns, there are foul motives, and with their internal data, there is certainly technical stats to identify related accounts participating in bad faith campaigns.<p>I understand the gut feeling to be suspicious of any large org to filter information. People on this very thread are screaming &quot;censorship!&quot; as if they were Orwell in the streets warning us the end is nigh.<p>However, if you look at Twitter or Facebook on any given day, you can see that a lot of bullshit, emanating from every possible angle of the political spectrum, still exists. Much of it organic, much of it bots, I&#x27;m sure. Let&#x27;s stop hitting the panic button every time they remove Iranian bot networks.')
