Model is there to represent an aspect or aspects of a real system (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conceptual_model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conceptual_model</a>). An object called &quot;Employee&quot; is a &quot;model&quot;, a representation of certain aspect of an actual employee.<p>Object oriented programming is about using objects -- models (representations of aspects) of actual systems, actors, objects, etc. In OOP you build the model from operations that define the object. The fields are not part of the interface, the operations are. That&#x27;s why everybody says to make fields public (but for some reason not everybody remembers why).<p>So a method call fire() on an object Employee is more &quot;object oriented&quot; than having HREmployeeService.fireEmployee(employeeId) to set field employedTo directly on EmployeeDAO.')
