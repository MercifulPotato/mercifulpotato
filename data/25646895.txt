There is a great deal of work being done on applying the speedup afforded by quantum mechanics to classically hard problems.<p>The current consensus (at least among people I speak to) is that a quantum computer will probably be able to solve some problems which are in NP (and not in P), but will probably not be able to solve an NP-hard problem.<p>Your intuitive view is appealing, but I don&#x27;t think one should get too hung up on intuition. Our intuition was honed for millions of years to avoid large wild animals and avoid falling out of trees in prehistoric Africa. It generally sucks pretty badly at making guesses about the fundamental nature of the universe (or at least mine does).<p>Edit: by the way a faster than light communication &quot;ansible&quot; is functionally equivalent to a machine that sends messages back in time. I disagree with your view that such a machine is more plausible than the view that some ftl stuff happens on the &quot;backend&quot; but is hidden from the &quot;frontend&quot;. Having said that my view is that there is no ftl stuff on the back or front end, this is consistent with something like the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is entirely local and causal (no ftl stuff).')
