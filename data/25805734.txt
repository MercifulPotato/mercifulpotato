I was able to spend a few days in the north.  I can only say the north of Pakistan is incredible.  There’s nothing that prepares you for seeing 8000+ meter mountains for the first time.<p>There’s no shortage of people offering tours, but I made my own plans.  I rented a Toyota Hilux 4x4 for 4 days at $50&#x2F;day, and they insisted I hire a driver because they didn’t trust me to drive solo (which in retrospect was wise of them because of language barriers, road conditions, police&#x2F;military checkpoints, etc.). The driver quoted me a rate of $3&#x2F;day (not a typo).  I drove from Islamabad to Hunza and back in 3 days (I could only get one day off work, lol).  It was way too much driving, but the trip was still incredible.<p>To make the trip extra fun, I had the worst case of food poisoning w&#x2F; diarrhea that I’ve ever had for the entire time.  I developed that the night before I was scheduled to drive off.  So in the morning I picked up some Imodium and baby wipes, and just stopped every hour or two.  I somehow managed to avoid shitting in my pants, but I don’t know how.  Nearly every bathroom in Pakistan, which might just be a hole in the ground, has a handheld bidet, which is a power washer for your backside.  No matter how messy it got, I also walked away from a pit stop with a fresh backside.<p>Here’s some pictures of the traveling, sans pit stops...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;tZ3scbSFbPbxQCpG7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;tZ3scbSFbPbxQCpG7</a>')
