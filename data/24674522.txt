None of the TVs with the best picture quality are dumb.  It&#x27;s a shame, but its the truth.<p>so it really depends what you want, but if getting the best bang for the buck picture quality (highest nits, highest contrast, best color accuracy in SDR and HDR), you are going to be limited to smart TVs.  If all you care about is 1080p in SDR, you can get a dumb TV that is competitive, but once in the 4k&#x2F;HDR world they just don&#x27;t exist.  you&#x27;re limited to samsung, lg, sony, panasonic at the top end, and even good bang for buck manufacturers like tcl, hisense and vizio are all just shipping smart features on their highest PQ TVs.')
