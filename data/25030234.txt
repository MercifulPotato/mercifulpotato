Item(by='mcswell', descendants=None, kids=[25030387], score=None, time=1604880105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25019348, text='&quot;What is the ROI of...a well designed logo?&quot;  For me (a consumer), absolutely zero.  What do I care what some company&#x27;s logo is?  I don&#x27;t, and I also doubt that I recognize most of them.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;ve seen the images of fake pennys, like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;technicallyeclectic.com&#x2F;video-best-practices-details-matter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;technicallyeclectic.com&#x2F;video-best-practices-details...</a>.  If so, you know what I mean; you could show me a hundred logos, and I couldn&#x27;t tell you which ones are real, much less which of those real ones belong to which company.<p>And yet many companies spend an inordinate amount of time trying to decide what the best logo is, and then a few years later they decide to &quot;refresh&quot; it, or &quot;clean it up&quot;, or &quot;give it a facelift.&quot;  To which I say, waste of time.')
