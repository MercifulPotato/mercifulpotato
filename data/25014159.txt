United States was 5-4, with Ginsburg in the majority.  The textualists stacked up firmly against it.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect any help from SCOTUS for the next... ever.<p>The textualist theory on privacy is basically: &quot;no trespass, no problem&quot;.  The trespass theory of privacy is why Scalia was in the majority on United States v. Jones (cant attach a GPS tracker to a car without a warrant) and  Kyllo v. United States (cant invade the house with an IR camera without a warrant).  The lack of a physical trespass explains why his intellectual bedfellows dissented in Carpenter.')
