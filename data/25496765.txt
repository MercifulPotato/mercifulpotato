People here also assume that just because Apple is a giant they must be trying to exploit. Just because it hurts our sensibilities doesn&#x27;t make it apple&#x27;s problem. This could very well be the country&#x27;s issues with labor and how they deal with it. We should at least be glad that they are rioting and causing a ruckus. If this were China they would be suppressed a long time ago.')
