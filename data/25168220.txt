The company was not on the market at that time. The first handful of machines reached the market in late 1981 and they literally were the first of its kind. They were also mostly the same systems that MIT developed, sold as LM-2. Almost no GUI based machines of any kind were commercially (!) available at that time. Just about 80 (eighty) of those LM-2 were ever built and sold between 81 and 83. The first actual Symbolics machine reached the market in about 1983, the Symbolics 3600.<p>SUN did not sell anything in 1980&#x2F;81. The SUN 1 came to the market in mid&#x2F;late 1982 as a 68k machine with a SUN memory management unit.<p>Basically in 1980&#x2F;1981 there were no UNIX system with a GUI on the market (i.e. commercially available) at all.<p>&gt; including their rather clunky object system.<p>Common Lisp&#x27;s object system was developed many years later. The first spec was published in 88.<p>Franz LISP used the same object system as Symbolics. It shipped with an object system called Flavors.<p>Flavors in the Franz LISP sources: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omasanori&#x2F;franz-lisp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lisplib&#x2F;flavors.l" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omasanori&#x2F;franz-lisp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lisplib&#x2F;...</a>')
