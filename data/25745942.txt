That&#x27;s not so. Just read or watch any introduction on hashes: the most basic principle is that even with a huge cluster of top-of-the line hardware, it would take billions of years to guess a password of a decent length. When hash algorithms are ‘broken’, like with md5 and sha1, it&#x27;s because newly found weaknesses bring down their strength by a factor of billions.<p>Secondly, you seem to conjecture that attempting password guesses against a network service would somehow bring that difficulty down considerably, to reachable levels. However: local hash guesses are made on GPUs or specialized FPGAs, whereas servers run on regular multi-purpose CPUs—plus, if you had a server respond to login attempts nonstop, it would spend half of the time in context switches and kernel calls. Top http frameworks in pure C reach just over a million responses per second when <i>doing nothing</i> but sending empty responses. You&#x27;re asking that Steam dedicate a fleet of thousands of servers to facilitate cracking your password. And <i>on top of that</i>, the service would also need a database that likewise serves billions of requests a second.<p><i>Additionally</i>, modern hash algorithms like bcrypt are constructed so that they take considerable and configurable time (on any hardware), so the hashing rates are on the order of tens of thousands a second or less, instead of billions and trillions. Since Steam are evidently very concerned with account security, I&#x27;d guess they take advantage of these algorithms—and since you changed the password recently, it was probably hashed with the latest used algorithm.<p><i>Besides</i> all of the above, a service easily foils password guesses by limiting the number of attempts against an account in a time span, which is by now one of the basic prescribed measures. The whole purpose of ‘password spraying’ is to sidestep this limitation by attacking a lot of users but using most common passwords. In no way does it help with guessing a single long random password.<p>Lastly, while it&#x27;s conceivable that Steam could have some vulnerabilities that would make cracking its accounts easier, those wouldn&#x27;t be burned by attacking the same accounts over and over for months.<p>To sum up: the whole magnitude of the task is such that no one would solve it just to steal your trinkets, even if they could. It&#x27;s time to accept that either your passwords are easily guessable, or are lifted from you in some way.')
