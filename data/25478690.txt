Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608396584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478404, text='Maybe, assuming it&#x27;s all committed in one shot (rather than, say, a couple lines per review) and the reviewer scrolls through and glances at every chunk of code. It&#x27;s some 4000 lines of code, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if at least one of those wasn&#x27;t the case. (And all of this is assuming the reviewer was a typical one... if they were particularly known to be careless or compromised, then you don&#x27;t need these either.)<p>P.S. Oh, one more thing: some workflows don&#x27;t mandate a second review after the code is amended, so the initial code could be benign. And many don&#x27;t require the merger to be the reviewer either. So this could&#x27;ve gotten in that way too.')
