Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611752808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926228, text='No, and it&#x27;s strange to keep seeing this false narrative on HN.<p>In fact:<p>- China&#x27;s GDP is largely based on real estate inflation that is decoupled from other economic progress. The &quot;lifting of the population out of poverty&quot; was a political leadership target, not actually achieved.<p>- several Chinese banks have failed in the past 2 years<p>- BRI is funded by fraudulent accounting on Wall Street<p>- China has no blue-water military capability. Many of their Army weapons were never tested, thanks to bribes. (One commander received a medal for actually testing armored, vehicles and rejecting them. That was considered &quot;novel.&quot;)<p>- China relies on espionage globally to maintain progress. ie. 1000 Talents program. Rumor is that US society is so riddled with spies that Biden wants to announce an amnesty in case they&#x27;re leftists&#x2F;Democrats.<p>- had Trump been re-elected, China would have had a US  dollar crunch (that&#x27;s what ultimately killed the USSR.)<p>Every time Trump made a speech in 2020, the CCP had an emergency meeting to deal with the fallout - that tells you who was in charge.<p>- Before the pandemic and natural disasters of 2020, China imported 30% of its food. In 2021, it&#x27;s close to double that.<p>- Xi&#x27;s family lives in Canada and Australia - not China, because even he can&#x27;t protect them from the CCP. Let that sink in for a minute.<p>Despite the US leftist Marxist narrative to tear down US society and remake it in their own navel-gazing image, the US is the most powerful nation in the history of the world.')
