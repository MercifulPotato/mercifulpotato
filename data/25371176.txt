Think about it logically. What scientist can publish a paper that says that genes don&#x27;t predispose anyone to cancer or smoking because he just observed smoking correlates with tar?<p>You literally say smoking must cause tar because it&#x27;s the only possibility in your two hypothesis... one must occur. Sure if this was math and you defined your universe to be one of two possibilities... but no person in the real world will take that seriously.<p>In math you don&#x27;t introduce ad-hoc axioms and rules to your formal analysis, but the scientific method exists because all observation in the real universe is ad-hoc. Anything goes and that&#x27;s why the best way to make sense of it is through correlation.<p>Which brings me full circle back to my original method. Can you introduce any &quot;adhoc hypothesis&quot; to render a causation established by directly controlling the causative event invalid? You can&#x27;t. Therefore the actual formal scientific way to determining causation is by placing yourself in the system.<p>The only way the graph method can be applied to the real world is if you map out every possible scenario and assumption into that graph. Then you can say based off of what we know and assume A must cause B. But more often then not a scientist is likely just establishing some correlations and coming to a qualitative conclusion that takes into account all the assumptions and hypothesis that we&#x27;re aware about in the real world.')
