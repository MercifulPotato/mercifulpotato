Item(by='dcolkitt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606763452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257398, text='&gt; Marriage does not mean both couples will be working.<p>That&#x27;s true. But a full-time homemaker usually generates economic value that saves money in a long litany of ways. Staying home with kids saves on childcare. Being able to cook meals saves on eating out. Laundry and cleaning saves money on housekeeping costs. Not to mention all of this labor is accumulated tax-free (i.e. if you work to pay for some expense, you have to pay tax on the income first.)<p>&gt; Conversely, you don&#x27;t need to be married to be in a relationship with two incomes.<p>You absolutely don&#x27;t. But the statistics are unambigious. Unmarried couples are substantially more likely to split than married ones. The dissolution of a household tends to be an expensive affair that permanently impedes wealth accumulation.<p>Not to mention that because of this, unmarried couples are substantially less likely to join their finances. Therefore they tend to get significantly worse deals than couples with joined finances. For example two-incomes who jointly sign a mortgage can get a much better APR, than when the mortgage is in one person&#x27;s name.')
