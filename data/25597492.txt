I&#x27;m not that stupid.</i><p>You might not say it directly, but if you&#x27;re trying to convince them, for example, not to celebrate New Year&#x27;s or not to go to Disney World, you&#x27;re going to have to say things that amount to telling them that their beliefs are lies. If they were open to any gentler kind of persuasion, you would already have succeeded in talking them out of it. Even if they don&#x27;t consciously realize that you&#x27;re telling them their beliefs are lies, subconsciously they will. At least, that&#x27;s been my experience in situations of this kind.')
