A flat sales tax rate for carbon will inevitably under-tax or over-tax something. Making it fairer will require armies of accountants poring over the carbon intensity of product categories. And of course companies will say &quot;our factories&#x2F;trucks&#x2F;warehouses&#x2F;stores run on wind power, give us a rebate&quot;. I understand the appeal of tacking a carbon tax on to an existing tax regime, but would it really be so easy or fair?<p>PS I&#x27;ve upvoted all your comments in this discussion and I appreciate you engaging with me so far. It&#x27;s given me a lot to think about.')
