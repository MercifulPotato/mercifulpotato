Anchors wrapping block headings feels...wrong, but it&#x27;s valid HTML5.<p>Most browsers will set the inner `h1` as display: block so the click&#x2F;tap target for the `a` becomes larger. (<i>`h1 &gt; a`</i> with `display: block` would have the same result though).<p>Also make sure that content isn&#x27;t being duplicated for the user, `a` <i>and</i> `h1` are waypoints for users. `aria-` attributes can help you here.')
