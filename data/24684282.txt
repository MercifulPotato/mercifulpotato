One segment of society says “there should be a law” often enough that we have more laws on the books in the federal space alone than the GAO can count. Now we add on state and municipal laws and we’re probably all guilty of something each day. Not having enough resources to enforce all of the laws we get the situation you describe exactly - selective enforcement and too often an unjust distribution of enforcement.<p>Add to that the fact that all laws are ultimately enforced with physical force and we get situations like Eric Garner - a situation instigated by the enforcement of a stupid municipal law - selling untaxed cigarettes. A state interest hardly worth exposing someone to a beatdown or in Eric’s inexcusable case, death.')
