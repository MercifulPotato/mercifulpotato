Or was it all part of the same drawn-out failure?<p>I also seem to remember shopping around for a new phone a few years back and coming across android phones running on what seemed like a Frankenstein Atom processor. At the time I thought it was a promising concept, though benchmarks weren&#x27;t flagship quality. But I&#x27;d hoped to eventually see dual-boot phones I could slot into a shell of a laptop to have access to a an ultraportable low-end windows box when needed. I&#x27;m kind of disappointed that never came about. (I know there&#x27;s some promising &quot;shells&quot; for android phones, but I&#x27;d really like an OS I can fully control for my desktop experience, and Linux phones don&#x27;t quite seem mature enough)<p>Anyway, any insight on the above from your unique perspective would be welcome.')
