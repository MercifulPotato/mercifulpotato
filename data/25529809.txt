Their Unreal Engine is popular with developers, but if they lost iOS device support and those mobile devs switched to Unity, most major games would still continue to use Unreal to target all the major platforms.<p>And similarly, Apple doesn&#x27;t need Epic, their iOS consoles historically don&#x27;t push any high end or involved gaming, so they don&#x27;t cede any meaningful ground losing them. And Apple has a bajillion dollars, they could lose all game sale revenue &#x2F; gaming IAP revenue tomorrow and barely even notice it.<p>---<p>Best case scenario: Epic breaks Apple&#x27;s monopoly and gets anti-trust regulation enforced upon Apple (something that really should have happened a decade ago).<p>Worst case scenario: Epic + Unreal is banned from Apple devices. Some mobile devs have to transition to Unity. Folks have to use the PC&#x2F;Switch&#x2F;PS4&#x2F;Xbox most people already own anyway, to play Fortnite + other Unreal titles.<p>No matter which happens, everyone&#x27;s better off.')
