As a lisp, the program is already in memory, I can interact with it through the repl. I am sure I can ask it to format itself?<p>If the program has syntax errors, nothing can happen, how would it know how to format it self if it is not correct?<p>Perhaps the approach is very different in lisp (and smalltalk which I have some experience with), there is no parsing of the program <i>from the outside</i> - or - if you take that approach and treat the s-expr as dead text you have to sort of reimplement the parser (or the system) in order to have some understanding of it, which in my mind seems very inefficient.')
