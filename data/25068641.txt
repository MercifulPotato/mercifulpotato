I&#x27;m a big FE user, but don&#x27;t have any experience with structural problems as it&#x27;s not relevant to my field. I note that you say that tetrahedral elements aren&#x27;t useful for structural problems, but why is this?<p>In my field, for e.g., generally people use Lagrange basis functions and it&#x27;s cheaper (and sufficiently accurate) to just subdivide the mesh and use more 4 node tetrahedra than swap over to 10 node tetrahedra or a different element type. Is changing the basis function family not acceptable in structural mechanics?')
