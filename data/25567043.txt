You&#x27;re responding to a comment that  angrily assumes some unspoken characteristics about &quot;cities built for humans, and not for cars.&quot;<p>I am a reluctant, but accomplished touring cyclist, and I&#x27;ve ridden hundreds of miles through American landscape that is positively hostile to pedestrians and vehicles operating at less-than-car scales. The assumption of cars has led urban designers to implement travel distances that are only grueling to traverse, and the interstitial spaces are inhospitable, bedecked with exhaust ports, bad lighting, narrow spaces or vast, entirely unfurnished without shade, let alone water or public facilities for miles, even, in larger towns. Sometimes, just crossing the street to go a kilometer I&#x27;ve found the American cityscape impassable without hopping in the car, and popping over a minimum of one (1) freeway exit.<p>That&#x27;s just one aspect of the alien dimensions to which our environment&#x27;s built.')
