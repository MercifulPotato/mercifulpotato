With more traffic comes more low-value traffic. Whether that is less than or more than or quite exactly proportional I don&#x27;t want to speculate about.<p>If a forum gets too big, those who value lower volume higher quality traffic will leave. It often doesn&#x27;t raise the level of the community remaining.<p>Most clearly we have seen that with Stack Overflow.
