The claim is that they&#x27;re rewriting urls you receive. I suppose if the imap claim is true, and you reply, and you quote the redirector url in your reply, and someone clicks that link, they could detect it. That seems a little annoying and presents a slight risk, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the type of thing that would be intentionally designed in, even if I model google as completely amoral and short-termist. There just doesn&#x27;t seem to be much advantage in it.<p>&gt; And not every gmail user uses the webmail interface either<p>That&#x27;s why i said the vast majority of cases, not &quot;all.&quot; :)')
