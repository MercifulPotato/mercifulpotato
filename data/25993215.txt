Know what also does harm? Underperformance, procrastinating my ambitions, low professional self-esteem. Far worse than any side-effect from amphetamine.<p>Edit: lol, when I started my reply to you, your comment was two sentences long. Take it easy.<p>Btw, I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and I&#x27;ve been taking amphetamine since I was 18. Perfect bill of health, though there&#x27;s plenty of life left.')
