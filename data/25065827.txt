The graph I linked used SPEC instead of GB5. The gigantic architectural deep dive over on Anandtech even includes a discussion on the strengths and limits of both benchmarks, and how they make sense based on further micro-architecture testing.<p>The reason that graph doesn&#x27;t include the A14 Firestorm -&gt; M1 jump was simply timing. We know the thermal envelopes of the M1 and the cooling designs. We now have clock info thanks to GB5. So yes, the data is pretty solid. No one&#x27;s saying that the iPhone beats the Mac (or a PC) at performance when you consider the whole system. Just that the CPU architecture can and will deliver higher performance given the M1 clock, thermals and cooling. Remember that The A14&#x2F;M1 CPUs are faster <i>at lower clock speeds</i>.')
