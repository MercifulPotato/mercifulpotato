Body Scanners. Removing your shoes (America only; it&#x27;s the only country out of the 10+ I&#x27;ve flow through that forced you to still remove your shoes. Some people do it in other places out of habit, but no one else actually requires it).<p>&gt; Entitlement? Entitlement is how to describe every comfy white collar worker that rolls out of bed and hops on Zoom, and then condescendingly and abusively berates everyone else that does not have that privilege<p>The vast majority of people on here are silicon valley types. They don&#x27;t understand people are loosing their businesses, their lives, their savings and their minds. They&#x27;ve never been out to the country and seen farms or know people who grow food. They see all republicans as racist and the enemy. It&#x27;s dissociative, sad and frightening.<p>&gt; If masks solved the issue (which clearly they don&#x27;t)<p>Thank you for having some sense. The numbers are really clear on mask usage. Zero correlation and no better than a coin flip. It has a high social cost too. People are berating others for wearing masks. It&#x27;s created a new talisman, and ideology and religion. It&#x27;s causing insane amounts of pollution and textile waste that will further damage our oceans. It&#x27;s terrifying.<p>Thank you for saying what you have. I have a comfy job where I can work from home, but I have been in touch with an America and a world that is falling apart, yet also gripped by insane and unreasonable fear. This is a terrible time, for reasons many cannot truly grasp.')
