Had I known KDE was next, I would have waited a bit! I already use Plasma on my laptop, it is a great desktop environment.<p>I replaced Manjaro by Mobian, it works way better for me. KDE Neon did not work too well, unfortunately (it could not turn off the phone screen, and it didn&#x27;t work correctly with an external screen), but I have hope.<p>I&#x27;d especially like to install Plasma Mobile on Mobian, I really trust Debian&#x27;s stability and trust KDE better than Gnome on getting UX just right and be more lightweight too.<p>Phosh is good, but they apparently have decided to remove auto rotation (which I need!), having to tap on the status bar instead of swiping is a bit strange, having to click on a X to close apps instead of swiping vertically is a bit strange too and by the way closing apps is unreliable. They prevent windows from being moved with fingers, which is fine if apps are entirely designed for mobile but this gets really annoying as soon as the world is not perfect, which it is far from being. I have the same feeling with Phosh as with Gnome, that things look beautiful and attention was paid on the appearance, but Plasma overall felt more intuitive and lightweight. I might contribute to the project at some point.<p>Congratulations on being the next Pinephone&#x27;s Community Edition!')
