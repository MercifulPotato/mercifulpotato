Maybe it would show a slight loss. Do you still expect to be paid your salary for the work that went into that? If you do, you shouldn&#x27;t expect to capture all the upside.<p>Imagine 5 teams set out to run $100K experiments; 4 teams fail and 1 team creates a $1M gross win. On net, $500K of value was created. The company can&#x27;t weather the losses from the 4 teams and pay out 100% of the upside ($900K) of the 5th experiment to the 5th team.')
