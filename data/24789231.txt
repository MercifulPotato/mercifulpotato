Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24789489], score=None, time=1602773685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24788824, text='To a member of one of the tribes, that tribe&#x27;s beliefs are obviously the correct ones. To an outside observer, you have to evaluate the individual beliefs.<p>Is the best policy to combat climate change a carbon tax which is refunded to the population, or a WPA-style &quot;Green New Deal&quot;? According to most economists it&#x27;s the former, according to AOC it&#x27;s the latter.<p>School choice programs have a strong record of giving low income families with children in failing public schools a better alternative, but public school teachers unions are a large Democratic voting block and major campaign donors, so they have a perverse incentive to oppose such programs even when they&#x27;re succeeding, e.g. by shutting down the popular one in D.C.<p>Immigration has a multifaceted economic effect. High skill immigration tends to bring domestic economic benefits, because the immigrants spend much of the money in the domestic economy and pay more in taxes than they consume in services. Low skill immigration tends to have the opposite effect, and to suppress wages for unskilled labor or increase unskilled domestic unemployment. If you combine the two the total effect is positive, because the former effect is larger. But the Democratic party has a stronger incentive to promote the latter, because unskilled immigrants from socialist-leaning countries are more likely to vote for Democrats, so they regularly conflate the two and adopt policies that promote the latter, even if it harms the domestic population.<p>You can undoubtedly find some Republican to argue that all immigration is bad and some Democrat to argue that a carbon tax would be a good answer to climate change, but there remains much wrongness on both sides. The filter bubbles show people who live on one side or the other the reasons why some subset of the other side is wrong and not the reasons why some subset of their side is wrong. It creates an impression that isn&#x27;t true.<p>Even the premise is basically nonsense. If one Republican says we should have a carbon tax and another says that climate change is a hoax, does that mean Republicans are right because we should have a carbon tax or wrong because it is real? We know which one will be on CNN. If one Democrat says we should have a carbon tax and another says that climate change will cause human extinction in twelve years without a Green New Deal, does that mean Democrats are right because we should have a carbon tax or wrong because humans won&#x27;t go extinct if we don&#x27;t immediately raise taxes to 75% and spend the money on government windmills? You know which one will be on Fox.')
