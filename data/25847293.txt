From a high-level: Modern Synthesis tools turn your RTL code (which is coded in an HDL or Hardware Description Language) into gates, and then map them to a library of &quot;Standard Cells&quot;. These foundry-specific cells are physical plans for an AND, OR, XOR, gates, flip-flops, etc. Once the code is mapped to these cells they are run through a Place&amp;Route tool, which lays out all the mapped standard cells onto a plane, and then wires them together in 3D following a set of design rules from whatever foundry you are using. Finally after verifying the physical properties of the output design, you ship it to your foundry using a industry standard format called &quot;GDS2&quot; which is basically a series of 2D layers for turning into actual lithography masks. Doing this process (commonly called &quot;RTL to GDS2&quot;) is non-trivial, but could be done to target a new foundry in &lt;6 months. Now, Intel is known to use some custom layout methods rather than this Synthesized flow I&#x27;ve described, but that&#x27;s pretty out of vogue and is a vestige of their early days.')
