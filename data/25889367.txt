Absolutely hated it after a month. My sleep schedule drifts off, I don&#x27;t get to see coworkers, had to spent way too much time around relatives etc, I felt like I was trapped in that cabin from The Shining.<p>It&#x27;s just way harder to organise going out for a drink after work if you&#x27;re already at home. If you&#x27;re in the office and it&#x27;s a 10 min walk to the bar you just go. There&#x27;s absolutely no spontaneity in working from home. At work you can have a conversation over dinner, or over a coffee or a smoke, it just doesn&#x27;t work over Zoom.<p>Covid has been hell for my social life and probably at least 80% of people in my social circle feel the same. I honestly don&#x27;t think any of this will persist.')
