(I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s possible to do and am sure it&#x27;s come up with Tesla, but haven&#x27;t looked for any relevant cases.) (Whether or not you trust that seller enough to give them that kind of money is a separate issue; I do not.)<p>This isn&#x27;t about these companies reselling food, its about them acting as an agent of the restaurant when they are not. They&#x27;re also not selling me a &quot;cheese pizza&quot; for delivery and giving me one from a local place, they&#x27;re selling me &quot;company X&#x27;s cheese pizza&quot; for delivery, when Company X may not want their pizza delivered and has no knowledge of their listing by this company acting as their agent.')
