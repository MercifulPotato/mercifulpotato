The people who like RxJs can&#x27;t utilize it fully, and the people who don&#x27;t still have to deal with it.<p>Re: forms:\nIt makes sense that the forms are hard to type without breaking stuff. Stuff being third-party is probably one of the reasons the React eco-system has been able to move faster, but also with more breakage. That&#x27;s probably just a consequence of the different ways to govern the project.<p>Re: fragments&#x2F;host elements:\nThere&#x27;s a two year old issue here with 200 or so upvotes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular&#x2F;angular&#x2F;issues&#x2F;18877" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular&#x2F;angular&#x2F;issues&#x2F;18877</a>\nI&#x27;ll admit that this is probably not the biggest issue - I&#x27;ve only encountered it because I wanted to have sub-components within tables and that can mess up the formatting.<p>Re: input&#x2F;output model:\nIt probably makes sense that you haven&#x27;t heard too much about it. It&#x27;s probably not something you&#x27;d necessarily think about if you just developed angular and haven&#x27;t tried other composition models.')
