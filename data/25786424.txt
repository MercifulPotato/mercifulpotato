Item(by='exporectomy', descendants=None, kids=[25799899], score=None, time=1610679374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25786082, text='Those are only some factors and don&#x27;t account for the entire wealth difference. I agree they are part of the explanation though.<p>Women social distanced more than men which is consistent with women generally being more careful about their health than men. They couldn&#x27;t explain it with women telecommuting more or having bigger houses.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to imagine that other lifelong lifestyle habits have a significant influence on people&#x27;s behavior. Wealthiness isn&#x27;t allocated randomly to people. It goes to people who already have different behaviors so of course they&#x27;re going to behave differently in many contexts. I find it ridiculous that people consider high income to be a fundamental source of good things, rather than being interconnected causally in both directions with many other aspects of a person&#x27;s life. High income people are also less likely to smoke which doesn&#x27;t make sense from a wealth-enables-behavior standpoint because they can afford to spend more on cigarettes. Seatbelt use is also positively correlated with income which surely can&#x27;t be explained by some greater convenience wealthy people have for putting on a seatbelt.')
