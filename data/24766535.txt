No parental&#x2F;sick leave, no per day overtime maximums, no mandatory break times, no non compete ban, lower minimum wages, etc.<p>Not that it’s the only reason, but I notice it to be a trend in “low cost” states.  The exception seems to be WA, which has decent labor protections, but not quite as good as CA.')
