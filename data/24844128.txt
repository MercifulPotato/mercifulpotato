Item(by='Xixi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603245048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843193, text='I don&#x27;t like to call these projects &quot;me too&quot;, as it makes it sounds like the goal is only to brag about having one. It isn&#x27;t. The goal is to guarantee independent access to a GNSS. It only needs to be good enough for US to lose the ability to use GPS access as leverage. I would refine that claim even further: it only needs to be good enough for Merkel, Macron, etc. to be able to confidently say &quot;no&quot; to a US demand made under threat of cutting GPS military access.<p>That said the Galileo project really looks like it is very badly managed, which is sadly rather common for European projects of this kind, especially on the military side of things. Even smaller projects with only a handful of countries tend to have so much overhead that it makes you wonder if going alone would not be cheaper...')
