Item(by='istjohn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607180706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310854, text='My conjecture is that school systems tend to mirror the population they serve, with blue collar schools tending to be more authoritarian (it&#x27;s cheaper to operate with the regularity and order of an assembly line, after all), and wealthier schools placing more value on independence (as the parents would demand and be willing and able to pay for). Teachers in schools that operate like factories (or prisons) will be managed like blue collar assembly line workers. Teachers in white collar schools will be given the autonomy needed to adapt the school&#x27;s policies and curricula to the unique needs of each student; they will be managed like white collar professionals.')
