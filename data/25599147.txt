You write a ticket. It ends up in the backlog. You are in the middle of a sprint. you are not allowed to change the sprint. 2 weeks (or whatever) later you have a meeting, where you have to argue for your ticket being next. That probably doesn&#x27;t result in success, but pretend it does. Then it gets assigned to somebody that essentially knows nothing about it, because developers are interchangable, don&#x27;t you know? Meanwhile you are stalled because that refactor made sense to do before the ticket you are working on. So you work on that one, don&#x27;t move it to complete, and get dinged. Or you do it anyway, knowing you will have to do the work a second time once the refactor is done, but hey, you&#x27;ll get so move multiple tickets to &#x27;ready for test&#x27; next sprint or so, so yay, you measure well, can&#x27;t wait for bonus time!<p>Yes, I just described a horrible process, but pretty much how it goes in most places. The very first thing people forget, and fight strenuously against, is the agile principle &quot;people, not process&quot;<p>To offer the counterpoint, if I am refactoring sw that runs in a flight computer or something, even more process is needed, because you need to test extensively before releasing code that can kill someone. That check in can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars if you touched something that is now going to have to go through lengthy QA.<p>It just depends on where you work, and the cost of bugs vs rapid response to problems&#x2F;requests. In my experience orgs try to build a workflow that would suit the space shuttle when the product is, well, less important and serious.')
