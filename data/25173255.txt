I led&#x2F;CEO’d a ~200 player Corp (WH&#x2F;Null pirates) for a fair few years. We had a security division responsible for protecting our web services and communications, custom web and phone apps because we didn’t trust the publicly available ones, an intelligence division responsible for trying to break into enemy services and get info, a propaganda division for feeding false Intel “accidentally” via reddit&#x2F;etc comments, PR department for managing recruits, and a strict chain of command with levels of management. The bigger corps went even way further than that. It was lots of fun, probably the most fun I’ve ever had in a video game in 35yrs of gaming, but eventually I needed to actually see sunlight again and have a life.')
