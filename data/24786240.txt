You and I knew when they were trying to blame the fiasco on a YouTube video and trotted the poor director out in a hooded perp walk on tv that it was complete. utter. BS., and then we watched Rice run around talking about it on talk shows trying to shamelessly prop up this narrative. That itself is a scandal. When you start asking more critical questions about why a government does crap like that you’ll find it’s scandals all the way down. The best you can say from the Benghazi debacle is that we had&#x2F;have a bunch of nincompoops running the show. _That’s_ a scandal. It only gets worse when you attempt to defend their qualifications. Don’t get me started on Libya as a whole - it’s executors only years earlier still criticizing the lack of an exit plan for Iraq.')
