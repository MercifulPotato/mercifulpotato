But it&#x27;s still zero-sum in dollar terms. So, if there is a big story about &quot;The boys who made 600 million dollars with oil futures contracts&quot;, that is strictly in terms of dollar value and their gain (a good trade), is someone else&#x27;s loss. That is what I&#x27;m talking about in response to my parent poster, who claimed:<p>&gt; &quot;There are limited resources and society have decided that these people deserve a big chunk of that resources.&quot;<p>As if society decided collectively to pay an unfair amount to a good&#x2F;lucky trader. They took it from other market participants and not from average joe. My intention with my initial comment was to point out that it simply doesn&#x27;t matter if one market participant has 600 million more than before, because others in the market lost it.')
