I&#x27;d loved ice cream for breakfast and sunday morning cartoons too at 8. I&#x27;d have an infantilism problem if I still loved them at 40.<p>If you still watch teletubbies at 40 and are excited desipite of your age, I&#x27;m genuinely sorry for you.<p>Slightly less so if you are genuinely excited about superheror movies, but still sorry.')
