Item(by='orbifold', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608292986, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465601, text='Both GTA V and Red Dead 2 have pretty broken and uninteresting NPCs as well unless you start causing havoc in immersion breaking and unrealistic ways. I think the fact that in Cyberpunk 2077 you can&#x27;t have fun just randomly blowing up shit and causing havoc is a good thing. It is very unsatisfactory to randomly kill people or run them over, because there is nothing interesting about it. The art direction and ambiance works very well as a &quot;movie set&quot; but not so much as a sandbox.')
