I think you may be falling victim to correlation is not causation? IE there are no liberal originalists by definition (above). If I&#x27;m wrong, could you give me an example of a liberal originalist? I would be very happy to be wrong about this.<p>The correlation here is that conservative presidents pick justices who object to rulings like Roe v Wade. The mistaken &#x27;cause&#x27; is that it is Conservatism that leads to this objection when in fact it could also be that originalists object to legislation from the bench.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rj_MhS2u-Pk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rj_MhS2u-Pk</a>')
