In the end it was dropped because we underestimated how much pixels we need to push to that display.<p>Even with the 1920Hz refresh rate of a 128x64 LED billboard panel we can only achieve like 5Hz volume refresh rate.<p>Not to mention the heavy flickering and danger of a quickly spinning hunk of electronics.<p>Volumetric display may be the future if we can couple a GPU directly to a quick enough display device. Until then we are stuck with VR.')
