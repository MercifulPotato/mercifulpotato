I remember bing use to have a site years ago where you would search for a term and see bing vs google results and you&#x27;d pick the one you preferred, and apparently 2&#x2F;3 people preferred bing results. But I couldn&#x27;t find it, so it gave me an idea to build a site but I didn&#x27;t build the gamified portion.<p>Yeah, you&#x27;re right about search results. I&#x27;m seeing more normal sites now as well. The results are not deterministic. I&#x27;m not sure whats causing it, but I saw different results for the vaccines query earlier. &quot;Flat earth&quot; still gives me a fair amount of flat earth content.<p>From the FAQ:<p>&gt; For Duck Duck Go, search-compare searches the html version (e.g. duckduckgo.com&#x2F;html&#x2F;?q=search). The results are different than the canonical duckduckgo search, but its easier to scrape. For Google, search-compare uses the main google site (e.g. google.com&#x2F;search?hl=en&amp;q=search), but it doesn&#x27;t pass any personally identifiable information')
