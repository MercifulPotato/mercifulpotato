Those same factors would arguably make a person less employable, or at least less productive in whatever employment they did have.<p>But whereas crime rates can just as easily slide one way as the other over time, income distribution cannot.<p>(Disclaimer: This is purely speculative on my part. It seems plausible, but I&#x27;m not claiming it&#x27;s true.)')
