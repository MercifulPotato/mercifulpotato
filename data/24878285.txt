Item(by='DrBazza', descendants=None, kids=[24878520], score=None, time=1603535871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24874806, text='&gt; If nuclear could compete on cost, we should go for it, but it can&#x27;t without a major tech breakthrough.<p>Fusion perhaps.  But fission, patently untrue.  The price of existing nuclear fission power plants is artificially high because politicians want weapons grade nuclear material, ill-informed &quot;public opinion&quot; and regulation.<p>And to qualify my &quot;ill-informed public opinion&quot;, Chernobyl&#x27;s direct death toll was 31.  Fukishima was zero.  Yet nuclear is held to some different standard to all other energy.  A nuclear accident, with zero deaths is front page news but the millions of people that have died world wide from burning or mining coal, or drilling for oil, isn&#x27;t.<p>The design of nuclear reactors is uranium based, and over 50 years old.<p>There&#x27;s no commercial incentive to make better, cheaper nuclear fission power plants because Governments won&#x27;t let anyone try.  Search for &#x27;nuclear startup&#x27; and they&#x27;re all fusion.  Making France (EDF) or Japan (Hitachi?) compete &#x27;on tender&#x27; to build the UK a new power station is not really competition unfortunately.')
