It&#x27;ll look totally zany but going into class wearing a bunny&#x2F;hazmat suit with positive pressure filtered air and the whole shebang could be worth it for those willing to go out on a limb? What about just forming local communes where everyone stays on the compound and mutually agrees to have some up front testing and quarantine and then when you pass the bar can move freely in the commune. Are either of those feasible?')
