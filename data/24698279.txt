Most of the time, coding is the process of writing some code, and then debugging it.  Knowing to ask, my graphql endpoint is failing with a status of 500, vs. my graphql doesn&#x27;t work.  The first will help you narrow down the issue, the second is far too generic.  I have been coding for over 20 years now, and I feel it is rinse and repeat in terms of hitting a roadblock, and finding the answer.  Also, a lottttttt of patience.  You might take two hours to figure out something that ends up being really trivial, and then you have that moment of feeling good that you solved it, and then you are right back into the next hurdle.')
