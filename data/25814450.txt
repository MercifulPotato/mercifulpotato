Clearly given world circumstances right now, in-person networking events are not likely to be happening, but it&#x27;s likely that there&#x27;s a local community in your area with security people.<p>They might still be doing virtual events, having some speakers etc. Get yourself known. I have been able to get junior people straight out of college&#x2F;university into roles by getting them into the &quot;networks&quot;. There&#x27;s a worldwide shortage of security people, caused partly by the inability of the people who need them to efficiently hire them (other causes include wanting top-level skills for bottom level pay, and blaming lack of people for their own lack of willingness to pay).<p>The more you get known in your local security community, the better. After a while, perhaps they&#x27;ll be interested in a talk from you about something as well - it gets you seen and known, and it&#x27;s much easier to break into security when you&#x27;re known.')
