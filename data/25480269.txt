And even for the side missions and other dialog, it turns out that almost every single choice will direct you to the exact same path&#x2F;outcome anyway. They might give you very slightly different dialog responses from the NPCs, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>All of the &quot;choice&quot; in this game can be summed as:<p>Character asks you to do something. Your responses are:<p>1) Sure, I&#x27;ll do that<p>2) Sure, I&#x27;ll do that but my response is going to be snarky<p>3) Sure, I&#x27;ll do that but you need to give me more information first<p>4) No, I don&#x27;t want to do that, but you&#x27;re going to tell me that I can&#x27;t refuse you so I&#x27;ll end up doing it anyway<p>5) No, I don&#x27;t want to do that right now but you&#x27;ll message me later and I&#x27;ll find out that I can&#x27;t progress any further without calling you back and saying yes<p>It&#x27;s very shallow &quot;choice&quot;, and I personally don&#x27;t get any entertainment from that level of &quot;replayability&quot;.')
