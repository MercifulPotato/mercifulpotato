Like when there are many reads but few writes it makes sense to have replicas, but if there are many writes and little reads you are better off with &quot;sharding&quot;. You can also think RAID, where you have mirrors vs stripes. Often though the two concepts are combined, like in RAID 0+1 or RAID 1+0. Scaling many reads are much more simple then scaling both read&#x2F;writes though. The holy grail of computing&#x2F;databases is to build a database that can scale both reads <i>and</i> writes while having decent performance and latency.')
