Spent the holiday in London, Salisbury and Cambridge while the latter in particular had a large number of visitors due to Fall graduation.  London always has a large number of visitors.  Thought we picked up a cold, which turned out into a 3+ week dry cough and shortness of breath for me and real shortness of breath for the wife.  She&#x27;s still showing signs of lung inflammation.<p>Anecdotally, various coworkers said they were particularly sick with flu-like symptoms that hung on in Nov&#x2F;Dec 2019.  Whatever it was, pretty much all the medical folks we&#x27;ve seen indicate it was viral pneumonia.  Way too long ago, unfortunately, for antibody testing and there&#x27;s no saved blood tests.')
