I have to assume the best here and believe that the people arguing on there being no merit to CDN hosting of shared libraries all forgetting the two most important things a business must consider.<p>Every byte sent will cost the business. If you can save that 2MB per user per cache life, you pay that much less on the internet bill for your hosting.<p>Every byte sent uses up some of your limited bandwidth while it is being sent. If your site is 10KB and you rely on 2MB of javascript libraries and fonts, offloading that 2MB is quite a significant reduction is resource usage.<p>These above two views seem vastly more important than terminal laziness, up-time management, etc.')
