Tons of stuff within walk distance, great weather all year, lots of interesting distinct neighborhoods, much better than average public transit for the US (still garbage by world standards), lots of restaurant choices, all sorts of &quot;cultural&quot; stuff happening all the time, plenty of neighborhood festivals of one kind of another, etc.<p>There are certainly some people very concerned about money&#x2F;status (as you will find anywhere), but SF is also chock full of weird people doing their own thing, much more than most places in the USA.')
