Motherboards for these Xeons (socket LGA1200) seem to be a somewhat pricier at 300 euro, but they positively have ECC. Intel still costs more for same perf&#x2F;capabilities, but if you need ECC and Intel platform, it isn&#x27;t crazy.<p>Most people wanting ECC just for the warm fuzzy enthusiast feeling would prefer Ryzen with good MB that supports ECC. Intel makes more sense at the high-end many-core Xeons, due to supporting huge memory with much higher throughput (LGA3647). But that segment is bonkers-expensive.')
