It&#x27;s designed to keep state in a repository on the local machine separate from the working directory so it plays nice with cloud synchronization software.<p>I started it after constant headaches involving Git LFS and the corporate proxy. It&#x27;s based around the Restic chunker library, with inspiration from both the Duplicacy backup software and Boar, another binary version control system for large binary files.')
