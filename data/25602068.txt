Both of them are not true. I.e. there are apparently types crashes for which it hasn&#x27;t been possible in the past decades to come up with a bluescreen, othiing new there. It is just as likely, maybe even moe so, the difference in your particular case is your hardware&#x2F;driver. It&#x27;s of course possible there were effectively changes at the OS level in how hard faults are dealt with, but I wouldn&#x27;t just assume so.')
