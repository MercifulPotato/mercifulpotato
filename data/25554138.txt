But it wasn&#x27;t like that when I started. That happened around a year ago(management was entirely replaced). I&#x27;m not known for being tolerant when it comes to bs so the moment those policies started getting pushed onto my team, me along with several others decided to bail(basically the oldest dogs, and as I understand a few others are one foot out already). Frankly I don&#x27;t see anything but the company going bankrupt within the next year or two. Ever since the management swap took place, the company has been in the dark red zone in terms of revenue.')
