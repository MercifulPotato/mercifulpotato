Stingle&#x27;s whole value proposition is encryption. Google and Apple don&#x27;t offer encryption-at-rest, and Google in particular is using the photos you upload to learn about you and market to you. If you&#x27;re looking for cheap cloud hosting and don&#x27;t care about privacy, last I checked, Google offered unlimited photo storage (with restrictions on individual photo size that are perfectly fine for non-professional viewing and use).')
