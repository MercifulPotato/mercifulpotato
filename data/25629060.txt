After 20 years of hard work, lately, I&#x27;m creating for myself.<p>My strategy is simple, I&#x27;m publishing new products like a machine gun and seeing what works. After Flow Cards, which I launched 2-3 weeks ago, I saw that there is a potential in the wireframing products.<p>Wireframes are a competitive business, I know. But there are 2-3 great wireframes in the market and the others are mostly not regularly updated or not reasonably priced ones. Well, I don&#x27;t know why I have to pay a yearly subscription amount for a wireframe kit.<p>So, I created Flow Wireframe Kit which shares the same design language as UI Flow Cards.<p>I hope to get feedback and I have a roadmap about this product:  first desktop blocks, which are available right now. Then I&#x27;ll launch mobile blocks, Sketch files, XD files, and templates.<p>If you want to buy them, you can use &quot;HN20&quot; coupon code to get 20% discount.')
