My views do somewhat align with CS Lewis so I am biased. But the reason I specifically mentioned him is because he has many overtly Christian themes he actively portrays in his novels but I never feel like he is banging me over the head with obvious allegories. His novels are not overly complex but have much depth in terms of the characters and the people and themes they portray. Narnia is an obvious exception, but it is a childrens book. I am currently reading Till We Have Faces and would highly recommend it. It has a Christ like figure, but the more interesting part of it is the exploration of relationship and love.<p>With Dostoevsky I do not know if he really set out to convey a specific philosophical truth or not. To me his novels seem more of an exploration of human suffering and what living in his day was like. But I am not Dostoevsky scholar.<p>Tolkien may be a better example. You can easily read Lord of the Rings without picking up any Christian symbolism.')
