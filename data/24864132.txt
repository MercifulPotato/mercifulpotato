I have to get so high to even approximate the pain relief from an opioid that I&#x27;m completely nonfunctional.<p>I had my first back surgery at 18, my second at 25, and I&#x27;ve been staving off 5 separate herniated discs since. I&#x27;m in a good place now (barring literally today), but I can&#x27;t stress enough how useless you end up being, mentally, to take enough thc&#x2F;cbd to relieve your pain enough to be functional.  Really, I just trade my disfunction of one type for disfunction of another type, which is only acceptable because sometimes you simply can&#x27;t handle the pain.<p>OP: I&#x27;ve had a lot of luck finding relief with tramadol.  It may not be sufficient for your pain or work for you, but it&#x27;s a schedule IV instead of a schedule II - my doctor can even call it in.  In my experience, doctors don&#x27;t treat you as a drug seeker if you suggest it - they almost seem relieved that you&#x27;re not asking for the radioactive stuff.  Just throwing it out as a possibility.<p>For myself, for the rare times each year I need it now, it has been wonderful: most of the opioids were almost putting me into a frenzy - not really the right word since it wasn&#x27;t as strong as the word frenzy implies, but I would get pretty amped up and anxious.  Tramadol offers me relief but I stay fairly even keeled - I can even keep working, for instance, something I can&#x27;t say I can accomplish when I&#x27;m using enough THC&#x2F;CBD to achieve relief.  I wouldn&#x27;t drive on it or sign a contract, but I&#x27;d put it on par with having a couple of beers at lunch.')
