Item(by='Animats', descendants=None, kids=[24928091], score=None, time=1603954267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927612, text='<i>There&#x27;s a good piece called the Tyranny of Structurelessness about radical feminist movements</i><p>That&#x27;s from 1970: <i>&quot;The basic problems didn&#x27;t appear until individual rap groups exhausted the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do something more specific. At this point they usually foundered because most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed their tasks.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s not just a problem with feminist groups. It&#x27;s made other protest groups ineffective. Most notably, Occupy Wall Street. They got national attention, but then had no process for deciding what they wanted and pushing for it. The Portland protestors ran into that, too.<p>&quot;Rules for Radicals&quot;, by Saul Alinsky: <i>RULE 11: “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.”</i><p>Black Lives Matter is hitting this now. This is the agenda of Black Lives Matter.[1] &quot;Page Not Found&quot;. The &quot;Toolkit for Social Media&quot;, though, is available. The result has been way too much focus on PR, statues, and renaming stuff. Not enough about how to stop cops from killing people. (There&#x27;s a straightforward solution: have the FBI investigate all killings by cops, immediately. There are about 1000 a year. The FBI has the authority to do this under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but does so only about once a year. They usually wait until the local authorities haven&#x27;t done much, and by then the case is cold. Requiring an investigation by an outside agency is a basic first step.  This doesn&#x27;t require new legislation; that battle was won over half a century ago. So that&#x27;s something to push for.)<p>What goes wrong when your group doesn&#x27;t focus is that eventually you either fail, or end up with a Strong Leader, which creates the usual problems. These are the usual failure modes of revolutions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blacklivesmatter.com&#x2F;what-we-believe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blacklivesmatter.com&#x2F;what-we-believe</a>')
