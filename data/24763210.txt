It’s the original user-created slang dictionary on the web.  My intention is for the site to be the ‘Wikipedia of slang’ - i.e. actual information backed up by facts.<p>I’ve never censored the dictionary <i>per se</i>, though I have edited user-submitted definitions to adhere to the dictionary’s overall tone.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlineslangdictionary.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlineslangdictionary.com&#x2F;</a><p>Unfortunately, the creator of Urban Dictionary worked at Google and Google employee(s) have intervened to ensure that only that site would appear at the top of Google SERPs.  So there’s no “popular” alternative - by design.<p>(Re. my desire for the site to be a proper wiki: At present, only registered users can add new terms and definitions.  I wish that weren’t the case, but with Google’s manual penalty in place, I simply don’t have the resources to deal with an anonymously-edited site...)')
