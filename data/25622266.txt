You seem to be particularly hostile in your comments about it. As someone who has participated in discussions about zig syntax for years, I can assure you that a significant amount of thought and consideration goes into these choices. It is not &quot;different-just-to-be-different&quot;. In fact, the very syntax being complained about is derived from other languages!')
