Articles like this need to get a lot more specific about what fields they&#x27;re talking about. I think the best idea would be to name specific publication venues or funding opportunities that should adopt these standards. It should be that granular.<p>Otherwise, this is one way that bureaucratic overhead, nonsensical policies, and perverse incentives are created.')
