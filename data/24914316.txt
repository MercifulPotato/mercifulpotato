Item(by='chaps', descendants=None, kids=[24918134], score=None, time=1603851376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896627, text='Blame for a leak isn&#x27;t the problem if a leak never happened, since the goal is to _prevent_ a leak through disclosure. Your snark makes it clear that you have little to no interest in trying to see the issue from the side of the person disclosing the issue, who at the end of the day is just trying to prevent lives from being ruined through simple negligence. Yes, people obsessed with bug bounties is a thing, but in contrast to the risk of ignoring a legitimate disclosure email, who cares?<p>The issue here isn&#x27;t that someone would be blamed for a data leak - not even a bit. The issue is that there&#x27;s a good chance that panicked management won&#x27;t consider the disclosure as helpful, but instead as a genuine attack on their infrastructure and will get non-technical lawyers involved. Tons and tons of people have been sued from doing this.<p>Giving as little information as possible is _necessary_ to reduce the risk of being sued. That you, and people like you, think that little information is a waste of time is just sad, man. Think about it from the shoes of those who try to disclose, and the lives of people whose information is in the systems that you maintain. Get off your lazy high horse, spend the hour to review their email, do your fucking job, or get out.')
