My favorite unexpected use case has been testing Apple webhooks and sign in, which requires TLS even for local development. Caddy made this so easy! I just set up DNS for my home address, configured my firewall to serve on public port 443 and fired up Caddy. Would have been endlessly more annoying to configure TLS for local development before Caddy. The config file for this is literally 3 lines:<p>my.public.hostname {<p><pre><code>   reverse_proxy localhost:3000\n\n}</code></pre>')
