There&#x27;s not a human being behind them -- there&#x27;s a corporate entity who has to answer to stakeholders with a spotlight being shined on them.<p>It&#x27;s purely politics and statesmanship, the human being is long gone, or only shows up in private settings after everyone&#x27;s had several drinks.<p>Except Elon Musk. That&#x27;s a man you can, probably, take at his word.')
