One of them knows the location of a specific hidden treasure.  I know who it is and I ask you to guess who it is, but you have no possible way of knowing or even getting a hint about it.<p>You pick some random person.  I then bring in another stranger and tell you that the person who knows where the hidden treasure is is either the random person you chose or the one I brought in.<p>At this point, there are only two possibilities:<p>1. You happened to randomly choose the right person on Earth and in my surprise, I had to pick some other random stranger to pretend they knew the secret.<p>2. You chose a total rando who has no idea what&#x27;s going on and the person I brought in is in fact the one who knows where the treasure is')
