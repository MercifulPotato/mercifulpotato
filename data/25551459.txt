SC2 tried this a bit, but at least when I used to play it was very clear that the game was completely unbalanced around team play.<p>Most of these games, if you want to really succeed, are mentally taxing. You have to pay attention to a minimap, you have to constantly be on the lookout for other people, you have to remember exactly what cards they&#x27;ve played so far.<p>If you can&#x27;t counterbalance that with at least some socialization and lightheartedness, it&#x27;s just work.')
