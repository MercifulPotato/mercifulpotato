Hack was a good attempt, but I fear it&#x27;s too late to fix the soup of features by forking&#x2F;cloning. I sincerely believe another language will replace it (not python), if they havent already (javascript <i>shudder</i>).<p>I&#x27;ve used PHP professionally for over 20 years along with other languages. The decisioning of language design, at large, has been mired in &quot;good enough and doesn&#x27;t break backward compatibility&quot; nonsense all over the spectrum. PHP was the poster child of thinking differently in the 90s. Make the languages BETTER by looking at others, not clutching your Perls &#x2F;s. Arcane sigils are not the way forward, that&#x27;s a known (eg Erlang, Haskell, Pony, Perl, etc), even with powerful features that put existing languages to shame.')
