This can actually alleviate a lot of parsing issues, by making it impossible to use stuff without parsing.<p>An example of where I&#x27;ve recently done something like this is my sparse linear algebra code. I have distinct types for column and row vectors for a matrix, so that if I want to right-multiply A with a vector, the input has to be a column vector and the output has to be a row vector. Similarly, if I want to left-multiply A with a vector, the input has to be a row vector and the output has to be a column vector.')
