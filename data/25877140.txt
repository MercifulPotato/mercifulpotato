Few enough that it would be fine to let you keep your ICE&#x2F;hybrid vehicles with almost no impact on climate is my guess.<p>If I had to guess, you live in Canada which is a country of extremes like what you mention.<p>The solution for Canada probably isn&#x27;t to prohibit ICE vehicles, but to disincentivize them heavily where they make less sense. So in the areas where extreme cold and long range is the use case, provide an exemption. Out here on Vancouver Island where the longest possible route is less than 500km and a cold day is one where there&#x27;s frost on my car, there&#x27;s really not a great reason for me to be buying a brand new ICE car 10 years from now. Same thing for when I lived in Vancouver and drove 5,000 km per year.<p>My point is that a huge majority of people live in circumstances where electric cars will be fine. We shouldn&#x27;t let the corner cases (living in a place with extreme cold where driving 400km to the airport is routine) dictate what the rest of the world needs to do.')
