Basal Chi3l1 mRNA was nonrhythmic because of a long mRNA half-life in astrocytes. However, inflammatory induction of Chi3l1 was gated by the clock<p>I&#x27;m struck by how much this description sounds like someone debugging or reverse-engineering some unknown microcontroller.<p>Do you (or anyone) know: has molecular bio always been like this? Or are there new tools that allow for selective inhibition of signals to observe effects?')
