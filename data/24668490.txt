I was in close contact with her during this time I even laid next to her in the hospital bed but did not contract her illness.<p>After 7 days the doctors concluded that she must have developed asthma and sent her home with an inhaler which she relied on daily until around February.<p>She is now able to exercise on a treadmill without ill effects. However if I cook things on the stove and it produces smoke this seems to trigger mild issues, and occasionally she has a stuffy nose that seems like allergies.<p>I&#x27;m not saying she had covid-19 but she had many of the symptoms. She had no fever during this time.')
