They sell TV&#x27;s like The Frame[1] from Samsung ($599 for the 32&quot; version) that look much closer to a picture frame and are designed for almost this exact purpose.  If you are in some semi-permanent home (you probably should be before you spend $2.7k on an art piece) it isn&#x27;t much work to mount it in a way that would hide the cables.  From the looks of the photos in this article, the e-Ink version isn&#x27;t event mounted flush against the wall and appears to be tilted downward.  I don&#x27;t love the way that looks given the cost.  I would much rather spend half the money on that TV and a professional mounting.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samsung.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;televisions-home-theater&#x2F;tvs&#x2F;the-frame&#x2F;32-class-the-frame-qled-hdr-smart-tv-2020-qn32ls03tbfxza&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samsung.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;televisions-home-theater&#x2F;tvs&#x2F;the-...</a>')
