Even if you watch a movie several times, you&#x27;d prefer watching another movie that&#x27;s just as good. As for multiplayer games, I actually wonder whether startups focused on one game will become more successful, though see the next point.<p>- A movie or game competes with every other movie or game, which requires a huge upfront investment.<p>- A startup can expand to cover entire categories. I find it hard to understand how a studio focused on creating communities makes more sense then something like reddit, which lets users create their own communities.')
