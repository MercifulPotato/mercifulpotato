You have to switch context from HTML to JS, you have to keep track of the &quot;link&quot; between your CSS-in-JS and your React component, you have to deal with cascading styles, and hopefully you&#x27;re able to keep all styles across all components consistent.<p>Tailwind cuts through all of that and says:<p>- Just declare the styles you want directly in the HTML<p>- If you&#x27;re repeating styles, use @apply<p>- Limit the number of styles available to your project to enforce a de facto design system')
