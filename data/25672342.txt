Item(by='KozmoNau7', descendants=None, kids=[25672962], score=None, time=1610034578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25671879, text='I do think you&#x27;re leaving out a lot of contaxt when claiming that simply posting as a right-leaning individual in a non-political subreddit will somehow get you banned. Unless you&#x27;re directly attacking others or posting really hateful stuff, getting banned will first involve some kind of escalation and very often also one or more moderators asking to tone it down or disengage. If you decide to stick to your guns at that point instead of taking a break, that&#x27;s when forced timeouts and bans start to happen.<p>As an example of you probably leaving out a lot of context, you used the phrasing &quot;wrongthink ban&quot;, which almost always goes hand-in-hand with (false) claims of being censored.<p>You also wrote that engaging in political discussion from a right-leaning viewpoint in <i>non-political</i> subreddits &quot;carries a decent risk of getting some sort of wrongthink ban&quot;.<p>Dragging politics into spaces where they&#x27;re not welcome is a bad idea, and will quite rightly upset the people in those spaces. It&#x27;s their space and they get to choose what is welcome in it. Someone trying to forcibly insert themselves or their viewpoints into other people&#x27;s space, when they are not welcome, is bound to create friction and anger.<p>Reddit doesn&#x27;t promise that anyone has any right to participate in whichever subreddit they want to. That is up to the users and moderators of any given subreddit, no matter how arbitrary their rules may seem. You are free to find other subreddits to participate in. If your politics or general attitude is generally so that you find yourself unwelcome in most subreddits, that should be an indicator to perhaps be a little more diplomatic yourself, honestly. Or just disengage from Reddit entirely, you&#x27;ll be fine without it.<p>Being of the belief that you should be welcome in all spaces and greeted on friendly terms by everyone is a really privileged position to hold. Not everyone is welcome everywhere.')
