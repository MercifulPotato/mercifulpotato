They don&#x27;t go so far as not to use it, but their opinion of it is not good.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because I <i>don&#x27;t</i> live in an SV or other techie bubble that I see this, that I give more credit to the average person. Because I&#x27;m not stuck I&#x27;m an echo chamber of &quot;general public are naive and don&#x27;t care&quot;. They do care, they are more aware of some of these issues than they think, and assuming the only people who care or think about these issues are techies is an extremely condescending &amp; patronizing view towards the average person. Perhaps it helps broaden my view that live in a densely populated but not very techie&#x2F;tech-company area with a large social circle of non techies. It shows me that your so-called bubble where hn&#x2F;sv&#x2F;techies make sweeping generalizations about the average person is often based in stereotypical fiction I stead of reality. My age 65+ parents and in-laws couldn&#x27;t tell you the difference between tcp &amp; udp, setup a WiFi router, or understand the difference between a spreadsheet and a database or know what Full Stack means. But they have opinions on Facebook, and they aren&#x27;t good. My few dozen coworkers of all ages are the same.')
