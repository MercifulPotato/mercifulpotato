One gram of flour contains about 13,000 yeast cells. I don’t deny that there are a few yeast in the environment that find their way into the starter, but by and large the yeast that will survive in the starter are the ones that like the menu there, i.e, the ones that have a taste for grain. Sure enough, they’re the ones that were on that grain in the first place. &quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wildyeastblog.com&#x2F;sourdough-stories-myth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wildyeastblog.com&#x2F;sourdough-stories-myth&#x2F;</a><p>or more discussion: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefreshloaf.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;37259&#x2F;mythbusters-grain-yeast-or-air-yeast" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefreshloaf.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;37259&#x2F;mythbusters-grain-yea...</a><p>I&#x27;m sure I read about some kind of experiment involving creating a sourdough starter with sanitised air but I can&#x27;t find it... Does anyone have something more scientific?')
