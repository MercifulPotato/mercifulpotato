Our VPN only works in Windows.<p>Some people have made Juniper Pulse Client work in Linux, even a co-worker has posted some instructions. But I already have a setup where I start the VPN client in a Windows VM and tunnel through it.<p>I feel like any Linux solution would take a lot of time to setup and might not be as robust.<p>Another reason I still need Windows around is we only support S&#x2F;MIME encryption in the Outlook client. Part of this is because of how our internal IT configures the cert, there is a way to make it work in the webmail but our IT guys have either opted out of that or not gotten around to it.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it though. I can happily use Linux for 99.99% of my time.')
