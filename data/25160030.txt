Adding suspension by running supple tires at lower pressure reduces the energy required to go over the rumble strips (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.renehersecycles.com&#x2F;myth-16-higher-tire-pressure-is-faster&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.renehersecycles.com&#x2F;myth-16-higher-tire-pressure...</a>).
