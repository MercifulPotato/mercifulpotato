I really wanted to like the sleeper train I went on but I just couldn&#x27;t sleep. It might be better for heavy sleepers.<p>The second one I took the train turned up at the station but they forgot the sleeper cars. We had to take a bus in the middle of the night across Germany to what where they left them. It was 3am when we got there and they still didn&#x27;t just let us sleep and were checking our tickets and everything. Our stop was at 6am.<p>The best overnight travel I did was on a ferry from Oslo to Copenhagen. We had the cheapest possible cabin (no window) but I slept like a log. You can even do a multiple night trip all the way to Helsinki.')
