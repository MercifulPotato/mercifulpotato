Current high end GPUs are much faster than that (e.g the 3080 is ~5 times as powerful as a 1050ti).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - this is still <i>very</i> impressive with a ~20w combined! power draw under full load, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t beat mid - high desktop GPUs.<p>(This is largely irrelevant for video encoding&#x2F;decoding though as you can see - as that&#x27;s mostly done either on the CPU or dedicated silicon living in either the CPU or the GPU that&#x27;s separate from the main graphics processing cores.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;m1-beats-geforce-gtx-1050-ti-and-radeon-rx-560&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;m1-beats-geforce-gtx-10...</a>')
