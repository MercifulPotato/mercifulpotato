Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605995669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172245, text='&gt; Can you point to any time since the adoption of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 that the GSA has waited until Electoral College vote to begin the transition process as required by law, or, in the alternative, provide any legal argument as to why you believe that every Presidential Transition since then has been conducted illegally?<p>You&#x27;re missing the point. Usually the transition happened early because the winner and the loser agreed on who had won. At this time, the official results are still in doubt. Therefore there isn&#x27;t a reason to begin official transition.')
