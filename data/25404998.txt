If I&#x27;ve driven down the motorway for long periods I am normally wondering if I&#x27;ve got a ticket because of the variable speed limits. I have no intention of breaking the speed limit, but I honestly don&#x27;t know if I had because the speed limit in some places can be changing all the time. Great so I have more things to worry about when I drive to work. Brilliant.<p>Most of the drivers that drive at extreme speeds are usually very <i>rich</i> (they are always driving Mercs, Range Rovers, Audis and BMWs) and don&#x27;t typically give a toss about the fine or the points.<p>Also there are many people (usually immigrants) who drive without a valid license and insurance.')
