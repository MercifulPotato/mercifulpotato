I haven&#x27;t tried building any Java code though, only Go and Swift.<p>I&#x27;m seeing about 2x performance (eyeballing build times) of a recent Intel MBP for compiling a medium size Go codebase, running natively on arm64. The machine is noticeably faster than previous iterations for most tasks.<p>I&#x27;ve made an effort to avoid emulated code though so am running a patched version of Go 1.16 and tools. Not all tools have officially supported native versions yet, but the performance is definitely there.')
