Both contain subjects that seem irrelevant, but with homeschool I could knock all that out quickly and move onto my favorite activities of reading, coding and playing outside.  Then I went to public school and spent hours bored out of my mind because I didn&#x27;t understand why different subjects mattered, and some seemed to be indoctrination which was both annoying and boring at the same time.<p>I like the older approach of emphasizing reading writing &#x27;rithmetic, and then teaching practical skills and classics.  All obviously relevant skills and knowledge for everyone.')
