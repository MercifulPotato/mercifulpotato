This is because it first tries to reach a repo in IPv6, then after 30s falls back to IPv4. If you disable IPv4, it is lightening fast. Many services behave the same way, to the point that computers are generally faster on IPv4.<p>Maybe it changed recently but it wasn’t the case for the last 10 years and I’ve quit trying, and I’m not knowledgeable enough to configure the Debian system far from the defaults.<p>Edit: Maybe it is my ISPs who don’t support IPv6, which makes it hard to improve because the problem is invisible for, for example, Debian developers who work on IPv6 support.')
