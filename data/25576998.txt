On one side all regulations and restrictions are bad, on the other side proposed regulations and restrictions are extremely poorly targeted.<p>The former is probably obvious so here&#x27;s some points for the latter:<p>Public debate centers around &quot;assault weapons&quot; high powered rifles and mass shootings.<p>- 2&#x2F;3rds of gun deaths are suicides (usually with handguns)<p>- The vast majority of gun homicides are with handguns<p>- The broadest definition of &quot;mass shooting&quot; I could find was 4 or more victims (excluding the shooter).  That puts mass shooting deaths on par with accidental gun deaths; about 1% of total gun deaths and single-digit percentage of gun homicides.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying ending mass shootings is a bad thing, but it&#x27;s as if everyone worried about traffic fatalities in the US was informed by watching &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; and wanted to ban forced-induction sports cars and was super worried about deaths from underground road races.')
