A time before anyone imagined the need for a system to authenticate who is sending mail or from what server. A time when a &quot;network connection&quot; was a big ass permanent wire into a deeply imperfect network. A time where someone intercepting the communications on that wire was an afterthought. A time where even when things were encrypted, DES was considered an acceptable cipher.<p>Unfortunately today&#x27;s internet has needed to be a continuum of newer stuff that still has to work with the older stuff. Such is life.')
