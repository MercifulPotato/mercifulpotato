When you are  optimizing the queries, it&#x27;s slightly easier to get rid of the N+1 behavior in GraphQL than in REST because you can see exactly what data the client is trying to get and can fetch data differently based on that instead of needing to come up with your own way for the API to describe what data to fetch.')
