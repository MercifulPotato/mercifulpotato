And then a totally separate indie track where all the revenue is yours up to X, after which some kind of sliding scale kicks in.<p>In reality, there are almost certainly enterprise deals going on behind the scenes (or at least mostly behind the scenes, <i>cough</i> Epic) and the details of those are almost certainly very proprietary, due to how the negotiations would occur. But having at least one option for which the details are public would be nice.')
