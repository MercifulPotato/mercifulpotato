This is PayPal&#x27;s most significant defense effort against cryptocurrencies.<p>The basic concept of cryptocurrency is that you don&#x27;t need PayPal or any company to be involved in digital money exchange.<p>By deciding that they are going to &quot;support&quot; crypto what they are doing is saying &quot;you don&#x27;t need to go use real crypto. Just buy it from us and we will handle it for you.&quot;. Which means instead of the transaction going through on the real blockchain, it goes through PayPal still.  Paypal stays in the loop and gets their transaction fee.  People don&#x27;t own cryptocurrencies.<p>What we want is for Ethereum 2 and or Polkadot or whatever that is now starting to get better scaling ability to really take off and start clearing a ton of transactions per second.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me that people cannot see that PayPal and other banks or transaction middlemen have a fundamental conflict of interest with cryptocurrencies which aim to make them obsolete.')
