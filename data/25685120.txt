The reason is simple: I can print expressions and manipulate the expression with a guarantee that my calcs conform to the pretty printed ones.  This allows non-programmers (senior engineers) to check the work on the engineering side with some additional assurances that the calculation is going to be correct compared to just inputting the expression in python seperately from the pretty printing process.')
