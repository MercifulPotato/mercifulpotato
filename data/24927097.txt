I made no assertion about the the prevalence of cargo cult science in Medicine or any other field. I, too, have read Ioannidis. And Smolin. And Goldacre. And Kuhn. And Popper(well, some Popper. His writing is pretty dense.) Hell, I&#x27;ve even read Robert Whitaker. My point continues to be that mere use of correlation as evidence of <i>cum hoc ergo pro</i> is neither necessary nor sufficient for a charge of bad (or cargo cult) science because <i>cum hoc ergo pro</i> is a logical fallacy.<p>Your reference to Metascience is a red herring.  Ionnides didn&#x27;t conclude that basic logic errors were the problem: his focus was on reproducibility and statistical errors as well as problems in experimental design (probably publication of negative results as well, I can&#x27;t remember). Further, &#x27;Why Most Published Research Findings Are False&#x27; was published <i>fifteen years ago</i>. It&#x27;s mainstream science now, and researchers are entirely aware of it. Feel free to charge (with evidence) that it&#x27;s being ignored in experimental design, but it&#x27;s certainly neither controversial nor obscure. It shows up in High School science curricula. Hell, I&#x27;ve used it in freshman college maths.<p>Feynman and Ionnides focus on experimental design, evidence selection, researcher bias or incompetence in selecting results, and publication of results. They don&#x27;t say that you can&#x27;t use correlation as evidence: the problem is not that there&#x27;s too much evidence being accepted, but that there&#x27;s too little.<p>Had you opened with \n- &quot;they&#x27;re ignoring evidence they&#x27;re wrong&quot; or \n- &quot;this paper has twice failed in replication attempts&quot; or \n- &quot;the study has too few subjects &#x2F; no control group &#x2F; too much noise to accurately measure these weak results&quot; or even went all Smolin with\n- &quot;the entire research program is based on inadequate and uncritical investigations into a poorly defined and contradictorily applied hypothesis&quot;,<p>I&#x27;d be merrily mashing the up arrow. But you opened with &quot;The amyloid beta hypothesis is the result of a failure to understand that correlation does not imply causation.&quot; You&#x27;re asserting that hundreds of thousands of qualified medical researchers don&#x27;t understand a fundamental principle of the scientific method.<p>Somewhat amusingly, the published results that prompted this particular discussion is good evidence against the plaque hypothesis (well, it will be after replication and a supporting metastudy).  From a well-regarded researcher. I guess they&#x27;re not all participating in the genocide.<p>I&#x27;m not &quot;hostile&quot; to the idea that AD research might have been misguided or even criminally wasteful of resources. I&#x27;m hostile to the assertion that the very close correlation between plaques and AD should not be guiding research and that it is clearly not only wrong but can be easily so demonstrated.')
