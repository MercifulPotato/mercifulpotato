You have to treat it as an entirely different problem.<p>I agree at a high level, but practically speaking it&#x27;s not realistic to expect colleges to completely reinvent their entire teaching systems for a temporary, 1-2 year remote learning period.<p>Now that we&#x27;ve been dealing with COVID for almost an entire year, it&#x27;s easy to forget that at one point we thought this would all be over in a matter of weeks or months. The situation was also evolving in real time. Colleges were looking for the most efficient stop-gap solutions, not for ways to completely overhaul their learning experience.<p>&gt; It is also practically impossible to prevent cheating.<p>It&#x27;s a mistake to assume that because we can&#x27;t eliminate all cheating, we shouldn&#x27;t bother reducing any cheating.<p>The advantage of synchronous test taking is that everyone is exposed to the problem set at the same time. The obvious cheat with asynchronous test taking would be for one person to volunteer to take the test early and then send the questions to their peers, all of whom take the test at the last possible minute.<p>This happens whenever in-person classes offer two time slots for taking a test. The later time slot is always far more packed than the first and comes back with significantly higher scores. Adding the internet and screenshots&#x2F;camera phones to the equation amplifies this because students can share the exact test, not just what they recall from memory.<p>&gt; In an online setting however, people can face all sort of troubles in a few hour window in their home. Your internet might stop working, neighbor might be making too much noise etc.<p>Educators aren&#x27;t oblivious to this fact. Working with students who have interruptions is just part of the job. Having someone lose internet isn&#x27;t much different from having someone get a flat tire on the way to the test. It happens, we deal with it, and it&#x27;s fine.<p>I also think you&#x27;re not giving students enough credit. They&#x27;re not dumb. If noise is a problem, they&#x27;re going to use headphones. If internet is flakey, they&#x27;re going to find a better location to take a test.<p>It&#x27;s such a weird double standard to see HN champion work from home as unequivocally superior to working in an office, yet whenever the topic of learning from home comes up we get a laundry list of what-about possibilities that might make the experience worse.')
