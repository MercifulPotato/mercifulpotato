I now have a system with nothing but DWM, st and Chromium, and it’s beautiful; no maintenance, no hundreds of parallel Chromium&#x2F;Electron installations, no need to support proprietary platforms and most importantly no need to be a slave to the Play store, App store or Microsoft store. Why Mozilla wouldn’t support such a libre ecosystem, even though they clearly benefit from it’s existence (check the mobile Firefox usage stats; it’s nothing even compared to the small desktop share) is beyond me. I’ve had high hopes for Firefox after the quantum release, but at this point using anything other than a Chromium or WebKit-based browser just seems to be a waste of time to me, and I’ll gladly take the downside of a monolithic system if it means that I and my users are free from proprietary platform-specific apps and proprietary distribution mechanisms.')
