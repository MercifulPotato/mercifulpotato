But, as the article explains, we do not (typically) inherently hold, are not born with, nor do genetics code for, these &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;light&quot; traits.  Therefore the emergence of &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;light&quot; tendencies is really more decided by the family, community, and economic systems.  It is not that a &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;light&quot; trait necessarily allows a person more to succeed, but it suggests that some family, community, and economic systems require a person to develop what we would label &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;light&quot; traits from our perspective in order to survive.  It appears the point of the article is: when we come across a person with &quot;dark&quot; traits, it is not entirely THEIR fault they have &quot;dark&quot; traits, it is more OUR fault we cannot shape our family, community, and economic systems to produce people with &quot;light&quot; traits.')
