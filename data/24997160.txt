Then I see videos where people are putting on spark arrestors and using more involving methods to totally remove oxygen (electrically interactive element in a steel container - an amount as low as 4% mixed with hydrogens low ignition point could be hazardous). Combine this with all the hoses and couplings I&#x27;d have to put in and it could add up and get complicated (although Alex Lab is a neat channel for hydrogen experimentation).<p>Could I just put a grinder wheel to some pig iron and create a powder stock (high surface area)? Since the powder flows it could be delivered like a wood pellet stove with auto-feed and hopper storage, and maybe for cooking I could spoon feed powder into a bowl with air flow rate control for temperature adjustment? Then another batch would &quot;charge&quot; as a short between two electrodes of a voltage source. Would the constant voltage of a charge controller be necessary for this redox? Could it just be a container of oxidized iron that reacts as voltage is available?')
