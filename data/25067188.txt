Customers used said service with that expectation<p>&#x27;unlimited backup and storage of the photos&#x27; was the market pitch, whether people read the TOS is another thing. I can see why some people would feel unhappy with this and I can&#x27;t blame anyone for that but on the other hand I wish we would stop taking these vague market statements at face value. &#x27;free&#x27;, &#x27;unlimited&#x27; and &#x27;forever&#x27; can never go together in a capitalist market. And I&#x27;ll abruptly stop here because I would derail into things like law and ethics which, I think, are out of my scope.<p>&gt; while competitors to it went out of business<p>This is honestly a tragedy that happens all across the industry at the moment.')
