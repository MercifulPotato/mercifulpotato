Item(by='whatatita', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604051050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940291, text='&gt; You want the company to say the words along with you and agree with your position<p>I disagree.<p>When I engrave &quot;I love you&quot; on a watch, as a present for a loved one, I don&#x27;t want the engraver to agree with me at all. The message isn&#x27;t from them. It&#x27;s from me. I couldn&#x27;t care less if they agree or disagree with the sentiment.<p>There&#x27;s a message I want to convey and a person (or company) - the engraver - who is offering to engrave the message for me as a service.<p>&gt; if you put your faith into a corporation reflecting your moral convictions<p>I think the trap we&#x27;re falling into here is assuming that if Apple were to engrave the &quot;liberate&quot; message, that they would somehow be endorsing the message. That&#x27;s madness. Nobody would expect them to be endorsing my &quot;I love you&quot; message for my wife if they engraved that, so why do we when it&#x27;s a politialy charged message?<p>As for why people get Apple to engrave the message rather than &quot;carve&#x2F;emboss&#x2F;sharpie&#x2F;sew&quot; the message themselves; it&#x27;s neater and looks good. I doubt most people spending hundreds of dollars want that &quot;I sharpied this myself&quot; look.')
