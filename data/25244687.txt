Ask people who can show you they’ve got millions more than you and have had them for years through ups and downs..<p>Second: there are a gazillion factors that goes into making solid investing advice; what’s your current living situation, what’s your 5 year outlook, 10 year outlook, ambitions in life (wanna retire soon or you’re planning to work and just have this as a long term nest egg), what’s your appetite for risk, do you need the money in the next 10 years (at all!), if you invested in something and markets suddenly crashes and your invest was suddenly worth 500k, what would you do, hang on and ride it out or sell? .. and on and on.<p>What matters is simple long term low cost investments, and then not touching shit no matter what happens. Hell, just buy cheapest sp500 index etf (vanguard or ishares or similar) and hang on for 20 years and you’ll be in extremely good shape.')
