(Ambulances are and doctors doing home visits are widely available and free where I live).<p>Turns out, it was a psychological thing; something similar to a panic attack, with my lungs completely clear. They gave me anxiety medication and the feeling has gone completely. Not saying that it&#x27;s necessarily the same with you, but if you experience hyperventilation and feel like you can&#x27;t breathe, try to relax and breathe slowly and deeply. May be it&#x27;s not as scary as it seems.')
