You pick the next few clear steps and break them down into small units of work, each of which delivers value. Then you knock them off at a solid pace.<p>We managed that here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;williampietri.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;2015&#x2F;the-big-board&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;williampietri.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;2015&#x2F;the-big-board&#x2F;</a><p>And that&#x27;s despite the fact that it was a startup. It helped that my cofounder had 3 kids under the age of 5. He came in on time and he left on time. We all busted ass while we were there, but when we left, we mostly left. One real test for me was when I had to take weeks off to help a sick relative. Even though I was the technical cofounder and had been involved in every bit of the code, I got maybe two calls where they really needed me. It was a sign that we&#x27;re built a real cross-functional team.')
