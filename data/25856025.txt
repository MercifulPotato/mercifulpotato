I&#x27;m not like that IRL face to face except for a very small subset of close friends. If you like that kind of high information rate, discursive exploration, then you&#x27;d probably like or are already hanging around the folks at dredmorbius&#x27; various lairs, what used to be slatestarcodex, and gwern.net as jumping off points. I still hold wan hope the Net will lead to the kind of introspection writing tends to encourage. Thanks for letting me know hnchat is gone. I moved to protonmail.ch and updated my HN profile appropriately.')
