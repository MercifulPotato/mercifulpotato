Item(by='vagrantJin', descendants=None, kids=[25841415], score=None, time=1611089252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832542, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not impossible that the universe is such a stack of simulations, and I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s worth looking into that, but it&#x27;s not a solution to the question what the root of existence itself is.<p>I agree with rest of your comment except the above quoted line. I&#x27;d argue its a casual display of hubris that the universe can be hypothesized as a simulation rather than perhaps acknowledging we are reaching the limits of what we can percieve.<p>To that end, we have very little insight into many things. We still dont know whether light is a wave or particle or both or neither. I find it a leap of logic to jump from there to <i>the universe might be a simulation</i> which in a sense, it already is since perception is a result of our brains turning those same photons we have questions about into informtion by electro-biochemical processes. Do you not think there would be hard limits to such a fragile system?')
