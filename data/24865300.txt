The big one for me is if it&#x27;s a link to documentation&#x2F;help while in the middle of something where you don&#x27;t want to lose state such as filling out a form. I always middle-click those out of caution, but they almost always do the smart thing. (Though I hate when the anchor&#x27;s href is &quot;javascript:void(0)&quot; and middle clicking doesn&#x27;t work. In that case it&#x27;s usually set that way because it displays a modal or other form of help overlay, but there&#x27;s no guarantee so I just have to pray)')
