Compounded by the money being printed by Fed which also doesn&#x27;t have a lot of places to go.<p>I doubt it&#x27;s sustainable to expect that this is the new normal and nobody will want to go back to the way life was before. If that&#x27;s the case, I can&#x27;t understand how the PE ratios that imply someday the future value of these companies will be worth 100x-1000x multiples in 10-20 years are justified. But this has lead to an incredible transfer of wealth to a lot of tech companies. I just wonder when the party will end and we&#x27;ll see a correction?')
