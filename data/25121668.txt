The poor bastard is very aware and anxious of his own cognitive decline, so when his computer starts behaving differently for no reason, he thinks he is to blame. Microsoft is literally making my grandfather doubt his mental capacity. I realise they&#x27;re not doing this deliberately, but when companies behave unethically, it has unexpected consequences.<p>It&#x27;s a similar story with his Antivirus software, which is constantly trying to convince him he needs to upgrade his subscription with useless browser extensions and other unnecessary features.<p>Windows is a fucking minefield for old people man.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on how insanely impossible internet banking is for old people. His bank&#x27;s idea of two factor authentication is to send him a TXT with a code, which he has to reply to with said code, as well as another code on his computer screen. He&#x27;s got a flip phone for crying out loud! You know, one of those phones where you have to keep tapping 1 to get an A? His bank has literally made internet banking impossible for him. What&#x27;s he supposed to do, get a taxi to the bank every time he needs to pay a bill? I realise protecting old people from bank fraud is extremely important, but did they ever test this crap with old people to see if it&#x27;s workable??')
