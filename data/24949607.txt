Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604127073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947702, text='&gt; To be clear, giuliani has refused to give the contents to anyone in the press.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for Giuliani, and I agree that his involvement in this is strange, but NYP, Daily Caller, and National Pulse have all offered to share the contents of the drive with other journalists.  I don&#x27;t know to what extent they have been taken up on it.<p>&gt; The Daily Caller (an extension of the Trump campaign) isn&#x27;t to be trusted. No rational person would expect this to prove anything.<p>To assume that the news agencies that ran with the Steele dossier or the &quot;Fine People&quot; hoax have some fundamentally higher standard of journalistic standards than smaller right-wing publications is a bit rich. But I fully realize you wouldn&#x27;t trust them directly.  The point is that it&#x27;s not just the reputation of these outlets now, but people without a partisan axe to grind like Robert Graham[1] and Tony Bobulinski who are providing evidence for the authenticity of the emails recovered.<p>&gt; Also, Hunter&#x27;s emails and photos were circulated in Ukraine last year to the highest bidder.<p>Irrelevant. All evidence so far points to the laptop (which is genuinely Hunter Biden&#x27;s) being the source of these emails.  The DOJ has already acknowledged that it received (what I believe is the original) laptop drive, and they have been pursuing an active criminal investigation against Hunter since last year. The DOJ, State Department, and DNI all have said there is no evidence of foreign involvement, and even a Washington Post journalist has acknowledged that this likely isn&#x27;t the result of foreign interference.<p>&gt; And no one is buying it.<p>Wishful thinking.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim</a>')
