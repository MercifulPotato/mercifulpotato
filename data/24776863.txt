I really like the way European shows often allow each season to be standalone, if it ends on that season the story is fully wrapped up. Broadchurch is a good example of this. If the show ended after season 1 it was great, season 2 was good as well and if there is no season 3, then its not an issue, no dangling plotlines. Bodyguard was like this too.<p>Nobel, a Norwegian show was like this as well, 1 season and it was great, no more was needed. If there is another season awesome but nothing is lost plotwise.<p>These are all shows I found via netflix.')
