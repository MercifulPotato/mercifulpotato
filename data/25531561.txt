I know you see what’s good about the test, but do you also see why it’s a bad test?<p>I totally see why some people reacted negatively to it, though I think ideally mature people can see that it is a useful test and is trying to teach them something and thus get over it.<p>My personal value system is that I chose tough love versus coddling because the former breeds stronger and more capable people. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but for example I want people who run security for my firm to err on the former.<p>It&#x27;s a tradeoff. I don&#x27;t want to work at a place that&#x27;s more vulnerable because it (rightly or wrongly) assumed that employees aren&#x27;t mature enough to go through a real exercise. That&#x27;s just my view.')
