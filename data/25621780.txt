Assuming the future continues with digitisation, whether that is online or offline, and Visa or MasterCard dedicate what you can sell, use or buy with their Network.<p>People will come and argue you can use cash with Offline. But what about online? Are these people left without a large portion of online opportunities?<p>People will argue you should start your own OS &#x2F; Smartphone if you dont like it, Why dont people start their own Payment network ?<p>The reason why we dont have those problem with payment much is because of regulation. I couldn&#x27;t think of a single industry which has more regulation than Finance.<p>One you have grown big enough into a Duopoly, and a foundation platform of the Digital Society, there are more responsibility to be hold. You can no longer act like Apple in 2010 when they dont have the market shares or the importance.<p>So the question is, why should two companies be so powerful to dictate all of our Digital Life, when Digital has increasingly become the norm.<p>Before Apple shifted its strategy to Services Revenue. App Store as an App Distribution platform was fine. That was 2015. Teaching App is&#x27;t required to have Apple Sign in, 30% wasn&#x27;t required for Education Apps to more than a few peoples. IAP wasn&#x27;t strictly enforce for non-gaming Apps. And what apple calls &quot;Reader&quot; Apps, that is Netflix or the recent Hey.com didn&#x27;t have much a problem. Right now Apple is trying to extract all the values it can, while being the gate keeper of the possibly largest Economic platform known to human history.<p>That doesn&#x27;t just make Apple the Judge Jury and the Executioner. They are also the Tax Code writer and the Collector.')
