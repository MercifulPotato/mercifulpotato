We had 200+ lambda functions (a lot of redundant lambdas that were breaking DRY rules). Each function was terraformed and there was no way to provision the AWS resources to run the lambdas locally. So whenever I made a lambda, I wrote all of my code locally without testing and then had to push it up to delpoy. Then I could run it and debug in the console. Nightmare. It was even worse with batch.')
