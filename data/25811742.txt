It is a worthy trade-off in many situations, I use it often when working on projects that are written in languages I am not too familiar with.<p>I would like to emphasize how big of a game changer the next release of Neovim 0.5.0 will be. With builtin LSP support it will get code navigation, auto-completion and refactoring support on the level of VSCode out of the box, while being way more efficient and faster. I will likely still keep VSCode installed just in case, but only expect it to use it in rare occasions in the future.<p>Emacs is really powerful, but its age is showing and there are some serious technical deficiencies under the hood. I would challenge the idea from the post that the need for &quot;Neoemacs&quot; is not that great. From the history it appears to me more like that many people tried, but due to complexity of Emacs nobody has been able to successfully pull it off yet.')
