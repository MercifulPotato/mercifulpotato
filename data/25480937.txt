Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608410159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480641, text='&gt;&gt;they&#x27;re putting it out there as being at least partially true when it was actually entirely false.<p>We <i>know</i> now that it was entirely false. She didn&#x27;t at the time. The flak at Canadian police had to take is regrettable. They were investigating, had to keep quiet, and couldn&#x27;t &quot;clear their name&quot; for several months. She owes an apology, but that&#x27;s somewhat outside of &quot;The Caliphate&quot; itself.<p>Look... I realize that my take on this is contradictory to journalistic norms. Maybe there is actual tension between practicable &quot;journalistic integrity&quot; and my layman&#x27;s definition of &quot;honest&quot; journalism.<p>Frame matters a lot. If you are printing a single column article summarizing the Chaudery saga, standard &quot;journalist integrity&quot; makes a lot of sense. Not verified enough. The primary source is lying about some stuff at least. Don&#x27;t print.<p>If you are making an audio series that follows a journalist on investigation... This allows for shades of uncertainty. Callimachi is very confident in the source at first. Later, she catches him on some lies. By the end, he&#x27;s clearly a dubious source at best. I don&#x27;t think you can summarize this as &quot;putting it out there.&quot; This isn&#x27;t a Reuters wire. You can have ambiguity.<p>She should not have jumped to the conclusion that Canadian police were inept. That was bad instincts, and an investigative failure resulted.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s journalistically perfect. I&#x27;m just shocked that it is being treated as a low watermark. I feel like a lot of reporting can and does clear a &quot;journalistic integrity&quot; hurdle, but scores much lower than Callimachi in <i>my</i> estimation of &quot;honest journalism.&quot; I guess we value different things.<p>Tangent: something about this thread is making me think of &quot;The Wire,&quot; All the lines about &quot;good police work.&quot;')
