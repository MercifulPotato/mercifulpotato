The Louvre isn&#x27;t so much an art museum as a museum of the the French empire. The paintings on the wall are less artistic expressions than trophies: &quot;Look what we could afford to have.&quot;<p>One example is the Venus de Milo. What makes it so great? Mostly that the French began talking it up after they were forced to return the Venus de Medici[1] following the defeat of Napoleon.<p>The Louvre is full of pieces that are famous for being famous. It&#x27;s not organized, or even labeled. You don&#x27;t go there to learn; you go there to gawp.<p>In addition to the famous pieces, it&#x27;s also full of antiquities taken from the Middle East when they occupied it. Even setting aside the acquisition problems, the pieces aren&#x27;t displayed for historical education. Many are beautiful and important, but they lack the context to make them more than curiosities. A tour or book might provide that context, but the museum on its own simply displays them haphazardly. There&#x27;s no distinction between the history and the art, not because it&#x27;s a museum of the history of art but because to the curators, it&#x27;s all just rare stuff they acquired.<p>The Musee d&#x27;Orsay across the river is a much better art museum. The pieces are arranged to tell the story of the art movements they contribute to. Many have placards that provide more context. In French, because they expect French people to visit; the Louvre appears to be aimed primarily to at tourists.<p>The Louvre is full of important pieces of interest to a scholar, and the museum is old enough that it&#x27;s worth visiting for its own story. It&#x27;s a fascinating story before, during, and after the revolution. (I highly recommend visiting the basement, where they&#x27;ve excavated the castle that originally stood on that site before the Renaissance structure.)<p>But as an art museum, it&#x27;s not just that there are better ones, but that there better ones in Paris. (The Rodin museum is also brilliant.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Venus_de%27_Medici" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Venus_de%27_Medici</a>')
