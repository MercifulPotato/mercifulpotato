Default risk is very low because there is more collateral than debt.<p>There&#x27;s also special loans with 0% collateralization which amazingly have even less risk than the type described above. Those are called flash loans and take advantage of ethereum behavior that allows mini-rollbacks in the time before a block is finalized. So you borrow millions of dollars in the span of about ten seconds, and if it doesn&#x27;t get payed back then it gets reverted. Very powerful if you&#x27;re smart enough to use it properly.')
