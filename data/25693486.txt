She found it interesting, but told me she didn&#x27;t have access to one of the studies she wanted to read.<p>I introduced her to sci-hub and she was blown away. She uses it fairly frequently now.<p>The idea that government-funded health studies are inaccessible to doctors during a pandemic is patently absurd.<p>Sci-hub does a lot of good.')
