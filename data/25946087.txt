Maybe the cliff is only 100 feet high, not 200. Could there be some gravel at the bottom, and not just boulders? Maybe it&#x27;s not a cliff at all! Let&#x27;s just think about this more. It would be terrible to act and then discover we didn&#x27;t need to, just yet!&quot;<p>What facts are you in doubt about? Do you have doubts that, as already-hot places become uninhabitable, people will flee toward places that are not, instead of staying put and, you know, dying?
