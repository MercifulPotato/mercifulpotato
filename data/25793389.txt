Near-field monitors are made for focusing on a &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; like this. Using purpose-built speaker stands is the easiest route here.<p>- Treat the first reflection points with foam, or anything that absorbs&#x2F;scatters sound (e.g. I hung a huge shag rug on the back wall)<p>- Break up smooth surfaces (walls&#x2F;floors&#x2F;windows) with other absorptive&#x2F;non-smooth decorations and materials. Rug on floor, couch at back of room, curtains, even a bookcase; all will help absorb and scatter sound.<p>- A good rule of thumb is to spend as much money on &#x27;treating&#x27; the room as the speakers themselves (even great speakers will sound like trash in a room with no treatment).<p>- When using the speakers for mixing&#x2F;mastering work, listen at a conversational volume. The lower the volume, the less the room matters (and the room matters a lot).<p>- You will get far better sound from decent headphones (I have HD650s) than from all but the most pristinely designed&#x2F;tuned monitor setups. Probably would cost well over $10k and a lot of knowhow to beat the headphones.')
