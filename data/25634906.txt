Depends on who you ask - but I&#x27;m willing to bet it would fall into the &quot;accepted risk&quot; category for the Facebook security team if they had to evaluate this.<p>The reality is that phone number lookup services are available all over the web which provide even more information (first+last name, address, zip code, social media profile links, etc etc etc) for free (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bestfreephonelookup.com&#x2F;phone-number&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bestfreephonelookup.com&#x2F;phone-number&#x2F;</a> as an example) - these services get their info from data aggregators and usually - your carrier! I don&#x27;t see how Facebook exposing (in _limited_, very specific circumstances) the first name of a persons phone number being a security issue.<p>All the people in this thread screaming GDPR violation don&#x27;t understand that if someone decides to stop using Facebook and delete their account, this method to lookup someone will not work. Sidenote: If you&#x27;re really paranoid about having your phone number expose your real name when you&#x27;re using any type of service online, just sign up for a Google Voice (voice.google.com) account and link it to your cell phone - I use this whenever I sign up for anything online and it saves me a ton of spam and scam calls.<p>EDIT: Facebook removed the ability to use the in-app search box in Facebook to find people based on just a phone number, this has been removed for at least 2 years.')
