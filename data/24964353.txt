Assigning some &quot;point value&quot; to them, which variously means &quot;complexity&quot;, &quot;man-day-equivalent&quot;, &quot;man-sprint-equivalent&quot;, and possibly others depending on (arbitrarily applied) context and individuals involved, is the gateway to micromanagement.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible to provide meaningful estimates of both complexity and time-to-implement without resorting to story point formulations or any particular PM framework. &quot;This will take about 6 weeks and has a few dependencies and unknowns that make it moderately risky to take longer.&quot; Rephrasing that as &quot;This will take 3 sprints and has a story point value of 8 points per print&quot; doesn&#x27;t add any value, except from management&#x27;s perspective as a way to put some &quot;objective&quot; quantification to the problem of estimates and deliverables.')
