So I still can&#x27;t see how this applies.<p>It would also probably be fair to say that the swiss watch industry was decimated as carrying a phone became ubiquitous.<p>I think the comparison is relatively apt though.  People have one left wrist, and even though the apple watch and a classic watch are different categories.  You don&#x27;t often see people wearing both.  So there is competition there for a limited number of wrist slots.<p>And apple is selling more units than team swiss watch.<p>Now, if you wanted to have a conversation about total wrist market share, I&#x27;d still guess the swiss watch industry is winning.  You don&#x27;t have to buy a new mechanical watch every other year so units moved isn&#x27;t as apt a comparison.')
