When we got on the train, one of the staff told us to keep our belongings safely stowed within the interior of the compartment, far from the windows and door. Also, he advised us to keep the compartment door locked at all times. The train stopped in Prague for <i>hours</i>, during which time the station announcements kept me awake (they are really loud!). Then, when travelling through Poland, the train hooted every couple minutes when it approached a railway crossing. I ended up getting maybe 2 hours of sleep on the whole trip and my body was aching the next day. Never again!')
