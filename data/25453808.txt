That means for the claimed 4 years of support, you&#x27;ll need monthly patches (since many of these vulnerabilities are critical and exploitable, and newer devices will get patches monthly).<p>I didn&#x27;t see any suggestion of security patches for SoC components for the full 4 years, just &quot;longer&quot;.<p>Another question this raises will be how many devices will launch a year or more into their supported lifespan - launching last year&#x27;s SoC this year - and thus reducing their lifespan for the user.<p>From an environmental and sustainability perspective, we need to lengthen support periods, but from a commercial perspective, chipset vendors want to sell the next shiny chipset. Getting Treble somewhere towards ACPI&#x2F;UEFI (you can boot Windows 10 or Linux 5.10 on pretty much any x86_64 system, even if the motherboard maker has abandoned it) as a standard hardware layer is one small step towards that, but there&#x27;s still a long road ahead I fear.')
