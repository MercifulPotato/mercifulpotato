I see this only causing endless division within the company, instead of people being (more) unified in their pursuit of the company&#x27;s vision.<p>Why not encourage employees to represent their beliefs individually, and off company time, by giving them more vacation and flexible working hours instead? Empower the employees to participate in politics without the company taking a side itself?<p>I&#x27;m tired of people pushing their political beliefs onto me at every opportunity, in every available setting, IRL and online.')
