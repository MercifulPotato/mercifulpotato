Fear is an important signal.  Physical fear keeps you out of danger; ego fear keeps you from wasting lots of time on fruitless things or doing things not in accord with your values.<p>You want to <i>control</i> fear.  Put it in a little box so that it&#x27;s a signal and not a dictator.  Process it so that you&#x27;re aware of what precisely is making you afraid and can rationally think of ways to mitigate that concern.  Fear is a reason to be vigilant and aware, not a reason to freeze up and stop doing what you&#x27;re doing.')
