It get&#x27;s boring to collect all the energy orbs or whatever the shiny points are.<p>* I want an upgrade to auto target the asteroids.<p>* It is weird how the planets move. Try to use something like the third Kepler&#x27;s law, so the outer planets move slower than the inner planets. (And in each system, move all of them in the same direction.) [OK, most people would not find this so annoying.]<p>* Add damage to the star in the center of the orbits of the planets, and If I touch it, I&#x27;m dead.<p>* Give the pirates some personality. Like custom color or shapes.<p>* Are there super pirates? At some point they are too easy to kill, and planets are too difficult to kill.<p>* If you are not afraid of the dark side, add some bots, so the universe looks more full.<p>* Fleets? Can you add some pirates that move in a formation?')
