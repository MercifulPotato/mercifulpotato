I used Numbers and it cloud-syncs to most of my devices, I prefer this over passive trackers.<p>I did this for a month a while back, one realization I instantly had was that a lot of the my attention issues were caused by &#x27;micro-interuptions&#x27;. For example, spending 8 minutes answering a support question on Slack and then going to write code - how do I record that?  The same is largely true with Twitter or even HN, spend 5 minutes browsing instead of doing something with intention. Recording [Activity,Start,Stop] was preferable for me, the continuous scale made it really easy to track not just what I was doing, but the interstitial time when I didn&#x27;t actively have a plan to do something.<p>Just setting out to record what I am doing helped to limit the number of things I was doing and made me be intentional about what they were.  This post was relatively timely, as I actually started doing it again this morning.')
