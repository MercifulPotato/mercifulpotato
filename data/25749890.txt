It’s like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we’re going to have to fight much harder. …<p>“We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”<p>“I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so, because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. … And I actually — I just spoke to Mike. I said: ‘Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage.’”<p>“I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S. Senate, Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley. … Senators have stepped up. We want to thank them. I actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out.

And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal. …<p>“You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can’t let that happen. These are the facts that you won’t hear from the fake news media. It’s all part of the suppression effort. They don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want to talk about it. …<p>“We fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”<p>---<p>This is incitement, pure and simple. I mean, look at this shit:<p>&quot;We will never give up. We will never concede.&quot;<p>&quot;You will have an illegitimate president... and we can&#x27;t let that happen.&quot;<p>&quot;...if you don&#x27;t fight like hell, you&#x27;re not going to have a country anymore.&quot;<p>What else do you need? Are you looking for instances where Trump told the crowd to attack and breach the Capitol before you&#x27;re convinced that he&#x27;s guilty?')
