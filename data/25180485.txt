All human scholarly cultures have things in common. We don’t use that commonness to argue that they’re all the “same”, it’s not an assertion that provides much value.<p>Your other arguments about science zealots arguing doesn’t provide any novel insight either. There are zealots everywhere, using them as the focus for describing the culture seems like a rather silly thing to do.')
