It is unacceptable because if you call them bullshit without giving good reasons why you think so it is not advancing the discussion in any good way. You are not contributing anything except your personal opinion.<p>If you do have good reasons to explain why you think they are wrong you don&#x27;t need to call them names because you can just provide the correct reasoning instead.')
