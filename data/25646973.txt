Item(by='pcl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609863244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646721, text='&gt; the government is spending something like 2.5 billion US Dollars per year to subsidize electric cars<p>The government currently does not charge import taxes on electric cars, but charges very high import taxes on ICE cars.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that the government is &quot;spending&quot; that money. For sure it&#x27;s a subsidy, but the Norwegian government is not actually sending checks to people or manufacturers if they buy electric. There is a cost to road maintenance that needs to get funded from somewhere, and that cost is not currently being borne by electric car owners. But using the phrase &quot;spending&quot; makes it sound a whole lot like a check is getting cut in some amount and sent somewhere.<p>(There&#x27;s an ongoing debate about when to ramp up taxes for electric cars, and to what amounts, so don&#x27;t expect the situation to remain as-is for too much longer.)')
