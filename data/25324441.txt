An emergency escape system could have saved the lives of the Challenger crew because they survived the external tank explosion (were killed when the crew compartment hit the ocean) -- they thought about putting one in,  but then they wouldn&#x27;t have had space in the hatchback for a satellite.<p>The thermal tiles were also &quot;unsafe at any speed&quot;,  it was known at the beginning that the tiles would get broken or fall off sometime and there was a lot of nail-biting around the first flights,  but after &quot;it&quot; didn&#x27;t happen a few times people started to relax.<p>Sociologist Dianne Vaughn popularized the term &quot;Normalization of Deviance&quot; in connection with the Challenger Disaster but it has been greatly misunderstood with the public.<p>Today people think it is the doctor not washing his hands and not being confronted by the nurse about it,  but in the case of NASA it is a formal process where they make a list of 200 unacceptable situations about the space shuttle that they make the case they can squeak by one by one and each speaker has a few minutes to make a case and if they had bad slides and didn&#x27;t make a good point they would clear the floor for the next &quot;catastrophe&quot;.<p>&quot;Normalization of Deviance&quot; is a regular procedure with dangerous technology -- it&#x27;s the paperwork that they fill out because they put the door frame in the wrong way in the break room at the nuclear powerplant or when they fly a regional jet back from a regional airport with one angle-of-attack sensor down because it can be fixed much more easily at the big airport.')
