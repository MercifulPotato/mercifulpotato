I really don&#x27;t like the way my current employer handles their market and I&#x27;m eager to do it right myself (I feel that with the right technologies I could really build something nice myself.) This part of my contract has kept me from it (the &quot;we own what you make at any time of the day&quot;-clause). I do understand the clause though, it&#x27;s just to easy to claim you made up some valuable IP outside of office hours. Maybe I should keep a log regarding the actual dev work...<p>With respect to the non-compete clause, it says in my contract that they can keep me from going to a competitor for a year, but they&#x27;ll pay me for that year. I wonder if they&#x27;d ever enforce this.')
