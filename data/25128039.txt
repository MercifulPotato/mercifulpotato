Item(by='simonebrunozzi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605639516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113440, text='Little funny side story: I met Marten Mickos, then CEO of MySQL, a year or two after the Sun acquisition.<p>He evidently did some due diligence on who I was (AWS Tech Evangelist back then), and told me that he saw some of my emails in a PostgreSQL-related mailing list. I was so impressed! I told him I saw a bright future for PostgreSQL, especially after Sun&#x27;s acquisition of MySQL (which I saw as a negative for the community).<p>Anyway, back on topic.<p>I keep thinking that PostgreSQL has a great opportunity ahead: in this decade, I would bet on the rise of an Oracle-like company (hopefully, less &quot;evil&quot; than Oracle), based on PostgreSQL. Possibly a company that will eventually go public.<p>Why? Because the tech is great, the community around it is great, and because we&#x27;re in need of databases more than ever. (I could rant and get lost in a much longer explanation, but I want to spare you this time :D).<p>Do you see it this way? Any other viewpoints?')
