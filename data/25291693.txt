Item(by='gfody', descendants=None, kids=[25304596], score=None, time=1607016921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289009, text='&gt; In our view, we should be able to maintain every view either in linear time wrt the number of updates or sublinear time with respect to the overall dataset, and every case that doesn&#x27;t do so is a bug.<p>This is awesome and I believe that should be technically possible for any query given the right data structure. The reduction tree works for min&#x2F;max but is it a general solution or are there other data structures for other purposes - n per x and top subqueries come to mind. Is it all handled already or are there some limitations and a roadmap?')
