Item(by='atombender', descendants=None, kids=[24925832], score=None, time=1603929973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921021, text='Gerrit is the one where each &quot;pull request&quot; has to be a single commit, right?<p>I&#x27;m not particularly happy about GitHub, but I think it&#x27;s less about GH and more about workflow and source code evolution, and I&#x27;m not sure if Gerrit solves anything here.<p>First, PRs being heavyweight encourages large branches instead of smaller incremental changes. Secondly, a large change (such as a big new feature) ends up living in a branch until it&#x27;s ready to be <i>released</i>, not until it&#x27;s reviewed. This means that any code that cannot be immediately merged to master need to live on that branch for a while, and gets rapidly out of date, requiring constant rebasing to keep it from rotting.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to merge as soon as something is accepted and use master at the main development branch, but that causes challenges. If you&#x27;ve merged something you don&#x27;t want to release yet, you&#x27;re faced with having to build release branches through cherry-picking, which can be really difficult or even impossible. You can hide features behind flags, but sometimes a branch is a big risky refactoring or some structural change that isn&#x27;t providing features that can be isolated. Plus, once you merge something, any following changes, even if unrelated, often end up depending on the things you want to exclude.<p>I think something like Pijul (with some discipline, like always doing small incremental commits) could make this easier by being able to treat individual commits as moving pieces that can be rearranged for a release, but it wouldn&#x27;t solve everything.<p>Any thoughts on this and how Gerrit would fit in?')
