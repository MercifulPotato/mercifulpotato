Item(by='Answerawake', descendants=None, kids=[25106302], score=None, time=1605482350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105839, text='&gt;I&#x27;m worried that insurgent candidate like those in &#x27;the squad&#x27; were only allowed to succeed as an olive branch to the left-populists for the purposes of maintaining a coherent anti-trump coalition.<p>I don&#x27;t buy that but happy to be proven wrong. I was following AOC&#x27;s race closely before she won her election (any before anyone had heard of her). They went out of their way to work with and endorse her competitor. It was AOC&#x27;s hustle and innovative techniques that made up for her huge money disadvantage (~300k at the end of the election vs ~3mil) as well as the fact that her rival was appointed the seat through a loophole (and so never really learned how to run a campaign) that resulted in her win.<p>The opposition spent 10+ million trying to unseat her since then.')
