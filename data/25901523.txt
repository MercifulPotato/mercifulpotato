I&#x27;m also working on a browser-based music app and here is my immediate reaction, would be interesting to know if you agree:<p>1. There should be a global play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;reset on the top or bottom of the page, and also a main volume knob. It takes some work just to figure out where the patching starts and ends.<p>2. You should have a bunch of well-named presets for newcomers to get a feel for what it can do and also use as starting points.<p>3. The volume &quot;sliders&quot; look like level meters. The first impression is that everything is on max volume constantly. Probably better to have a physical-looking slider. On that note, it would be nice to see the current output of each CV port. It could be just a fading LED if you want to stay &quot;realistic&quot;.<p>A separate question, did you consider porting VCV (using emscripten) instead? If so, why did you choose this route?')
