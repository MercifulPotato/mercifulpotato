That is literally a &quot;specific policy&quot;.<p>You were being pedantic about how the New Deal raised revenue. Literally the only reason I linked it.<p>&gt;  Do you want me to show dozens of examples of FTTs failing? Do you simply need more?<p>If you have examples in the United States or the United Kingdom, sure I&#x27;ll take a look at them. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t really see the point, when no other country has had global financial controls comparable to the US&#x2F;UK in the last 100 years. Further, I&#x27;ve already said that FTT is only one approach, and not one which I have specifically advocated for at any point in this thread. You are arguing against yourself on that one.<p>We already tax wealth, so it&#x27;s not clear at all why you think it&#x27;s so catastrophic. It sure doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;ve done real research if you haven&#x27;t been able to come around on the existence (and non-apocalyptic nature of) property and estate taxes.')
