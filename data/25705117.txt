I’ve still not seen hard evidence of Trump calling for violence or criminality. I’ve seen him make unproven claims about the election, and I’ve seen him call for people to march and fight, but that’s no different than any other politician encouraging protest. The violence in the Capitol is the responsibility of the individuals who participated.<p>I have no love for QAnon craziness, but I am very unhappy that all the thousands of accounts affiliated with BLM or antifa, which have caused much broader violence over this last year, and are much more explicit in inciting violence (for example calling to burn down buildings or kill all cops), are allowed to continue operating. It’s simply because their use of violence is in support of political ideologies and goals that Jack and other Silicon Valley techies generally agree with. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google and the rest are dangerous monopolistic hypocrites and we need alternatives.')
