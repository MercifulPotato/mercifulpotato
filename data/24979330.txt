Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604409411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24975023, text='&gt; but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a total pipe dream<p>You may well be right. Personally, though, I find this essential inseparability of the logic as specifying a model and its proof theory aesthetically unappealing (not that I find everything in formal FO set theories appealing). Of course, it may have other advantages.<p>&gt; Would that really be enough to make you say that these are functions now while they previously weren&#x27;t?<p>Yes, provided that `id` wouldn&#x27;t be a function that could operate on that type. But any operator with a truly universal domain cannot be, itself, a quantifiable object without introducing a Russell paradox (perhaps constructiveness can save it, but assuming the system allows non-computable objects, too). As it is, `id` is universal, but it isn&#x27;t a function. This isn&#x27;t just a philosophical or even a purely syntactic difference. Lean doesn&#x27;t allow you to refer to `id` as an object, just an application of it to a known universe.<p>&gt; so not having a specific universe isn&#x27;t an issue.<p>Does that require forbidding full recursion, or can you still introduce non-computable objects?')
