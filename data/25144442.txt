Alcohol acts as an _amazing_ pan deglazer and general solvent without any real substitute to carry flavors and aromas out of the pan and into the final dish. You don&#x27;t even need much, maybe 2 tablespoons of wine get fond unstuck and dissolved. Some of it _does_ evaporate, you can literally watch it happen as it reduces in volume. You can flash evaporate a tablespoon of wine and return to a dry pan if it&#x27;s hot enough. What it&#x27;s not going to significantly evaporate out of is adding alcohol to an existing volume of liquid like a red sauce. It&#x27;ll happen but not in an ideal or useful time frame. But for deglazing, try swapping your deglazing wine with broth, water or even vinegar and it&#x27;s easy to see, smell, and taste that they are not functionally equivalent, an alcohol does the job so much better.<p>Now, if you or someone in your home has a problem with alcohol addiction or your religion forbids it, I&#x27;m not going to tell you to change your ways but for the average home cook (even a nondrinker) a bottle of wine kept next to the stove strictly for cooking purposes is an undeniably valuable tool.')
