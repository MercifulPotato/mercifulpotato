That is, you get stuff that you &quot;normally&quot; couldn&#x27;t afford, or can&#x27;t afford right now. For a smaller investment (maybe all you can afford..) you can achieve bigger outcomes.<p>Usually in software, this would be shipping &quot;magical&quot; features (that are done in a crappy way behind the scenes) or shipping faster (because you are foregoing some maintenance).<p>The common business advice is that debt is OK if you&#x27;re using it for growth (building capital) and I think that analogy loosely holds for software. Obviously it&#x27;s possible to get dragged down by debt if you overdo it.')
