Outbrain is the other. I wish they had actually merged to save us the time of destroying both.<p>Their product is horrible and without redemption. But let me make it clear that the people that work there are also as horrible - try criticizing them on Twitter and watch the bots and employees attack.<p>They provide nothing of any value in any way whatsoever. It&#x27;s pure scam. If they disappeared tomorrow the world would literally become a better place in real, measurable ways.<p>I&#x27;ve had a PiHole set up for years explicitly to block them. No other service I can imagine is built on such lies, falsehoods, deceit and fraud. They are pure garbage. Hatred doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe my antipathy towards them.<p>Taboola employees reading this? You&#x27;re all trash.')
