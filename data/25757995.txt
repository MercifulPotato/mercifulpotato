It&#x27;s not that Amazon just decided to do it out of nowhere, people demanded it. So shouldn&#x27;t Twitter be shut down by their cloud service provider, DDOS protection provider, domain registrar, payment processor or whatever service they do business with? Because I don&#x27;t see anyone arguing for that.<p>Just as an aside, did they really tried to argue in court that AWS should suspend Twitter too despite not having anything to do with them? Jesus Christ, the incompetence in some of these people.')
