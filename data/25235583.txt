Not just that X has value 13, but that 13 means something and might influence the significance of Y or Z.<p>Having a table with columns A, B, and C doesn&#x27;t say a ton about what the values in them mean. Or how they relate to one another. If it&#x27;s a bunch of decimal numbers, it could be financial data, and the sums expected to sum depending on how another column that indicates a type is set. Or it could be temperature readings. Or distances, with the unit implied or tracked elsewhere.<p>Generally this is the kind of data and rules for reasoning about data that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> stored in a database. Certainly not a sqlite database. Column and table names are often vague or unclear, and in my experience it&#x27;s an exceptionally rare developer who leaves detailed commentary on the relationships between columns and tables and their possible values in their create statements.')
