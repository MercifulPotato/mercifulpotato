Some benefits:<p>- It&#x27;s physically impossible for your devices to bypass the VPN.<p>- It also works with devices that have poor or non existent VPN support (e.g. Roku, smart TV, etc.).<p>- You only have to configure it once vs having to configure it on all your devices.<p>- You can easily and quickly toggle the VPN by switching to a Wifi that doesn&#x27;t have VPN setup.<p>I&#x27;ve been using GL.iNet&#x27;s travel routers for many years and can&#x27;t recommend enough (no affiliation other than being a customer). Just ordered their new Beryl router[0].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gl-inet.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gl-mt1300&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gl-inet.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gl-mt1300&#x2F;</a>')
