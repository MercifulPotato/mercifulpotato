They also wouldn&#x27;t have put special iCloud servers where the CCP can easily spy on them.<p>&quot;Compelled by law&quot; is a dodge. They didn&#x27;t have to create the circumstance where they had the data in the first place.<p><i>On a side note: would you please stop cross-examining so many of my comments? It feels like you&#x27;ve singled me out for harassment.  Your comment history doesn&#x27;t indicate you do this to anyone else.  In this instance you seem to be arguing against something I didn&#x27;t even say. Please stop.</i>')
