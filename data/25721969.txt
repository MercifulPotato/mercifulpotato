You aren&#x27;t exposing people to &quot;public scrutiny&quot; when you both give them the anonymity of the internet, and gleefully create an echo chamber where things like racial superiority and violence against others are glorified and re-affirmed.<p>The message of &quot;poor me&quot; has been fine-tuned.  It falls apart pretty quickly if you spend 10 minutes actually looking at the content on the site.<p>Furthermore, if your end goal is truly &quot;public scrutiny&quot; to the ideals being posted on your site, why are you complaining that the public scrutiny has resulted in everyone in the valley telling you to go away?  Isn&#x27;t that EXACTLY what you claim the site is fostering?')
