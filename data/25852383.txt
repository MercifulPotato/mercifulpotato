They start down a hill when the brakes give out and they crash into a tree at the bottom of the hill. Luckily no one is seriously injured, and they set out to figure out what happened. The mechanical engineer examines the car and says &quot;I believe a brake line was over-pressured and burst, causing the crash.&quot; The electrical engineer looks and say &quot;No, I think it was a short-circuit in the anti-lock braking system.&quot; The Microsoft guy stays quiet, so the other two look at him and ask &quot;What do you think happened?&quot; He looks up and say &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but let&#x27;s push the car back to the top of the hill and try again.&quot;<p>---<p>A newly wed software engineer from Microsoft and his wife are going to visit her family in the mountains. For some reason they have to travel separately and she arrives before him. After a while the phone rings and the new wife&#x27;s dad answers. It&#x27;s the husband. He says &quot;Tell everybody I&#x27;ll be there in 5 minutes.&quot; 35 minutes pass and the phone rings again. The husband says &quot;Tell everybody I&#x27;ll be there in 2 hours.&quot; A minute later he calls again and says &quot;Tell everybody I&#x27;ll be there in 14 minutes.&quot; 45 minutes later the phone rings again and the dad answers and says &quot;You&#x27;re the guy who designed the Windows progress bar dialog aren&#x27;t you?&quot;')
