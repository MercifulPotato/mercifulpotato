I&#x27;d go so far as to say it&#x27;s a software engineering best practice to prefer languages with static types when building new software. The reason for this is because many, many, <i>many</i> engineering hours are saved at an organizational level by having a compiler that is able to enforce correct data structures throughout the application. Eschewing types for speed is just a form of technical debt that has to be repaid in perpetuity whenever it comes time to maintain or refactor the software, not to mention the fact that every new developer working on the application is now burdened with this debt.')
