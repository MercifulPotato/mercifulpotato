Several years ago, I sat through a panel (at a university) in which representatives from various businesses tried to lecture a bunch of academics about how the university is a hidebound institution, and that if doesn&#x27;t &quot;get with the times&quot; it will be crushed by the new technological world order.<p>I recall noting that &quot;the university&quot; had not only outlasted any particular firm they could name, but had indeed survived the rise and fall of empires.  I also noted the irony of being lectured by a representative from Big Blue about one&#x27;s inability to &quot;pivot.&quot;<p>&quot;The university&quot; is a remarkably resilient institution.  That doesn&#x27;t make it a good institution, but we should pause before we analyze them with the kind of narrow-minded presentism we see in this post. Universities have survived these many centuries not because they refuse to change, but because they&#x27;re better at changing than even the nation states that have supported them.')
