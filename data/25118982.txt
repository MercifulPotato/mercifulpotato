While I&#x27;m generally in favor of rigorous testing of all hypotheses, sometimes you have to make decisions before those tests can be completed.  (It <i>is</i> worth running the tests in the meantime, though.)<p>In that case, if the context is what I think: it <i>is</i> methodological fetishism to assume masks are useless until proven otherwise, because the cost is very little, the potential benefit is rather high, and the probability of benefit seems like &quot;at least 10%&quot;.  And I think certain health authorities were indeed making that assumption early on (though some have said they were simply lying because they thought that would produce the behavior they wanted).')
