Best for this month maybe :)<p>Some of which I like most:<p>&gt; Clever code isn&#x27;t usually good code. Clarity trumps all other concerns<p>&gt; Bad code can be written in any paradigm<p>&gt; So called &quot;best practices&quot; are contextual and not broadly applicable. Blindly following them makes you an idiot<p>&gt; Designing scalable systems when you don&#x27;t need to makes you a bad engineer<p>&gt; In general, RDBMS &gt; NoSql<p>&gt; DRY is about avoiding a specific problem, not an end goal unto itself<p>Overall, software engineering is NOT a solved domain, nor it needs to be. Best practices works best solving others&#x27; problem, but most likely, your problem is different, and you are different as well.<p>Don&#x27;t be scared to do things in the way that you think is not approved. Exploration is necessary, because unknown is inevitable.<p>Stay fluid and vigilant, be skeptical yet adaptive.')
