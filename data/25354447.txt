I routinely write documents hundreds of pages long in Word that are filled with cross-references, figures, complex tables, and Visio objects.  Word is very solid (though it wasn&#x27;t always so) and maintains really good performance even with large documents.  Cutting and pasting massive amounts of content from one place to another in the document can be done with more or less reckless abandon.<p>My hot Word tip is to use Styles.  My other hot Word tip is to use cross-references.  If you type &quot;See Figure 3-1&quot; in full, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>If anyone from Microsoft is reading this, please fix a) the unreadable text in the Styles drop-down selection list in dark mode and b) stop asking my if the large amount of data I put on the clipboard should be available to other apps when I exit Word.  With SSDs, this anachronism takes me far longer to read and click No to vs. just saving the damn clipboard content without asking me.')
