I get why bitcoin might be appealing to a country like Iran with cheap energy and sanctions preventing them from participating in the world economy. I also get why it would be appealing to individuals in developing countries with unstable local currencies, and perhaps limited access to harder assets. I don&#x27;t get what the benefit would be to national reserve banks and finance between countries in the general case, where special circumstances (like Iran) don&#x27;t apply.')
