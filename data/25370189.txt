The argument is that if this is a non partisan effort then this would have caused the same outcome if the political motivations were reversed. The parent comment is suggesting that is not true. I don&#x27;t know if that has been well argued by the parent but I don&#x27;t think this is an attempt at mud slinging.<p>A better argument would be to point out that a non partisan motion should gain some Republican support and it has not.<p>Additionally you could point out that it would be unlikely to gain support from the right due to the current incarnation of right wing politicians tending to support freedom of speech and would be opposed to this action on a partisan basis.')
