If you really are trans, and your parents won&#x27;t let you talk to a medical professional, then you will have to suffer for a long time and end up with a body that causes you even more pain.<p>So you have a bad tradeoff between &quot;If we give children autonomy, some of them will make bad decisions,&quot; which is true, and &quot;If we don&#x27;t give children autonomy, some of them will have worse mental health outcomes,&quot; which is also true.<p>The current discussion on free speech seems to be: &quot;If we allow misinformation to sprint around the world before the truth has got its shoes on, that causes harm. It&#x27;s okay to censor obvious misinformation if it will protect people,&quot; versus, &quot;Why is it obvious? Why is it harm? Some parts of the book are true. What percent needs to be misinformation before censorship becomes valid?&quot; Those are important questions to ask, but they don&#x27;t generate enough hype and outrage for Twitter to answer them.
