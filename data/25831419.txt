I never believed this but found it funny to which lengths they would go to get people to pay the public subscription fees for their TVs.<p>Until the mid 2000&#x27;s they also hired free agents that were paid a commission for every &quot;black sheep&quot; they got to register. Of course these people regularly overstepped their mandate and found creative ways to intrude people&#x27;s homes, some would e.g. pose as TV technicians and ask if they could have a look at the cable as the neighbors reported some problems, only to reveal themselves as the GEZ guy once they were inside and saw the unregistered TV set. Of course all of that was illegal, and in 2007 (I think) the system was finally changed so that a given household would pay a fixed fee instead of a fee that depended on the number of receiving devices they had, which made using the &quot;collection mafia&quot; unnecessary. Still, the GEZ is by far the most hated agency in Germany and the subscription fees (around 18.5 € &#x2F; month) are among the most hated taxes people pay. Some people go as far as voting for an ultra right-wing party (AfD) only because they promise to do away with this fee should they come into power. Personally I don&#x27;t mind paying for it, though I&#x27;d prefer to be able to pay more selectively for services I use. Then again, less than 20 € &#x2F; month in additional tax for a single household isn&#x27;t anything to really get worked up over.')
