That part of their stance has been very consistent.</i><p>Besides being used internally as mentioned, making the Alpha Geeks (to use Tim O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s phrase) happy would be prudent for their continued success. If the Alpha Geeks aren&#x27;t using your product, they will not recommended it to their friends when asked for computer advise, and it will not be installed in relatives&#x27; home where the Alpha Geeks tend to do tech support.<p>The Alpha Geeks was how Apple probably got more popular that PCs in the first place, and they may now have a lot&#x2F;enough inertial to keep moving forward, but Microsoft and PCs used to be the 800-pound (400 kg) gorilla, and they&#x27;re less so now.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of Unix-y stuff being used in academy, research, and HPC: plenty of folks there would be just as willing to switch to a PC with Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian&#x2F;CentOS (which run the world&#x27;s HPC clusters) if macOS gets in the way of their workflow if Homebrew or Macports don&#x27;t work.')
