Every single kind of information you need to be able to work is hidden behind someone&#x27;s wall. I often lose entire weeks of productivity just trying to find who owns a certain information or knows which permission I need to request in order to read a link. There was a time I literally had to wait a whole month before the person was on vacation and their manager didn&#x27;t know how to authorize me into the system. All I needed was a binary file they provided.<p>Even worse: every team thinks the thing they do is absolutely the most important thing in the world so they hide it even more. They create empires around the information they control and explicitly force you out of it. So instead of just reading their freaking source code or documentation you have to get permission to open a ticket in their system, then you open it, then one person will triage your ticket, another will forward it, another will create an internal Jira about them, a PM will prioritize it, then a dev will gather the information and pass to the Senior Information Proxy employee who will instruct the intern to finally reply it in your ticket. And of course your original message was misunderstood so the thing they gave you is useless. All you needed was access to the damn thing, but they built an empire around it and now you have to fight a war of improductivity.')
