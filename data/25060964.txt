The main differences in methodology were making fewer assumptions about Republican turnout, larger sample sizes, and different survey techniques.<p>Trafalgar clearly missed some things: traditionally republican collar counties breaking hard for Biden. (My county didn&#x27;t vote for Obama either time, but voted for Biden by 12, after voting for the republican governor a couple of years ago by 38.) But 538 had some insane misses this year in critical states like Wisconsin (off by 7.7), Ohio (off by 7.3), Florida (off by 5.9), etc. Finalizing counts in NY and CA isn&#x27;t going to change those numbers--and Trafalgar wasn&#x27;t analyzing them anyway.')
