It doesn&#x27;t work well for creating leverage in term of wages though.<p>If anything, the impression I got at my last job where I was in the union was that the union negotiations mostly created an excuse for not increasing individual pay. &quot;Sure, you perform really great and all, but if we give you more we&#x27;ll have to reduce pay for someone else based on the agreed upon average increase.&quot;<p>For high-in-demand jobs such as SWE, the leverage of &quot;if you don&#x27;t maintain competitive pay I&#x27;ll probably start look around for other work&quot; is much more effective than union negotiations when no one is paid bad enough that they&#x27;d be willing to go on strike to get better terms.<p>Education is good and free enough that the supply of qualified labor would be hard to keep down without governmental intervention.')
