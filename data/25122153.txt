Article implies the term &quot;darknet&quot; is being used liberally, possibly to include spying on protestors, but is very unclear on the details.<p>Mounties have some sort of vuln in facebook that allows them to see your fb friends even if set to private (this is probably the most significant revelation in the article imo)<p>Mounties use proxy software when working undercover (no kidding, never would have guessed that one)<p>Mounties have software to do sentiment analysis on intercepted or publicly available messages<p>It is implied that the mounties have a caviler attitude towards privacy violations.<p>--------<p>The article is a little light on details and high on unstated implications. I&#x27;m not exactly happy about all this but this is hardly a bombshell of privacy violation. Maybe there is bad things there, but the article just doesn&#x27;t have the technical detail to judge.')
