Just lost a few hundred Tabs from last session. Not the first time this has happened to me on Safari. ( Firefox used to have this problem as well, they implemented multiple LastSession.json to combat the problem and it is basically a thing of the past.  )<p>2. Fav Icons meant they are no longer showing the Tab Description once you have a dozen tabs as they will shrink to Icons Size. So you either have normal Tabs or Tabs with Fav Icons, not both. ( This is new in Safari 14 )<p>3. Show Tab Overview will reload all the tabs, including those that were in idle &#x2F; unload state. If you are a heavy tab user you should not do this. Having a hundred tabs reload will cause <i>hundreds</i> of GB of Data written to your SSD. Basically shortening its lifespan.<p>4. AFAIK ( I could be wrong ), Extensions still requires you to have an $99&#x2F; year developer account. Some of my favourite extensions are now either paid or can no longer be used.<p>Apart from that, yes it is very good.')
