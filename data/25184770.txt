It may mesh better with your personal world view but it&#x27;s also a propaganda over facts publication. By that I don&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t factual but rather that they are very selective in which facts to surface in order to craft a narrative that will hopefully sway the reader into thinking a certain way.')
