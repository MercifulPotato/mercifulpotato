Yes, there are dozens of complex ideas I would love to work on, but they involve infrastructure and bootstrapping and a dozen other things that are useful, but not fun.<p>AdventOfCode, on the other hand, is completely worthless in the grand scheme of things, but has been fun as hell and provides me with a sense of accomplishment every day.<p>I’ve also got a Pimoroni environment sensor that was a lot of fun to set up and gives me fun graphs every day. Sure it provides (as far as I’m concerned) the same temperature and humidity reading as the $5 device I got at a random store, but it provided something for me to do that was relatively easy, involved an emerging interest for me (hardware), and in the end who doesn’t love graphs?')
