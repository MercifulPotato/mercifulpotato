While C programs focus on creating simple data structures and getting the task done with as few memory operations as possible, in Rust I&#x27;ve dominantly seen use of types, memory&#x2F;resource safety patterns and external libraries. My theory is that this removes direct understanding what happens and instead shifts the focus on how to get the task done while not violating the type system rules. In both cases, what the programmer minimizes in the first place might be the lines of code or maybe &quot;code complexity&quot;. (Assuming programmers tend to do what most directly leads to completion of the programming task).<p>I&#x27;m not in a position to claim that this theory is actually true, and I won&#x27;t take a stance which is &quot;better&quot;, but personally the former is much more appealing to me, for purely aesthetic reasons.')
