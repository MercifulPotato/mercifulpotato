I think that’s what the M1 will finally signal to all the other vendors, even though many have been saying this for a long time it’s proof in the wild that you can build desktop class ARM chips.<p>My other thought is I wonder if this will open up the idea of vendors support specific co-processors analogous to how Apple has things like the T1, some offloading to a specific chip for ML etc.<p>This is exciting if more vendors do this, I predict the first one to do it in an open way will win the day long term as it will be attractive to all upstream manufacturers like Dell etc')
