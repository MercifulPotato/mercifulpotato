The only thing that changes is time spent with coworkers, and time spent with children.<p>But when you&#x27;re at your office hacking away at your computer, are you really &quot;with coworkers&quot;?  Is it really less lonely to sit at your desk, with your coworkers at their desks, than it is to sit at the workbench in your garage with your wife in the house?<p>I know there are exceptions -- people whose spouse has died, who live alone, and crave every bit of social interaction they can get.  But on the whole this graph was fairly positive for me.')
