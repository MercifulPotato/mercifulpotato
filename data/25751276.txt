In that until toxic individuals insisted on testing its most extreme boundaries it was allowed to remain, in theory, nearly unlimited.<p>&quot;Free Speech&quot; is a great thing when it&#x27;s used with wisdom and solid judgment. It can be a vehicle for insight, innovation, and new ways to think about the world. This reflects the constructive uses of &quot;free speech&quot;<p>If you look at the other side of the coin you have these eruptions of toxic individualism. The power of &quot;free speech&quot; isn&#x27;t used for constructive reasons. Instead it&#x27;s a show of force. I am going to say this and there is nothing you can do to stop me. This has continued even as we see real material setbacks manifest because of this capricious use of &quot;free speech&quot;<p>Returning for a moment to the power of the pardon. It&#x27;s likely we will see that power reigned in. It was never scrutinized before because the wielders of that power always used it responsibly and judiciously. I think we&#x27;re going to have to turn the same scrutiny to speech on the internet. In the end you can point the fingers at the selfish few that ruined a good thing for the rest of us.')
