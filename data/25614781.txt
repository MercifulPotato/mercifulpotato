Well, I find that advanced dynamically typed languages tend to be hard to read in general, because you can never be sure what type your inputs and outputs are and what values they can take. Usually my<p>At least idiomatic Python shuns wildcard imports that obfuscate where symbols are coming from (that drove me insane in Ruby).<p>On the other hand Rust code tends to be very strict about what your types are (even more so than a language like C++ where metaprogramming is duck-typed by default). It can lead to complicated code, but baring some weird operator overloading decision you should know exactly what calls what from whom when you look at any method or function.<p>Rust code can be tricky to write at times, but I generally find it a pleasure to read. Sure, ultra-complicated generic code can be overwhelming, but this complexity would be here in one form or the other regardless of the language, Rust just forces you to be explicit about it.')
