I do think &quot;Haskell has an unusually low amount of gotchas&quot; isn&#x27;t a subjective argument that applies to any language. Also, no, yours &quot;Haskell works better than other languages as long as you happen to know how to make it so&quot; can&#x27;t apply to every language, by construction you can only put one language on itÂ¹, unless you assume that Haskell is the <i>only</i> language the developer knows well, what would make for a really lame argument.<p>But &quot;you won&#x27;t be able to use it well if you don&#x27;t learn how to use it&quot; does indeed apply to all languages. Yet, it&#x27;s more relevant for some, and Haskell is one of those more affected by it.<p>It is a fact that Haskell is not beginner friendly. Your first program on it will suck, whatever proficiency you have with other languages (there are some people that argue that it is easier if you know less beforehand). It takes some learning before you are able to get the better safety, high productivity and easy collaboration people talk so much about (and even then, you won&#x27;t get those for <i>every</i> problem, the language has limitations too).<p>1 - The statement is false anyway. There&#x27;s no such language one can single out there without more context.')
