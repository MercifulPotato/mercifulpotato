To me that makes every open source project a potential ethical minefield since they could all be getting used to do immoral acts without even knowing about it.<p>As a concrete example, most of Palantir’s indexing and searching back when I was there was done using lucene. Should the lucene authors feel some moral conflict over this? If we’re shifting blame&#x2F;responsibility down the tech stack why stop at the productized form? Why not the libraries? Why not the language?<p>I understand that the case is different since Palantir is more purpose built for this type of work, but you have to admit the lines get blurry pretty quickly.')
