One is that DIF&#x2F;DIX disks are not easily available at reasonable prices.<p>The other potential shortcoming is that it provides substantially weaker consistency guarantees than what people are used to.    After all of the scan threads are finished with the recovery, yes, the file system metadata will be self-consistent; but that&#x27;s all you can count upon.<p>Suppose that a particular file is getting updated at the time of the crash.   There might be several blocks that were newly allocated right before the crash, and the a larger number of data blocks that were getting overwritten right before the crash.   There is no guarantee which set of data blocks will be persistent across the reboot, and which newly allocated blocks will actually be attached to the file.  There might also be newly allocated blocks that were attached to the file, but the data might not be written to the block, such that stale data (the previous contents of the block, which mgiht be another user&#x27;s medical data, or private e-mail, etc.) that would become visible to the file across the crash.')
