Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606193738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188722, text='&gt;  If you have functionally unlimited funds, you can just use them to astroturf, which, as we&#x27;ve seen, can be far more effective than advertising.<p>Exactly, the amount of psy-ops via bots and entities like the CCP&#x27;s Wumao Army are going to be way more effective at steering the narrative in your favour way more than any short-lived &#x27;viral&#x27; ad or targeted ad campaign.<p>Furthermore, it can be sustained for much longer periods of time and can foment and incite way more resentment than any controversial or persuasive ad, because of the associations to other conflict-based facebook groups.<p>This is all really to say that the underlying surveillance economy is entirely indifferent to labels such as &#x27;communism&#x27; or &#x27;capitalism&#x27; and seem ephemeral and fleeting when the means&#x2F;methods and desirable ends are the same as each other: manipulation by discord.<p>The fact that this takes place is not a surprise as psy-ops, conspiracy and counter-intelligence have been the mainstays of every single Nation-state&#x27;s intelligence agencies; what is a surprise to me is how widely adopted and how pervasive it has been for so much of the Human population when there is SO MUCH MORE interesting aspects of the Internet. And how readily people are drawn to go for such shallow fodder when presented the opportunity to do so.<p>It&#x27;s all so <i>High School,</i> and for those of us that got fed up with it when we were (forced) in it we cannot see the value or appeal to any of it: I got a small chuckle in passing from the whole &#x27;Space Karen&#x27; spat with Elon after he supposedly tested positive for COVID and was not able to go to the Cape, but rather than waste my time digging into it or anything else related to that drama that led up to it I just kept the stream from the Crew flight on throughout the entire mission and then stopped listening to anything related to that entirely until I had time to watch the Sentinel launch this morning. Which was pretty rad, and dedicated to an amazing man who devoted much of his life to the pursuit of studying and monitoring Climate Science and Ocean levels and made incredible contributions to the discipline before tragically losing his battle with cancer this year: Michael Freilich [0].<p>His children&#x27;s recounting of their father was incredibly touching and it made my day to hear their story and relationship with Micheal.<p>By contrast, I felt physically ill for several days trying to follow the impact of Anonymous&#x27; Blue Leaks on twitter without an account during the riots. I&#x27;m not prepared to subject myself to such a degrading sense of mental health for what seems like vapid forms of entertainment, especially with so much more beneficial and fruitful things to be in engaged in, both on and offline.<p>The concept of &#x27;de-evolution&#x27; comes to mind anytime I hear about the latest twitter beef that spills over into real life that often leads to violence: Follow Live: Violent white supremacists (proud boys) clash with Liberal snowflakes (BLM protestors)! Its often feels like we&#x27;re filling in the missing parts to the prelude of Idiocracy.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarsystem.nasa.gov&#x2F;people&#x2F;432&#x2F;michael-freilich&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarsystem.nasa.gov&#x2F;people&#x2F;432&#x2F;michael-freilich&#x2F;</a>')
