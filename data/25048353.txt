Its been a while since I’ve done it, but heres the short version.<p>1. I found a version of linux (voyage maybe?) that had some pxe boot stuff setup automatically.  I just had to set the dhcp range and a few other options. Any distro with pxe boot works but I’m lazy.<p>2. Plugged the soekris box into my laptops ethernet port.  The linux distro was just a vm.  Set up the vm so its nic could communicate with the physical laptop ethernet port.<p>3. Hooked a serial cable up to the soekris and set it to pxe boot.  I had to find the manual to figure out what speed i needed for the serial port.  I want to say default was 9600, but double check.  Then it got the image from the linux vm and was enough to get me a cmd line via serial port.<p>4.  I copied the pfsense cf (i think its called that) to a exfat USB flash drive and plugged it into the USB port on the soekris.<p>5.  I mounted the USB flash drive on the soekris and used dd to copy the image to the internal cf card.<p>6.  Reboot the soekris when done, change boot order on it, if applicable, and from there plug the soekris into the network or somewhere where it can get a dhcp address so you can finish setup from a web browser.<p>If you’re interested i might be able to find my notes on it, but its probably been 5+ years.')
