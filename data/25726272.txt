It&#x27;s unclear what % of costs of revenue is attributable to &quot;salaries of software engineers&quot;, though.  Let&#x27;s approach it another way.  Google employs 30k+ SWEs, the vast majority of which are in the US.  The median outlay probably falls somewhere in the L4 - L5 range, though there&#x27;s a fat tail at the top.  If we want to be conservative, we can just ignore the tail and say ~300k&#x2F;dev.  $300k * 30k = $9b (this is probably low).<p>Google&#x27;s net income in 2019 was $34b.  So you could multiply SWE comp at Google by not-quite-5 and zero out Google&#x27;s net income.<p>What do top pro athletes make?  Wikipedia says the top pro athletes earn mid-high eight-figures&#x2F;year.<p>There&#x27;s some headroom to pay engineers more, but it&#x27;s definitely not &quot;top pro athlete&quot; more.  Engineers can and do make that kind of money by founding &amp; growing successful startups, not by working for FAANG (possibly with a very small # of exceptions at the top).')
