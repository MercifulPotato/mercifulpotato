Then there&#x27;s the issue of game developers who make their game (or essential parts of it) so unpleasant that people are tempted to pay real money to avoid playing it. &quot;Robux&quot; sounds like a system that is ripe for misuse.<p>&gt; It took months of gentle denials to my kids &amp; constant explanations about the relative value of spending their week&#x27;s allowance on something that will save them 10 minutes to finally convince them these things aren&#x27;t worth it.<p>A lesson many adults should learn as well!')
