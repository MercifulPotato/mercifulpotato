I try to upvote points of view I disagree with, especially when they are in response to my own comments.  I believe this policy encourages interesting discussion.<p>I reserve the downvote for comments that are mean-spirited or total non-sequiturs.  I flag even more rarely, and that&#x27;s for blatant bad behavior.  I avoid engaging in any way at all on threads that deal with political issues I feel strongly about.  Any engagement, even downvotes, is fuel for the fire.')
