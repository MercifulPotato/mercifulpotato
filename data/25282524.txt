Since capacity for Snowflake is sold in very small tranches(we at one time got a bill for less than a dollar for the month during our on-demand time), I assumed the new contract could be issued with very small, essentially token amounts, this point is where the rep more or less waved his hands on and I agree I should have not trusted his portrayal. Honestly he may be working with the constrains of changing policies imposed on him too, so I def take responsibility here. Just as I mentioned, the post is for people who may be looking at similar clauses and coming to the wrong assumption that I did to not repeat the same mistake.')
