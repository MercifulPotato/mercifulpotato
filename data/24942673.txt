I&#x27;m curious how you got there.<p>I think a large part of that for me is because early in my career I got involved in Unix kernel work, first writing device drivers and later doing Unix ports, including both porting a swapping Unix to paged hardware (and rewriting pretty much all process and memory management from scratch) and porting a paging Unix to swapping hardware.<p>That was followed by a few years largely doing embedded stuff on systems too small to have operating systems or memory management units. For those I&#x27;d write a small kernel that supported threads and scheduling (sometimes cooperative and sometimes preemptive) and then write the embedded applications much like I would have written them on Unix, using threads instead of processes.<p>So for me threads are easy and things like async&#x2F;wait seem overly complicated and less clear because I came at concurrency from the operating system side of things and the hardware side of things (e.g., dealing with interrupts) where thread-like thinking is natural and perhaps required.<p>Maybe it is conceptually harder for people who come at it from the application side of things?')
