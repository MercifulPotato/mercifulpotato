Putting aside the kind&#x2F;unkind learning environment debate, what do you think breadth&#x2F;diversification looks like for programmers? What does it mean for a programmer to &#x27;develop broad perspectives&#x27; in order to help them better solve problems? Would this entail venturing into different, perhaps even unconventional domains (graphics, hardware)? Or simply reading widely outside of tech&#x2F;CS topics in general (economics, biology, etc)? What do you guys think?')
