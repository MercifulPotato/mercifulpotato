Kids need to learn the psychology of money&#x2F;finance as much as the knowledge about it. Just finished Morgan Housel&#x27;s &quot;Psychology of Money&quot; and it should be required curriculum (every year) for high school and especially college students. When my kids are older, they are definitely reading it!')
