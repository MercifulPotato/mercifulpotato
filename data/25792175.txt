I myself have used dropbox for personal stuff, and onedrive with several of my previous employers for years now.  For any person or business that i know who is all-in on microsoft products&#x2F;services, i recommend to just adopt leveraging oneDrive, and life for them gets easier. (I didn&#x27;t say better in other ways...but certainly easier.)<p>In fact, oneDrive is good enough that i signed up my family for the o365 family plan, because the cost is hard to beat (and because my family doesn&#x27;t care if their machine is windows or linux)... But, when i went to start mixing in my files (vs my partner&#x27;s and rest of family&#x27;s files)...I learned that onedrive does __NOT RUN NATIVELY ON LINUX__ ...and linux is my personal daily driver.  Hence, while my family, and all of our collective and shared files (including family photos) live on a paid oneDrive account, my stuff (files that really only pertain to me like dev. projects, etc.) live in dropbox, because dropbox runs decent enough on my linux machine. I can not wait for the day when dropbox is NOT the only decent option for linux machines.  (Caveat: I am a big fan of nextcloud, but they&#x27;re not there just yet...hopefully soon though!)')
