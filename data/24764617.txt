It&#x27;s more likely that nickel and iron would be used as construction materials in space, to make satellites and stations cheaper by reducing the launch mass required.<p>The profitable stuff to ship to Earth would be platinum-group metals, which have values in the tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram. But those require much more capital investment, as you need to get to farther-off asteroids and do more intensive in-space refining.')
