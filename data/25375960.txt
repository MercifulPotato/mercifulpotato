In reality, I&#x27;ve never even heard of anybody who&#x27;s completed a CS degree (or any other degree) who works as a developer who didn&#x27;t <i>also</i> learn independently exactly the same way people who didn&#x27;t get a four-year degree did.  The CS curriculum seems to <i>expect</i> this and instead of focusing on the things that you can realistically learn on your own, focusing on the things that you&#x27;re probably not going to come across on your own.')
