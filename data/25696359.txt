The United States right? Social Media operates in 100+ countries. What happened in USA is historic for you maybe. Not for us. USA is not the World.<p>Regimes fall every now and then. Coup attempts happen all the time. I have never seen media or social media ban any Government account over it.<p>I guess Social Media has a different conscience for when regime change&#x2F;coup-d&#x27;etat happens in say Iraq vs when it happens in USA.<p>What this has done is set a very bad precedent. The Big Tech is acting like Supranational Powers overriding what Elected Governments can and cannot do. Remember that the transfer of power hasn&#x27;t completed yet. Trump is still the elected President of USA until 20th of January.<p>If Big Tech can do this to a sitting elected President, it can do it to anyone else. No Government in the World is safe from Big Tech censorship.')
