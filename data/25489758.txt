I think it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re young and don&#x27;t want to settle down, otherwise I think you&#x27;ll be worse off than e.g. in Munich or Berlin. Also the general culture if way less accomodating to foreigners in Switzerland, even as a German you&#x27;ll never be &quot;part of the club&quot;. In Berlin people care way less where you&#x27;re from, almost everyone moved here either from other parts of Germany or from abroad.')
