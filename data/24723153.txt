Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602186888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722881, text='&gt; Has anyone come up with an ed with the advantages of a modern screen, so it shows the full file on the side but you can still run ed commands on it?<p>Unless I misunderstood you, it&#x27;s called Vi(m).<p>&gt; I am curious if anyone uses ed as their editor of choice these days, assuming an actual screen and such of course. If so, why? Muscle memory?<p>If I&#x27;m on a machine where the choices of editor are either ed or nano, I prefer ed.<p>Also, if I want to do some text processing on a bunch of files and it&#x27;s simpler to do it with an ed script than with sed or awk, I&#x27;ll use ed. It has happened.<p>If I remember right, I wanted to edit some upper lines when some lower lines matched some regex for a bunch of files. It ended up being an ed command like &#x27;g&#x2F;foo&#x2F;?bar?s&#x2F;baz&#x2F;qux&#x2F;&#x27;. Doing something like that with sed or awk gets more complicated.<p>&gt; Edit: ... I was thinking of something a little less different, like literally just a command prompt on the bottom and a pane above centered on the line you just operated on.<p>If you stick to command-mode, that&#x27;s pretty much what vi and vim are. You <i>could</i> run this in vim:<p><pre><code>  :cmap &lt;enter&gt; &lt;enter&gt;:\n</code></pre>\nto re-enter command-mode automatically as soon as you leave it.')
