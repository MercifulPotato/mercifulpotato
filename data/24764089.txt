The issue though is with the last-mile travel. How do you get from the train station to your house? Walk and you&#x27;ll get mugged, esp. if you walk a regular route with expensive equipment on you, otherwise you take an Uber.<p>The minibus taxes aren&#x27;t roadworthy and drive like demons. So most people in Gauteng own a car with anti-hijack coatings on the window, or they Uber.<p>In Cape Town there is no longer a working rail system because the trains were burned by the protesting populace. Even when the trains were running (with huge delays), you&#x27;d get pickpocketed on the train. You could never risk travelling at night if you had anything valuable on you.')
