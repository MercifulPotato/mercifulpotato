It&#x27;s soooooooooo fucking good I&#x27;m telling you. It just works, be it on web, mobile, and desktop.<p>At this point who the fuck knows if Durov can be trusted (hell we all wish, right, no harm in that). But regardless of that, at the end of the day I&#x27;d be willing to admit he&#x27;s a fucking genius when it comes to Telegram&#x27;s UX and DX.')
