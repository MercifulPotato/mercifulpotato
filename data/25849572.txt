It&#x27;s quite short. My wife is Chinese and I&#x27;ve spent a bit of time over there. It&#x27;s hard for me to tell which aspects of cultural behaviour over there are a product of several generations of communist rule and which date back earlier. What I can say is the business environment over there is bare naked ruthless. It&#x27;s always possible to make a deal, right up to the moment it isn&#x27;t and then you&#x27;re done. As for social order, the Chinese believe in the rule of authority, not law.')
