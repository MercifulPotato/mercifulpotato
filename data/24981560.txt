The husband made the decision to make the divorce as painful as possible (falsifying evidence, perjuring himself) to try to get her to give up and let him keep all of the money (he keeps the $400k house, she keeps the $5k SUV), and ultimately, it largely worked. Would you pay $50k to avoid having a miserable year? I would&#x27;ve kept fighting on principle, but she&#x27;s wiser than I am.<p>Whether or not any of this was fair, eh. The mistake she made was to enter into a binding legal contract with someone that didn&#x27;t have a clearly defined, equitable exit path. She misjudged her husband, but no one&#x27;s immune to that. Honest people will want to write everything down and be bound to their word.<p>Don&#x27;t make agreements based on mutual trust and assumed cooperation into perpetuity. It&#x27;s only once people&#x27;s incentives shift away from cooperation that you get to see their true character, for better and worse.')
