You enter the train at around 22:25, then it arrives at London around 6:45 in the morning, then you have breakfast and walk over to St, Pancras International and can get the leaving Eurostar at 10:00 or so. Only two train changes. In the afternoon in Brussels and around 17:00 in Cologne. It is very convenient when you have either a good book or work on a laptop because you are going to have quiet quality time which you will probably not have in an airport.<p>For booking, one has to be careful to book the inter-European distances from Brussels with a reduced price a bit in advance (for example from the German bahn.de web site). It&#x27;s called Eurosparpreis or so. Also, for the British trains there are resellers which sell the seats much more expensive, so one has to watch out not to be short-changed.<p>By the way, another and often cheaper alternative is to take the ferry from Newcastle to Ijmuiden&#x2F;NL which is a port of Amsterdam. As well as the Caledonian Sleeper, it leaves in the evening and arrives at breakfast time. And you have a nice two-people cabin which is a good place to sleep. It can be like 120 â‚¬ per person for a return ticket.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dfds.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;passenger-ferries&#x2F;ferry-crossings&#x2F;ferries-to-uk&#x2F;amsterdam-newcastle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dfds.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;passenger-ferries&#x2F;ferry-crossings&#x2F;fe...</a>')
