Item(by='1propionyl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610838539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798039, text='&gt; What works instead is voting with feet&#x2F;dollars.<p>So I both agree and disagree. On one hand, yes, one person voting with feet&#x2F;dollars has a relatively large impact compared to one person raising a complaint. But if we look at the entire ecology of users, the story is different.<p>Many of the people who end up voting with their feet do so after being exposed to people raising complaints. And on the flip side, people who see their friends voting with their feet may then seek out the explanations and complaints leading to that action.<p>Just uninstalling an app is very low information density as a signal. It doesn&#x27;t provide any reason <i>why</i>, it&#x27;s just a single bit. It&#x27;s value is more as an action rather than a statement.<p>I think the ideal is somewhere in between, and we need both concrete action (voting with your feet) as well as public discourse (raising complaints). The former without the latter is inscrutable, the latter without the former is toothless.')
