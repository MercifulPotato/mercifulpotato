One key is that I&#x27;m not looking for an abstraction, I&#x27;m looking to provide an abstraction. I run infrastructure teams that provide the infrastructure as a product to other engineering teams, including build and deployment systems. So I need a system that is flexible enough that I can create the abstraction I want to provide. Most of the tools in this space either abstract away everything, in an opinionated way that I don&#x27;t agree with. Or they abstract away too little, so I would have to write a heavy abstraction over the abstraction. Waypoint, with its plugin system and if the HCL syntax is expanded to support reusable templates&#x2F;modules, may provide a good building block for me.')
