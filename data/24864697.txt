It used this tactic to kill or maim a long list of companies: Netscape, Lotus, WordPerfect, Aldus, Novell, Sybase, STAC, Central Point Software, Quarterdeck, and dozens more.</i>&quot;<p>Netscape defunct 2003, FireFox still exists.\nLotus 1-2-3 last release 2002.\nSybase still existed until it was sold to SAP in 2010 and SAP killed it in 2014.\nWordPerfect still exists.\nQuarterdeck defunct 1998.<p>Sun, Java, ActiveX, ASP. 1990s.<p>Anything from this last decade? And, how is &quot;this tactic&quot; going to stop you from using Linux?<p>&gt; &quot;<i>It has a long long history of being the nastiest, most deceitful, dishonest, back-stabbing company in the computer industry -- and that is saying a lot.</i>&quot;<p>Cruelty, ruthlessness, and exploitation goes with success in capitalism.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>TL;DR -- it spends just enough money that Gates &amp; Buffett don&#x27;t pay tax on the interest of their wealth; it does not do ethical investment of any kind; its objective is whitewashing the reputation of a retired criminal, in which it is very successful.</i>&quot;<p>Character attack on a retired man, based on bad things which happened a generation ago, while giving free pass to Google who are strongarming the web with AMP and unilateral changes to Chrome, and unilateral standards which were proprietary Google internals released to the world, because they use Linux in their advertising-spyware mobile platform, and to Amazon, a much maligned company run by one of the current world&#x27;s richest people, known for its mistreatment of employees and abusive attitude to the publishing industry, and for using its cloud platform to steal and reimplement popular services and put them out of business, free pass for current bad behaviour because they let people run Linux cheaply?')
