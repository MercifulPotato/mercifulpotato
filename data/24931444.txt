I&#x27;m not knowledgeable at all about investing, which is why my savings are in Vanguard index funds to begin with. I have two that are up nearly 70% over the last 10 years or so. If you buy and hold these things you&#x27;re investing in the long term functioning and health of the economy, which has proven over the last few centuries to be a decent bet. If civilizational collapse messes with your returns the state of your index funds will be the least of your worries.')
