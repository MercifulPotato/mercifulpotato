I would imagine that Texas might also be hostile to embezzlement.<p>(I can imagine a similar investigation by a pro-gun DA going very poorly for the executives in question. Suppose you support the NRAâ€™s mission and discover that the leadership has embezzled most of the funding. You might want to throw the leaders in question in jail and strongly encourage new leaders to use any new funding for the actual nominal purpose of the NRA.)')
