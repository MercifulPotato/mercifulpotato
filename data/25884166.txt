Screw that noise, literally.<p>Your messaging habit of sending each message fragment as a new notification is the most annoying. 5 messages to communicate one thought?  You have no respect for other people or their attention and are so self centered that even at their explicit request you can’t use the shift key when hitting enter.<p>You,re the type of communicator I’d have to look up Slack documentation to mute all messages. And forever more you would get no synchronous responses. And that’d be ok: you lack respect, you don’t deserve respect.')
