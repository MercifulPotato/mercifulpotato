Sorry for the effect that has on your karma though)<p>The dangerous part is presuming that no good software can come from OO. A comment like &quot;I would prefer to see this in a functional paradigm, with as few side effects as possible&quot; is absolutely fine.<p>The statement that all OO is bad makes an absolute out of a subjective, rubbishes the work and effort of millions and may cause a relative beginner to ignore learning a paradigm that is fundamental to their growth and learning as a developer.<p>Now then, that said... if you wanted an argument over avoiding OOP, I would argue any statement that categorically says &quot;Avoid X&quot; is an oversimplification. Everything is a balance of strengths and weaknesses, and there are times when OO is the right tool for the job. You are welcome to disagree, and I wouldn&#x27;t downvote you for doing so _in this context_, but in a Stack Overflow context, depending on how you say it, I very well might if I considered your words dangerous enough.<p>(i.e. Silver bullets kill more than just werewolves)')
