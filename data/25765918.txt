Secondly, ARM is growing rapidly for workloads in places like AWS and many think there will be a lot of growth on-prem as well. Apple&#x27;s symbolically important for Arm in the sense that it shows switching to a non-x86 architecture for a laptop is possible but they&#x27;re fairly irrelevant from a volume perspective.<p>If one assumes that x86 remains the dominant architecture in the industry then, yes, it&#x27;s basically a zero sum market share game between Intel and AMD.
