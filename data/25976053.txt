I also believe they provide a service that doesn’t benefit the average American because it’s inaccessible. Even if they could, does it provide value or does it exist only to add inefficiency and extract wealth for those who are already more wealthy?<p>I think many people see the extremely wealthy such as those running Citadel as the people who play by different rules than the rest because of their wealth. Does that make them evil? I don’t think so, but I’m not going to pretend that having the wealth and relationships to get political favors means you earned your wealth fairly.')
