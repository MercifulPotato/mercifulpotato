This is how they sustain developers to continue working on Elastic Search. This model has worked for companies long before cloud providers were a thing. What AWS and others basically did is create identical services, keep all the profits, and exploit gaps in Open Source licensing to this end.<p>First, Elastic sells a buckload of licenses for on-premises ELK, which is a vastly bigger market than managed services. And second, how is Amazon different from &quot;other companies&quot; you mention? Just because they&#x27;re bigger and have a ton of experience with managed services they should be forbidden from offering managed ELK?')
