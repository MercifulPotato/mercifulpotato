I think their original value point was lowering friction in payment systems and reasonable rates. Stripe still does those things really really well, but so did Braintree (now part of PayPal).<p>Where Stripe absolutely nailed it is the infrastructure around it. Their SDK documentation and continous improvements still outpace Braintree.<p>For instance, Stripe has custom elements that you can use to interact seamlessly with their SDK, with little setup needed[0]<p>I could not find a similiar integration from Braintree.<p>Compartively, I find their informational SDK page a bit more polished than Braintree, respectively, though I realize some of this is personal style and taste, Stripe has clear pathways for me to find the information I want right on the side bar and referenced throughout the landing page for the client SDK[1] where as Braintree[2] is more narrowly focused, which with payments, may mean I miss a better set of features I should be aware of.<p>Reducing frictions and painpoints is what they won with, in the end. It was easy to setup and maintain. How many 3rd party services have both of those things that handle something as complex as payments? I can&#x27;t even get AWS integrations with their own SDKs working together without some effort<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;payments&#x2F;elements" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;payments&#x2F;elements</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stripe-js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stripe-js</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.braintreepayments.com&#x2F;start&#x2F;hello-client&#x2F;javascript&#x2F;v3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.braintreepayments.com&#x2F;start&#x2F;hello-client&#x2F;...</a>')
