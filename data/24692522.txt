Then this string is injected into the directive `@sendEmail` (which would be provided by some WP plugin), and added to the schema through IFTTT rules, as I&#x27;ve described here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.logrocket.com&#x2F;adding-directives-schema-code-first-graphql-servers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.logrocket.com&#x2F;adding-directives-schema-code-fir...</a><p>As a result, the user can install a WP plugin, add `@sendEmail` to the schema through configuration, and customize the email, without touching one line of code.')
