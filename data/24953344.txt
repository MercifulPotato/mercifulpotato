Because that would be super weird: of course learning about the history of the modern caste system changes things in the present. And don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that, just because dead British are to blame, that absolves everyone else from blame too:<p>Dead british are to blame for setting it in motion, and everyone who reinforces today is <i>also</i> to blame, for keeping it alive.
