Being able to install Linux or Windows or what have you doesn&#x27;t really impact that much, since the option to reinstall macOS and return to that &quot;integratedness&quot; always exists, and since there&#x27;s nobody holding a gun to &quot;normal&quot; users&#x27; heads saying &quot;you must install an entirely different operating system&quot; (and indeed, Apple taking a stance of &quot;we don&#x27;t officially support this, and strongly suggest you stick with macOS, but if you really know what you&#x27;re doing we won&#x27;t get in your way&quot; would be perfectly reasonable).<p>Nowadays, especially on iOS, it seems like the software is the focus.  I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s a mistake that will sooner rather than later bite Apple in the ass.  Hopefully the switch to M1 is a sign that Apple realizes this and wants to move back toward making top-notch hardware instead of coasting on App Store rent-seeking and planned obsolescence.')
