I remember when Zebra mussels first appeared in the Great Lakes. Tens of articles appeared, how this was an epic natural disaster, that would kill the Great Lakes Eco system, because Zebra mussels would eat all the food. \nNow decades later, it turns out that Zebra mussels are great at filter feeding, and have thrived. But this also cleared up the water greatly. To the point that the lakes can look almost tropical, ocean clear, on sunny summer days.<p>Which is probably great for all kinds of plants that now thrive on the extra sunshine reaching deeper down. \nIt seems like the system just rearranged itself, and new opportunities appeared for some other plants to thrive.')
