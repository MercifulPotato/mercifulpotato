Poland is a little less than 32K average, Japan is around 38K, OECD data from 2019. Somewhere between Japan and Poland is where the average worker starts to be poor. Interesting.<p>And that is at the present time, every generation going back to the invention of agriculture had it worse. Someone making 32K a year - PPP adjusted - is in what, the top few percent of all humans that have ever lived? Poor bastard. Learn to code.<p>In the same way that if everything is about politics, nothing is about politics, if everyone is poor, no one is poor. And if these people aren&#x27;t making a living wage while making what the top few percent of humans have ever made, how did our ancestors manage to live and have children on a sub-living wage? Shouldn&#x27;t they have died out?<p>I think in this case, &quot;living wage&quot; is just a propaganda term. &quot;Poor&quot; is too I guess. I guess maybe that propaganda term works on people, &quot;living wage&quot;. It seems to be effective propaganda, seems to be working. I just cringe every time I read it. Adjusted for inflation, I made $7 an hour working in a factory. Decades later you&#x27;re going to tell me that isn&#x27;t a living wage, more than twice what I made back then wasn&#x27;t a living wage? Was I lucky to survive?<p>That&#x27;s bullshit by the technical definition of bullshit, and its propaganda.<p>Anyway, these arguments usually split people into two camps, people who worked warehouse or factory jobs before, and people who haven&#x27;t.')
