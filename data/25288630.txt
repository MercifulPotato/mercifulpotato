Their attention to performance is innate, their attention to critical obscure details is innate, and their desire to write code they are proud is innate. Plus they come with advanced, useful math knowledge. I love former game developers because they did the pop culture dev job, saw it was exploitation, and took their incredibly optimized skills elsewhere.')
