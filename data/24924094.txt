The problem is I&#x27;m on this dopamine treadmill. I see a thread with an interesting topic and a lot of comments, and I want to dive in and spend an hour sifting through it. I check my subreddits and HN every day.<p>And for what? I get nothing out of it, maybe a little pissed off every now and then. Most articles I read are forgettable and have no impact on my life. There is literally nothing that I&#x27;ve learned on the internet over close to two decades of use that I couldn&#x27;t learn more thoroughly with a book or by looking at a newspaper, and in recent years it&#x27;s been getting impossible to find actual factual subject information on the internet that isn&#x27;t some half assed SEOified article that doesn&#x27;t even have my answer.<p>I think I&#x27;m just gonna pull the plug and block these websites with some browser extension, because I am just too compulsive at this point, too engrained into this automatic unconscious action of cmd+t-&gt;news.y-&gt;tab-&gt;enter to do it under my own volition. Sometimes I sit down and I don&#x27;t even remember opening HN, but there I am scrolling through the front page.<p>I still need the internet for emails, stack overflow, or finding articles in my field, but that sort of use I will allow because I take that information and synthesize it into something novel and useful. I&#x27;m going to pull the plug on being a mindless internet consumer, who leaves no time for actual thinking in between the rampant consumption.<p>Good bye, HN, hopefully for good but we will see how long I&#x27;m able to remain disciplined. I&#x27;m kinda excited about what sort of mental clarity this might bring me and how much that will improve my life.')
