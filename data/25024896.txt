There&#x27;s enough compatibility between MS Office and LibreOffice to exchange the occasional file, but when you get down to complex usage, you really need to pick between the two.<p>For anyone with IT knowledge, such a switch is easy. For most people in most companies it&#x27;s not, though. Loads of people needed workshops and training when MS introduced the ribbon design, and some people that couldn&#x27;t adapt still swear by their old Office 2003 installs. Lots of people learn not to use feature X to accomplish Y, but to click button Z to make Y happen. Even people who advertise &quot;experience with computers&quot; on their resum√© are often unable to adapt to different software because they only know how to do something in a certain software package and don&#x27;t know how to figure out (use Google) how to get feature parity.<p>The sad state of modern offices is that it&#x27;s somehow okay to be &quot;not good at computers&quot; even when your job is centered around using them. Whenever something small changes, people will call IT to &quot;fix&quot; it because they&#x27;re now confused.<p>In young, small companies and startups this isn&#x27;t a problem per se, other than needing to Google to see how to do a certain task, but most companies in the world aren&#x27;t capable of switching to another product without sending everyone to a workshop to learn how to use a new product. There&#x27;s very little workshops centered on open source software, making is nearly impossible as a company to pick anything other than MS Office or, these days, the Google office suite.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem of compatibility. Most people on the company i work at run some flavour of Linux so everyone has LibreOffice installed. All of our customers use Excel to basically run their business. Sometimes, sheets need to be exchanged. We run into trouble that certain parts of their Excel sheets just don&#x27;t work correctly, just because of the sheer volume and complexity of the files exchanged as with companies basically running on Excel sheets. We have a few people with MS Excel licenses for those cases. You simply cannot ignore compatibility in situations like that.')
