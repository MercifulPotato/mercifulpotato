Item(by='falcolas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604704080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011320, text='FWIW, monetization strategies do influence how a game plays - at least for people who don’t pay extra.<p>Energy limits how much you can play the game in a particular day.<p>XP Bonuses ensure that there’s a greater-than-normal (probably dull) grind to progress through the game.<p>Cosmetics mean that there will be few, if any, cosmetic rewards for playing the game. (An aside: yes, this matters. If cosmetics weren’t an important part of a game, why would they sell them?)<p>Lootboxes (gacha, etc) mean that the ability to make substantial progress through the game will rely on luck (and grinds to get the chance to test that luck).<p>And, something new coming to roguelikes&#x2F;lites, “Undo” consumables mean that you’ll be starting over more than you’d expect to.<p>Otherwise, I agree with your overall definition of Roguelikes.')
