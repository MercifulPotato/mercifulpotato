(Eg, not on the Euro, or a currency pegged to another currency.)<p>The idea is that you create money to pay for things, and then pull back excess money through taxes. (As opposed to pulling in money through taxes, using it to pay for things, and whining that you don&#x27;t have enough.) So it &#x27;works&#x27; as long as you have your own independent national currency.<p>Another mind flip: the scarce resource isn&#x27;t money - it can always be generated - but labor. Inflation starts when there&#x27;s a labor shortage, because up to that point you can just employ more people to meet demands.')
