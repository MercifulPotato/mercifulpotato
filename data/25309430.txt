It also isn&#x27;t possible to send from aliases on Fastmail. I find Fastmail&#x27;s UI&#x2F;UX to be too cumbersome for what I want to do with my email.<p>Once I&#x27;ve added a few more key features and polished the UI a bit, I am planning on revamping the landing page to make things clearer.<p>Thanks again for the feedback. It&#x27;s incredibly useful.')
