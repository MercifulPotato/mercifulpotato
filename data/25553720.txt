When corporation profits were at stake everybody threw money at solutions that instantly and automatically solve the issue to everyone&#x27;s advantage but the users&#x27; - copyright infringement. Now we get the &quot;policing is hard, man&quot; discourse from one of the biggest companies in the world, with the biggest userbase in the world. Indeed, the solution to this problem may not be technical but they&#x27;re still miking everything for profit while claiming it&#x27;s hard to come up with a solution and people are rightfully skeptical of their stance and vilifying them.')
