One of the textbook examples is homelessness, whose root cause is lack of a social safety net that helps people with mental problems cope with their condition instead of throwing them in jail. The other one is drug abuse, where it&#x27;s far more cost effective to treat addictions as diseases than to throw drug addicts in jail.<p>The only instances I ever saw of calls being made to disband police departments were due to rampant systemic corruption problems affecting some police departments which are too entrenched to salvage, and how the US has already a long history of tackling that type of problem by replacing the whole police department with a brand new one.')
