In SC4, things like subway entrances and bus stops always take up a full tile, when they&#x27;re typically no more than a portion of the sidewalk or a road sign (and maybe a shelter), respectively.<p>- Mixed-use zoning.  It&#x27;s probably been the single biggest wish I&#x27;ve had for the SimCity games.  It&#x27;s impossible to build a vertical downtown if you&#x27;re stuck trying to mix together commercial and residential plots, when many residential buildings along avenues feature ground-level commercial (making them effectively &quot;light&quot; density commercial contained within &quot;dense&quot; residential).')
