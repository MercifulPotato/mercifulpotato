The high pressures change the speed of sound, and therefore change how easily Cooper pairs form.<p>Interesting.  Do we know if it possible to disrupt superconductivity with sound at just the right frequency?  And the converse, has anyone tried to enhance superconductivity by using sound (i.e. increase either the critical temperature, increase the current density, etc)?')
