React isn&#x27;t all that terrible, it&#x27;s actually quite good and battle-proven. It has great libraries, many devs are familiar with it and if you know it well you can be pretty damn productive with it.<p>Not to say Svelte doesn&#x27;t have great innovative features, but I myself don&#x27;t still feel that tempted to jump into Svelte. What some of us don&#x27;t like, is the infamous JS churn where libraries are changed every year because &quot;this new one is better&quot;.')
