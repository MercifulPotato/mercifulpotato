In Australia, you can claim home office expenses by one of two methods: fixed rate, or actual cost. As well as being very convenient, the fixed rate method is typically going to be quite advantageous (certainly has always been for me—my actual costs are quite slight), as it’s 52¢ of deductions per hour, which is about a thousand dollars for a full-time year. But to go with the fixed rate method, you have to have a dedicated work area—if it’s an area of the house that would already be being lit and heated or cooled or whatever, it’s assumed the actual <i>cost</i> is negligible. I don’t believe this thing would count as a dedicated work area, so if you file your taxes honestly it could easily cost you most of a thousand dollars of taxable income per year; depending on your income, this could effectively make using this office cost you $200–400 a year, compared with using a dedicated room (of course, if you don’t <i>have</i> a spare room to dedicate to the purpose—).<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ato.gov.au&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;income-and-deductions&#x2F;deductions-you-can-claim&#x2F;home-office-expenses&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ato.gov.au&#x2F;individuals&#x2F;income-and-deductions&#x2F;ded...</a><p>(This year there’s also a “shortcut method” which I presume is due to lots of COVID-19 working from home, at 80¢ per hour including <i>all</i> costs, so no claiming phone or internet costs on top of it as in the fixed rate method, and no dedicated work area required.)')
