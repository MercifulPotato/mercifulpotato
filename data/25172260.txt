For example, an Audi A4 has a 3700 lbs curb weight.<p>Also, since road damage scales at something like axle weight ^ 4th, balance issues could completely override the 300 lbs difference in mass.<p>For example, if the Tesla 3 can have 2 axles each with 2036 lbs&#x2F;axle (because there is no ICE weighing down the front), it could theoretically be less damaging to roads than an ICE that has one heavy axle and one light axle.<p>2<i>2036^4 = (x </i> 3700)^4 + ((1-x) * 3700)^4. Solving for x = 63%, so if more than 63% of an Audi A4s weight is on the front axle, it will be approximately worse than a balanced Tesla 3 for road wear and tear.')
