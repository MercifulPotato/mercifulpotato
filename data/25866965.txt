All the old music stores I used to go to are closed.  The big chains are gone.  The small indie stores are all gone.  Some of the boutique websites still exist, but it has been more than 10 years since I purchased a real physical CD.<p>One thing I do miss is that CDs are mastered far better than anything on iTunes or YouTube is these days.  Modern music is compressed (not MP3 artifacts, but flattening of dynamic range) in a way that wasn&#x27;t common back then.  Algorithmic remastering of music by all the big websites is overdone in my opinion.')
