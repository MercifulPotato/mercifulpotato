Things in life going extremely sideways and leaving me heartbroken&#x2F;depressed were what pushed me to that same kind of workaholism described above. Every single significant side project I wrote was during some awful-feeling events happening in my life. Those were also the times when I spent the least time doing &quot;fun&quot; things (e.g., videogames), because I just didn&#x27;t feel like it.<p>That drive for me had nothing to do with the actual desire to make money or have career advancement, it was just a mirage. In fact, I would say I have more of the actual desire to make more money and advance in career when I am in &quot;good times&quot;, but the drive isn&#x27;t quite there. But when the &quot;bad times&quot; come, I have no actual desire for money&#x2F;career advancement. I do however get that insane intrinsic drive to just get away from all the &quot;bad things&quot; in life at that time by diving deep into working&#x2F;studying&#x2F;etc. It wasn&#x27;t about money, it was about doing something productive, because most of that work (at least for me) was just side projects that I didn&#x27;t get paid a dime for, and neither was I expecting or cared to get paid for it.')
