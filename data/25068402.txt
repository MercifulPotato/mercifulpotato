Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=[25070616], score=None, time=1605176656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25067431, text='&gt; Hook it up to his stereo - him being in his 70&#x27;s he might still have one - and he can use it as a jukebox, playing through the speakers without having to fiddle with Bluetooth.<p>Haha, I still have my stereo from 1980 or so, run it all day every day. Only these days, I drive it with a Grace Digital media player that sucks the files off of the desktop through the wired LAN.<p>I don&#x27;t play directly from my desktop because I strongly dislike the bleeps and bloops from the computer, and those stupid autoplay websites. Easier to just disable the sound from the computer.<p>The computer stereo output also underlays an extremely annoying 60 cycle hum.<p>The sound quality from the computer DAC is horrible. Nice to use a real stereo (Carver amp and preamp for the win!).')
