They just get preloaded[0]. If google preloaded non-AMP sites (which is technically feasible, there has been browser extensions doing this since ages ago), they too would load &quot;faster&quot;, fancy that!<p>This is not feasible in a security conscious way. Preloading leaks metadata (at a minimum things like IP address, and probably much more for a useful implementation) to third party hosts without any user interaction.<p>Even without preloading, as I understand it, amp is still faster than your &quot;average&quot; site since it enforces decent performance hygiene. Yes, performance conscious owners can create slightly faster sites, but most <i>don&#x27;t</i>. The 0.0s load times for preloaded sites and potential to cache is just butter for an end user.<p>[I work at Google but have nothing to do with AMP].')
