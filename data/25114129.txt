Despite the phrasing of Github inviting and wanting a counter notice, ultimately they are not the arbiters of legality, so their part in the process is now done.<p>The RIAA now has to bring the youtube_dl developers to court if they plan to keep pushing their argument, at which point we&#x27;ll have the RIAA lawyers vs EFF lawyers and an eventual legal decision (with potential appeals in the process).')
