I&#x27;d buy the smart watch right now if it was either open-source, it came with a strong privacy policy.<p>As is, I see no reason to upload my health information to a random corporation.<p>Indeed, I can see plenty of business models where I could give away smartwatches and cameras for the wealth of data I&#x27;d collect.
