Some friends of mine get winter depression and it&#x27;s a real shit thing. I can&#x27;t understand, I love winter much more than summer (you can dress for it and turn on lights; try turning off the sun or take off your underwear when you&#x27;re still too warm and need to go to work in summer...), but I know it is a thing :&#x2F;')
