E.g. it&#x27;s not reflecting who they vote, just who they most vehemently disagree with.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why that kind of interstate correlation should impact predictions?<p>&lt;incoherent rambling :D&gt;\nIANAS but it feels like these correlations were added to compensate for the failure in 2016 to recognize that state A going one way implied that state B would also go that way. It &quot;feels&quot; like a more correct approach would be to compute some kind of error&#x2F;weakness measure in a states polls by bringing in those of its geographical neighbors and incorporating the polling error of that entire block vs prior years. Or something.<p>The intuition I&#x27;m having difficulty conveying is that actual voting correlation is based on neighboring states only because you&#x27;ve got bubbles of ideology that aren&#x27;t strictly cut along state lines. If strength of opinion in a bubble is going one way, then you&#x27;ll see that mostly in the state at the center of the bubble, but the bubble still spreads into neighboring states, and a &quot;stronger&quot; bubble could push it geographically further into those neighbouring states, and&#x2F;or could increase the bias in areas inside the bubble.\n&lt;&#x2F;rambling&gt;<p>[1] &quot;Always&quot; == most recent history')
