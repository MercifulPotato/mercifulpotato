Item(by='paradox242', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607119307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302527, text='Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the history of the universe (in absolute number) by founding a company that made life a lot more convenient for a lot of people and there is value in that. We have also all read the stories about how Amazon relates to their labor force, in particular their blue collar workers, upon whom they depend for their business to succeed. Everyone has different attitudes about wealth and poverty largely relating to the class they grew up in and the one they now find themselves in (historically almost always one and the same) but the question that pg sidesteps here entirely is whether it is moral for a single individual to accumulate this kind of wealth. It&#x27;s clear one can, but should they ought to? Should it be something to be ashamed of, not lauded and aspired to?<p>I would say yes, and I think many (perhaps not here, given the type of person who frequents this board) would agree. They would observe that while Jeff had some ideas and provided some direction, that the vast majority of the work was done by others far more talented than he in their specific role. That he happens to live in a society that routinely grants the spoils disproportionately to the organizers and not those performing the actual labor is the central critique of capitalism highlighted by Marx and to which I think pg is actually alluding, even if he doesn&#x27;t realize it. This &quot;profit&quot; is not a surplus, and the difference between the price charged for a commodity or service and that paid in labor (less any costs in materials) is seen as inherently exploitative. I think people can reasonably disagree about the degree, there is of course value in the organization of labor and materials to provide a product or service, but wage disparities of 100 times? 1000 times? I find this to be indefensible.')
