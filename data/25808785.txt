I never been in those shoes, but for a different reason that you believe: I simply do not want to support&#x2F;contribute for the development of any system that depends on centralizing and monopolizing the users.<p>I <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe that it is the right way to do it. Moxie does.  I rather have, work on and put skin on the game of decentralized&#x2F;distributed systems. Moxie prefers to build centralized systems. He is the one putting skin on the game behind that. So I don&#x27;t think we should be easy on him when the system he proposed fails so catastrophically <i>precisely</i> for the reasons that critics of centralized solutions said it was likely to fail.<p>Yeah, I would never get 40M+ users on a week. That would be by design. Instead of one company getting this many people (and potentially being killed in the process) I&#x27;d rather have 400 new providers, each working to get 10k customers. Easier to scale, more people figuring out issues, more people contributing to the system and making the infrastructure antifragile.')
