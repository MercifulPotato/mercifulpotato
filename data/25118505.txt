There is no liberal or conservative thinking to be blamed anymore, that&#x27;s just a polarized husk of what used to be America frankly, mainly caused by technology oversharing coupled with ignorant people who say stupid shit like you just did without thinking about it more than seeing some stupid visual lie in your head and putting words to it.<p>Granted, liberal thinkers tend to embrace the tech and the corporations, but that doesn&#x27;t make them critical thinkers unless they are willing to step back and consider the facts of the situation and how that applies to them. Non-critical thinkers don&#x27;t realize or care the corporations are the ones to blame here for our current divisive hole - not the government or the faces of the government, and certainly not their fellow neighbors who also do things like buy toilet paper and throw the ball with the kids. I&#x27;m not your problem and Obama isn&#x27;t your problem, but that&#x27;s just the way you see it because you don&#x27;t bother to think for yourself and instead latch onto the imagery the divisive right throws up on media (and not news media either).<p>Anecdotally, I was up in Oregon flying my drone at a lake a few months back. I wasn&#x27;t wearing a mask and glad to be outside. I saw this guy in his truck and he asked &quot;is that a drone?&quot;. I said yes, and asked if he wanted to see the screen on my phone. As I started to approach him I stopped and asked &quot;is it OK, I don&#x27;t have a mask?&quot; He replied without a beat, &quot;Sure, I don&#x27;t care! I&#x27;m a Republican!&quot;<p>And that is exactly what is wrong with non-critical thinking. Critical thinking is realizing we are outside and it doesn&#x27;t matter, probably, between two people talking for a brief moment.  But instead, he just believe some stuff someone else who is of a &quot;type&quot; he aligns himself with, and does so without consideration then announces it as if being a Republican gave him some great idea it didn&#x27;t matter.<p>That&#x27;s just stupidity, in my book.')
