There was one design issue that needed fixed in the first year, but other than that it was a solid laptop for 5 years or more till it finally died. I would have waited, but I was extending the life of the previous tibook for a year prior.<p>I’m not in the market for a laptop now, but I’m really curious about what’s in the pipeline. Oddly enough, My MBP is about as old as the tibook was in that transition, but it’s not feeling slow or ole enough to replace yet.')
