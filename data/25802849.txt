Our only chance of ever improving the situation is to call attention to it.  I fully believe Google leadership has to be aware of it at this point, but it clearly won&#x27;t be a priority to them to fix until the public backlash&#x2F;pressure is great enough that they have to).<p>Just to avoid any misreading, I didn&#x27;t say I thought it was malice on Google&#x27;s part.  My opinion (as mentioned above, is):<p>&gt;  <i>I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s outright malice, but the doubling down on these horrific practices (algorithmically and opaquely destroying people) is so egregious that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</i><p>So they are not (at least in my opinion without seeing evidence to the contrary) outright malicious.  But from the perspective of a site owner, I think they should be considered as such and therefore mitigations and defense should be a part of your planning (disaster recovery, etc).')
