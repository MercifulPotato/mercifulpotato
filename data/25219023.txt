People accumulate on cities for a reason. Productivity grows as more people interacts and share ideas.<p>Cities are safe, diverse, places where you do not depend on the judgement of a small set of popular people in your community. My father family comes from a small town where everybody knows everybody, it is an oppressive feeling with consequences for anyone that does not conform to the prevailing mindset.<p>Mid&#x2F;small size cities (1-3 million) seems a good size for me. So, I also share part of your feelings. I could not live in a small town thou, it is not for me.')
