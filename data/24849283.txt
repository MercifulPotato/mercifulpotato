When I was in college I got a repetitive stress injury from practicing piano too much. I ended up becoming a programmer but I have followed ergonomic practices religiously in the 40 years since then. My kids make affectionate fun of my perfect posture. But I have worked with the computer keyboard for going on five decades and have never come close to suffering a repetitive stress injury.')
