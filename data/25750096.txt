And even if they do not accept the refutation, the arguments should be left up for people to read and make their informed choice.<p>I don’t think this a good approach.<p>It takes real effort to refute a bad faith untruthful claim, but just it takes a single breath of air to make one. Lies scale better than the truth. And the people making bad faith arguments <i>know</i> this.<p>Maybe ridicule isn’t the answer but it’s something more than just facts and truth. Perhaps shame?')
