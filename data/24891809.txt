She describes herself as &quot;Facebook comms, formerly @TheDemocrats and @SpeakerPelosi&quot;.<p>This is an example of power leakage. These institutions do in fact (i.e. de facto, not de jure) have elements of sovereign power given their relationship with the political&#x2F;ruling class, it&#x27;s just that they are not directly accountable in the same way that a government is. They engage in censorship for the benefit of the ruling&#x2F;political class and use political formulae as a mask (TOS violations, &quot;community standards&quot; violations, exhortations to the first amendment, section 230 protections, etc) in the same way governments do.')
