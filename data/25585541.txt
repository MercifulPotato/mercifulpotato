Browsers no longer show any indication of difference, and customers are not likely to inspect certs.<p>From a risk perspective, it looks like Visa is all-in on Cloudflare for consumer-facing infrastructure:<p>* Cloudflare terminates visa.com TLS, so it would be easy to swap an origin server without attracting notice, even if the cert was pinned or otherwise monitored<p>* Cloudflare also operates registered nameservers for visa.com, so they could issue DV certs at will<p>It looks strange, but it makes some sense. Visa deals with imperfectly-compliant handlers of cardholder data <i>as their business</i>, and they obviously have all sorts of risk modeling built into those relationships.<p>I&#x27;m sure they require Cloudflare to certify to a high level of PCI-DSS, and have carefully-apportioned liability in all of the paperwork.')
