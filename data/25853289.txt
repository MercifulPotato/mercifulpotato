Still salty about that since my insurance supposedly covers annual physicals but asking for the test meant that I was going beyond a routine physical and so they coded it as an office visit and billed me a not insignificant amount for it (for the visit, not the test itself, which was extra). Talking to the billing department and the insurance company got me nowhere.')
