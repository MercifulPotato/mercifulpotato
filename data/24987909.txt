No curation nor customer service is handled by indie booksellers. The service is Bookstore.org&#x27;s through and through. Then they&#x27;re effectively &quot;donating&quot; 10% to indies (though it&#x27;s not clear how much control the consumer has over the distribution of this).<p>They then have this additional affiliate programme, which is open to all, but has some special treatment for indie booksellers (no magical difference here from Amazon affiliates in terms of structure of approach).<p>They don&#x27;t seem to recognise any actual distinguishing value in shopping in indie bookstores in their business model. What&#x27;s to stop Bookstore.org just becoming the next Amazon (in a perfectly successful scenario) with this approach?<p>Is this just doing the same thing over again and expecting different results?')
