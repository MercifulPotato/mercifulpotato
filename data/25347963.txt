We are very excited to bring our vision of learning autonomy to the world, and it&#x27;s great to see this interest.<p>The MOOC Duckiebot is the first of the family to be powered by NVIDIA. Our other Duckiebots as well as the Duckiedrone are Raspberry Pi based.<p>This said: as for peripherals you definitely want to get a compatible wifi dongle and provide cooling to the Jetson, e.g. with a fan.
