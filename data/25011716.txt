Password hashes such as argon2 make brute-force cracking more expensive, but nothing can help you all that much if the password is &quot;letmein&quot; or something quite high up on the guess list. With well implemented pepper there&#x27;s just no way to even check one password, never mind brute-forcing.<p>If you go beyond peppering and also use encryption to protect the whole password database you can get additional benefits like keeping the list of usernames secret.')
