Since writing is pretty difficult, here is what I do: I write aphorisms (Nietzsche&#x2F;Debord&#x2F;Wittgenstein style) to force me to say the main proposition without deviating from my point. This forces me to state clearly what I want to say.\nAt this point, the aphorism is nothing more than an assertion that needs to be proved with arguments. But my main proposition is already here and I can keep it in mind while I develop my thought. It&#x27;s like a lighthouse.')
