If you don&#x27;t care about indexes you don&#x27;t need to think about them (finally!).<p>The remaining cases are by definition edge cases and warrant enough attention that bugs caused by 1- vs 0-based indexing doesn&#x27;t seem to be a big problem in practice.<p>It&#x27;s like with goto and structured programming - people stopped using goto for loops and ifs, so the remaining cases where goto is used as last resort aren&#x27;t much of a problem. People think hard before doing this.')
