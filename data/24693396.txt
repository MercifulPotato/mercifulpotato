NB I have put zero effort into thinking if that makes sense or is true. (edit - confirmed)<p>[ Edit ] - We also made every other coin smaller. It&#x27;s always startling to get an Australian 50c coin - even though it&#x27;s the same size as ours used to be. Our&#x27;s is now smaller than the AU 20c.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coins_of_the_New_Zealand_dollar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coins_of_the_New_Zealand_dolla...</a>')
