If Raniere hadn&#x27;t turned out to be a serial abuser&#x2F;rapist of underage girls even outside of his cult, I doubt that they would have ever been arrested, and if they had been, they would have gotten off.<p>He was a creep that ran a process&#x2F;self-improvement cult and started a harem inside it, but that&#x27;s not really a crime. If it hadn&#x27;t been part of a larger (consistent) pattern, what is law enforcement really supposed to do about women branding each other and sending each other material expressly labeled as blackmail? If I sign a contract with you that says that in order for me to (for example) lease a property to you, I require nude pictures, an embarrassing interview, and a physical brand on your body (weird), and that if you skip out on the rent I&#x27;m granted the right to release that material - is that a crime? Maybe - you can&#x27;t sell yourself into slavery, but the definition of slavery is loose.<p>NXIVM was no worse than Scientology or Mormonism, which is to say it&#x27;s horrible but protected, and its insularity hid stuff that was actually criminal but impossible to prosecute because everyone in the group would form a protective wall around the organization even if you made a bit of headway.<p>It&#x27;s a lot easier and more rewarding to set some 80 I.Q. kid up as a terrorist. The public would have absolutely no interest in this if there wasn&#x27;t sex involved (as Oxenberg and Edmondson remarked at least a couple of times on the TV series.) We don&#x27;t prosecute financial institutions for financial crimes (or even resource the agencies responsible to even theoretically prosecute them.) There&#x27;s no chance we&#x27;re going to be going after tiny cults.<p>Maybe the CIA would have noticed them as they got a better foothold in Mexican elite circles and figured out a way to <i>support</i> them.<p>NXIVM is a cautionary tale for cults. The Guardian&#x27;s Office&#x2F;OSA in Scientology is not just decoration, it&#x27;s crucial to build an internal intelligence service to keep an enterprise like that together. Raniere was just trying to improv the response to defectors and potential defectors rather than building a bureaucracy. Maybe get that done before the harem.')
