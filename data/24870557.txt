I suspect the successful low status people are actually the standard devs&#x2F;IT employees, not founders.<p>An annoying part of this game is that it’s also high status to pretend you’re low status or that you don’t care about status (hence all the “I’m humbled to accept &lt;high status achievement&gt;”)<p>Dating is always awkward, doesn’t really matter what you’re doing (except maybe doctor).')
