The original OFP has been retrospectively renamed to Arma (1). Arma 2 and 3 are sequels, and as a big fan of the series I can assure you they feel very, very similar, to the extent that Arma 3 has many of the same bugs and quirks I&#x27;ve seen in the original one. I am 99.99% sure they kept the same engine since the 90&#x27;s, and have been improving it instead of doing complete rewrites. Thank god, because it helps to keep the feel and the atmosphere of the game.')
