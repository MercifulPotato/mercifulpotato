You&#x27;re confusing leftism with Neoliberalism (you&#x27;re not alone in this thread). The anti-gun people in this category are firmly rooted in the Auth-Right quadrant of the political compass (just a few hairs to the &#x27;left&#x27; of Modern Republicanism).<p>That being said, it&#x27;s understandable why these platforms don&#x27;t want to be involved with promoting &#x27;gun-safety&#x27; information, and it&#x27;s not about censorship, it&#x27;s about liability. You can&#x27;t talk about gun-safety without talking about proper operation. This information has implications regardless of a users intentions (good or bad). Imagine the headline: &#x27;Mass Shooter planned attack with help from YouTube videos&#x27;... The following uproar would only lead to greater censorship and restriction. Restricting content is not about censorship, but preventing scenarios like this. It&#x27;s impossible to separate &#x27;safety&#x27; from &#x27;tactical training&#x27;, and I for one, would prefer such information was not readily available to any would-be rogue actors.<p>If you want to have a gun, that&#x27;s fine. Take a class. Want tactical training, take a class. Better yet, join the military.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly convinced that owning a gun offers any net-benefit as far as safety is concerned. I&#x27;d reckon you&#x27;re statistically more likely to injure yourself (or a family member) than you are to prevent an attack from an assailant. It&#x27;s also a really hard argument to make that there is 0 correlation between the high level of gun-ownership in the US and the extremely high homicide rate. Especially when looking at hand-guns (Canada for example has similar levels of &#x27;ownership&#x27; and a lower homicide rate, but less hand-gun ownership compared to US).<p>TLDR; restricting &#x27;gun-safety&#x27; info is not about censorship, it&#x27;s about liability and owning a gun probably doesn&#x27;t make you &#x27;safer&#x27;. (these are, of course, <i></i>my<i></i> opinions)')
