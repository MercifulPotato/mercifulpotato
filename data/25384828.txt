Think (Notepad++ and JDeveloper) vs (vim&#x2F;emacs and cargo).<p>And as far as enterprise IT, there are a ton of Windows infrastructure folks, and again, there&#x27;s little overlap between those and FAANG types. Plus infrastructure folks frequently hate Macs, for example (the stuff to manage fleets of Macs is vastly underpowered compared to stuff used to manage fleets of Windows PCs).<p>Plus even in those companies, the ERP &amp; infra folks are maybe 1-5-10% of the workforce and they&#x27;re generally in supporting roles (frequently they&#x27;re temps or consultants), not in core business roles. Nobody listens to them :-))<p>And they generally want to get rid of them, they&#x27;re seen as an expense.<p>I do agree that Windows-only places are becoming less common, but in big enterprises it&#x27;s far from agreed that going outside the Microsoft ecosystem has a good ROI.')
