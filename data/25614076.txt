It has been happening since Firefox first added their &quot;in-browser&quot; PDF renderer.  The in browser renderer does not handle the full gamut of the PDF spec (the actual PDF spec. doc. is on the order of 800+ pages long) so whether a PDF renders, or not, depends upon what portions of the PDF spec. it utilizes.<p>This is what the warning &quot;this doc may not be displayed correctly&quot; really means.  It is saying: &quot;this PDF uses PDF features we do not yet support&quot; (but without being so explicitly direct about the meaning).<p>But barring a recent bug that has broken everything, the cause is inside the particular PDF&#x27;s because they use features that FF&#x27;s render library does not yet support.')
