That is easily enough space to fit a full fledged implementation of Common Lisp on somewhere between 1 and 4 records (SBCL&#x27;s working tree is 40MB, and with its .git folder it is 152MB). There are countless other factors that would need to be considered<p>Don&#x27;t vinyl records experience physical decay over time?')
