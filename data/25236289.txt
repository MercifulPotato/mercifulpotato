You will likely not be able to really hit your endpoints hard enough by using one machine only.<p>Personally I use autocannon which in my testing is faster than k6 and easier to use with a node.js environment. It is only a npm package, not a full software you need to install on your machine. Autocannon in my testing is 2 orders of magnitude faster than gatling, but you should do your own testing. PS. I have no affiliations to autocannon, I&#x27;m just a very happy user.<p>The only drawback compared to k6 is lack of websockets, which is unfortunate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcollina&#x2F;autocannon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcollina&#x2F;autocannon</a>')
