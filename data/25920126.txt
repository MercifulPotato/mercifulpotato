I prefer a world without advertisement, ideally. I disagree with you that there is no spectrum of ad ethics.<p>And while you are not &quot;trying&quot; to manipulate anyone (maybe), I also disagree that you are not effectively influencing your reader thoughts to some degree.<p>The analogy I made is: even an internet comment does, on a smaller scale, less maliciously, use persuasion techniques: should we get rid of discussion forums too? I don&#x27;t think so, and while an ad-less world seems like a nice experiment, sounds pretty unrealistic, regulating (outlawing would be nice) tracking in ads? More realistic and fixing 80% of what&#x27;s wrong with 20% of the effort if you ask me')
