This is more of a fun hobby now for them.<p>It seems they are more interested in throw-weight, in pursuing the Long March 9. It’s safer to establish the capability first, then, to work on reusability afterwards.<p>And they’re locked out of the western commercial launch market, so, that’s irrelevant to them. So they’ll just have to stick with domestic demand.<p>The next interesting play, is if they go forward with space based solar power.
