What does it matter if it didn&#x27;t stand the &quot;test of time&quot; â€” especially if it shone a light for its successors to follow?<p>The Autotools model of probing for system capabilities at build time isn&#x27;t dead; it will never die, it will only be used in greater and lesser amounts and to complement other means of discovering system capabilities.<p>CMake seems to me like a reimplementation of the Autotoools model of build-time probing.  The true competitors are binary distribution after building on precursor systems with full specification and no probing, and cross-compilation with full specification and no probing.')
