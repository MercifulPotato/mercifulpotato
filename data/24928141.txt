If you are using a state management library, that&#x27;s probably more relevant to your selection here than React is.<p>REST is also too open-ended for a complete low-friction solution, but, e.g., if its swagger&#x2F;openapi, there&#x27;s tools that will do almost the entire thing for you with little more than the spec.<p>&gt; The only thing I&#x27;m aware of is Ember Data but Ember is apparently not cool anymore, and I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable replacement.<p>Ember Data is definitely a valid choice. It may not be hyped right now, but that has little to do with utility or use in the real world.')
