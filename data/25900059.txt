UberEats, DoorDash, etc are not v1.0 of deliveries. Online ordering in the early 00s were atrocious. Modern day services should at least be v2.0, but it seems like we are only at v1.5 (v1.0 reskinned and more options). These apps also seem to be run in the style of the mafia in that they take as much from all of their &quot;stores&quot; until they bleed them dry.')
