Adding @2x bitmaps was easy enough for developers, and the transition was quick and painless.<p>Since then, however, Apple&#x27;s UI has (regrettably) become less about pixel-perfect bitmaps and more about black typography on white roundrects, and almost all Macs run at a scaled resolution by default, which is then typically used to display web-based apps that support fractional scaling.<p>I really think that Windows&#x27; approach has aged much better. Kudos to Microsoft. We could have our cake and eat it too if Apple sold Macs with slightly higher-resolution displays, and also a 5K 27&quot; display because other manufacturers can&#x27;t be bothered.')
