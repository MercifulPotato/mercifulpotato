You can check the time series data from Edison Research which is publicly available on the NYT static data page to see the irregularities for yourself. For example you can see the Trump N votes decrement by X000s in MI and PA when it should be monotonically increasing. This might be an API glitch, it might be fraud, or it might have an innocuous explanation. Mainstream news doesn&#x27;t report on these irregularities.<p>(3) Widespread fraud isn&#x27;t alleged. Targeted fraud at swing states is the claim.<p>(4) Fraudulent ballots or vote switching by voting machines might have only flipped the POTUS choice. Dr Shiva had allegations on this which he&#x27;s detailed in a YT video alongside data that he believes supports this hypothesis. Again, the mainstream media has not reported on this.<p>I&#x27;ve personally looked into (2) and (4) in some detail. I find (4) to be meritless and an artefact of the way they&#x27;ve presented the data. I find (2) to be totally real, but an innocuous explanation such as an API error to be much more likely than fraud.')
