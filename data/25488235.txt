If it is, that would mean that the ratio of take_home_pay&#x2F;total_cost_for_employer for US is smaller than in much of Europe (which is surprising to me).<p>Here is what numbers for that kind of salary would look like in Croatia:<p>Gross yearly salary: 80 000 USD<p>Total cost for employer: 93 200 USD<p>Take home pay: 48 088 USD<p>(Note - this puts you in the highest tax bracket, almost no one makes that much.)')
