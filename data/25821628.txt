At least I tend to think &quot;z&quot; is for compression because of ZIP, but it predates that.<p>.Z was used for compress(1), probably because pack(1) used .z, but where did that come from?<p>My best theory is that it&#x27;s from Steve Zucker who wrote pack(1) at RAND. There were other versions of pack(1) too, but if his was the first, it seems possible that he choose the z extension for Zucker.<p>Does anyone have more info or other theories?')
