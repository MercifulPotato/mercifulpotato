Item(by='Izkata', descendants=None, kids=[25017576, 25017496], score=None, time=1604774960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25017317, text='Still a bit early to say &quot;much more&quot;:  Arizona can still flip (it&#x27;s been inching ever closer and is at 0.6% difference at 90% counted) and Georgia has already announced a recount because it&#x27;s so close.<p>If those do both actually end up in Trumps favor, that puts him only 11 electoral votes short.  If the voting machine errors in Michigan do turn out to be a thing (and the error is large enough), or he wins legal battles there or in Pennsylvania, that&#x27;s enough to flip the whole election.<p>It&#x27;s a very long shot, but this isn&#x27;t actually over yet until everything is counted and verified.')
