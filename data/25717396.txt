Boys -- especially first-born boys -- were more likely to be fed their favorite foods, taken to the doctor the same day instead of &quot;in the morning&quot; and so forth. These were relatively small things, like delaying seeing a doctor by a few hours, and nothing anyone would likely characterize as <i>abuse</i> of the girls, yet the difference could be measured in terms of mortality.<p>Think about this: You can die of dehydration in as little as two days and you can die of lack of oxygen within minutes.<p>These are not stats for people of frail health or something. Anyone can die of lack of oxygen within minutes, no matter their current state of health.<p>Making excuses and saying &quot;But they must have been in a weakened state to begin with or something...&quot; amounts to denial of the racism that we all know is rampant within this country.')
