I think all but the most hardcore Linux lovers won&#x27;t have enough breadth and depth to understand the full ramifications of many of these config changes.<p>I&#x27;m no Linux expert but even having used it for a fair number of years, I only have a shallow understanding of most of the things that are tweaked here, if I&#x27;ve even heard of them at all. For example, it says &quot;kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1&quot;, and points out the threat which I can understand, but I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s used for in the first place. Perhaps it isn&#x27;t really ever used for anything, but it&#x27;d be nice to be told that, because my initial line of thinking is that these defaults must be defaults for a reason and that makes me hesitant to actually make any of the changes.')
