And what you think is &quot;morally by far the best thing to do&quot; really does not have to match others morals.<p>If there is another choice, then none of what I said applies. That being said, history has been such that there often has been no such other choice.<p>&gt;My morals are, I do not judge absolute morals, like you. I judge only concrete situations.<p>If your morals are such that you would prefer fascism to any kind of socialism, then I do judge, and I think most do. If they aren&#x27;t such, then the rest of my comment applies.<p>&gt;And since so far a egalitarian society is only a theory that failed multiple times in reality, I do not believe in supporting such a theory with all my energy and posession. Which would be &quot;accept the socialization of your property, and live the life of an ordinary person, which is morally by far the best thing to do&quot;.<p>No one, not even Karl Marx believed in an egalitarian society. What socialists do believe is that private property is an issue that will inevitably lead to the fall of liberalism, and that it must be heavily reformed, along with the removal of the class system. All socialist societies had some inequality in them, and no one complained about it, because everyone can agree that those more capable or who work harder should receive more.<p>&gt;In other words, if I would have to take the choice between fascism and socialism I would rather try to gather what I have and go away.<p>That is an understandable choice, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would object. Of course, getting your capital and other kinds of private property would be much harder as the fascists would certainly not let you do so.')
