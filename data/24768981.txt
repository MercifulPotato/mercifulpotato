Of course, the bandwidth is also very low. But that&#x27;s OK for things like tracking devices (they&#x27;re making reindeer trackers in Finland) and basic smart watches.<p>With eSIM or iSIM you can also make the device smaller<p>&gt;  is using 2G cellular modems<p>I think carriers really want to discontinue 2G eventually. It&#x27;s really inefficient. They&#x27;ve already dropped support for 3G around here.<p>I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s also way more power hungry than LTE-M&#x2F;NB-IoT<p>Can you make something like this with 2G? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;airbolt&#x2F;the-airbolt-gps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;airbolt&#x2F;the-airbolt-gps</a><p>I don&#x27;t think so...')
