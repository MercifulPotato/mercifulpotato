You can face a second (or indeed subsequent) trial for some crimes despite being earlier found NOT GUILTY if there is substantial new evidence for the prosecution. In OJ&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s likely (under those rules) prosecutors could put together enough evidence to show OJ actually did kill those people, go back to court and get him convicted.<p>Historically it was possible in England and Wales to re-try people in some particular extreme cases. For example if prosecutors could show tampering with the jury allowed you to get off, they can get the High Court to run a new trial, having presumably successfully convicted people (maybe including you) for the jury tampering meanwhile. Or if the original trial judge made a decision that is manifestly wrong e.g. you&#x27;re on trial for murder, the judge says you seem like a nice man, acquits you on the spot, that can be appealed because a jury was never asked about it.<p>But in 2003 as a result of the fall out from the murder of Stephen Lawrence (basically a bunch of white guys murdered a teenager apparently for being black but they weren&#x27;t found guilty of murder) the law was changed. Now it&#x27;s possible for prosecutors to go to court to get the court to decide that your original acquital was unsafe (the same way they&#x27;d decide if e.g. new CCTV evidence showed you were actually half way across the country at the time of a crime your conviction for that crime is unsafe and should be undone) and order a new trial. This option is only open for a handful of offences like murder or kidnapping.')
