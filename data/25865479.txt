Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611268567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865236, text='&gt; The SSPL allows free and unrestricted use and modification, with the simple requirement that if you provide the product as a service to others, you must also publicly release any modifications as well as the source code of your management layers under SSPL.&quot;<p>The magic is in the &quot;management layers&quot; part. True copyleft says &quot;you can use this software in your product but you have to open source any changes to the software&quot;. Okay, fine. This &quot;poison pill proprietary license dressed up as copyleft&quot; is saying &quot;if you sell a service that uses an UNMODIFIED version of elasticsearch, you have to release every piece of software around elasticsearch, including your hypervisors, kernels, os image...the list goes on&quot;. It&#x27;s very clearly an attempt to make the requirement so odious that no-one would risk triggering that clause.<p>Which is why functionally all they did was force Amazon (and other organizations like Wikimedia who don&#x27;t sell Elasticsearch as a service but do refuse to run proprietary software) to have to fork.')
