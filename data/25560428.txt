I guess you can read&#x2F;view SIGGRAPH papers and presentations to get an idea what they&#x27;re doing to achieve realtime performance.<p>Common things that make a scene too difficult to handle for brute force sampling approaches: caustics, difficult to reach light sources (small or behind openings), many light sources, camera or motion blur, volumetric materials, etc.\nAlgorithms approximating the behavior of real materials also is a complex topic, e.g. skin or hair are handled separately from dielectric or metallic surface models.\nSome optimizations can solve one problem well in isolation but fail when encountering a combination of them.<p>Here&#x27;s one that tries to solve caustics and small light sources at the same time: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cgg.mff.cuni.cz&#x2F;~jaroslav&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2012-vcm&#x2F;2012-vcm-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cgg.mff.cuni.cz&#x2F;~jaroslav&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2012-vcm&#x2F;2012-vcm-p...</a>')
