It makes a case for Focused Protection, arguing for _more_ protection policies for the vulnerable (elderly, etc) than the current efforts. I find this compelling, because I see elderly folks at Target and the grocery store, as well as working jobs like older bus drivers, they are disproportionately at risk and as such should be encouraged through health policy to not go for groceries or work during the pandemic. They also point out in the UnHerd interview that the current policy is classist because upper class professionals can work from home, while many more poor and working class essential workers have to continue working, regardless of age, which results in an unjust higher Covid death toll among the poor&#x2F;working class than those with white collar jobs. The declaration encourages more protection of the vulnerable than the current lockdown health policies.')
