Previously, you could mix and match 3 feature packs, at $2&#x2F;month each. Now, they&#x27;ve combined it into $5&#x2F;month flat, regardless of how many features you use.<p>This may be the right answer for them (chasing the premium competitive market and all that, and maybe less tech debt with fewer tiers), but it caused me to drop my subscription. As a &quot;casual&quot; cyclist, I was willing to pay $2&#x2F;month, but not $5&#x2F;month, for the value I got out of the service.')
