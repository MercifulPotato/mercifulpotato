Look up &quot;plogging&quot; for example. Also, in 3rd-world, signs like &quot;Whoever litters here, thou shalt become an impotent or infertile&quot; (and all the varieties) are quite popular. In more developed countries, gamification is &quot;put each kind of garbage in its own can&quot; (in half of that world, those cans are still emptied to the same trash truck).<p>&gt; Or the fix the sewage system game?<p>&quot;Install a smarthome leak protection system. While doing so, learn how to plug that leak in the first place, dammit!&quot;')
