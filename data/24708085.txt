But the comment you&#x27;re replying to is proposing a change, presumably to treat these huge platforms more like common carriers rather than publishers. I agree with them on private messages - the carrier should have no editorial control and no responsibility for what users say.<p>Something like Facebook Messenger is conceptually far closer to texting (or even just sending letters) than it is to a newspaper publishing your article. And I don&#x27;t think anyone legitimately considers it similar to choosing which products to stock.<p>For public forums I think there&#x27;s probably a better middle-ground. Possibly requiring transparency, like indication if a user&#x27;s post has been edited or partially deleted by moderators, and explaining how posts are sorted&#x2F;recommended&#x2F;hidden.<p>&gt; If society decides to toss QAnon into the bargain bin of cultural relevance, that&#x27;s perfectly valid.<p>Normally it&#x27;s the decision not of society as a whole but rather of a few huge platforms. You may agree with banning QAnon accounts, but what about &quot;anarchist groups&quot; mentioned in the article? Or if the platforms go full WeChat (even scanning for text in images) to make sure your private messages are for the right politicians&#x2F;companies&#x2F;groups&#x2F;laws&#x2F;platforms and against the wrong ones?<p>&gt; Even Ben Franklin recognized this[0]. As a publisher he refused to publish libelous and slanderous speech, yet recognized the right of other publishers to do so if they wished.<p>I&#x27;d argue that editorial control over what billions of conversations say is far more powerful than editorial control over what a single newspaper says. Silent manipulation of public opinion in this way can even be used to make people less critical of the control that platforms have. I think it&#x27;s something everyone should be cautious of, even if the current bans line up with what they consider dangerous views.')
