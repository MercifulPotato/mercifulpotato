On the other hand, I don&#x27;t even use Uber once a year locally.<p>Whereas with food delivery, I don&#x27;t really have decent options. But, if I did, I would probably use it now and then at home. But I think it&#x27;s accurate to say that I have <i>never</i> used food delivery while traveling.')
