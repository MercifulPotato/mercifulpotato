I want my button-blister microwaves back.<p>Knobs are low-accuracy, low-precision. Which may be fine for some cooking, but not all. On my current knob-equipped microwave, my precision is limited to +&#x2F;- 30 seconds simply due to the mechanical design, which means a) it&#x27;s hard to heat anything up &quot;just a little&quot;, as sub-minute heating is hit-and-miss, and b) it&#x27;s hard to do food sensitive to cooking time.<p>Button blisters with a digital clock telling time to the second. That&#x27;s an interface I can trust because I can <i>see</i> the time counting down in the correct pace (I have trust issues with all kinds of analog knob timers, including Pomodoro timers). That&#x27;s an interface I&#x27;ve learned to use without looking, one hand keying in the correct time and power setting, the other hand operating food, &lt;Start&gt; getting pressed as soon as the tray door close.<p>I still remember my most common sequence from childhood. &lt;Cook Time&gt; &lt;Power Level&gt; &lt;Power Level&gt; &lt;1&gt; &lt;4&gt; &lt;0&gt; &lt;Start&gt;. Could do that blind even today.<p>Knobs are good for things that you need to scroll around a lot (and knobs in professional devices excel at jumping precision levels to allow an excellent experience here). Setting time and power on a microwave is not like that. You have exact values in mind, and need a way to input them precisely.<p>Having an input level precise to 1 second <i>is</i> useful if you&#x27;re using it day-in, day out. As a kid, I was mostly doing the same few meals in the microwave, so I had perfect timing nailed with experience. For instance, a DIY <i>zapiekanka</i>[0] made of bread, cheese and some flavoring, would come out perfect at Full power, 1:40 time. Add 20 seconds, and you&#x27;d burn the cheese. The cheese was the factor that determined microwave settings. If, for some reason, my mom bought a different type than usual, I&#x27;d have to correct the time (usually adjust up), but then with experience I quickly developed &quot;cheese tables&quot; in my head. I&#x27;d look at a slice, and think, &quot;ok, this is the smelly one, needs +40 seconds to come out well&quot;. Etc. Then I&#x27;d key in the correct settings, and come back in 2 minutes to the perfectly made <i>zapiekanka</i>.<p>(I suppose this was my attempt at treating cooking as an industrial process and not black magic :).)<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zapiekanka" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zapiekanka</a>')
