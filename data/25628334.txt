It&#x27;s a mattress&#x2F;pillow start-up&#x2F;brand in India. The ad shows the exact thing I am looking for.<p>But when I click, and I am redirected to the actual product page <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;eI6sNtJ.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;eI6sNtJ.png</a> that has none of these features and the product description is completely different from what it shows on Google Search result page.<p>I had reported this to Google sometimes back and nothing changed in their SEO gymnastics the last time I had checked a couple of weeks later.<p>I think what they are doing is fraud (wrong? unethical?). But what really annoyed me is it wasted a lot of my time as I thought I was doing something wrong and probably they actually had the product I am looking for.')
