In a society with functional antitrust laws, such activity would be illegal.”</i><p>That&#x27;s ridiculous. According to that logic, neither Office (nor Google Workspace, formerly G Suite) should be allowed to exist -- you&#x27;d be forced to buy Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all separately.<p>Or by the same logic, an OS shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have any applications at all -- not even a calculator app, because that would be anticompetitive against other calculator apps.<p>In what universe should Microsoft not be allowed to add a chat component to their office productivity suite? When that&#x27;s clearly an essential component of such suites these days? Sheesh.<p>Slack has had an amazing outcome. And awesome products, historically, tend to be absorbed by large corporations simply because it&#x27;s more efficient and therefore profitable for everyone involved. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.')
