Let the political people run with it afterword.  And it doesn&#x27;t even say that it emphatically &quot;will bring &lt;bad thing&gt;&quot;, it uses the weasel words &quot;could bring &lt;bad thing&gt;&quot;.<p>This seems politically motivated; at the very least they&#x27;ve made it easy to mistake this as more political than scientific.')
