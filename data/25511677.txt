Then, when banks ostensibly adopted XRP for their banking needs, the banks would be forced to pay exorbitant amounts of money to buy the artificially-scarce XRP from all of the speculators who got in early.<p>Everyone conveniently ignored the fact that large banks are not dumb, and they had no real reason to use a currency literally invented out of thin air to power their transactions. If banks really wanted to use cryptocurrency to trade among themselves, they&#x27;d obviously just roll their own cryptocurrency. Or they&#x27;d just copy-paste the permissively licensed Ripple code and call it something like BankCoin. No one could ever give me a good reason why banks would have no choice but to buy up arbitrary XRP from general public speculators.')
