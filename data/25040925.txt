The shell is where I spend most of my time executing commands that need to be scripted, inspecting various system resources and troubleshooting. The vim editor is readily available to use in places where external tools outside of a terminal emulator may not be readily available or the startup time required to configure those tools may be better spent on configuration tweaks in the shell.<p>I&#x27;ve also found especially when working with build automation in Jenkins or deployment automation with uDeploy, that a GUI-based client IDE somewhat obscures things I need to see in the environment I am building in.  IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, while providing plugins for Gradle or Maven, may have configurations that are not compatible or differ in some fundamental way from those of the server build environment.')
