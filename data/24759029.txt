I&#x27;d be fine with that, but my wife wouldn&#x27;t. She prefers more of the Victorian&#x2F;Queen Anne style of architecture. I wonder if there is a way they could design this system so that the innards are all the same but then you can put different shells around the innards so the home could look modern, craftsman, victorian, etc. Sort of like how you could have 10 cakes that are identical on the inside, but dramatically different on the outside from the frosting.<p>I&#x27;ve often compared HTML, CSS, JS to a house. HTML is the foundation, studs, joists, rafters, sheeting, subflooring, etc. JS is the wiring, plumbing, HVAC, etc. CSS is the paint, tiling, carpet, millwork, and other decorative elements. Maybe the prefab system can be the HTML and JS and then decorative elements can be layered on top to make it look like very different designs.')
