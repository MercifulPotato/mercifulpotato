In addition to the above, the contracts (some of which have become public) also contain third-party audit requirements.<p>&gt; What is the consequences if someone fails?<p>They lose their TRR status, presumably.<p>&gt; How can the individual user who is giving away their private data exercise control and agency?<p>DoH is surfaced in Firefox, you can choose not to enable it, or you can choose to configure it to explicitly use any DoH endpoint your choose.  On my network I use a Pi-Hole which talks to DoH on the backend and everything on my network is forced through the PiHole and all other DNS&#x2F;DoH is blocked.  You can use similar mechanisms, and Firefox surfaces preferences for DoH.<p>Just like any other decision, a sensible default which serves users needs to be made, and advanced users can configure things.  Firefox chooses the sensible default of using encrypted DNS to trusted resolvers for users, and if you want to do otherwise, you are free to do so.  Nothing removes your agency as a user.<p>&gt; I personally do not think that is enough for me in regard to my own data. Where I live (EU) I at least got GDPR to use if my ISP decide to go rouge with my data. I also got a contract with the ISP. In additional my country have a few different government agencies that in theory could jump in. Neither of those would be an option if the data is shipped over seas.<p>Nothing in the current implementation ships data outside your jurisdiction.  DoH is only enabled in the US pointed at a US-based provider (CloudFlare).  There are numerous providers in the EU that may sign up to the TRR program as Mozilla gets to the point of rolling out DoH in Europe.  This comment period gives them an opportunity to get feedback prior to getting to that point.<p>I think perhaps you should send them your feedback directly.')
