If one is looking for a better alternative, just buy a modern receiver with airplay 2 built in and pair it with some decent speakers. Not only will that sound better by an order of magnitude, you&#x27;ll have the option of upgrading your system over time.<p>I admit that Sonos has the high ground when it comes to convenience, but after reading this and being burned by their bricking policy on older devices, one is far better off with a traditional 2.1 set up (at least for a living area).')
