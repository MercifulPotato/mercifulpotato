And that&#x27;s a helluva buy.<p>In any case practically nobody pays full price for longer range train travel in Switzerland.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.myswitzerland.com&#x2F;en-ch&#x2F;planning&#x2F;transport-accommodation&#x2F;tickets-public-transport&#x2F;swiss-travel-pass&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.myswitzerland.com&#x2F;en-ch&#x2F;planning&#x2F;transport-accom...</a>')
