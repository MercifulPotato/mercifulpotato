I find them much more readable than any other style.  That&#x27;s just my personal view, but I find code which uses the brace in the function declaration to be disorienting when I&#x27;m reading it.  My eyes are traveling around trying to see where the first line of the function is.<p>I also write a bit of Rust and I find Rust&#x27;s nagging me to use the &quot;default&quot; brace style annoying.<p>IMO this is very much a personal taste issue, it depends on how someone grew up learning to read, what programming languages they grew up with, etc.')
