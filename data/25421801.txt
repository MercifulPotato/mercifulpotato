But honestly, I&#x27;m lazy. I don&#x27;t leave my house much. I like to keep it no lower then 72 or 73 in the day and 75 at night. I have my heating setup such that after 9 am it drops the house to 72 (naturally) then at 4 pm kicks it up to 73. 6 pm 74, and 8 at 75. Hold all night until 6 am when I have it kick down to 74.<p>I don&#x27;t care about the cost. Sure I could spend less and yes, I use more then all of my neighbors, but I really, really don&#x27;t care. Sure it might be environmentally less efficient, but I couldn&#x27;t care less about my bill being $20 or $50 cheaper. I want to be comfortable. That $20 or $50 isn&#x27;t going to change my life in any meaningful way, but being warm sure makes me a lot happier, every, single, second, of the day.')
