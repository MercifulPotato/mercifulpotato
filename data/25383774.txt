It is, in fact, possible to increase expenditures <i>without</i> tanking the global reserve currency.  Indeed, the two are at odds so long as we rely on deficit spending, since our willingness to tank the dollar&#x27;s value on a whim lessens others&#x27; desire to loan money to us denominated in dollars.<p>Furthermore, our demonstrated willingness to devalue our debts undermines our moral high ground when we criticize China for its exchange rate manipulation, <i>and</i> makes China less likely to set much store by our financial ties, freeing them to take more aggressive actions... as we&#x27;ve seen <i>since</i> 2008 by its actions in Hong Kong, the South China Sea, and Taiwanese airspace.')
