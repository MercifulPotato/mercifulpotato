If I screw up and allocate a bunch of resources unintentionally, I&#x27;m left holding the bill.  That&#x27;s a terrible setup for PaaS because all programming involves mistakes eventually, especially for new users learning the system.<p>Granted, there are likely limits on accounts, but those are to protect the services from fraud, no to protect the user from overspending.  The limits aren&#x27;t well defined and it&#x27;s not something you can rely on because MS might consider $10k &#x2F; month a small account while it&#x27;s a ton of money for me.<p>Azure customers have been asking for hard limits on spending for 8 [1] years with radio silence for the last 5.<p>There&#x27;s a difference in goals I guess.  If I spend more than expected I WANT things to break.  Microsoft, Google, and Azure want me to spend unlimited amounts of money, even if I don&#x27;t have it.  At least AWS can be set up using a prepaid credit card so if I screw up they have to call me to collect their money and I negotiate.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feedback.azure.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;170030-signup-and-billing&#x2F;suggestions&#x2F;3238796-spending-limit-or-maximum-cost-cap-for-azure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feedback.azure.com&#x2F;forums&#x2F;170030-signup-and-billing&#x2F;...</a>')
