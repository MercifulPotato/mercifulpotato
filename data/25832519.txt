But saying Bitcoin simply wastes energy by applying a &quot;proof of work&quot; scheme is totally naive. It&#x27;s not easy to replace and the advantages and risks of &quot;proof of stake&quot; are not clear, yet, I belive.<p>BTW: For others who have never heard of &quot;proof of stake&quot; and &quot;proof of work&quot; ...<p>&quot;Proof of work&quot; requires miners to solve a cryptographic puzzle taking the giant share of all computing time required to validate a block of transactions. This is to assure nobody gains complete control over the blockchain and, hence, keep it being a decentralized effort. On the other hand, by providing a miner fee and a reward (currently about 6 BTC) the system creates incentive for miners to keep on validating Bitcoin transactions despite the costs. It&#x27;s a careful balance and probably the most difficult aspect of the Bitcoin  system to grasp.<p>&quot;Proof of stake&quot; means the miner with the highest monetary stake receives the largest share of the mining fees. In this scheme a miner needs to deposit quite a lot of money to be allowed to compete in the creation of the next transaction block. So it&#x27;s not computing power enabling a successful miner but his or hers prior investment in the crypto currency. I think you understand now, why such a scheme would have been impossible to implement in Bitcoin 12 years ago.<p>Ethereum is preparing to switch over to &quot;proof of stake&quot; at the same time as they&#x27;re preparing to run multiple block chains at the same time. Ethereum 2.0 hopes to save a lot of cost in maintaining its block chain and at the same time to boost its transaction turn over significantly. But it&#x27;s also a risky undertaking. Keep that in mind if you plan to invest in Ethereum.')
