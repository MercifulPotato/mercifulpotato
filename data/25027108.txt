For example, for Ruby, it uses bundler under the hood which will use the Gemfile.lock, and then it converts the results of that into Nix expressions.<p>Someone could certainly submit a PR to the nixpkgs repo that purports to do that but really modifies the generated Nix expressions to refer to different sources, but this would be discovered by anyone who re-runs the package update process.')
