They shoplift everything. And Walgreen&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t rush to re-stock.<p>There are a lot of homeless and drug addicts in that area, but I don&#x27;t know firsthand if they&#x27;re the shoplifters.<p>I spoke to a police sergeant at the Walgreen&#x27;s at Broadway and Polk, and he said it&#x27;s pretty bad, and that even he has a hard time getting the shoplifters to stop.')
