Pasting his reply below.<p>First, linguistically speaking: it&#x27;s a Slavic language work, which broadly means &quot;work&quot;. For example, the Russian word for &quot;work&quot; is &quot;rabota&quot;. The Czech for work is &quot;prace&quot; but in slang usage one could say &quot;robota&quot; to signify hard work (e.g. &quot;Musim do roboty&quot;; &quot;Ceka na me robota&quot;)<p>Historically: in the middle ages peasants had to spend a day each week working for the local lord on his field--this obligation was called &quot;robota&quot;.<p>Karel Capek wrote a sci-fi play called R.U.R. where the word &quot;robot&quot; is used for the first time (it was suggested by Capek&#x27;s brother Josef.)<p>R.U.R. stands for Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti (Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots, a phrase that has been used as a subtitle in English). It premiered on 25 January 1921 and introduced the word &quot;robot&quot; to the English language and to science fiction as a whole. R.U.R. quickly became influential after its publication.\nOriginal language: Czech\nDate premiered: 25 January 1921\nWritten by: Karel Čapek\nGenre: Science fiction')
