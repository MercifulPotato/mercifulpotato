Huh, it seems I&#x27;m out of the loop.<p>Yeah, Matrix is great. I was probably among the first people to install Riot, but the grim reality is nobody (well, one geek-friend of mine and his wife) uses Matrix. Look, even I was surprised when you mentioned &quot;Element&quot;: thought it must be some new messenger I didn&#x27;t hear about...<p>But I&#x27;d surely rather like people to promote Element here, not Signal.')
