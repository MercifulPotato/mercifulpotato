Such a tax would work, as would outright quotas backed by criminal law.<p>It&#x27;s to agree and to implement <i>any</i> common strategy in a classic Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, where it&#x27;s beneficial for every single participant to break any agreement. Another difficulty is that the partners that would agree (governments) are not themselves fishing. Even with the best intentions, not all of them have the means to sufficiently police every operator of a fishing vessel.<p>The silver lining is that it&#x27;s an &quot;iterative Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;. The &quot;prisoner&quot;&#x27;s decision isn&#x27;t isolated from everything, because others will respond in the next round. The issue can also be combined with others, tying, for example, trade agreements to sufficient cooperation (c.f. Brexit).<p>But the sheer number of participants alone makes it a slow slog. Just look at the problems OPEC has, even though that group is a lot smaller and the activity in question is far easier to control.')
