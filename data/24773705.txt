It generates a map according to my first &quot;click&quot; and solves it deterministically. If it reaches a state in which it has to guess, it regenerates the map, and tries again.<p>It happens so fast behind the scenes that the user isn&#x27;t aware of it, and it makes sure I won&#x27;t have to guess anything when I play.
