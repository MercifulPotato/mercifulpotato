I&#x27;m a sucker for sleek UI and I&#x27;m in favor of keeping up with design concepts.<p>I get that not everyone will embrace this, but since VLC was launched 25 (or was it 15?) years ago to create a barebones video player that basically plays whatever you tell it to, it&#x27;ll just lead to people creating new projects in modern languages that&#x27;ll do the same. Imagine how many new developers could jump on this if there was a new OSS media player written in Rust or Go. And even if it doesn&#x27;t happen, you can still fork VLC and keep the old UI alive.')
