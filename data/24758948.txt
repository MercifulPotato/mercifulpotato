But without the ability to know the future, picking the one that has the most &quot;stuff to learn&quot; (according to your first assessment) at the initial discovery phase is imo the most optimal strategy. It is fine if you discover later that the other project had a bit more to learn than the one you picked, because the goal is to learn a lot averaged down over a long period of time.')
