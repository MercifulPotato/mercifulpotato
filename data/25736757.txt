Their web UI and SSH console are a bit quirky but the performance is pretty great for the price.<p>My primary use case for their gear at home was to have a router that can handle a LACP WAN bond for my fancy cable modem as well as connecting to a 10G Ethernet switch via copper or direct-attached SFP+ to a CRS-305 10G switch. Their RB-4011 was a perfect fit, without any of the Ubiquiti SSO&#x2F;controller stuff to worry about.<p>I haven’t explored their WiFi products yet (still using an old router as an AP) but their product range is pretty broad. Might look into it this year though.')
