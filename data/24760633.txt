It&#x27;s also my wife&#x27;s home office and creative space and gets used every day. When we have guests, she&#x27;s happy to relinquish the space to welcome a guest into the house (it&#x27;s not an imposition).<p>Then the guests have a nice, relatively private room in a nice part of town and can hang out with us easily - a lot easier than negotiating the rather weird idea of paying for their hotel or airbnb-type rooms (which would, IMO, be a strange negotiation to have with most grown-up people we know).')
