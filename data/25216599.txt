And I don&#x27;t see that as a bad thing. Now, talking scale of consumption and all that is another matter that I didn&#x27;t gather was at the core of this discussion—at least that is the way I&#x27;ve been framing my comments.<p>But now I&#x27;m getting a bit worried I&#x27;m taking this too far off track of the actual linked content and discussion so I think I&#x27;ll have to leave it at that—but I&#x27;m happy to continue to discuss if you wanted to—just fire me an email.')
