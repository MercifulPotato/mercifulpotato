But I think it may just be my wishful thinking to confirm to what I believe.<p>Companies can coast on way past their prime and maybe Google ends up being CBS or something in 100 years (they were a big technology innovator in the early to mid 20th century). And IBM still has lots of customers even though they aren’t what they once were.<p>I remember using Novell [0] in the mid 90s and they stayed around until 2014 making money with 1000s of employees somehow.<p>So I guess there’s companies that stop being interested to me from a technology perspective and that’s a form “collapse” even though they’re still making gobs of cash and existing.<p>Maybe the author really means we’ve hit “Peak Google” and it’s all downhill from here. But I think it’s important that the peak of the Roman Empire was like 117AD but it took hundreds of years to really stop (maybe the peak was really 10AD under Augustus and maybe it still exists today, but you get my drift).')
