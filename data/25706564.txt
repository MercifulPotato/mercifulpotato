It&#x27;s a really insightful look into the world of the Communist revolutionaries and the anti-Fascist front-lines in the early 20th century. In fact, it&#x27;s a really good look into similar political movements all the way up through today. It&#x27;s also a very good first-hand account of war in multiple environments and the sections on urban warfare in Barcelona reminded me of the scenes of warfare in Baghdad during the Iraq war.<p>Some people find the writing about all of the factions confusing and hard to track, but I think that&#x27;s on purpose. I think being there, it would have been confusing as well.<p>I read it a few years before actually making it to Barcelona and the description of the city came back to me in a flood as I was spending time in it. I hadn&#x27;t realized how well he had described the look at feel of the city but the image I drew in my mind while I read the book was almost exactly what it actually looks like in many parts.<p>Orwell had an amazing ability to evoke complex settings in surprisingly sparse and unadorned language.')
