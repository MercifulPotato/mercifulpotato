I donâ€™t get to buy what I want, have to deal with particular overpriced vendors, and the process slows to a crawl.<p>If I want to use AWS, however, I get instant gratification. And of course I can experiment with different models and then refine into cheaper service mixes as scale increases. As base load emerges, I can use reserved instance pricing and shift that onto our capital budget. And of course I can control everything with code using AWS CDK.<p>At a smaller company where I was able to control the IT process more, it might be worthwhile. But the speed and optionality I get with AWS is vastly more cost effective than dealing with legacy enterprise IT processes.')
