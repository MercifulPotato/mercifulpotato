I have searched far and wide and can only find scholarly articles on the various approaches to privacy but there is no commonly accepted definition. What Iâ€™ve found, however, is that people often implicitly define privacy as the right to lie. Nobody should know how much money I have and should be relying on my statement alone. True, not all governments or other institutions are worthy of the full truth. But it is also true, that any cooperation involves a level of trust hard to reach when one side reserves the right to lie without consequence.')
