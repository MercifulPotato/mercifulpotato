This may feel safer for &quot;non-experienced riders&quot;, but has its own issues: instead of being on the driver&#x27;s side of cars (who tend to look into the mirror before opening the door), you&#x27;ll be on the passenger side, and the passengers don&#x27;t have a mirror to look into. At intersections, drivers turning right (especially truck drivers) will tend to overlook you. Plus, you&#x27;ll have pedestrians stepping in front of your bike, snow not being cleared in Winter and other annoyances. So, the grass may look greener on the other side, but not all that glitters is gold...')
