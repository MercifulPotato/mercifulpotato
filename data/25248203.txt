Presented by the person you are replying to.  I&#x27;m also assuming there was no funding involved given the requirement to build an exploit just to boot anything on the PS4.<p>As an unabashed cynic myself: Your cynicism as someone uninvolved with the project is outweighed by the informed opinion of someone who has demonstrated ability in the field of porting linux to other platforms.')
