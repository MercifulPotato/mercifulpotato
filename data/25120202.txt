But that&#x27;s not how most informal introductions to the incompleteness theorems go (and indeed not how this article went about it).<p>More to the point, Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems are theorems of proof theory, not model theory. Their proofs can be carried out with no recourse to models at all. And I think they are far less prone to being misunderstood when carried out without recourse to models and by extension without recourse to semantic truth.<p>You can of course choose to interpret them in model theory if you&#x27;re working in a semantically complete logical system such as first-order logic with the usual semantics or second-order logic under Henkin semantics, and it is often illuminating to do so once you have those fundamentals. But I think in an informal setting those will tend only to confuse rather than clarify. And importantly the incompleteness theorems still hold in contexts where you don&#x27;t really have a meaningful model theory to speak of.')
