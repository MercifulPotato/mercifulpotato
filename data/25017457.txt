Keep dragging divisive topics into HN and it will turn into the sh!thole that slashdot is now. I&#x27;m not just talking about politics, an article about vim vs emacs is (usually) just as worthless.<p>There are places to discuss politics. But I come to HN regularly because the topics are usually about things that stand or fall on their own merits and inherently promote further exploration of a topic, often linking to related resources that readers may not be aware of.<p>There is nothing new in politics, it&#x27;s the same competing agendas recycled over and over again. I worry HN is slipping more towards that genre of tribalistic topics that achieve nothing more than virtue signaling and mud slinging.')
