He had some advanced biology degrees and worked in a lab. When asked why he ate moldy food, he would reply &quot;Most of the time the mold (some mold type) and is mostly harmless to people. The trouble is knowing what is and isn&#x27;t ok to eat. Besides, I&#x27;m not letting safe food go to waste.&quot;<p>On the other hand, I knew a foreign student who disappeared from classes for 6 weeks. When asked about him, we were told that he had been in the hospital for some time because he had nearly died from eating moldy chicken. When he returned near the end of the semester he looked like a skeleton having lost more than 40 lbs on a super skinny frame.')
