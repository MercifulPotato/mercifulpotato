You’re right that there’s definitely likely a bias in the data we collect. But in terms of validation and verification, I just wanted to provide some info on how we source.<p>Whenever possible, we collect verified offers &#x2F; pay stubs &#x2F; W-2s to anchor the data on the site. While our self reported data is definitely the more popular choice for submission, we are able to determine general bands and find blatant outliers for certain companies and remove them. I think we might be the only consumer facing salary site to do this afaik.<p>Some more info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levels.fyi&#x2F;verified" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levels.fyi&#x2F;verified</a><p>We also do provide a community reporting feature much like the flag feature here on HN, which we actively monitor.<p>Even after all we do, we are after all only as good as the data we collect. The more contributions we receive the more we can color in the whole picture. Feel free to email us any suggestions at hello[at]levels.fyi')
