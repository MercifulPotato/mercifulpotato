There is no rational reason to expect fusion will produce a single watt of practical, commercial power in the lifetime of the grandchildren of anyone reading this. The most optimistic estimate of power density of a productive plasma is so low that a practical fusion plant would need to be tens or hundreds of times as large as a current nuke. Then, it would destroy itself in a short time, leaving hundreds of tons of more-or-less radioactive waste.<p>Fusion research is a jobs program for high-neutron-flux physicists, to provide a population to draw on for weapons work. There has never been an expectation of practical power generation, and its prospects fall as renewables continue getting cheaper.')
