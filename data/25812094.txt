Up to the moment of departure I fantasised about &quot;accidentally&quot; oversleeping and missing the coach.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to assess (at least for me) whether the upside (fun) was outweighed by the downsides (prolonged feelings of anxiety). In all honesty, I bonded more with colleagues on typical Friday nights at the pub (yeah alcohol, but plenty didn&#x27;t drink).')
