By output there&#x27;s a lot of socialists online, for example, but they&#x27;re not in charge.<p>You could just split it into socially and economically. The social progressives are in total control of social media, search, and academia and are closing in on control in traditional media (think newspapers, TV, Hollywood). They&#x27;re not economically left wing though, they&#x27;re economically libertarian.<p>The capitalists used to work with the socially conservative, but have switched and are now aligned with the socially progressive. Might be because of a generational change, might be because they found to be able to make more money in a more progressive environment.')
