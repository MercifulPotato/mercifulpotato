There are three stages involved: 1. excess electricity is used to make the initial powdered metal, 2. powdered metal burners replace coal or gas burners in existing or new power plants, and 3. excess electricity is used to recycle the powdered metal oxide output from stage 2 back into combustible metal powder.<p>The research is focused on the efficiency and CO2 footprint of all three stages.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;afl.mcgill.ca&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;afl.mcgill.ca&#x2F;</a>')
