They define the key concepts and how they interact. But at the level of a programming language, this is of immense scope and power. Java defines an imperative language with built in garbage collection with abstraction from physical hardware.<p>Furthermore, the real distinction between API and implementation is that API are that which needs to be exposed to the world.<p>Programming languages are more akin to defining the fundamental laws of a universe. Physics to chemistry.<p>It is true that other APIs are of much smaller scope but the point is that the scope is so wide.')
