Racket is absolutely the best place to start. There are great books for beginners, and the documentation is top notch.<p>it comes with its own editor (Dr. Racket) that does some really helpful things for beginners, like hovering over a variable and seeing lines drawn to where it&#x27;s being used.<p>It&#x27;s not the fastest lisp, but that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s spectacular for learning and has a huge ecosystem too. My &quot;daily driver&quot; is Chicken Scheme, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a beginner. The docs just aren&#x27;t helpful to newbs (and frequently frustrating to me even though it has one of the better set of docs)<p>Vim is meh for Lisp &amp; Scheme, and I&#x27;m a Vim fan. Emacs is great. If you&#x27;re a Vim user check out Doom Emacs. It&#x27;s great for us geeks who love vim but want more power and better lisp support. But... start with Dr. Racket for now.<p>Others have mentioned the SICP book, and it is good but i wouldn&#x27;t suggest it as as &quot;how to start with lisp&quot; book. Also, watch the free lectures of the course from MIT. Very good, and make it way easier to work through the book.')
