Item(by='jimz', descendants=None, kids=[25027640], score=None, time=1604849258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025429, text='I feel like what&#x27;s not explored is that a system such as this with a centralized reputational management system and what seems to be a trade focused on easily reproduced goods of relatively low value means that this really focuses on a particular sort of middleman-aggregator actor with a much more diverse supply-chain and specialization in roles than observed. I mean, they&#x27;re not exactly selling particularly sophisticated and unique things here, and I can only imagine that reputation maintenance becomes almost a full-time job (i.e. customer service) and the actual acquisition of the goods, however unsophisticated, needs to come from somewhere else. The really interesting thing would be seeing how the supply chains work because really it&#x27;s the producers and not the salespeople that pose as actual threats that needs to be countered, although it also feels like ultimately this is a marketplace where people are more or less still scamming each other with low-quality high voume goods with a lot of hype.')
