Threat actors have their budget, limited time and goals. They could also find this information by other osint means. Even if they have it on that page, they still need to make their research.<p>Even if SolarWinds would not have a list on their page they are so big that you can count them as interesting target anyway. It is the same with Google and MSFT you can safely assume if you hack them, some of your targets will use some tools from those companies.<p>I mean security by obscurity is fine, but I don&#x27;t see what kind of value it would bring in this scenario.')
