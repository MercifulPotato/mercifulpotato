They don&#x27;t really advertise it clearly, but if the technical specifications say &quot;millions of colors&quot; it means 8-bit, if they say &quot;billions of colors&quot; it means 10-bit. (256^3 vs 1024^3.)<p>So if you&#x27;ve got the iMac model with the 4K screen, it&#x27;s 10-bit and therefore capable of 1,024 levels of color. So remapping the UX to e.g. 512 will still be fine, assuming (safely, I think?) the compositing is all done using 10-bit color.')
