Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606863512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25270632, text='I do not disagree, but I think it really depends on your definitions of &quot;poverty&quot; and &quot;middle class&quot; here. There is a big chunk of people in between those.<p>Middle-class people (in UK&#x2F;European terms at least) are likely to have had <i>some</i> exposure to long-term wealth management of some sort: owning a house, having a regular income that allows for significant savings, small investments, small businesses, pensions, etc. Hence it&#x27;s easier for them to &quot;turn out fine&quot;, as parents will have taught them the basics of interest and investment, the value of recurring income, inflation, and so on.<p>The working class, though, is a step below. They have stable paychecks but that&#x27;s it. There is less of a long-term view, and there is a concept that money is entirely linked to performing work. They are not necessarily poor or ignorant, but they are unprivileged and unfamiliar with &quot;money issues&quot;, if not downright hostile to the concept of accumulation - because they&#x27;ll never be rich, so might as well live a full life instead. A lot of athletes start from here. It&#x27;s not poverty, but it&#x27;s also a situation where there is no familiarity with, or propensity for, significant long-term wealth.<p>And then you have utter poverty, and that&#x27;s definitely a killer like you said. Some athletes come from here, but not all of them, I would argue not even the majority (although I don&#x27;t know the stats, and it probably varies across countries). However, from what I read, the issue of well-paid athletes that end up bankrupt after a few years is widespread, and going well beyond the limits of people coming from really poor backgrounds.')
