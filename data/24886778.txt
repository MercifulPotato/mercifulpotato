Gitlab and Github are both actively sharing technology. It&#x27;s not like Gitlab randomly decided &quot;Hey let&#x27;s block Iran today&quot;, obviously they have in house legal council who advised this course of action.<p>With regards to your second point, everyone knows there are sanctions on Iran, it&#x27;s been all over the news, and besides it&#x27;s not like Gitlab is a random US citizen. They are a big company that is doing business overseas. It stands to reason that they should be aware of <i>all</i> laws and restrictions on international trade.<p>I think it&#x27;s the other way around, companies like Google and Facebook should grow some responsibility, it is not unreasonable to ask a company to &quot;fish&quot; for any accounts that conflict with any laws. Google and Facebook might give the impression that it&#x27;s hard, but it&#x27;s really not, it&#x27;s only hard if you expect to make hundreds of dollars for every dollar that you invest acquiring your user base.')
