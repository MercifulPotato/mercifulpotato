It cannotis trivial configuration for people who can control and do not want the DoH service provider given by Firefox.<p>Also many places do not allow VPN traffic either. It is not as easy to bypass monitoring in a locked down environment like typical corporate firewalls, college campuses etc. Yes for every block in place like deep packet inspection etc there is usually some workaround but these become increasingly difficult as more stringent the blocking becomes, and having options like DoH helps users who cannot or do not know how to run VPNs.')
