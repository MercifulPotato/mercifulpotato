It&#x27;s kinda the industry staple these days as you can adjust the sensitivity to your play style in software without having to touch the hardware.<p>I&#x27;m a pretty high level player (passes in 15 blocks and 3 stars in 12), although I&#x27;d be content with any pad that I can just play for fun on that doesn&#x27;t require modding or constant fixing.<p>Like the blueshark, the sensitivity in Ltek pads have to be adjusted by adding material between the panels and the sensors and they&#x27;re pretty prone to either breaking or just losing their sensitivity, so they require basically weekly tune ups and they&#x27;re never really perfect.<p>Ive been looking for a pad with a bar and pressure sensors for about 1k USD. I&#x27;d buy the Stepmania X pads if the shipping costs weren&#x27;t absolutely bonkers.')
