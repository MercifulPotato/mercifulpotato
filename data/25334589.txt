We love the title, but that is not our goal. We built Stencil for a very specific use case: building out a bunch of Web Components for our Ionic Framework project so they could run in any frontend stack. Stencil will generate React, Angular, and Vue bindings from a standard Web Component base, so developers in each of those frameworks get the native experience they expect, and any issues using Web Components (in React, for example) are smoothed out and fixed.<p>Stencil is really focused on building design systems and reusable component sets, like the kind we needed for Ionic Framework.')
