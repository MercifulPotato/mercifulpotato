The whole of modern philosophy, especially political philosophy , is a product of that effort. That&#x27;s basically what the enlightenment was.<p>The problem, IMO, is that formalistic, math-like approach produces &quot;an inconsistent system can prove anything, so is essentially useless for reasoning.&quot; Going for fundamental, objective truths with a mathematical standard as an ideal can go one of three ways: delusion, nihilism or sociopathy.<p>Peter Singer, Jeremy Bentham and other utilitarians came up with a &quot;moral math&quot; system that (a) sounded morally reasonable at first pass and (b) are theoretical applicable widely. The problem they encounter is extreme conclusions. Bentham was responsible for some horrific prison&#x2F;reformatory systems. Singer ends up with some sociopathic conclusions like morally good infanticide.<p>Ayn Rand went down a philosophical worm-whole trying to tie her philosophical system into one &quot;theory-of-everything&quot; bow where pure (Aristotelian) logic yields conclusive answers to all epistemological, moral, political &amp; economic questions.  This certainty, rather than just the extreme or counterintuitive (selfishness as a virtue) elements of objectivism is what gives it that cult-like flavour.<p>Ayn Rand was simply following the frame created by Marxism, and Trotsky particularly. Marxism of that era was all about airtight rationality. Communism wasn&#x27;t a choice, but a dictate of pure reason. Marxists got this idea from French revolutionary philosophers, who started with the idea of &quot;rationalising&quot; everything with math-like systems of thought.<p>What all these have in common is a desire to create irreproachable systems. Like math, like physics. In practice, they created religions. Religions are irreproachable too. The way religions become irreproachable is by banishing heretics. That&#x27;s what the &quot;secular&quot; rationalist philosophers did to. Rand was famous for her banishments.<p>If you are after scientifically valid, reductive, Popperian insights only... you might just have to accept that this is an amoral viewpoint. Morals just don&#x27;t exist in the mathematical realm.')
