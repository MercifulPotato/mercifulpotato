A good king is one who lets their kingdom unravel to be replaced by something a bit more democratic in a more-peaceful-than-the-French-Revolution style. I don&#x27;t know the period very well, but setting the kingdom up to be invaded by the Normans is difficult to reconcile with the word &#x27;effective&#x27; without a bit more meat in the article.<p>Secondly, the article goes to none of that. All I can tell from it were there were political shenanigans afoot in the 1050s. Since there are political shenanigans every decade, everywhere, why are these ones interesting? The article does not articulate why. If anything, this is an effective advertising piece because I do now want to learn more about Edward the Confessor to figure out why Woodman thinks he is worth writing about.')
