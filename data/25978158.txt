It made me wonder if people knew they were in the middle of one of the most impactful years in American history (MLK and RFK assassinated, sentiment shift regarding Vietnam, Nixon elected, etc). I then realized that 2020 would be viewed in time in a similar fashion. It was somewhat comforting knowing that we’ve pushed through tumult in the past, and that we’re still perfectly capable of doing so.<p>It’s so easy to lose the context of our place in history when there’s a constant stream of voices all pointing and screaming at the “now”.')
