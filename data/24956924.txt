Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24957503], score=None, time=1604199818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956884, text='<i>&gt; How can a theory be consistent but unsound?</i><p>&quot;Consistent&quot; means that there is no proposition P such that both P and not-P have proofs within the theory. If F itself is consistent, then F+Not(Con(F)) will also be consistent, since Con(F) will have no proof in this theory. (Conversely, if F itself is inconsistent, then Con(F) <i>will</i> have a proof in this theory (since <i>any</i> proposition will have a proof in an inconsistent theory), so F+Not(Con(F)) will also be inconsistent.)<p>&quot;Sound&quot; means that there exists some semantic model of the theory that the theorems of the theory accurately describe. This cannot true of the theory F+Not(Con(F)), since there are only two possibilities:<p>(1) F itself is consistent--which means that, while F+Not(Con(F)) is also consistent, it can&#x27;t be sound, because the theorem (by virtue of being an axiom) Not(Con(F)) cannot accurately describe any semantic model of the theory; or<p>(2) F itself is inconsistent--which means that the theory F+Not(Con(F)) has no possible semantic model at all (since F, a subset of the theory, cannot--no inconsistent theory can have any semantic model), and therefore cannot be sound (since to be sound a theory must have <i>some</i> semantic model).<p>Possibility #1 above answers your question.')
