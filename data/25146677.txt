As a user, Apple has, over the last decade-plus,  earned my <i>trust</i> that the software I decide to run on my device won&#x27;t...<p>* brick the device\n* stay on the device in any manner if I delete it\n* access my private data without my consent \n* intrude upon the experience of any other app(s) except by way of easily-managed notifications<p>... etc.<p>As a developer, the App Store is how you explicitly inherit that inbuilt trust from users. One can&#x27;t put a price on that, because there&#x27;s no fungibility in trust. It <i>must</i> be earned.<p>Apple can, and does, however put a price on sharing that trust, as well as the ongoing infrastructure, tooling, and processes needed to maintain it: a flat cut of revenue.')
