Item(by='TaylorAlexander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609361335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583775, text='I have been working four six hour days a week for the last two years. It’s life changing. I can wake up and lay around the house in a tired stupor for an hour if I didn’t sleep well, and then start getting ready for work and leave an hour later. If I did sleep well I can go outside for a hike around the neighborhood trails or finish whatever software project I started for fun the night before. The weekends feel long. My personal project game is off the chart and I feel like I’m on the path to monetizing personal projects via YouTube. I am learning so much. I’ve started a computer vision project for my off road robot and I’m learning all the stuff required to make a self driving vehicle using only cameras, inspired by what Tesla has done and the lectures Andrej Karpathy has given on that architecture.<p>I don’t think I can ever go back to the Silicon Valley corporate churn. I’d rather be careful with my cash than be flush with RSUs and dream of living my life. I’m 36 and I’m living my life NOW, not in some far off dream after two decades of churn.<p>I feel bad that most people don’t get this opportunity. I really think we need to change our work norms to allow for this. What is the point of life if we spend it always working? I’ve been very productive at work. I’ve designed and built a whole solar powered farming robot vehicle (no tools, just the autonomous vehicle so far) in 18 months working 20-25 hours a week. Does one individual really need to be more productive than that? (You can if you want, but do we all NEED to?)')
