The consumer IO die is 2.09B transistors. The Threadripper IO dies is 8.34B transistors. M1 is 16B transistors. A14 is 11.6B transistors. That difference is mostly 2 firestorm cores&#x2F;cache, 4 GPU cores, another DDR4 controller, and some Thunderbolt&#x2F;PCIe.<p>Taking a ruler to a die shot and multiplying that area by transistor density (16B&#x2F;119mm^2) gives us somewhere around 500M transistors per core plus 3mb of cache. Adjusting out to 4.5MB per core to match Zen 3 adds another 75-100M transistors.<p>Zen 3 gives 518M transistors per core, but that includes interconnects. Taking a ruler to the core reveals about 14% of the die is interconnect, SMU, and wafer tests (about 580M transistors). Subtracting that from 4.15B and dividing into even core&#x2F;cache gives 446M transistors per core.<p>We&#x27;ll assume an identical IO cost of 8.5B transistors and 150M transistors of interconnect per core. (64 * (600 + 150)) + 8500\nis 56.5B transistors and 420mm^2 total area. A zen 3 chip with similar densities would be 310mm^2.<p>No matter how you slice and dice that, Apple&#x27;s chip is going to be significantly more expensive than AMD&#x27;s chip. Thinking anything different is a pipe dream.<p>EDIT: also note that formal verification adds a lot to chip pricing.')
