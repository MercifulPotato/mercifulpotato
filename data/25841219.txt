And they will continue to happen until that lesson is learned.<p>This is completely different to an entitled middle income mob of COS-playing couch heroes storming the political centre of the US and making credible threats against elected representatives inside it - after a speech <i>by the president</i> which inflamed the mob, and after a campaign of lies <i>by the president</i> which threatened the foundation of electoral integrity.<p>All very possibly at the behest of a hostile foreign power.<p>That&#x27;s simple textbook domestic terrorism. It has no excuse or justification, and it&#x27;s naive and misleading to suggest the two are somehow equivalent.')
