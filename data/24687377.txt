ECS is a direct consequence of seperating data from code.<p>Furthermore for it to work well you normally also want #2, #3 and #4.<p>Sure you can build a ECS without #2,#3 and #4 but it makes it more complex.<p>Lastly in a ECS you split up components into many parts each having their own data and you normally want the idea behind #5 to apply to each of the parts.<p>EDIT: Well ok, weather #2 makes any sense at all depends on the language you use. And using a language where #2 makes no sense can be a as reasonable choice. I only would apply #2 IF it makes sense for you language of choice.')
