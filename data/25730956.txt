Maybe there&#x27;s going to be a huge open-source project that will make these updates. Maybe someone will figure out a way to automatically handle a large number of hardware configurations at scale (a powerful enough hardware abstraction layer should be able to deal with it). Maybe someone will make a business out of it, providing security updates at a reasonable cost. Either way, there shouldn&#x27;t be any artificial hurdles against the customer developing and running their own firmware on hardware they paid money for.')
