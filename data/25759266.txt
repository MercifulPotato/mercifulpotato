If this would have happened 2 years ago or 4 years ago, he wouldn&#x27;t have been banned. Just like all the people around him that are leaving him like the media is saying &quot;rats leaving the ship&quot;, the same thing happens now with all these platforms and the media. They should have ignored&#x2F;sanction him for all the lies and all the misinformation he promoted even before he had a chance in getting that nomination, but he was the golden goose that got reactions, engagement and rage across the board. So this is just &quot;rats leaving the ship&quot;.')
