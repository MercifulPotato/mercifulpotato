People do rent for many reasons, but in my cohort the primary reason is &quot;cannot afford to buy&quot;, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s unusual. As I pointed out, homes would be strictly easier to purchase with fewer landlords in the market.<p>I don&#x27;t think my comparisons are absurd, which is why I made them: They are illustrative. Just as loan sharks occasionally do provide valuable loans to people with no other option, so too do landlords occasionally provide valuable flexibility. However, it&#x27;s not their primary effect.')
