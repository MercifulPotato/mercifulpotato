The article primarily addresses beauty as an important feature of science (and it probably is, as Tupolev said, &quot;an ugly plane won&#x27;t fly&quot;) but one can go much farther.<p>Not only is beauty valid in science, anything that advances science is. Epistemological anarchy is what we should strive for, because everything else inhibits science. In a sense the irony is directly visible in the modern scientific attitude. Empirical data and experimentation are supposed to reign supreme, the only thing that is <i>verboten</i> is experimentation with the scientific doctrine itself, which is supposed to be taken almost on faith, full of complex rituals that everyone needs to abide by.<p>The mainstream story about Galileo often implies that it was the sinister church at odds with the enlightened scientist. But the reality is much different. It wasn&#x27;t just the church, but actually also establishment science at the time that was very unconvinced. Galileo&#x27;s heliocentric worldview could not account for his own empirical observations. (Diffraction was not yet known, so he estimated that observed stars were closer by a factor that was off by a thousand, prompting everyone else to ask why, if his theories are true, observed stars don&#x27;t change drastically in size if the earth indeed moves around the sun. He didn&#x27;t really help his case by essentially writing what you could today call trollish treatises in which he was just mocking everyone for their criticism.<p>But as it turns out in the end he was right, despite what (even relatively sound) science had to say. It shows that science is fundamentally uneven, that ignoring existing &#x27;truths&#x27; for the purpose of radical shifts, even for dumb reasons, might advance science.')
