In the early 2000s I occasionally saw poop on the sidewalks and it felt to me the homeliness was confined to certain areas. I went back last June and was shocked about how the homeliness problem had grown. The city also had become very dirty. But to me the largest change was how vacant the streets felt. I am sure COVID was part of this as was flawed memory but it was a pretty summer day and no one was out.')
