No reason to believe that would be the case.<p>Would it lower the cost of goods so that at least the working poor could have a better standard of living?<p>Perhaps, but how much of the cost of a good is the energy, how much labor and raw materials? Would we see even more job loss due to lower cost of energy as it becomes even cheaper still to automate?<p>(Edit: to be clear, OP wasn&#x27;t saying lowering energy costs would do anything more than lower the cost of goods. But that statement alone, coupled with the article showing declining wages, etc. suggests OP was implying lower energy costs could reverse or stop the trends shown.)')
