The usual &quot;node&quot; figure is utterly meaningless; an electrical engineer couldn&#x27;t care less about &quot;feature&quot; size (whatever that means.)  What is the count of discrete components in a given area?  There are 40 billion 5nm (the supposed &quot;node&quot; of these chips) squares in a millimeter of area.  That&#x27;s <i>two orders</i> of magnitude more dense than 134 million.<p>The meaningful achievement is how many discrete electrical components are composed into a given area.  Not some arbitrary dimension of some cherry picked subset of these components.')
