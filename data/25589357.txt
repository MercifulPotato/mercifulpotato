This is called quantum parallelism.<p>This is a common misrepresentation of how quantum computers work. Because we can start in one state (e.g. |0^n&gt;, the all-zero n-qubit state), and apply the Hadamard gate to each qubit. And now we are in the universal superposition state (measuring has an equal probability for each n-bit bitstring). Oh no! what happened?<p>If you are under the belief that quantum computation is &#x27;like classical computation, but in parallel&#x27;, going from one single state to a superposition is impossible. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t accurately capture what quantum computation does.')
