I consider myself somewhat objective on this issue. I have biases that run counter to most on this site(I lean right politically). I would consider Trump&#x27;s incompetency to be an objective assessment when considering the massive amount of political blunders that he has made combined with the instability that he has triggered, or at least amplified. I&#x27;d say he also took advantage of his base as well, seeing how wildly different their assessment of the election is compared to the mainstream narrative.<p>If you disagree with me, then how would you measure or determine objectivity?')
