In 2 different restaurants (Pop&#x27;s Diner and Flat Rock Wood Room) parties were sat at tables adjacent to ours. I actually had to check to see if NC had any sort of restrictions in place.  Anecdotally, I would say that mask adoption in SC where I live is ~65-70% but even in places where I was in the minority for wearing a mask I&#x27;ve never seen a smirk or a chuckle and definitely haven&#x27;t felt alienated.')
