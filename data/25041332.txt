I think it puts prospective employees at a disadvantage. Also it can waste applicants&#x27; time if you&#x27;ll never pay as much as they need or expect.<p>I think your mission is valuable. I want public services to serve the public well. I hope you consider being more open about potential salary ranges because people like me would feel more comfortable applying.')
