Mind sharing some of the ones you found worked the best for you on a regular basis?<p>- I noticed a lot of yoga videos involve rounding your back eg in toe touching movements. This really put me off because from everything I&#x27;ve read (a lot of Stuart McGill), movements that take your spine out of neutral position and put load on it are bad for the long term health of your back. Did the yoga you practiced involve these movements? Did you notice any ill effects on your back health?')
