What would the type be?<p>It would be bytes. Because py2 string === py3 bytes.<p>&gt; What if that py3 function then passed it to a py2 function - would it become a string again?<p>Yes<p>&gt; Would you have two string types - py2string that accepts anything and py3string that only works with utf8?<p>Yes. You already have those two types in python3. bytes and string. You&#x27;d just alias those as string and utf8 or whatever you want to call it in python2.<p>How would this all work with C modules?<p>They&#x27;d have specify which mode they were working with too.')
