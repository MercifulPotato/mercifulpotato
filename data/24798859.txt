Thanks so much for the questions.<p>- The PoPs are meant to be purchased by retail investors, we&#x27;ve sold 35 of them so far. We&#x27;re offering it as a franchisee agreement for a period of 6 years with a 70-30 revenue share split with minimum guaranteed revenue.<p>- Regarding the FSOs, we&#x27;ve been serving thousands of live customers for the last 9 months off the FSOs and have greater than 99% uptime through rain, hail and heavy winds. FSO has come a long way in terms of reliability and throughput since the early days. We&#x27;re using the 1535nm - 1565nm wavelength.<p>- We&#x27;ve wired thousands of public wifi hotspots as well as large buildings and campuses over the last 3 years and a have a really clear deployment strategy and team in place.<p>- Yes, the $20k covers the cost of the lasers, deployment, sales and management of the service and customers. We&#x27;ve put in a huge amount of effort over the last 3 years to bring costs down by using a lot commodity components for routers, switches, etc.<p>- The $20k price point hasn&#x27;t been much of an issue so far, but happy to hear more feedback on that. We&#x27;re thinking about setting aside a few PoPs where a group of people can pool money to purchase one. Would love to hear your thoughts on that.')
