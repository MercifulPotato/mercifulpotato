Sorry.&quot;<p>Comments included: &quot;I worked at a store and every year we&#x27;d get someone insisting they bought such an adapter the previous year&quot;, &quot;such an adapter would leave energized bare prongs at the other end&quot;, and (relevent to this discussion) &quot;the fuse would be at the wrong end of the string of lights&quot;.<p>And, of course, all sorts of comments about homemade adapters, generators being used with such adapters to energize circuits during power outages, etc...')
