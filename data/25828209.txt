Item(by='throwaway9870', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611014039, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821637, text='I had an employee adopt a foster child around 10-11yrs old. Quite an eye opener for me. Employee missed a huge amount of time (which I allowed with no questions) because the child just could not function. When they put the child in school, the police were called a couple times a week (I am not exaggerating). Finally, the child accused one of new parents of child abuse because they were not allowed to do something. Child services took the child back in custody but no charges were pressed because everyone involved knew what was going on and what happened. My employee that adopted this child was heart broken and talked to them everyday even a year later. Truly a terrible situation.<p>Bottom line: young children can be broken severely at a very young age and it is extremely hard to fix then going forward.')
