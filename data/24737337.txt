Then why was he given the Nobel Peace Prize? See that is why I said it is a joke! You guys have different standards for Obama and Trump. With Obama, he literally did not do anything and was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Even he was shocked when he heard it. But Trump did much more good than Obama and yet he hasn&#x27;t been awarded. It is a joke!<p>Obama literally launched 12 new proxy wars during his entire tenure. Trump hasn&#x27;t launched even one. Most US Presidents have been involved in some War or the other. Trump pulled troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. That is an accomplishment in itself.')
