A classical state machine will thus behave different, depending when it receives the event.\nHowever, in FRP you _must_ either parametrize the event with the current time, or you need to have something _outside_ of the statemachine (such as an effect interpreter) which handles effects such as printing the current time. A classic state machine does not have these restrictions.')
