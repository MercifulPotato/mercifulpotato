Thankfully, I was aware enough to prevent hitting them. A combination of a slow enough speed, good brakes, enough distance, and luck (to be honest). It was a jarring experience each time, and each time it was completely unexpected. Of course I care about the life of the people who almost got hit - and I&#x27;m glad they didn&#x27;t get maimed.  But I absolutely did do a lot of cursing and wondering why they didn&#x27;t look both ways.')
