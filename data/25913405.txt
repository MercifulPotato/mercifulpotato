I am guessing they&#x27;re easier to use on a channel oriented network where a small number of senders and receivers are protecting a multiplexed packet stream.  Additionally I&#x27;m guessing the most effective use would be 2D encodings like optical media use to spread the codes out over time (for runs of bit errors) and space (single bit errors) which would introduce another latency&#x2F;efficiency tradeoff.')
