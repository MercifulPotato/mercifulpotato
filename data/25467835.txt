The headset fits over both eyes and features a rapid onslaught of white and red blinking LEDs, <i>much like the actual device neurologists use in real life to trigger a seizure when they need to trigger one for diagnosis purposes. ... This is a pattern of lights designed to trigger an epileptic episode</i> and it very much did that in my own personal playthrough.<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;<p>Emphasis mine.<p>&gt; What possible reason could there be for that?<p>Probably for the same reason devs model decapitations and other deadly effects off real world references: using real world lighting patterns that are known to effect the brain adds a sense of authenticity to the world.<p>Even if the intent was not malicious, the device and lighting pattern are too spot-on to be mere coincidence.')
