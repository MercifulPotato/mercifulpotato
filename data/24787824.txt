In that sense, one could argue that the software has also become more complex, and perhaps more fragile, in recent times in order to better assist individuals in navigating this world.<p>To your other point, I think that &quot;education&quot; and &quot;critical thinking skills&quot; are often conflated as one and the same, or that perhaps one necessarily leads to the other, but this is certainly not the case. While I think being educated to some degree is important in order to share a &quot;common language&quot; with others and to become a contributing member of society, the ability to think critically, and to act on it, is really necessary if we are to succeed and not fail catastrophically along the way.<p>To go back to the analogy, having the ability to execute the software faithfully is one thing, but understanding when it might make sense to modify the software and how to do so responsibly given the fixed hardware we have available is really the critical piece.')
