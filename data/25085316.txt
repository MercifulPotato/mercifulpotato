The fluidity of labor does not imply the commodification of labor. It implies a wider market for it, which has benefits like increasing the liquidity accessible to those with labor to sell. This marketization of labor  was partially responsible for wages increasing over 20 fold, in inflation adjusted terms, since 1820.<p>Increasing the market for a product&#x2F;service provides greater than zero sum gains for society. For instance, creating a global market for fine art doesn&#x27;t make fine art less valuable.
