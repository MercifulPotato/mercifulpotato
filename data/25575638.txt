Is musk worse for disparity of whealt ? And a man who earn 30k and use 10k to live ? Is him different from a guy who earn 10k and use 10k to live ? Yeah the first ok one may have more cash if something goes bad.. but theyr lifestyle may be the same ... I think that the difference should be calculated on what we spend not in net worth ...  if I have 1 trilion$ and spend 0 and live like a homeless because I don&#x27;t wond to spend those money but maybe because I don&#x27;t need or can spend ..why should I been considered as society monster from those kind of statistics ?<p>Net worth over certain threshold is non sense imo , someone who own a company may be calculated was total company value net worth but probably have a quote normal life and his net worth is in the market\\street creating jobs, plus having a 1m earning and 1m spending  i could have net worth 0 , but i would me different from who have 300$ income year<p>An ultra rich doesn&#x27;t abuse society until he spend his money for things useless to the society imho.. that&#x27;s what should be tracked. How much wealth is wasted for a golden toilet .. not accumulated')
