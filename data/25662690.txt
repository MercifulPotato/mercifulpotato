Never have we been a country full of people willing to admit we&#x27;re wrong. But we&#x27;re increasingly a country of people being pandered to by those who want to make a buck telling us we&#x27;re not actually wrong.<p>I think you&#x27;d more easily make the OPPOSITE argument, that our norms about what is acceptable speech have eroded too far, that we&#x27;ve taken free speech to an unhealthy extreme (such as how our tech platforms will happily amplify the speech of extremists - in fact, they PREFER to do this, because their algorithms have figured out that it gets more ad views).<p>If it&#x27;s acceptable for politicians to respond to losing popularity by claiming fraud - as Trump has been doing for months - then you are on the path that leads here. If the resulting violence <i>is not</i> acceptable, but you ALSO don&#x27;t want to restrict Trump&#x27;s speech with stronger norms, what do you propose instead?<p>How many previous presidents would be inciting this sort of thing? How is that the result of <i>less</i> free speech?')
