They measure &quot;aggressive behavior&quot; based on a questionnaire.<p>They look for a correlation between the &quot;class&quot; of gamer; literally &quot;people who play a lot at younger ages, drop, and then increase&quot;, &quot;people who play a moderate amount at younger ages, drop and then slightly increase&quot;, and &quot;people who play only a little bit at a young age but increase&quot; and report no correlation between those classes and the aggression assessment based on the questionnaire.<p>I admire the fact that they didn&#x27;t do more work to p-hack their way into a correlation; they went with one methodology and showed that it didn&#x27;t produce a correlation, and reported that. But even though I agree with the article&#x27;s conclusion, I don&#x27;t think the data support it in any meaningful way.')
