Even eating absolute junk in Europe I noticed I lost 5 or 6 pounds over 2 weeks.<p>Here if I eat junk food for 3 days my weight jumps by 7 pounds. I am a bit dismayed with all the attempts to normalize obesity in the US. I was morbidly obese up until I got serious about my weight in my early 20s. You can read all the dating books you want, but getting in shape is the only thing that works. It&#x27;s much easier to hop on Reddit and complain though.<p>I&#x27;m very optimistic I&#x27;ll be able to move to a healthier country once I retire at 40 or so. Not exactly easy to stay in shape when this country tries to pump us all full of corn syrup')
