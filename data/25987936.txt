I definitely think it&#x27;s the way to go on 4 disk setups, as it has the same failure level as a RAID5 but with significantly faster resilver times (i.e. both can lose any 1 disk and recover). RAID10 could theoretically lose 2 disks and recover so long as they&#x27;re not in the same mirror pair.<p>After that it starts to feel like a bit more of a gamble though as you _could_ lose all disks in a single mirror on larger arrays. Say with 12 disks and a RAID7 setup (I&#x27;m converting from ZFS setups which is what I know :D) compared to RAID10; you could in theory tolerate notably more disk failures (50%) in RAID10, but you could also take 2 failures in the same mirror and immediately lose data.<p>But yeah the resilver times are horrible even when just mirroring two drives on my server, so I&#x27;m definitely wary of the stress resilvering a RAID5-7 array will put on the disks.<p>I think my ideal setup would be two servers with RAID10 arrays mirroring each other. Or I suppose with ZFS you could create two RAID10 arrays in the same machine and then make them a mirrored pair. Which would be entertaining, but I have no idea what RAID number that converts into!')
