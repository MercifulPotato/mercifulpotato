The EU has more or less the same wealth floating around as any other western country, but it&#x27;s in total stagnation.<p>We can argue about why this is, but the end result is that asset prices are high, while there&#x27;s no incentive to cycle money through the economy in a way that allows wealth building.<p>Not even the government is willing to spend, which is a problem because the government has set itself up to be the subsidizer of everything.
