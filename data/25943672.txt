Item(by='AndrewStephens', descendants=None, kids=[25946989], score=None, time=1611848877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25942240, text='I have watched this mess from afar and the tone of the conversation has changed from &quot;Hey, here is an opportunity to make some money off a mistake some hedge funds are making&quot; to &quot;Smash the system&quot;. Exhibit A - this idiotic article.<p>You cannot use the tools of the system to beat the system.<p>Here is the thing about hedge funds - they hedge. They hedge in the morning, hedge in the afternoon, eat some hedge for dinner and get in a few rounds of hedging in down at the hedge club before going to bed dreaming of hedges. The clue is in the name. They don&#x27;t typically make huge loses or gains for a single stock, they are happy to make a consistent gain every day.<p>The vast majority of hedge funds are making stacks of small gains off this nonsense and anyone who doesn&#x27;t cash out at the right time is going to be hosed. Do you know when the right time to cash out is? No? Sucks to be you.<p>Honestly I am worried. Mob investing has collapsed economies, brought down governments, and ruined more lives than can be counted during the last 150 years, and I don&#x27;t see how this is different.<p>This is completely ridiculous and will all end in tears. I am actually glad that some pressure is being put on Reddit and the brokers to cool things off - there are opportunities to cash out big time but a lot of the small players are going to lose money.')
