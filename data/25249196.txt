Trying to paint it as anti-science ignores all of the scientists urging caution &amp; regulation, not to mention the other arguments. The antivax and birth control complaints are similarly unfounded - you can find people with any combination of views but that one is not even remotely representative.<p>As a simple example of an argument which the poster omitted, I know multiple scientists - people who use genetic modification techniques for their work – who are in favor of GMOs conceptually but opposed to  Monsanto’s sweeping ownership views (hybridization of GMOs with other crops), broader ecological impacts from increased pesticide usage, or want stricter regulation before things are released into the wild. None of those positions are honestly characterized as anti-science.')
