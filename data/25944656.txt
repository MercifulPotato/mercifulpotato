So, if you have a camera you can shoot a ray into the scene and pick some points on it to ask if it is inside the model. if so you paint that pixel with the surface material of the model. Then it&#x27;s just a matter of picking a good way of sampling points along the camera ray. usually this distance function is some basic math (distance to sphere or so). But here they take a 3d mesh and create a neural network that can answer the question of distance to it (since meshes are very slow at that).')
