Are they terminating new service for all DSL based technologies, or just actual &quot;old school&quot; DSL? It focusses on FTTH but most of AT&amp;Ts service area is actually FTTN. I assume FTTN service (VDSL) is not being terminated to new subscribers?<p>If it&#x27;s just DSL service then to be honest 4G is likely to be vastly better for most people. Some will be left out though, which is a real pain, but many countries are switching off new DSL connections (though probably not as quickly&#x2F;aggressively in rural areas as AT&amp;T is here) if not migrating en mass to at least VDSL.<p>DSL requires a tonne of maintence compared to even VDSL&#x2F;FTTN, as you can replace the main run of copper from the exchange to the local node with fibre and then just need to worry about the last mile connection part. In most network topologies this reduces the amount of copper in the last mile by 70%+, with significant opex savings. 4G&#x2F;5G can provide better speeds in nearly all cases with none of the cost. Starlink will also be super interesting for this segment too.')
