If the program takes longer to run, but the computer would still be turned on for the same amount of time, how much does that change the amount of power used?\nAnd, if the program finishes sooner, will some other program be run in its stead?<p>Now, there are benefits to code being more efficient, and computers being more energy efficient, but I don&#x27;t think computation time on personal computers is a substantial contributor to household energy use, nor a relatively easy&#x2F;kwh to reduce contributor to it.<p>And even then, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if &quot;getting people to power off their pcs when not using them&quot; could have more of a contribution than &quot;making the programs they use run faster&quot;.<p>That being said, striving for excellence is a virtue, and I think wanting one&#x27;s code to be efficient is good on those grounds.<p>Philippians 4:8, NIV: &quot;Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.&quot;<p>Efficient code is more admirable and praiseworthy than inefficient code, for the most part, I think.')
