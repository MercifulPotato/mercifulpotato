Item(by='ddsaso', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1610553431, title='Ask HN: What tools do you use to build and share demos of API based products?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I’m curious what tools or combination of tools you use to build&#x2F;share customized demos of your API based products to customers? I usually do a combination of pushing code to a GitHub repo, deploying to PaaS, then after a call sharing a link to both. But, it often feels a little messy and cluttered for both internal discoverability and external sharing. For example, internal sales folks who want to demo to a user need to sign up and learn how to traverse a GitHub repo, sign up and learn to traverse a SaaS product, etc. Feels suboptimal for them. On the customer side, sharing a demo via a GitHub repo and link to the running application seems relatively ok. Although I would like to consolidate the two so in the off chance it’s further shared internally, it’s not an email forward with a bundle of links and text explaining each link. Although I don’t have hard data on how much in internal forwarding happens. In any case, curious to hear what others do and if there are better setups I can consider or if I just need to scratch my own itch.')
