Item(by='sigmaprimus', descendants=None, kids=[24929300], score=None, time=1603954686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927574, text='Yes these were 19&quot; upright coin-op arcade machines, located mostly in bars and pubs.<p>It cost more than a quarter a game when it first came out, pretty sure it was at least a dollar. Even at that it would still take 13+ Hours which you&#x27;re right that seems like plenty of time, it&#x27;s possible the two player games earned faster or the cost per game was higher.<p>This was also long before cell phones or even pagers were common, so if a machine went down on a weekend it represented a pretty big loss.<p>The cash that these machines earned was crazy and the distributor conventions (and after parties) held in the 80s were legendary!<p>EDIT: Actually the conventions and parties up until the mid 90s were pretty wild too! Street Fighter 3 earned 5K a week for the 1st month it came out, I remember converting Asia market games from 220V to 110V just so we could get a jump on the North American cabinets. Cherry Master &quot;Grey&quot; machines were pulling in even more.')
