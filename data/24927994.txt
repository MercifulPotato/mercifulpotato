Even at that it would still take 13+ Hours which you&#x27;re right that seems like plenty of time, it&#x27;s possible the two player games earned faster or the cost per game was higher.<p>This was also long before cell phones or even pagers were common, so if a machine went down on a weekend it represented a pretty big loss.<p>The cash that these machines earned was crazy and the distributor conventions (and after parties) held in the 80s were legendary!')
