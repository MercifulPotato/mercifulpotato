But profitability is a poor proxy for whether a thing is useful to do or not.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s unique to capitalism. The Soviets were building spacecraft and nuclear weapons while people went without food.<p>Curing an extremely rare disease is valuable, we all value human life. But say there are tens of thousands of uncured diseases and more coming every year. Then let&#x27;s say there is a finite number of people capable of working on them, how do you decide which cure we&#x27;re going to target. The tradeoffs are a consequence of limited resources, not the system.<p>Market based health care does make me uncomfortable though, mainly because the incentives aren&#x27;t in curing but in perpetual treatment to generate an income stream.')
