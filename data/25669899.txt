I don&#x27;t text back or call back immediately, which my friends and family forgive, but it sometimes seems to hurt my relationships.<p>I still worry of dependence on large companies, big data companies gathering more information about me than I know myself, and the potential of out-of-control AIs. However, I attribute these in-part to my own paranoid thinking that use my memories of large company layoffs, privacy concerns raised in the tech community, and mostly fiction.<p>While I&#x27;ve come to the realization that the act to trying to be happy and successful is the very thing that makes me unhappy, and I just need to exist, maybe becoming better at whatever I&#x27;m naturally good at, while being here and now with those I&#x27;m with, giving my service to them... I still keep wasting time replying about things that don&#x27;t matter.')
