We are banning people for using our API in ways that our official client doesn&#x27;t. This is paramount to our spam detection strategy, which is detecting quirks in requests that try and emulate our official client, in order to send spam. There is a very thin line between &quot;scripts meant to try and emulate our client to send spam in an automated fashion&quot; and &quot;third party client&quot; both try and emulate our client, but perhaps for different intent. However, our systems currently treat these as equals. It is for this reason that we have maintained that 3rd party clients are against our ToS - and most warn you before you use them. Given the vanishingly small user-base of 3rd party clients relative to the tremendous amount of spam-bots that constantly are attacking our platform, it&#x27;s an unfortunate reality that this is bound to happen.<p>If you are a real human, and not a spam bot, our general policy is to unban and tell you &quot;hey don&#x27;t do that again.&quot; Which is the outcome that should have (and eventually did) happened here.')
