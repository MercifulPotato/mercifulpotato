The number of trucks on the road is minuscule compared to passenger cars, they just put on a lot more miles. A kilogram of lithium used in a truck battery will accomplish more than a kilogram of lithium used in a car battery. (Which also suggests the industry may be less cost-sensitive and able to tolerate price increases if they ever happen, although the trajectory is solidly downward.)<p>Furthermore, secondary use of EV packs (when they&#x27;re down to maybe 60% of nameplate capacity, they&#x27;re replaced and the old ones are sold into stationary applications) means that there&#x27;ll be _decreasing_ demand for purpose-built stationary batteries. Five years ago, if you wanted to put together a massive lithium backup system, you had to buy new batteries. Today, you can head over to batteryhookup and get BMW, BYD, Mercedes, and other ex-EV batteries for pennies on the dollar, in modules with the connectors on &#x27;em and everything.<p>The industry is actively pursuing this, by the way. Five years from now, it&#x27;ll either be much easier and more official, or wrapped up in-house and out of third-party reach. But either way, the path from EV to stationary use is developing, and the packs which already did some service on the road, will fill much of the need for stationary batteries, displacing that market&#x27;s appetite for virgin batteries.<p>As the secondary market floods with ex-EV packs, at some point it becomes economical to &quot;mine&quot; the really-dead ones for their lithium, and the loop closes. Recycling plants aren&#x27;t the same as virgin-lithium plants, but we&#x27;ll see those developing in due time.')
