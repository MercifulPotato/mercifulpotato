It makes sense that businesses would want to get all of their IT solutions from a single integrated company for simplicity&#x27;s sake, and it makes sense that consumers don&#x27;t mess with actual files as much as they used to. But for my own purposes I actually wish Dropbox would <i>stop</i> trying to move beyond their core product. And even though the market of people like me has shrunk, I don&#x27;t think it will ever go away completely.')
