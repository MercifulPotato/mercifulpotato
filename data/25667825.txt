Item(by='edmundsauto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610000036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666661, text='My understanding (from reading a book called &quot;who wrote the Bible&quot;) is scholars generally agree Jesus existed, but out of the 5 main objective criteria for &quot;did a character exist&quot;, he only satisfies 3 of the 5.  IIRC, the fact that he plays so prominently in modern life acts as an effect size: in the 3 categories he can be confirmed, he is off the charts.<p>So it is generally accepted he existed, even if the criteria used to judge other historical characters is loosened for JC.<p>Edit - but please try to not say things like &quot;ignorant&quot; or &quot;disabused&quot; unless you meant to attack OP.  Those are pretty loaded words for a collegial discussion.')
