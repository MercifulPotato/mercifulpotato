Item(by='wayneftw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605803481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148170, text='&gt; Ctrl-C copies if there&#x27;s a selection, which is unnecessary under OSX<p>That&#x27;s because macOS uses a wholly different keyboard shortcut for copy which is only a standard for Apple. The rest of the world uses the IBM CUA standard at their core. On a Linux desktop, you use `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy when in the terminal. Alternatively, you can re-bind Super+C and Super+V to copy and paste - then it&#x27;s just like your Mac. But I wouldn&#x27;t do that [0].<p>Macs have all sorts of inconsistencies and hardships for keyboard users. For instance, open the `About this Mac` window (or any app running in the menubar which is not a System Preferences app) and then move focus away from that program. Now try to use the keyboard to switch back to it. You can&#x27;t. The only way you can do that is by starting `About this Mac` over again via Spotlight or by focusing on the menu (Fn+Ctrl+F2) to restart it.<p>Aside from that, if you don&#x27;t want to memorize keyboard shortcuts on your Mac you have to at least memorize the cryptic symbols that they show in the program menus. A sane OS shows the same words that are typically printed on a keyboard (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Esc) whereas macOS shows you a caret symbol, a long up arrow arrow symbol, a lambda symbol or the &quot;Escape&quot; symbol that looks too much like the international symbol for the power button... and then they don&#x27;t print those symbols anywhere on the laptop&#x27;s keyboard. Those symbols are only printed on the external Mac keyboards, not the ones that come with your Macbook.<p>[0] Macs have so many limitations. You can&#x27;t even easily change the mouse pointer color from black to white without buying a third party program - and even then - that program didn&#x27;t exist for a long, long time. I&#x27;ve tried to force my Mac to be an OS that I like by getting rid of the <i>hideous</i> global menu bar and replacing the brain-dead dock with uBar, using Witch instead of Cmd+Tab, using Karabiner to modify all the keyboard shortcuts and so forth and so on... It&#x27;s not worth it and things will break often. So now I just use it the way it was intended (but only when I have to - I vastly prefer XFCE and Linux).')
