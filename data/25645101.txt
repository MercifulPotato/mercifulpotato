Nobody said that.  The crucial word in your sentence is &quot;all&quot;, with which nobody has agreed here.  Of course nobody is above law.  But sometimes, in exceptional circumstances, a particular law turns out to be immoral.  In that case, and only in that case, it is wrong to follow that particular law, and it is right to do the illegal alternative.<p>If a company is found to have followed an immoral law and performed harmful (but lawful) acts, it is right that society punish that company later (e.g., when the law situation is solved).  More so in this case, when the company is overzealous in its application of that immoral law.')
