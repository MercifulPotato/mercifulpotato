I&#x27;m realizing the lighter-gray text is donwnvted posts. Is it a large number to cause it? I see nothing inflammatory here, it&#x27;s a well-reasoned response, where both posters essentially agree - we are at an impasse do to the fundamental incompatability of the modern versions of teams Red and Blue.\nAm I to infer that the it&#x27;s being downvoted simply because it suggests that both sides are responsible for the state of affairs? I am used to encountering this in the world from both sides, but it&#x27;s sort of extra disappointing to see such behavior here.\nForgive me if I&#x27;m missing something.')
