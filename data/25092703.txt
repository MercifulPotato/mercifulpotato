However, during the daily grind of shuffling data around for 13 hours, an existential crisis inevitably creeps in. I envisioned I&#x27;d be building the algorithms of consciousness - instead, I&#x27;m optimizing the concatenation of data frames in Pandas.<p>To overcome days like these, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best to zoom out and meditate on the awesomeness of it all - that we live in a Universe where scratching a piece of silicone bestows upon it the power of thought itself. I often rekindle my passion by rewatching the movies that impelled me to enter the field years ago: 2001 Space Odyssey, Iron Man, Her, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve now edited them all into a 4-minute &quot;supercut&quot;, a short video I can watch whenever I&#x27;m in need of some inspiration: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;z6fRZd9FM7A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;z6fRZd9FM7A</a><p>I hope you&#x27;ll like watching it as much as I loved making it :)')
