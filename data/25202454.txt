Cover every windy plain with wind turbines. Take all the excess power and instead of building expensive batteries, use it to power this CO2 -&gt; synthetic liquid fuel process.<p>This makes our current infrastructure carbon-neutral, yes. But that doesn&#x27;t solve global warming? Atmospheric CO2 levels are <i>already</i> too high. We&#x27;re at 413ppm, and we need to go back to 350ppm. Doing that requires carbon sequestration, which by definition makes no useful product.<p>The scale of the problem is thus: every kilogram of coal that has ever been dug up needs to be unburnt and buried, and every barrel of oil ever pumped out of the ground needs to be put back. That&#x27;s the only way you can get to 350 ppm.')
