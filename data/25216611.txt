I stumbled on it when looking up old connections for something I&#x27;m doing now. Here is a video of Phil introducing MmHmm[2]. In my very limited and a few interaction with him, I found him to be a kind person, and was super responsive to a small guy when he was very busy, and around its peak with Evernote (2010-2011).<p>While waiting for MmHmm&#x27;s invite, I got invited to try Around[3]. I haven&#x27;t tried MmHmm but it seems to share similar features with Around. I find Around nifty while pitching prospective customers but rather too-much-ado for, say, our team meetings - face-to-face visual meetings with audio.<p>After a while, all the bells and whistles wares down and we want to just stay at the basics. Just my thoughts from our small team&#x27;s experience.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evernote.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evernote.com</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.around.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.around.co</a>')
