Do it in a well-behaved manner, dont try to argue, just try to explain your feelings. I know, it must be hard for you to open up, since you are an introvert. But bear in mind that in any job there is someone who you will not like, so changing a job might not be a solution. So dont worry, you wont break anything, nobody should be angry at you only for a small talk about your feelings.<p>After you pick up your courage and talk to him, wait what will happen. Maybe you will need to do it second time. If it will not stop, just talk to somebody else above him and somebody may find a better solution for you two.')
