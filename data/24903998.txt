This means there is some lag time to setting this up, and that it isn&#x27;t done with automation. So if you have an application you want to spin up a custom domain with a temporary user pool, test something, and then destroy it later, it&#x27;s probably not going to work without some custom workarounds. No need for this with a traditional VPN.<p>- If you have 50 different apps, with 50 different URLs, you&#x27;re going to need to do the above 50 times. Also have 50 staging and dev portals? Same deal. Now try managing changes to all of those at once. The manual steps, plus all the integration with all the product teams, now means this whole thing is becoming burdensome. This is a <i>lot</i> more work than just &quot;use this VPN client and whitelist these CIDRs&quot;.<p>- If you&#x27;re working for one of those weird companies that loves to do split-horizon DNS with lots of custom internal-only domains, guess what? Probably not gonna work without a VPN.<p>- Onboarding can be complicated. You now need to help your users manage their accounts, such as password resets, being a part of different domains, using a supported device, MFA registration, troubleshooting internet connections, using a supported CLI tool for non-web-interface APIs, etc. Versus just saying &quot;are you connected to the VPN?&quot;.<p>- A VPN allows a central network team to manage access control across the entire network (or wherever that network team manages networks). BeyondCorp needs to be managed for all of your products by one team, or you may end up with an uneven and difficult process of supporting users across teams. A lot of companies (maybe most) are just not set up to allow independent product teams to manage internal user access. Even then, authorization maybe, not probably not both AuthN + Z.<p>- If you have a single domain serving multiple apps in multiple URLs requiring different authorization, things can get more complex.<p>Ultimately I think most of the protocols used for BeyondCorp today have too many drawbacks to say we could all drop our VPNs in support of it. We&#x27;ll probably need at least another generation of protocols and management workflows in order for it to become the new norm.')
