Item(by='echelon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603074208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822637, text='&gt; You must be pretty far to the right if you’re going to argue Miami is working well<p>That&#x27;s a baseless and factually incorrect accusation.<p>&gt; Have you spent much time in these places?<p>Yes, and I don&#x27;t see the world the same way you do.<p>&gt; After decades you still can’t take a train from the airport to the main destination (Miami Beach).<p>That&#x27;s a problem? There are other forms of public transit and low-cost transportation. The US has by and large opted not to invest in heavy rail - that&#x27;s not a local issue, that&#x27;s a federal one.<p>It&#x27;s not like California is leading the way on trains anymore.<p>&gt; Miami is a mess of planning and corruption with none of the modern industries like tech that create quality employment for the middle class with reasonable wages, quality healthcare, and partial ownership of their employers.<p>Sharing a flat with two roommates isn&#x27;t quality middle class living, either.<p>&gt; In fact the governor has banned the use of the term “climate change” to help avoid the issue.<p>Florida is a purple state. You can point fingers, but the state is at the precipice. The election was incredibly close. You shouldn&#x27;t diss those living there - they have an outsized impact on the direction of this country. Their electorate matters more than California&#x27;s, and we should hope more liberal voters move to Florida and similar states.')
