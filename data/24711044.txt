Sites aren&#x27;t apps; sites that do little don&#x27;t &quot;install&quot; into the browser with an intentionally-limited set of permissions, such that an attacker would then be limited in their attack by those permissions. An MITM can replace the site with basically whatever they like.<p>I can&#x27;t find the example (it was linked on HN a few years back), but a clear demonstration of this is a case where the MITM can serve a phishing page that <i>initially</i> appears to be the original site you&#x27;ve hijacked (so the user trusts it, and leaves it alone); but later, <i>while the page is not visible</i> (for example, when the user switches away from that tab), the page will switch over to showing a Facebook login screen or something.<p>Since the website isn&#x27;t a known &quot;malicious site&quot; (so no alert from the browser), the user probably won&#x27;t bother to look at the URL bar. They&#x27;ll just think they left Facebook open in a tab, and it logged them out for inactivity. So they&#x27;ll &quot;log back in.&quot;')
