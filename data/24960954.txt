C&#x27;s objective was to standardize a set of practices based on what the hardware of the day was capable of.  If they had pessimized performance on one architecture because it failed to provide efficient checked overflow (or any other feature), then C would have never made it to standardization.<p>ISO C is therefore a three-way compromise between three communities: Software authors, compiler authors, and CPU manufacturers.  You will naturally end up with some decisions that dissatisfy some members of each.')
