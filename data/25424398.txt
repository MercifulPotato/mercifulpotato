Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=[25425730], score=None, time=1607986009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25420711, text='&gt; You could have learnt a musical instrument or developed some other accomplishment that lasts a lifetime.<p>These &quot;classical&quot; hobbies are vastly over-valued in my opinion.  I spent almost a decade learning to play violin, and while the appreciation for music has been valuable, the actual skill of being able to play the violin has been largely useless.  I also quit when I was no longer forced to play for school, and probably can&#x27;t even read the sheet music anymore.  It&#x27;s by no means a life long skill like riding a bike.<p>Phrased another way, I don&#x27;t see much that validates being able to play a musical instrument as more valuable than being good at a particular genre of video games.  Music has existed for far longer, so it has a certain level of prestige as a long-standing part of our culture.  Music can be shared with others, although Twitch seems to imply there are a substantial number of people interested in watching other people play video games.<p>There are various studies about the tangential benefits of music, there are likewise for video games.  I don&#x27;t know that one comes out clearly ahead.<p>Video games are more likely to give you real world skills.  As more and more of the world moves online, skills that you pick up trying to get games to work or trying to make them run faster can be valuable.  Online etiquette is another thing you tend to learn (hopefully, instead of just being toxic).<p>Learning an instrument is also not without pain.  When I played, probably 75% of the time I was playing I wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything enjoyable, I was working on committing a piece to memory, or practicing a piece, or doing exercises to work on my finger strength or flexibility.  I don&#x27;t feel like learning an instrument is less &quot;grindy&quot;.')
