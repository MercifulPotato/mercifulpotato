Although the social data may comprise information from the lifetime of the deceased relative, the social data may not comprise information related to a time period after the lifetime of the deceased relative. As a result, a set of data acquisition rules may be generated for (or assigned to) the personalized personality index. The set of data acquisition rules may provide instructions for acquiring data related to various time periods of the deceased relative&#x27;s lifetime (e.g., before, during and&#x2F;or after the lifetime). Such instruction may include asking a user questions about a time period, one or more events and&#x2F;or people, or asking a user where such information may be obtained. In such an example, such questions may indicate the specific person represented by the personalized personality index (e.g., the deceased relative) possesses a perceived awareness that he&#x2F;she is, in fact, deceased.')
