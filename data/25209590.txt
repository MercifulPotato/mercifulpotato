It’s now cheaper to get an MRI with radiology report than a primary care office visit. Lab tests for most common ailments are less than gas to get to the hospital (GSA schedule pricing). Doctors don’t have any more information than the diagnostics tell them. Office visits are a functionally useless exercise. Innovations in private elective procedures have dramatically reduced costs and increased safety compared to procedures controlled by hospitals and paid by insurance. The government pays for drug development and then the FDA grants monopolies charging several orders of magnitude markups and giving kickbacks for prescriptions. Although there is little technological need for most doctors, the administrative demand is greater than any other industry, but don’t expect many H1Bs granted for physicians. Limiting access to the profession through high standards is actually great for innovation, if innovation is allowed, but protecting obsolete functions is probably bad for everybody.<p>I’d like to do some angel funding of new concepts in private consumer healthcare that go around the system. Medical hacker stuff. For instance, you can buy an imaging ultrasound system from China for roughly the cost of a single ultrasound appointment. I think micro-MRI is achievable under $10k, mostly a problem of data analysis. X-rays of course could be very cheap if people could be trusted not to abuse them. DIY blood and urine testing could be nearly free. I don’t want to sound like Elizabeth Holmes here; I’m mostly talking about known existing simple procedures with huge unnecessary overheads, replaced by DIY, community, or AI business models that are aligned with users.')
