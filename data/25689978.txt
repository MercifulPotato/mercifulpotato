My GMail spam folder used to be in the tens of thousands from the last 30 days. Now it&#x27;s in the low hundreds. (Low enough to locate the occasional false positive.)<p>I can&#x27;t tell if Google is just not telling me about the vast ocean that the filter considers obvious, or if it&#x27;s just gotten so effective that the spammers gave up. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s working. I dunno if other email providers are similarly effective, but the tech exists if they want it.<p>Now, there&#x27;s still web forms, which don&#x27;t have the vast spraying power of SMTP, and also don&#x27;t have the same kind of access to data to drive email spam filters. They usually try to de-automate the process with CAPTCHAs, which are also kind of a proof-of-work system (a &quot;work&quot; that&#x27;s supposed to be cheap for humans and expensive for computers).<p>Maybe you could install a proof-of-work based system there? Not being email, it sidesteps some of the issues on the form reply that SI_Rob reposted.')
