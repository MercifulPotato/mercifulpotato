There is almost nothing worse than being behind a smoker on the sidewalk.<p>I really, really could not care less about what people smoking do to themselves, but that horrible smoke carries so far and is so overpowering that it&#x27;s hard to think about anything else when you&#x27;re forcefully exposed to it.<p>A smoker is dominating a massive area around them and preventing other members of the public from enjoying that space. In a city space is at a premium.<p>Being an addict skews their ideas on what is socially acceptable, but the worst part is that the smokers themselves have no idea how bad it smells because they have completely ruined their sense of smell, so they are also at a heavily reduced capacity to judge how their actions are affecting others.<p>We have rules around a lot of antisocial behaviors, why should smoking be exempt?')
