The one who is paying shares a file with the one who doesn&#x27;t pay. Dropbox provides a worse experience for the person who doesn&#x27;t pay.<p>This is in contrast to services like Zoom or Google Drive where part of the sales pitch is that you get a seamless experience when communicating with people - even if the person you&#x27;re talking to might not be paying, you can guarantee because you are paying their experience won&#x27;t be impaired, at least for the duration of your interaction.')
