But I&#x27;d be extremely suprised if that were still the case or if it were even within the same order of magnitude as the fastest regexp engines.<p>Also, despite the fact that scenarios that can leverage &quot;jit-for-free&quot; are both a best case scenario for lisps and not that rare in different fields (from firewall rules to stencil computations) to the best of my knowledge, even in this niche lisp plays absolutely no role in practice. To be clear, I don&#x27;t think this due to any inherent shortcoming of lisp itself, indeed I suspect it&#x27;s mostly due to brain-drain.')
