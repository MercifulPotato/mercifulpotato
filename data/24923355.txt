Titan meant a different thing with every new iteration. Some were explicitly &quot;non-gaming card that you can play games on&quot; other were &quot;got tier gaming card&quot;.<p>RTX Titan for example was not as good in FP64 calculation compared to RTX Quadro. While first Titan was good at both. Nvidia kept changing what Titan means in order to extract most amount of money without hurting Quadro sales.<p>Even at its peak certain things were software limited for Titan, but not for Quadro. Nvidia has tons of artificial limitations for each of their graphics card once you go beyond gaming.')
