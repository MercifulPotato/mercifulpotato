But hydrogen can be used instead. It is a lot more complicated than one would think because not only is carbon very efficient at picking up oxygen, it is also an exothermic process which makes it very practical. This energy have to be added some other way when using direct reduction.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_reduced_iron" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_reduced_iron</a>')
