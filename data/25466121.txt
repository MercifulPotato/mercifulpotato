I&#x27;m curious to understand what you are basing your claims&#x2F;arguments on - would you be willing to share any sources that have shaped your perspective on these issues? My own arguments are based on socialist organizers who are on the ground and organizing in the US, as well as the paper this thread is discussing.<p>&gt; How is it that the economics works out so differently in, say, Eastern Europe where poor people&#x27;s best choice is to buy staples in bulk and cook and can&#x27;t afford packaged convenience food and eating out?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s because American people&#x27;s time is priced much higher and they earn much more overall.<p>I&#x27;m curious, have you been able to read the BMJ paper&#x2F;article? This is absolutely not meant in a derogatory way. I am genuinely curious to understand where you are coming from or what your statement is based on.<p>From my understanding the paper argues that people&#x27;s perceptions of which foods are nutritional has been distorted and negatively manipulated by corporations. In other words, people have come to believe low-nutritional food (or even non-nutritional food) is somehow nutritional, when in fact it actively contributes to ill-health and chronic disease&#x2F;conditions.<p>From the first paragraph of this paper:<p><i>&quot;In 2015 the New York Times revealed that Coca Cola was covertly funding the Global Energy Balance Network based at the University of Colorado, a research network set up to promote the message that all calories are equal.1 The network’s aim was to show that sugar sweetened beverages are no more responsible for the rise in obesity levels than any other foods or a lack of physical activity.2 In doing so, Coca Cola was copying and adapting the corporate political activities and scientific strategies that have been pioneered and perfected by tobacco, alcohol, and drug companies to defend and promote their products.34<p>Corporate food and beverage companies such as Coca Cola have engaged in what I will refer to as “corporate scientific activities.” These activities are designed to produce and influence the scientific knowledge used to evaluate, promote, legitimise, and regulate their products. Such activities include funding and conducting in-house nutrition research related to their products; sponsoring scientific seminars and expert meetings; involvement in scientific standards and policy committees; publishing in scholarly journals; funding scientific front groups; and delivering nutrition education programmes.2&quot;</i> [1]<p>[1] same as the link at the top of the page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;371&#x2F;bmj.m4601" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;371&#x2F;bmj.m4601</a>')
