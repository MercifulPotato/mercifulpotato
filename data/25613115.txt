Of course I love good textbooks too. And review journals like signal processing magazine are my favorites. I&#x27;m sure many people do them for great reasons too. Let&#x27;s not forget that academics teach too, and there are academics and colleges that are entirely devoted to teaching, not research. People are free to prefer them more if they like. However, when it comes to research metrics, the person who did the research deserves the credit for it. Even if we subtract the citations for obvious review papers (which is commonly done) there is still the lost citations by the original researchers.<p>Reviews also cause other devious problems, like journals hacking their own impact factors. And don&#x27;t forget the Matthew principle (aka rich get richer) whereby only big-shot researchers can get invited to have their reviews published in high-impact journals, warping the network effects to their favor even more.')
