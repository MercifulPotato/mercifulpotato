The book <i>Super Pumped</i>, for example, shows clearly that Uber was seeking a monopoly. They only got a duopoly in which they&#x27;re the dominant player, but from a pricing perspective that&#x27;s nearly as good.<p>It follows from VC efforts that market dominance produces massive profits. That money comes from somewhere. Anti-trust enforcement is way too weak in the US. Congress&#x27;s motives in going after the tech companies is decidedly mixed, but given decades of laxity, I&#x27;ll take it as a good start.')
