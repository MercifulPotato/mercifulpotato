If they are all precisely alike, then they&#x27;ll miss perspectives and be blindsided. But if they are totally different, then they will struggle to communicate their assumptions, and also won&#x27;t perform well.<p>So I&#x27;d expect honest research to show a U-shaped loss curve. Or more realistically, to have gathered cautionary tales of companies that fell apart for both of these reasons.')
