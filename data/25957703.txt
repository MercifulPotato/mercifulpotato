Everyone constantly harps on these classes of people in order to play to your emotions instead of thinking logically. The great thing about America is we allow you to make &quot;stupid&quot; choices. No one should care if you lose all your money by acting stupidly, doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re Harvard or a heroin addict. If you rely on a pension or university endowment for funding you should take up a greater interest in where that money is being invested.')
