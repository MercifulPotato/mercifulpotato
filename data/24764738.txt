There&#x27;s no need for that shit.<p>&gt;  They are simply applying the same standard to both sexes.<p>No they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re just taking sides because they share characteristics with what they perceive to be the slighted party here. Its likely they&#x27;re projecting anger they have about gender issues elsewhere to the discussion of this article. They&#x27;re being off-topic by doing so.<p>I&#x27;d wager that they didn&#x27;t even read the article.')
