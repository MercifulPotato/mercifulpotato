Would this be a union for all search engines, or just Google&#x27;s?<p>Why is it needed?<p>What enforcement would there be, if the search engine were not performing to the union&#x27;s expectations and needs?<p>Good old fashioned competition has usually been the way people deal with a service or product they didn&#x27;t find satisfactory.
