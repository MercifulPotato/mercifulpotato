This entire article is really dismissive, but this line especially struck me. I&#x27;m not convinced the M1 chip is some strange alien tech bypassing the laws of physics, but it seems clearly superior at its specific niche (single processes with an emphasis on low power usage, using fewer cores but massive L1I and L1D caches with a shared L2 cache).<p>Architecturally it looks like they&#x27;re sacrificing expandability and raw multiprocessing power (like massively parallel database server multiprocessing) for a single minded focus on laptop chips. Why would it be surprising it&#x27;d excel in that domain?<p>The author also makes the confusing suggestion that M1 is a ploy to get developers to publish to the App Store because ... Xcode produces fat mach-o&#x27;s? Maybe I&#x27;m an idiot here, but all those third party apps are also made with xcode. Where is the correlation with the app store? Sure, apple has been pushing the app store, but how does &quot;apple silicon&quot; specifically push devs there?<p>If there&#x27;s anything apple has done to discourage 3rd party distribution, it&#x27;s through Gatekeeper and strictly requiring notorized executables. If they wanted to make non app store distribution even less appealing, they could only allow notorization through the app store, or change the default to &quot;only app store&quot; ... Oh wait, they did that. On Intel.<p>Apple has always had complete platform control. They&#x27;ve done a lot of crappy things -- but this article tries to dismiss the M1 for pretty absurd reasons IMO.')
