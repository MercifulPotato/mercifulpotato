I don’t know how this is typically solved.<p>I think better than either for security and usability is passwordless WebAuthn with a local factor (e.g. Touch ID for Apple devices, or even a master password for a simple improvement over existing password-unlockable saved passwords), if implementing something outside the status quo.<p>(edit: starbugs’s point about latency is also very important.)')
