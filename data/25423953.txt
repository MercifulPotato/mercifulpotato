It puts the power to choose what to consume back in the hands of the recipient.<p>Sure, it’s not a real-time discussion platform but, IMO, most things at work don’t need this anyway. For the times this is useful (incident response, etc) small messenger groups work well.<p>YMMV, opinions mine, contents may settle in transit, etc')
