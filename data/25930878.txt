The landlord will take all available money until the retailer has bare minimum margins, 2-5% typically. Retailers will trade away wages for rent because landlords are very powerful and retail labor is not at all powerful. Therefore the minimum wage is simply a way for the government to set a rule saying you can only trade down to this amount. To treat the staffing budget as a fixed thing isn&#x27;t a proper model. You have to understand it as being in tension with other budgets.')
