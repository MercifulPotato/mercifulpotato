It would make perfect sense for the mythical Robin Hood to, in fact, <i>be</i> a toll-road operator&#x2F;customs officer â€” or at least to be in cahoots with them.<p>(In fact, come to think of it, he wouldn&#x27;t even need to <i>steal</i> from the rich, per se. He could just <i>destroy</i> trade caravans, and collect a cut of the revenue from the toll-booth operators; or <i>destroy</i> goods already imported but not yet sold, and collect a cut from the customs office; and then distribute said cut to the poor. The same virtuous(?) cycle would occur.)')
