Bear in mind that Australia&#x2F;New Zealand have a ~250ms round trip latency to most web services, 4G can easily have a 300ms latency to Google, and developing countries are often in a much worse position. Depending on &lt;100ms for anything is a non-starter for most of the web.<p>If you&#x27;re a service provider several layers removed from a human, then there may be enough between you and the user that it&#x27;s critical that you respond in &lt;100ms, but this is not most of the industry.<p>More generally, I find this sort of comment to be similar to the sort of comment that asks why anyone would write a web service in a language as slow as Ruby or Python when we have languages like Go and Rust. They ignore the fact that there are huge, successful companies running on Ruby, Python, and other &quot;slow&quot; languages, all for very good reasons.')
