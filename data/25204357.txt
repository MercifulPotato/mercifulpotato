The company I worked for had some sort of enterprise encryption on the laptop on the hard drives. A friend had some reason to decrypt his to resolve an issue. Progress was very slow on a large progress bar and hard to determine actual progress as the estimated time was over 8 hours so he put a post it to mark the progress and would check intermittently. I spent the day moving the post it and he was convinced it was progressing, pretty sure it never finished. I guess the lesson is maybe progress bars should state a percentage as well.')
