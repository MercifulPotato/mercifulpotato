Item(by='higerordermap', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606201840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182416, text='&gt; What makes India so unique<p>The sheer population in competition I guess, gaming the system is almost always the way to win. This is true everywhere but more pronounced in India, because we have very large number of people very eager to game the process. Maybe it&#x27;s a culture thing, or just the effect of competition and FOMO, idk. (The coaching mania so fierce in North is less aggressive in South)<p>When I was studying K-12 or PUC or whatever it&#x27;s called, Byju&#x27;s (the company that acquired WJR) was doing most aggressive promotions. There were a few similar education startups putting genuine effort but way less aggressive promotion. I liked the content of one of those startups called Toppr. I never went to purchase anything, tbh (I was a rural student), but the quality doesn&#x27;t necessarily win.<p>The entire coaching ecosystem is also like this. They teach lot of formulae and shortcuts. These years success in IIT-JEE is a combination of super hard work and having access to highly expensive coaching material. (Tbh, as a rural student, I dropped the dreams of getting into one of these &quot;good&quot; institutes halfway because of this).<p>Whitehat JR is just misusing FOMO of urban Indian parents. I don&#x27;t think pushing programming on children of 7-8 years is worth it. Instead it needs to be properly taught at high-school level.')
