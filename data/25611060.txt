Programming itself is a layer of abstraction. Why did we invent this bespoke complicated and arbitrary syntax that can be explained succinctly with a comment in your native language, rather than just develop the computer to interpret commands in common native language syntax directly? I shouldn&#x27;t have to remember that ls is list directory contents. I should be able to type all sorts of permutations of &#x27;show me what stuff is here&#x27; in my language and not some bullshit syntax that someone came up with on a whim 50 years ago, if the computer was truly developed to be a tool for everyone.<p>I&#x27;m not confident it&#x27;s going to change for the better and democratize what computers can truly do, simulate and model. People who&#x27;ve already paid the cost of memorizing all the ins and outs of complicated computer syntax don&#x27;t really care how much of a hill they&#x27;ve had to climb anymore now that they&#x27;ve learned enough to be familiar. Now you have this memorization lock in, where you&#x27;ve spent years and perhaps thousands with university learning some dense programming language and start building your tooling around what you&#x27;ve learned, and in the process you force the next generation to have to learn that syntax if you are to hire them, and so on and so forth. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve been typing ls since the 80s and we will still be typing ls in 50 years. I&#x27;m sure the authors of ls would find that horrifying.')
