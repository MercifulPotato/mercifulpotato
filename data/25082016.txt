Not huge contracts, but say mid six-figures on average. We sit down with our clients but the key word here is &quot;bespoke&quot;, which warrants these meetings and communications and calls. We build these solutions from scratch to solve their problems with their workflows. Anything that&#x27;s not bespoke or where we don&#x27;t have to discuss regulatory matters or where that conversation is not required by law is a roadblock for my purchase.<p>One reason we&#x27;re making our platform is to reduce that necessity and be able to deliver that value to companies without ever speaking to us. Heck that &quot;speaking&quot; is also included in the cost of the product, and all those &quot;engineer.days&quot; add up pretty quickly, making our client list exclusively composed of behemoths who sometimes happen to have internal ML teams but just need more help, or because we happen to have expertise on a problem and they&#x27;re inexperienced despite their size. One of our biggest frustrations is that we could not serve smaller organizations, and I&#x27;m not even talking mom &amp; pop&#x27;s or SMBs, but even some organizations that seem large shy away from this kind of projects even though they want to leverage data.<p>I find that these companies and products are targeting decision makers who do not consult with their teams and buy products nobody will use. They&#x27;re targeting dysfunctional organizations which, I&#x27;ll grant you that, may be a large enough segment to build a business around. Not my ideal to wake up and earn a living, though, but that&#x27;s another matter.')
