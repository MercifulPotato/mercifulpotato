Not huge contracts, but say mid six-figures on average. We sit down with our clients but the key word here is &quot;bespoke&quot;, which warrants these meetings and communications and calls. Anything that&#x27;s not bespoke or where we don&#x27;t have to discuss regulatory matters or where that conversation is not required by law is a roadblock for my purchase.')
