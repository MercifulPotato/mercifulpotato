To be fair, being silent does not mean supporting rioting. I guess that the Portland government letting &quot;protesters&quot; destruct federal court building for 5 months is not condoning either. But hey, it is the righteous people who told us &quot;silence is violence, not me.<p>&gt; because the police in your community are perfect doesn&#x27;t mean real problems don&#x27;t exist elsewhere.<p>Of course not. But following the same logic, we should &quot;abolish&quot; or &quot;dismantle&quot; police for a few bad apples?')
