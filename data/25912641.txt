Even Linux is very big and complicated. I&#x27;m also looking for simplicity at the hardware level. A Raspberry Pi is cheap, but I would hardly call modern ARMv7 Cortex chips simple.<p>Are there any computers on the market that try to replicate the simplicity of earlier home computers? Perhaps there&#x27;s an SBC that would meet my hardware requirements, and there&#x27;s a separate, simple OS I could flash?')
