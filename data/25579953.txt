This post made me curious for exactly the reasons you brought up. I wasn&#x27;t sure why being banned from one domain meant giving up on mastodon all together, and I came in expecting some post about the problems with Mastodon as a project itself, because presumably they would have known that you could just easily make an account on a different instance. But nope, they just didn&#x27;t even know the ABCs of Mastodon.')
