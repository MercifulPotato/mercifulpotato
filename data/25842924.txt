At that point, the whole computer industry was an ecosystem controlled by a couple of mainframe manufacturers, and populated by a few thousand COBOL and FORTRAN programmers.  The Apple ][ and CP&#x2F;M computers existed, but not at a disruptive scale.<p>Personal computers took off when the IBM PC provided a platform where 3rd party application developers could flourish, technically and commercially.  The same thing happened again a quarter century later with the iPhone and Android ecosystems.<p>What will be the enabler for EV&#x27;s to grow a huge ecosystem?<p>A monolithic Tesla?  An Android or an IOS for Automobiles?')
