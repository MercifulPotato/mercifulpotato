This is why the fundamental issue is policy, not science - the science can only help you understand a situation better, it can&#x27;t answer &quot;what is the right amount of risk to take&quot;.<p>The precautionary approach you suggest isn&#x27;t a new idea, but it has very real negative economic effect at minimum, and a complex relationship with other issues.  Collectively, somehow (e.g. legislative bodies) we have to attempt the impossible task of finding the &quot;right&quot; position on the scale between don&#x27;t-trust-anything-new to anything goes.   Clearly both these extremes are problematic, but balancing them is really hard.')
