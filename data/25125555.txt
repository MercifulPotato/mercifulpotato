Not only because the margins the companies are taking, but the guilt with how much to tip the driver (is the company providing them salary of some sort?).<p>However there is no other easy way to buy food without doing significant amount of research and then most of these companies are reliant on the online ordering for inbound sales anyways.  It&#x27;s a total cluster.<p>Probably a downvote here but I don&#x27;t feel good making investment money on an extractive business like this - i.e. I&#x27;m not going to buy stock.  Even though these services are lifelines during the pandemic, I wonder if they are a faustian bargain of sorts in the long-run understanding full well that in the short-run the alternative is to shutdown.<p>The sad future: I think the executives and staff will make off and the retail investors will be holding the bag as well as the shutdown restaurants and employees laid off.<p>The happy future: Some&#x2F;most restaurants survive pandemic and ease off their online habits, stock stabilizes&#x2F;investors take a hit and people go back into restaurants.
