The reasons that the language might be offensive depends on the social makeup and norms of the group you&#x27;re referring to.  Sometimes those norms are driven by religion, sometimes they are driven by other factors, and sometimes it is a combination of reasons.<p>For example, you can find instances of social groups that:<p>1. are not religious, but recognize the concept of profanity.<p>2. do not recognize some slurs as profane.<p>3. are religious, but do not recognize the same profanity as other social groups that belong to the same religion.')
