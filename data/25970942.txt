They&#x27;ve probably gotten hundreds of millions of dollars in free advertising without spending a penny, which is going to result in a feedback loop that is only positive for the business.  As they say, ANY news is good news, and this certainly rings true here.<p>Now would certainly be the time to accelerate their plans to move more to eccommerce from brick and mortar, and re-adjust what the stores are selling from video games themselves to hardware (read: consoles, accessories, PC gamer parts et al)<p>They could sell additional shares into the market to raise money to fund projects and pay off debt, but this is a double-edged sword.  The SEC might not look favorably on them doing this (read what Hertz did during the reddit craze there during bankruptcy) since it <i>could</i> be construed that they were taking advantage of the whole situation.  Also, releasing new shares into the market could unwind the squeeze scenario trade by providing more liquidity to the shorts to cover at lower prices and dilute the amount of existing shares driving the price down.<p>Because of this they&#x27;ve probably been dead silent realizing that anything they say is going to drastically move markets.<p>Gamestop is in an interesting situation here from a management perspective - I&#x27;d love to be a fly on the wall in their board room right now.  This will be an MBA case study for many many years.')
