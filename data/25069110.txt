Make your changes locally and either sync behind the scenes automatically or when you push &#x27;commit&#x27;. Many applications (like notion and a bunch of the other browser based applications) go the cheap SaaS route. One central database behind a web service and every frontend only displays an instantaneous view of some part of the data. That&#x27;s not collaboration - you want to be able to work offline (at high speed) and then sync when you are ready. Multiple people should be able to work on the same artifact at the same time (and deal with conflicts at the point of the commit). While the sync works well for google docs, I think the experience of working on a single shared resource is bad.
