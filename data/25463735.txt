Paying for government assistance for people employed full time by a company.<p>I think you mean &quot;taxpayer&quot;<p>&gt; In other words, Amazon is costing you, the taxpayer, money by not paying their workers a living wage.<p>Imagine how much assistance they would need <i>if they didn&#x27;t have jobs.</i><p>&gt; living wage.<p>what constitutes a &quot;living wage&quot; is dependent on <i>the cost of consumer goods</i> which is in turn dependent on <i>the cost of labor</i>. You&#x27;re not going to escape the fact that some people&#x27;s labor isn&#x27;t worth enough to earn them the standard of living that you or they would prefer by wishful thinking or statutory fiat. You can, however, limit their options and distort the market in a vicious circle of economically ignorant mandates.')
