After all, Erlang developers already have the most important part of Elixir, which is the Erlang runtime!<p>There are also key people in both communities working hard to make sure the tooling is consistent across all languages. A lot of this effort happens under the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;erlef.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;erlef.org&#x2F;</a>) too.<p>All to say, regardless if you pick Erlang or Elixir (or Gleam, LFE, etc.), I hope you will fall in love with the platform as much as I did 10 years ago!')
