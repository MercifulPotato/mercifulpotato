I think it needs to be broken down by the various products.<p>Both companies have done things to protect consumer data, but they have also done things to abuse it imho.<p>In regards to O - I think my suggestion currently would be to find alternatives such as Chromium, plugins like adblockers and noscript, and hardware like pihole or whatever.<p>Both MSfot and Google are collecting data, regardless if they say that they are using currently using it in nefarious ways today or not, they may intend to use it in different ways in the future, or could be compelled to release it one way or another in the future. imho.')
