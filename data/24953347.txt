I think he talks about a specific type of girls (and possibly guys too but i have not met any in private) who can be very insisting and pushing you contantly to the limit and never leaving you alone in private even if you clearly say &quot;please leave me alone now im done&quot;... so you feel your only last options is to walk away or actually engage in violence. These people sometimes even resort to violence even before you would..<p>The only gender specific and slightly sexist part of that video is assuming only girls could behave like that (you know the whole &quot;its the periods&quot;) but i personally think its not the case its just a type of person.')
