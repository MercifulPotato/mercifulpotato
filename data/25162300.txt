The reviews have dwindled down to single digits per day in all decks where I do not add new material.<p>(I don&#x27;t use the desktop Anki, by the way; I used it briefly for doing some editing on decks.)<p>Tha said, AnkiDroid could use a vacation feature. How vacation mode could work would be simply by rescheduling all cards, delaying them by the vacation amount (14 days or whatever). Thus, no cards are due for the next 14 days, and on day 15, the same cards are due that would have been due day 1 (no &quot;snowplow&quot; accumulation). It would probably help if the app generated a notification a day before vacation ends.<p>It&#x27;s incredible that neither the author of the original Anki, nor the authors of the AnkiDroid clone, recognize the value of a vacation.')
