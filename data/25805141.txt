Congratulations.<p>More seriously, maybe invent imaginary third parties rather than arbitrarily assigning your imagined bad motives and awful consequences to real people who did none of what you&#x27;ve suggested?<p>Google could, if they wanted, just add a new category to Safe Browsing. They could call it &quot;Arbitrary censorship&quot; or &quot;Nazis are bad&quot; or whatever you want. There are already several categories which even use slightly different parameters for the core technology so this wouldn&#x27;t substantially change the system and yet would add much more flexibility if you wanted (as you might well) to protect against Phishing whether from Nazis or not, while still visiting a popular web site organising the overthrow of American democracy.')
