What&#x27;s being hidden from you are other options where the same or similar outcomes can happen which might have even more benefits you would like.<p>Right now you seem to have what you consider a benevolent dictator.  What happens when the dictates are not as benevolent?<p>You desires matter less to Apple than they do to organizations that actually have to worry about users users leaving more.  That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s so much you give up if you leave.   How long until this is abused?  Also, what of those that are <i>already</i> abused because of Apple&#x27;s power?
