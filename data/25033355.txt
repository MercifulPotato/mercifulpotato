Then they appear on Joe Rogan, Rich Roll, Tim Ferriss and every other podcast they can manage, and talk at length about &#x27;paradigm-shifts&#x27; and other nonsense. On their website, they beg you to subscribe to their newsletter. They might start their _own_ shitty podcast. Through it all, very little in the way of insight is provided, and the little that exists is padded to within an inch of its life in the name of weekly &#x27;content&#x27;.<p>Ryan Holiday, Seth Godin, Mark Manson, Tim Ferriss himself are other perpetrators of this stuff and I fucking hate all of it. The internet is shittier because of this trend, and has caused me to largely forego reading things on it.<p>To the OP, if you want a good book on attention, Nicholas Carr&#x27;s &#x27;The Shallows&#x27; is my recommendation. It is written with clarity and vision. He gets to the heart of the matter by focussing on two things: neuroplasticity and &#x27;how the medium is the message&#x27;. His argument is presented logically, cogently and convincingly.')
