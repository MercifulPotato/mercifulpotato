It goes a bit like this: People always think that nature is so efficient. But nature doesn&#x27;t optimize. Nature is lazy and does as little work as possible. You&#x27;ll never see a lion hunt down a zebra and then go like &quot;Okay, that took me 30 minutes, so I could do 10 more zebras today before dusk&quot;. He&#x27;ll eat part of the zebra, leave the rest for the hyenas, and then spend the rest of the day basking in the sun.')
