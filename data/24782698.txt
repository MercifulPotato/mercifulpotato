I have not had to change a tire in over a decade, but my unused spare tire in my car&#x27;s trunk is actually being used every time I drive, by being available.<p>What about nearly any accessibility feature? What about fire extinguishers? I know that support for the FTP protocol is not nearly as severe, but it is on the same spectrum. For the minority of users that use it the minority of the time, it is good to have it available.<p>As long as it does not impose significant costs to keep ftp support, they should keep it.<p>And as it happens, I have had to use FTP several times recently, because there are still active FTP links in some manuscripts and scholarly articles I&#x27;ve read.')
