At least, one would hope that a deputy of the government is bound by the same rules which constrain the government itself, or else it&#x27;s trivial for the government to circumvent any of its constraints (e.g., if the majority party wants the IRS to penalize the minority party, simply deputize some organization affiliated with the majority party, require that businesses obtain the cooperation of that deputy org, and then have that deputy organization blackball businesses affiliated with minority party members).')
