ASCII uses \\b as the combining character mark which is a convention that&#x27;s always been widely supported by typesetting programs such as less and nroff. For example, A\\b_ is AÌ², and you can do the same thing with apostrophe and tilde for accent marks. There&#x27;s also UNICODE emojis where two codepoints in sequence get joined together as a single glyph. Never underestimate the creative ways text can be used, or that standards just codify a long history of practices.')
