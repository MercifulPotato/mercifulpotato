I also experienced that bug, though I don&#x27;t think it affected Firefox for me.<p>It resolved itself for me recently in all apps except Slack. I have no idea why. I&#x27;m fairly sure I didn&#x27;t update anything.<p>While it was still reproducing, I tested a purported fix in the upcoming Chromium 87 (or 88?) and it was resolved. So just wait a bit or try Canary. More specific info in the bug thread of course.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=1113040" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.chromium.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=111304...</a>')
