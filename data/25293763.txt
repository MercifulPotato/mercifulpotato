Unlike some of the others that replied to you, I don&#x27;t mind the social aspect but only in an apathy and indifference. Until someone&#x27;s phone comes out and affects my field of view, but I&#x27;ve mostly seen good etiquette there in recent years (last 5).<p>I prefer spontaneously going to a theatre by myself with no planning, getting a good seat (or lately they&#x27;ve been reserved seats, in the same apps I used to check the movie times), on time, and enjoying the experience uninterrupted. For me, it is a privilege because in suburbs and rural America such spontaneity is not an option, whereas living in a prime area of a city allows for 3-5 or more movie theatres to choose from, multiple simultaneous showing at each one, different sound system and seating and viewing types, etc. A stroll at 11:30pm to a fun bar or club afterwards, or spontaneously leaving an evening social setting I no longer prefer to be in and decompressing in a theatre!<p>I don&#x27;t enjoy planning that with other people, and tolerating their movie going routine. But whether I put up with that or am with one or more people that aren&#x27;t late or picking bad seats, I don&#x27;t find it a social experience because we are watching the movie, not making jokes the whole time.<p>Yes, I do enjoy other people&#x27;s reactions and how that can add to the energy. But it isn&#x27;t that interesting for me to miss it.')
