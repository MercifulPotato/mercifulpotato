With seeming no productive use of the older technology aside of historical value.<p>Does that mean that the new PS5 should have a VHS drive to accommodate historians? No, you can still buy and own a second hand VHS drive.<p>I don&#x27;t see why it is viable for companies to spend their time innovating and designing new products only to have to think about keeping historic software designs alive. I understand there is of course a balance between compatibility with older software and the new. But you pick and choose your battles.')
