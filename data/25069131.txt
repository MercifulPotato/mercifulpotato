It&#x27;s.. been unpleasant. A few of my pain points.<p>- Observables. I&#x27;m actually okay with observables, but it seems like Angular has tried to ride on both horses when it comes to observables. E.g. the `HttpClient` returns an Observable, but you can&#x27;t get your input as Observables, so you have to do weird lifecycle workarounds to get observables re-computed as your input changes<p>- No fragments. Each component always creates it&#x27;s own HTML tag. This makes stuff like having components inside tables really difficult to get right.<p>- The reactive forms has been untyped for years. It feels weird to ship with a forms module that seems to work pretty well, heavily invest on typescript, and then the forms are simply \n`any` - I mean what the hell?<p>- The input&#x2F;output model is unfortunately much worse than it is in React. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it, but the moment you want to create a HOC, or you want to wrap a component in another component, you find out that you have to manually specify all the input&#x2F;output of the component you have to wrap.\nNesting components is so inconvenient that your components become much larger than you want them to.')
