A sleep study would be well worth it. It may sound like a headache to go sleep in a lab, but if it is sleep apnea the positive life changes of treating it are beyond worth it.<p>I used to wake with near panic attack just like that.... turns out I wasn’t breathing well. And you don’t have to be overweight to have sleep apnea. Since treating it, I sleep like a baby.<p>Maybe covid induces some type of central sleep apnea?')
