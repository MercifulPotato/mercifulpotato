These aren&#x27;t as direct and immediate as literally being able to immediately work more hours as a freelance contractor, but are no less invalid a means of improving my profits in the long run, even if it means more short term debt.<p>I&#x27;m certain I could drum up extra work or self improvement for myself that has a higher return on investment than $1&#x2F;hour now.  I very strongly suspect most people who earn $20&#x2F;hour or more can.  Borrow a mower!  Offer to clean other people&#x27;s houses for $2&#x2F;hour!  Then, after an hour of cleaning someone else&#x27;s house instead of your own, you&#x27;ll be out the same amount of work but have pocketed an extra $1 in the process!<p>A valid point is raised here:  Just because you&#x27;ve profited in extra free time, doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll convert said free time into additional $$$ at your job&#x27;s hourly rate.  You might earn less.  However, you might earn <i>more</i> over the long term, by investing in your future in a way that results in compounding profits.  A broke college student might reasonably still end up spending $1&#x2F;hour on a cleaner, so they can have more time to study!  Even if that means more debt, and even if their current unpaid internship pays them $0&#x2F;hour!')
