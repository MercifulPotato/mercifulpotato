I learned a lot and happy with it but have been having a really hard time finding a job. I am in the EU. Today I spoke to a recruiter who suggested a few changes in my CV. Lambda&#x27;s staff for helping graduates find jobs are not doing a good job. I&#x27;ve been trying to get endorsed and don&#x27;t know how many times I had to message different people about getting it sorted.<p>Overall, Lambda is great and worth doing but its not perfect. Everyone there means well but there needs to be better structure.')
