I have Nest cameras and smoke alarms. I don&#x27;t have Nest Security products, but this announcement is making me feel even more nervous about continued Google support than I did before (see below).<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m not understanding how these products are not useful anymore for you. They still perform the same functions as before no? It&#x27;s still supported per Google.</i><p>Speaking only about Nest&#x27;s cameras and smoke alarms, they actually don&#x27;t perform the same functions as before. They mostly don&#x27;t change (Google rarely seems to update anything), but the apps have gotten much, much bugger.<p>Ex: Home Away&#x2F;Assist (which tells Nest when you&#x27;re away from home using your smartphone GPS) just <i>does not work</i> with Pixel phones. It never has. I contacted Nest support, and they confirmed it and said that no one was working on fixing it.<p>This is typical of Google products. Features stagnate, bugs appear, and no one seems to be behind the steering wheel. It would be absolutely astonishing to me if anyone working on these products actually use them, because basic quality-of-life features are never implemented.<p>The worst thing that&#x27;s happened is that my Nest smoke alarms just stopped reporting their status. All of them. They now say their status is out of date by 100+ days and increasing, and I can&#x27;t fix it. They all say they&#x27;re in perfect working condition, but how can I know for sure?<p>&gt; <i>I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to expect anything else.</i><p>I expect Google to pay attention to my products by fixing bugs, improving software, and (at minimum) maintaining the level of function they advertise them to have.<p>Lots and lots of other companies do it. It&#x27;s absolutely reasonable to expect it. Google just doesn&#x27;t have it in their DNA.')
