Men who grow up being exposed to the idea of nipples as sexual have a subconscious response; men who have not, don&#x27;t, which is why some lineages of humanity don&#x27;t have the same taboo, like most pre-modern tribes. It&#x27;s the same reason that an ankle could be scandalous and arousing in 1750, but isn&#x27;t now (with some exceptions in modern subculture.)<p>Personally I&#x27;m in favor of modesty, and would prefer not to have sexuality flaunted everywhere like it is, but your answer isn&#x27;t quite accurate.')
