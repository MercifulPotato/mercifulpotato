I think that something important has been lost since those days.<p>My favorite anecdote of 25 years on those machines is what we put into the 64-bit word at address 0 on the Cray-2.  In ASCII, it read ~Z~E~R~O.  If you jumped to it, it worked as four no-op (&quot;PASS&quot;) instructions, and at word 1 was a jump to the library&#x27;s routine that dumped registers and said &quot;hey you jumped to a null function pointer&quot;.  If you ever saw ~Z~E~R~O in a dump, you knew that a load from null had taken place.<p>I still wish a modern ISA would implement real vectors; SIMD is still a distant second-best.')
