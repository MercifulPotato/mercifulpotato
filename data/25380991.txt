Neither AWS nor GCP, nor Azure have plans for any of their products.\nI understand that plans make sense for SaaS, platforms and user based products. But this is a DB where costs are mostly related to storage+cpu usage.<p>Second the plans have fancy names, but they are actually just $ based volume commitment.<p>So the $25 Plan gives you $25 worth of usage, the $150 gives you $150 worth of usage.. This is not a plan is a monthly commitment. AWS Saving Plans is far smarter on this case, after you have a monthly commitment you&#x27;ll receive a discount for your loyalty.<p>Third: \nSome features are only unlocked after a certain plan. I&#x27;m interested in `premium regions` but this is only unlocked at $500&#x2F;month. So in order to test this i need to commit to the `business plan`. With AWS, Azure, GCP you can pretty much use any feature at any scale, so you can test complex features with just a few users or even for just a few days, but you&#x27;ll only pay what you use.<p>Lastly:\nThe real, clear, pricing is already there! At the bottom of the page: <i>Billing unit rates</i>. This is a simple, clean table that I can easy reason about and evaluate costs my business plan.<p>P.S \nSorry the headline `Pay only for what you need`? sorry this BS marketing, as stated above I can&#x27;t use premium regions in the individual plan, so well technically incorrect.<p>Hope this helps.. Project looks really amazing..')
