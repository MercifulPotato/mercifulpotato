One kid I went to school with moved immediately after he had a knife pulled on him, but I don&#x27;t know any of the details so can&#x27;t say if it was race related.  Our own family moved about a year later.  If I had stayed in that house I probably would have went to high school with Prince, but if I checked the yearbook of the suburban school I graduated from I doubt I could find a single black face.  I never heard those stereotypical comments you speak of because there was nobody to speak them about.')
