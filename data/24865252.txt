I got caught up a bit in the story of the inspiration behind Markdown (email for Markdown, typewriters for Textile), what I&#x27;d assumed was competition between Textile and Markdown (when it turned out they were more connected that you&#x27;d think just by seeing two &quot;competing&quot; standards on the market), and how this standard of sorts in Markdown both came from all these inputs but then was flexible enough that everyone can write how they prefer and also that others can take the Markdown idea and run with it and make their own thing.<p>Pandoc would have absolutely been worth mentioning; that&#x27;s definitely more on the modern look at how Markdown itself got remixed and taken further, but definitely relevant.')
