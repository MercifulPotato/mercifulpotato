I don’t mean “ideologically, I am upset that the government can see I buy too many pastries”. When we look at cryptocurrency, it is used for a small collection of things:<p>- Speculation on a high volatility, unregulated market<p>- Money laundering<p>- Distribution of illegal material<p>These all seem like things Im fine with the government having visibility into. Perhaps this is ignorance on my part, but all legitimate uses I’ve ever heard of seem like rounding error next to the above. No one is buying pizza with bitcoin in 2020. The uptake for real transactions seems like it’s near zero.<p>About the best I can come up with is that financial privacy permits low level lawbreaking for laws generally regarded as stupid or unethical (e.g., marijuana). I think it’s safe to say that people who want to feed their drug habits will find other anonymous ways to to pay, e.g. barter or proxy goods.<p>The types of folks who are deeply affected by large governments having logs of their transactions are not the downtrodden masses. They’re the moderately wealthy engaged in corruption and trafficking. Cry me a river.')
