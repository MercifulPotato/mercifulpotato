The additional context doesn&#x27;t make any difference, it just provides two additional (different) calculations:<p>average remaining lifespan across the entire population:<p>&gt; we calculate that the 2020 American population of 330 million people has on average 45.8 y of remaining life expectancy, totaling 14.9 billion person years.<p>reduction in remaining lifespan in the 70-89 age group:<p>&gt; Older individuals ages 70 to 89 y, taking those who die and those who survive together, would on average lose about 0.2 y of remaining life, and younger individuals would lose far less.<p>I did not include these calculations because they are not comparable to the number to which I was responding.')
