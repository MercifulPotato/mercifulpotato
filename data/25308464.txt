Other than maybe(?) the comment was some attempt at a &quot;but they do it too&quot; sort of reply you find on Reddit.<p>Judging by your interpretation of James memo I&#x27;m leaning towards that direction. Especially considering the fact James made multiple direct claims in the memo he was not suggesting anything of the sort which you are alleging (I have a feeling few people actually read the memo).<p>Regardless the two stories were very very different. Nor does his story match my comment&#x27;s &#x27;archetype&#x27; of a certain type of employee who always end up flaming out of their job, usually via making non-conditional demands (unsurprisingly coming from a bubble&#x2F;worldview where it&#x27;s entirely normal to have things which are not open to discussion).')
