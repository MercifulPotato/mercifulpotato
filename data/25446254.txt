Cyberpunk 2077 can&#x27;t render (full blast) at 60 FPS on a 350W 3090, so to get 90FPS on both eyes you would need (if it was possible, it&#x27;s not) more than 3x 3090 at a whopping 1000W!<p>And this is at peak everything: memory speed and litography; with cheap- energy, hardware, (food, rent too) etc.<p>The final medium is not VR, it is regular 3D MMO action potentially with server-side neural-network brained mobs&#x2F;npcs! How is that progressing Mr Carmack?')
