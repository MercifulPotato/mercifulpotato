It should not ever be used for its ethanol purpose. There are better crops suited for that purpose but the infrastructure in the US is set up for.....corn. Humans don&#x27;t eat corn (or they eat a trivial percentage). 75% of the corn grown goes to feed animals (usually cattle) or cars (via ethanol).<p>Yea we need to grow less corn. But we can&#x27;t outlaw it. You just removed the livelihood for the Midwest. The current economic incentive structure is to grow corn (there literally is no downside). A solution that changes that has to include benefits for farmers, landowners, consumers, and society. It&#x27;s not going to be easy (or cheap).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinkingagriculture.io&#x2F;incentivizing-regenerative-agriculture&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinkingagriculture.io&#x2F;incentivizing-regenerative-ag...</a>')
