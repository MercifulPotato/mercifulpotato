I was in a location where flying the drone was 100% going to get me in trouble. So, I fired up the app, started the camera, and carried the drone above my head as I ran down the street. The gimbal was active and in the end, looked like a drone shot. Did the same thing shooting from the backseat of a convertible. People still ask how I got the footage.')
