Both are fine until the instructor needs to present a powerpoint. Zoom stops showing everyone&#x27;s video. Not sure if there is a difference between Zoom desktop app and Zoom chrome extension.<p>For Meet, it is nice that the instructor can present from a tablet but there is no way to hid the presentation video so it is way too small to see everyone signing.')
