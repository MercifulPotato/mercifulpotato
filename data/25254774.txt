I can see a ceiling somewhere at €100k before taxes. If you are single, you give half away for taxes, if you are not, then you have family expenses. Living like a student I could save €36k yearly. Now it’s only €15-18k. Considering moving to Switzerland, but it’s simply too expensive with family. And good sounding CHF 135k aren’t that impressive with local prices.')
