For example, we can use data science to automatically detect symptom exacerbation or improvement (from patient-reported outcomes or functional metrics such as activity levels) and get them in for treatments at the right time.<p>The problem with patient-reported outcomes or other metrics, is that you are relying on the patient. This trap already exists for the vast majority of people suffering from mental health issues in the United States: in order to conquer your issues you basically need to not have them in the first place. Navigating (maybe battling) insurance, out-of-pocket bills, finding doctors who will take you seriously, and so forth, is really taxing, and when you are already struggling it can be Too Much.<p>I saw, second-hand, some of the surveys that Stanford sent to their disabled patient, which I would suspect would be used in the same way. The surveys are tiring, exhausting, and frustrating. It&#x27;s frustrating to be asked the same questions over and over again while you tread water, and have to admit the same shitty answers, whether it&#x27;s pain or depression or any other miserable symptom.<p>I am curious what you are doing here that is wholly different from what most institutions are already doing.')
