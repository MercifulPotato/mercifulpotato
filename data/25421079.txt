We dressed in layers, we used heavy blankets on the bed and the couch, and used a small space heater in the room we were in.<p>It was ok, but kind of uncomfortable.<p>Then we had kids and that all went out the window.  Kids in many layers of clothing is hard for diaper changing, is a pain to clean when they spill, and once they start to walk, keeping them in one place is impossible.<p>So now we keep the thermostat at 70F(21C).  The energy usage is a lot higher of course, but at least it&#x27;s all green energy!')
