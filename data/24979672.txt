The point is that it doesn’t matter if you tax the company profits at 20% and capital gains at 20% (assume the normal income tax is 40%) or if you tax the company 0% and tax capital gains at 40%.<p>The government already tries to reduce double taxation. There is not supposed to be a penalty for incorporating vs. doing business as a sole proprietor or general partnership. That’s why the capital gains tax is lower than the income tax.<p>This is all about ease of administration and making creative accounting more difficult or impossible. If you’re looking at it through some moral lens, you don’t get it.')
