So, Citadel has an interest in not letting the price go up any further.</i><p>Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital. <i>Not</i> its position. Melvin doesn&#x27;t have a short position anymore.<p>Melvin made a stupid bet. Citadel bailed them out. Private sector bailouts aren&#x27;t free: Citadel got its pound of flesh. Even <i>if</i> they bought the entire portfolio, that portfolio no longer includes GameStop shorts.<p>If Citadel&#x27;s asset management and market making arms are colluding, that is illegal. But it&#x27;s the most complicated and stupid explanation of the bunch. Market makers stop quoting for all kinds of reasons. If I were still on my options market making desk, I&#x27;d be pulling the plug on this. My traders would yell at me. This is what you make money on in market making! But the risks of loss go up with volatility, and the costs of gamma getting away can be nasty.<p>The chances that a fund the size of Citadel has any strong opinion on the direction of GameStop stock is vanishingly low. The chances that they stopped quoting in the name, as did almost every other market maker, and thereby broke Robinhood&#x27;s system, which doesn&#x27;t--to my knowledge--directly interface with exchanges to any significant degree, is high.')
