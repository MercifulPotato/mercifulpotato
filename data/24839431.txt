People complained because it was buggy and didn’t follow standards so that, compounded with monopoly, meant that apps only worked in IE6.<p>Sounds like the current Firefox situation only because 1. Google deliberately ignores Firefox support and 2. Firefox does not support some standard APIs that even Safari supports.<p>The former is only Google’s bad politics while the latter is just Firefox playing catch up. Neither attributable to the monopoly.<p>Even if I don’t use Chrome, it’s currently the best browser by far from a user’s standpoint. This was not the case for IE6.')
