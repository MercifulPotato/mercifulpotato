Butowsky accused Folkenflik of pushing a &quot;false narrative&quot; of Butowsky&#x27;s involvement in a now-retracted Fox News story alleging that the murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was connected to the 2016 leak of DNC emails to WikiLeaks. Butowsky also alleged that Folkenflik conspired with an attorney to extort money from Fox. Butowsky told Courthouse News Service that he still believes the Fox News story was accurate.[12] The case is scheduled to go to trial in mid-2021.[13]</i><p>&gt; <i>By August 2020, Butowsky still insisted that the retracted Fox News story was accurate.[2] He claimed without evidence that the Seth Rich family were &quot;not innocent bystanders&quot; and that they were &quot;in possession of material evidence indicating that Seth Rich downloaded the DNC emails, sent them to Wikileaks, and requested payment.&quot;[2]</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ed_Butowsky#Murder_of_Seth_Rich_conspiracy_theories" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ed_Butowsky#Murder_of_Seth_Ric...</a><p>So if the GDP grew &quot;only&quot; ~2.5%, then any inflation above that (as the &#x27;truthers&#x27; claim), would mean were actually in a recession&#x2F;depression for the last decade... which makes no sense. If inflation is &gt;5% (per the truthers), then the economic growth would have had to been <i>on top of that</i>, for a nominal growth rate of &gt;7%.')
