Elon tried to take Tesla private. He himself didn&#x27;t want raise money on higher evaluation. He himself multiple times said they don&#x27;t deserve the high stock.<p>He has been an optimist on this technology of a long time and has made that argument for a long time.<p>The claim that the FSD testing is to boost the stock price is truly bizard, specially because there is very little evidence of any correlation between FSD and stock price.<p>Go look at the Wallstreet models, most of them don&#x27;t have large considerations income from FSD.
