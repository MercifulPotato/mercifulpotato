Companies don&#x27;t just reassign ownership, the original owner of the number has to actively forward calls. This causes some issues when a provider goes out of business and Ofcom or whoever have to call around and ask nicely for someone to take on forwarding for their number ranges. (There&#x27;s talk about fixing this with a big central database, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s come to fruition yet.)')
