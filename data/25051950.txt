My biggest issue now is when I accidentally activate it.  I didn&#x27;t have an issue accidentally hitting the function keys on my 2013, so why not bring those back?  Or invent something new.  Forward or back, I don&#x27;t care, just admit the touch bar was a dud and get it off my keyboard.<p>EDIT:  My mother also says she gets distracting autocomplete suggestions on the touch bar while she&#x27;s typing.  I vaguely remember doing something to turn that off on mine, but she is terrified of Covid so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to get at her laptop and fix it for her.  I don&#x27;t know what human factors genius at Apple decided it would be helpful for people to see words hopping around at the edge of their vision while they&#x27;re trying to type.')
