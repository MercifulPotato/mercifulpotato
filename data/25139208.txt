Is it moral for some workers to receive rewards that are richer than others (in terms of what they will buy) purely on the basis of local economics?<p>Why is it moral for workers in locations with generous government programs to receive the same nominal cash pay as those who might have to pay out of pocket for some of those same services in different locations?<p>&quot;All other things being equal, equal pay for equal work&quot; sounds reasonable, but when you&#x27;re not holding all other things equal, the moral position is more tenuous.')
