If you live on the west coast and connect to a server on the east coast, you&#x27;re looking at 50 ms minimum based on laws of physics alone.  Real world latency is usually 60-70 ms.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s a worst case scenario of connecting between the coasts.  Honestly I don&#x27;t know what Discord&#x27;s voice latency is.  I suppose I could measure it, but it&#x27;s already low enough to be good.<p>Besides, it&#x27;s a voice chat service.  Even if latency was a ridiculous 200 ms, how would you even notice, other than when you hear your own voice coming from someone else&#x27;s microphone?')
