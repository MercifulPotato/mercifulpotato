Transferring a quantum state from one particle to another isn&#x27;t an easy or obvious task, because you can&#x27;t measure it or you would collapse it.<p>Note that &quot;classical&quot; is just stating that a classical channel is <i>good enough</i> to serve that purpose. A channel that preserves quantum state can of course be used, it&#x27;s just that that isn&#x27;t required for this to work.<p>All classical phenomena are quantum, we just use the word &quot;classical&quot; to describe subsets of quantum phenomena acting qualitatively in ways that are consistent with macroscopic phenomena.')
