The nature of work deepens the problem. “Unlike the agricultural and industrial societies that preceded it,” Miller writes, our “professional society” is “made up of specialized careers, ladders of achievement.” You make your choice, forgoing others: year by year, you “clamber up into your future,” thinking back on the ladders unclimbed.<p>Freedom is a weird thing. Most would say that more personal freedom is a good thing, at least for themselves. Yet so many behave in exactly the opposite way. I&#x27;m reminded of Paul Graham&#x27;s recent essay <i>How to Think for Yourself</i>, and this passage about ideologies:<p>&gt; The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious about food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a large variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;think.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;think.html</a><p>Nobody forces an ideology on someone, and yet the number of people who gleefully latch onto ideologies seems to be exploding.<p>Could there be a connection between greater freedom and greater desire to restrict that freedom - not from the outside, but from within?')
