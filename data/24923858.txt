Great libraries are designed so that you can get a feel for them and -- with practice -- use them intuitively. Even after years of (admittedly light) use I still find pandas&#x27; multi-indexes confusing, and I always have to look up the best of myriad ways to do something in matplotlib. In comparison, R&#x27;s dplyr and ggplot have stuck with me even ages after giving up day-to-day use of R.')
