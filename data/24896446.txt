You can&#x27;t just say &quot;oh, we don&#x27;t mean actually racist, we mean &#x27;woke-racist&#x27;&quot; and expect everyone to agree with this new definition and feel good about calling themselves woke-racist.<p>This stuff <i>barely</i> flies with hyper-progressive elites, and many of them are deeply uncomfortable with it.
