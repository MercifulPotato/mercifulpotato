As a post-doc in astronomy, I&#x27;m happy to report that the quality of HN discussion on astro-related submissions tends to be quite good[1]. The top level posts tend to be either be broad-level questions that get some good replies or &quot;fun facts&quot;. This probably has to do with most folks being interested in space but not really having strong opinions, leading to cordial comment sections and a decent supply of actual astronomy experts on HN.<p>Now, for things like finance, markets, politics, etc. like you&#x27;re getting at, those are a different store. I&#x27;ve been baffled that some political and finance posts have devolved to threads <i>worse</i> than Reddit... Maybe some subs have become homogeneous enough that they don&#x27;t generate quite the same conflict?<p>[1] About once a year there&#x27;s a Dark Matter related post that usually brings out a very critical set of responses. That and Dark Energy are just things you need a lot of investigation into the evidence of because, like Quantum Mechanics, they are just weird and don&#x27;t make sense to the uninitiated.')
