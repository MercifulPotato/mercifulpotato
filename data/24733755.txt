To presume to know anything about what goes on in the rarified power struggles at an intercontinental&#x2F;global levels requires free speech and giving serious researchers&#x2F;writers a viewable voice. There are plenty of wonderful investigative reporters (Whitney Webb is a stellar example right now for example) but the editorial employees of oligarch owned media have marching orders and objectives to meet, so voices like Whitney&#x27;s are invisible in the &#x27;mainstream media&#x27;, except to be undermined if their work gets through to an audience.<p>We don&#x27;t know anything about the political layers of the onion batting for control of the US democratically elected leadership, but we do have a daily torrent of candidate abuse, undermining and  negativity from the two big corporate camps and zero coverage of anything else (Greens, Libertarians, candidates rejected by their party etc etc).\nThe person currently in power usually gets the worst of the abuse and second guessing as who-knows-who fights to depose and replace. (I&#x27;m a registered Dem in Cal FWIW, not arguing a political point here).')
