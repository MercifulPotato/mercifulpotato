Often the undefined variables are within the context of communication theory and reputation or auditing systems.<p>In the case of the famous prisoners dilemma, the real solution is establishing a secret out of band communication channel prior to the dilemma, alongside a known reputation and retaliation penalty for abusing the mutual trust.[3] [4]<p>The famous &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; rational resource optimization game is often cited as justification for machiavellian exploitation, yet humans being social creatures are subject to reputations, and have sophisticated communication, cooperation, and retaliation abilities.\n[4]<p>Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s &quot;Rules, games, and common-pool resources&quot; and Robert Axelrod&#x27;s work &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot; both explain game theory in the context of human scale realities. Of particular interest to the hacker community would be Ostrom&#x27;s Common Pool Resource principles, which are applicable to adhoc decentralized communities. :)<p>At the core of game theory, and human civilization is communication and trust. The abuse of mass media to manipulate populations knows the power of communication and cultural narratives, and we&#x27;re witnessing what&#x27;s often described in terms such as &quot;hypernormalization&quot; or &quot;accelerationism&quot; [6][7][8][9]<p>For a better applicable human scale game theory primer, check out Bruce Schneier&#x27;s (yes, the same legendary cryptographer Bruce), &quot;Liars and Outliers&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;liars-and-outliers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;liars-and-outliers</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@sarabizarro&#x2F;the-trolley-problem-now-903adaa295e9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@sarabizarro&#x2F;the-trolley-problem-now-903a...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;trolleyproblem&#x2F;top&#x2F;?sort=top&amp;t=all" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;trolleyproblem&#x2F;top&#x2F;?sort=top&amp;t=all</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=S0qjK3TWZE8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=S0qjK3TWZE8</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principle...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stuartmcmillen.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;amusing-ourselves-to-death&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stuartmcmillen.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;amusing-ourselves-to-dea...</a> Neil Postman&#x27;s &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot;<p>[6] on Cybernetics and the 20th century &quot;All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace&quot; by Adam Curtis <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thoughtmaybe.com&#x2F;all-watched-over-by-machines-of-loving-grace&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thoughtmaybe.com&#x2F;all-watched-over-by-machines-of-lov...</a><p>[7] on propaganda and 20th century culture &quot;The Century of the Self&quot; by Adam Curtis <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thoughtmaybe.com&#x2F;the-century-of-the-self&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thoughtmaybe.com&#x2F;the-century-of-the-self&#x2F;</a><p>[8] on the hyperreal news and the use of crisis to manipulate populations &quot;Hypernormalization&quot; by Adam Curtis <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thoughtmaybe.com&#x2F;hypernormalisation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thoughtmaybe.com&#x2F;hypernormalisation&#x2F;</a><p>[9] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Accelerationism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Accelerationism</a>')
