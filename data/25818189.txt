This is a matter of degree, but there&#x27;s a point where the effects of that annoyance become very obvious.<p>If publishing on Apple devices was just a tiny bit more annoying, devs would complain and then still publish their extensions. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be what&#x27;s happening, it seems Apple has crossed a line where extension devs have decided to just ignore the entire thing.')
