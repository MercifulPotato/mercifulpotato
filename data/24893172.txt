That can certainly result in bad code, but it also enables very good code as well (ex the Eigen library). Python objects can be monkey patched at runtime - a powerful ability, but trivial to misuse.<p>Certainly the design of a language should facilitate and even actively encourage writing good code. Attempting to solve systemic organizational or educational issues with it is probably counterproductive though.')
