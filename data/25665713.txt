I suspect adding other types of clocks could pose back&#x2F;forward compat challenges. However, this is a wild shot in the dark &amp; I didn&#x27;t really look into the internals of libdispatch. Maybe ask on their github page?<p>Generally upgrading a private API to public is a lot of work &amp; goes through <i>a lot</i> of review (having monitored that mailing list &amp; added 1 API during my time there). So if there&#x27;s a private API probably some team at Apple needed it to deliver a feature but the maintainers were not confident the specific solution they chose generalized well &amp; either requires some work or something else.')
