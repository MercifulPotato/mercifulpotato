It was usually the same young guy who would try to purchase a single beer, without saying a word.<p>If the cashier asked for his i.d., the guy would silently hand them card that said something like, &quot;Congratulations, you did not fail the underage liquor sales test&quot;, and then leave.<p>After the 4th or 5th time of the same person trying the same purchase most of the employees learned who he was. I think law enforcement did eventually switch to a different decoy towards the end of my time at the job.')
