Item(by='kortilla', descendants=None, kids=[24979273], score=None, time=1604396536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977206, text='&gt; My intuition is that if I personally came up with a cute &quot;gotcha&quot; like this where I wound up paying zero in taxes because of some loophole, I would go to prison. Why isn&#x27;t the same standard applied to rich companies?<p>The same standards do apply, the loopholes just don’t really exist down at a normal individual income level.<p>Calling it a “loophole” is a bit of a misnomer as well since it’s just the regular law. Being a subsidiary of another company is extremely common and isolating particular resources into subsidiaries with exclusive licensing&#x2F;usage agreements for liability&#x2F;accounting&#x2F;ownership&#x2F;management purposes is extremely common.<p>&gt; These tax shenanigans would stop if laws were enforced.<p>Again, the laws are enforced. Tax avoidance schemes operate within the bounds of the law. It sounds like you’re confusing with “tax evasion”, which is illegal and is enforced.')
