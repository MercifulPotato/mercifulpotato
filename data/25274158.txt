The main reason is that we read sequentially. It much easier to follow something sequential, then something jumping around. A lot of bugs happen when you see a function call that you think you know what it does but doesn&#x27;t.<p>There is a reason regular front-to-back books are more popular then choose-your-own-adventure books. You know where you are, and you dont spend all day flipping back and forth.<p>I also find that when you start splitting up your functions down to 5 lines, it becomes almost impossible to differentiate what the different functions do clearly, and that makes good naming almost impossible.<p>EDIT: Also, I dont understand why people complain about functions being longer then 5 lines making code hard to navigate, and then turn around and write header only files with 10000 lines of code....')
