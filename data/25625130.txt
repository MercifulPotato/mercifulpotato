Pop!_OS is a flavor of Ubuntu that&#x27;s maintained by System76, a Linux laptop vendor.<p>Two selling points of Pop!_OS for me:<p>- It Just Worked with my high DPI monitor—no futzing with settings or drivers.\n- It Just Worked with my graphics card—no tweaking kernel launch flags when trying to install the operating system.<p>I&#x27;m sure other operating systems can be made to work as well, but Pop!_OS was the first distro I tried that didn&#x27;t give me problems.')
