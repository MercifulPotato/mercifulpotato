If you can show me some data that it&#x27;s false I&#x27;m happy to take it back, but every company I have worked for does geo-based compensation in one way or another.<p>&gt; The first half of you statement sounds like an absolute (&quot;Remote workers get paid less&quot;) and the second half walks it back...<p>It&#x27;s less an absolute and more a trend. I also did not walk it back. I talked about RSUs but there&#x27;s a lot of caveats there. You can&#x27;t be offering someone in CA more RSUs than someone in Oklahoma. The COLA part of your salary may change slightly, but the relative take home pay should be the same. This is not true at most companies but they&#x27;ll try to convince you it is.')
