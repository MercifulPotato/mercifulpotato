Of course I don&#x27;t buy anything above 100€, but neither anything computer related, clothes or in general things that I can walk ten minutes and buy in a physical shop.<p>Most of what I buy are products that I can&#x27;t find offline easily or at all. So Amazon actually brings them sooner than what I would be able to find it offline, like vitamins or exotic incense. Also some audio electronics are too expensive in the few shops that, even in Madrid, are specialized in that area.<p>But computers or phones or monitors&#x2F;tv? MediaMarkt or Fnac have a good enough variety and I can just walk out the shop with a box, that I can return no questions asked if defective, the same day.<p>I&#x27;ve also found out that some pieces of audio electronics or instruments are better bought used from individuals. I got a pair of pro speakers for 100€ that are triple that money new. You can go and see the thing before paying. Same for furniture that is dirty cheap used.<p>Edit: could be this related to USA car dependence?')
