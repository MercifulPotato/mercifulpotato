Unlike SPOT trackers and such, the response is managed and coordinated by the US military. If your EPIRB signal makes it out, someone <i>will</i> come looking for you.<p>They work on dry land, too.  Very useful to have if you like to do trips to the desert backcountry.  I ended up purchasing a satellite phone after ditching my SPOT tracker but if I had to do it over, I&#x27;d just buy the EPIRB.<p>The marine versions activate automatically when dropped in the water.  Typically, on a sailboat, you would lash it somewhere on deck where it would pop up to the surface and activate if the boat sinks.  The outside of a life raft shell is one such spot.')
