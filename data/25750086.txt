What Trump has always done is deflect.  You can&#x27;t trust my opposition, I tell the real truth, as he frequently says, implies, and follows up with falsehoods, lies, misconceptions, alternate facts.  Whatever you want to call it, its hard to define intent.  However you can judge history.  Trump does not recant his misconceptions.  Often he stands by them, saying that he is partially right, being wrongfully accused, or was just joking.<p>This happening so frequently shows to me that he provides information in bad faith and when something seems like either a misconception or a lie, its looking pretty clearly that the intent is to manufacture a separate reality that is conveniently aligned with his goals.  To put it simply, the intent is to deceive and that is the very definition of lies.  Using lies to manipulate the media is propaganda.')
