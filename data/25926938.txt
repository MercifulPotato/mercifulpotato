I manage them using Capture One Pro, which only manages them inside their directory, so it&#x27;s really unlikely that they&#x27;ll get imported or moved out.<p>That said, I too have a few TB of online storage, but my problem is the reverse: I will sometimes capture a few GB of photos, import them for safety, the nightly backup will run and back them all up, and the next day I&#x27;ll delete most of them as rejects. Those rejects, I don&#x27;t really care to keep, so I wouldn&#x27;t want blurry or otherwise useless photos taking up space for ever.')
