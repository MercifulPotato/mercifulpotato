Not for anything exciting like travel, I just was burned out. I spent 6 months working for UPS, unloading trucks and airplanes. It was great - I worked 2 hours a day, got in shape, learned a bit about a new industry, and got health coverage during my time off.<p>Eventually, I went back to work in tech, no longer burned out.
