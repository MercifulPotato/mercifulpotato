Instead of building the proper infrastructure to allow traffic to pass through we just slow it down.<p>My second problem with speed enforcement is it has caused a shift in policing.  Speeding is an absolute and so is cheap to police and prosecute so gets 100% of the enforcement effort, ignoring tailgating, undertaking,  lane hogging, lane indiscipline...etc. All of this can be just as serious,  and I feel (as a regular driver of some of the UKs busiest roads) are getting worse. I would much prefer to have a police officer in a car enforcing the rules than any fixed speed camera')
