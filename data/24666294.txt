I could see the following as one way it could happen.<p>There is a large disconnect with large system integrators there and the actual developers &#x2F; architects; usually 2 or 3 levels of subcontracting.  This means there are 2 to 3 levels of intermediaries taking a margin too, and as such, the actual developer doesn&#x27;t have the fiscal wherewithal to push back on requirements or deadlines too strongly.  (How do you save money on a 300k yen salary in Tokyo?)<p>If I was to guess, the requirement was there, but by the time someone technical got into the real nitty gritty, they discovered that the timeline was too tight to effectively do the testing.  Instead of pushing back, they just rushed it through with a lot of overtime work.')
