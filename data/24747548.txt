Large tech companies would be crazy to keep their engineering teams artificially low, because when you&#x27;re making billions in revenue the added headcount ends up paying for itself even if it&#x27;s only capturing that last 1% of possible product efficiency gains. Like, Google Search could be nearly as good as it is now with 1&#x2F;20th the engineers -- but that last bit of improvement is still absolutely worth having the much bigger team.')
