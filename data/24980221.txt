Working around the character limit.</i><p>I stored an expression in the URL fragment&#x2F;hash, loaded it from there and eval-ed it. The hash symbol would break the expression, so it needs to be removed or commented out. Removing it by string manipulation would have exceeded the 32 character limit, so I went with commenting it out. That means you need to start any expression with &quot;* &#x2F;&quot; (remove the space) to close the comment around the hash symbol.<p>The hover text of the example link gives you a good idea of what is happening.<p>Have fun!<p>Random animation, 47 characters payload:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tixy.land&#x2F;?code=eval(%27%2F*%27%2Bparent.location.hash)#*&#x2F;(i+y)%16&#x2F;16+Math.sin(x*t)-Math.cos(y*t)+(2*t)%3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tixy.land&#x2F;?code=eval(%27%2F*%27%2Bparent.location.ha...</a>')
