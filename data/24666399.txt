A lot of really emotional reactions like yours. I described it as a beneficial side effect and suddenly the whole conversation is about &quot;evil trans people&quot; and &quot;bad liberals&quot;.<p>Having your pronouns available is beneficial to more than just trans people. It benefits everyone, avoids mistakes and makes conversations more accurate. It also breaks the myth that there are no women online and that there are no computer-savvy women. It also brings visibility to non-binary people who are otherwise invisible.')
