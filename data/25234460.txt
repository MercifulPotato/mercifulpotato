While they don&#x27;t straight up lie, they often omit many important details in their story, in order to justify their conclusion.<p>That&#x27;s also my experience with the media on the left. It&#x27;s not straight-up fake news. But it&#x27;s more misleading news. The infamous &quot;women earn 78 cents for every dollar a man make&quot;. Which gives you the impression that a man and a woman both working at the same role doing the same work and woman makes 20% less than man. While in reality this is just an abject misrepresentation of the actual stat and weaponized for political gain. But unfortunately, this will not qualify as fake news.')
