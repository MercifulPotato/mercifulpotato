We&#x27;re discussing arguments that apply in the real world, not in math theory.<p>In math, if you have this axiom:<p><pre><code>  f(x) &gt; 5 for all x &gt;= 20\n</code></pre>\nyou are not then allowed to change it with a later axiom<p><pre><code>  except when x is divisible by 240\n</code></pre>\nHowever, in real life this happens a lot. I have a company that is taxed a fixed amount per year... except for the years where I make over 100k euros, in which case things become quite complicated. If I omit the second part (which is not impossible, given that I never made over 100k euros a year with that company), and suddenly get a big payout from someone, the result will be very different from my initial estimation - as sound as it was WITHOUT that additional axiom &#x2F; assumption &#x2F; rule.')
