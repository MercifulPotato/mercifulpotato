I wonder if &quot;I don&#x27;t need a framework&quot; gets you crazy looks in the broader PHP world today? Going no-framework was already increasingly out of fashion as of around PHP 5.3 (when I got out and stopped bothering to learn the new updates -- my last project used the Yii framework) so it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me. Sure there&#x27;s still the old practical business-needs-first PHP, I was able to update some old PHP to v7 without much fuss, yet it&#x27;s more than just out of fashion it&#x27;s ripe for any consultant or new employee looking to make a name for themselves to &quot;clean up&quot; and get with the times. Younger me would probably cringe but I&#x27;d just advise to use Java instead of modern PHP with all its bells and whistles and patterns, there seems to be little difference anymore.')
