Lots of speculation about why, but it’s still just speculation.<p>Betting markets seemed all over the place, poor predictions that swung around, and at times were clearly wrong.<p>538’s model of potential outcomes was right on target and their analysis was solid. Biden’s chance of winning was high because he could survive a polling error, and he did.')
