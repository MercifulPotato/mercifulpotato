One of the issues we ran into was unlink() on ext4; it could take quite a long time for large (TB..) files on busy servers. NFS would eventually timeout the request, the client would retry the operation, and get ENOENT back. It turned out that while ext4 blocked until it&#x27;d finished every detail of unlink(), the name was immediately removed from the filesystem namespace.<p>NFS is in the category of works well enough, but the edge cases are a mile wide!')
