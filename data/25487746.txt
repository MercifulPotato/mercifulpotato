For start ups, I can see the CEO actually having this kind of involvement. Jobs&#x2F;Musk&#x2F;Zuck all come to mind of a CEO that is in total control. ATT&#x2F;Spectrum&#x2F;Comcast&#x2F;etc all seem to be on a different level. This adding of fees type of schemes seems more like something the bean counters come up with, and then eventually the CEO is informed&#x2F;blesses the decisions. Would a CEO in these companies really be the ones scheming up ideas like this or be more concerned about the next acquisition?')
