Parler people spread the word how to sideload on Android. Parler people on iOS get angry and lobby their congress people to force Apple to allow sideloading and&#x2F;or alternate stores.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can really prevent people from communicating. Yes it sucks they&#x27;re lying to each other and causing a ruckus. Can you imagine if they managed to do this via the phone and the phone companies cancelled their phone service. Yes, I know the phone company can&#x27;t do that legally but that&#x27;s precisely my point. These people are going to push for laws that allow them to communicate however they want.<p>Removing the apps from Google Play and Apple App store will not stop this.<p>Or at least that&#x27;s my prediction. I have no solution unfortunately. This seems like the new norm. In fact maybe it&#x27;s part of the great filter: Mass many to many communication and its repercussions.')
