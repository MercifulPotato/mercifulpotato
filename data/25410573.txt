Because VAT applies at every level, complexity is required to avoid unduly interfering with industries with multiple mid-levels.<p>2) To say GST is exactly like VAT is to say that an abacus is exactly like a supercomputer because they both calculate things.<p>A GST is not a VAT. A GST is a goods and services tax, not a &quot;value added tax.&quot; The GST only taxes the <i>final</i> value of the product or service sold, similar to a sales tax, not the value added at every step. This is important, because it means that a GST does not try to capture the value delta provided by middlemen, while a VAT does and is deliberately designed to do so. Thus, a VAT impairs the value proposition of utilizing middleman. This makes a GST (or sales tax) significantly more efficient from the perspective of taxpayers, though from a governmental revenue perspective, this also means that GST raises less revenue than a VAT would.<p>A big issue with sales tax is that reseller exemptions only apply to products acquired with the intent to resell, which means the supplier has to know (or be told) if the products acquired in a transaction will be resold, and this creates complexity for every transaction. So instead, the simple way to do it is that every transaction is subject to GST.<p>To get legitimate resellers and middlemen back to the economic position of not paying GST, they get to offset the GST paid for goods or services acquired to produce their own products or services against the GST they collect for their goods or services. This is superficially similar to the VAT, except that with GST you&#x27;re done (yes, it&#x27;s really that simple), whereas with VAT you&#x27;ve still got way more work to do.<p>(Note that I have spent the last several years handling both GST and VAT compliance. You will not convince me or any other tax professional that a GST is anything like a VAT except in the most superficial ways.)')
