This is less remote than the typical national park over there.<p>The snake danger is overstated as always, for extra sensationalism. Snakes don&#x27;t hunt people. Unlikely attacks are defensive, when provoked, and virtually always happen domestically. The death rate after an unlikely bite of the top 3 most dangerous snakes in Colombia is in the range of 1-3%. Not 80%. And surely when you see it, it&#x27;s easy to avoid.<p>&quot;The territory where the paintings have been discovered was completely off limits until recently and still involves careful negotiation to enter safely.&quot;<p>Given the nonsense in the rest of the article, likely another exaggeration. Even in areas of Colombia declared red (= do not travel to in any case), you can just go. They are giant areas, where locals know exactly the 95% of the area safe to visit. Where nothing has happened for many years, with zero rebel presence. Just avoid that 5%.<p>FARC is gone and ELN focuses on sabotaging infrastructure. There&#x27;s no interest in visitors or tourists. The latter has been true for about 2 decades now.<p>A true and real risk over there is running into somebody in a forest doing something illegal (narco, logging, gold mining). Then you de-escalate, pay, and wish them a good day.<p>None of this dismisses the beauty and importance of the discovery, just triggered at these constant falsehoods about Colombia and sensationalist writing.')
