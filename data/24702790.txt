I find that shocking given how bad Microsoft is for a healthy and competitive market. You don&#x27;t have to look much past the bundling of various products under Office subscriptions to realize this. Either way, this report doesn&#x27;t actually take any action but simply makes recommendations:<p>&gt; The 449-page report recommends Congress consider a series of measures in response, including legislation forcing them to separate certain dominant online platforms from other business lines as well as changes to antitrust laws to reinvigorate a perceived lack of strong enforcement.<p>&gt; The report carries no legal consequences on its own, but lawmakers hope its conclusions will spur policy makers to action.<p>I&#x27;ll be pleased if even just one of these companies faces consequences - with Google being my top pick. But ultimately I want to see all of them broken up.')
