Every one of those AWS services <i>can</i> be reproduced in a colo, but it takes time and effort to set up a queueing solution which just exists already in AWS. It takes time and effort to set up notifications for storage and database events which are easy-as-anything in AWS.<p>Even without getting into multiple availability zones, things like SQS&#x2F;SNS, Dynamo, S3, and Lamda combine to make things very easy on day one with AWS.<p>Could it be cheaper?
