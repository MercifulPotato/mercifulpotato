Really it should be Hourly Rate = 30 + (2.50 * max(0, Speed - 12)).<p>Or if you prefer Lispy stuff :)<p>(+ 30 (* 2.5 (max (0 (- speed 12)))))<p>This then means if you drive at 22mph for 1 hour, you earn 30 + (2.50 * max(0, 10)) or $55 which you also get from 2.50 * 22<p>Is this just discounting the constant multiplier since it applies to everything and can be pulled out?')
