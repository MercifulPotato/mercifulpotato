I flew ~1,000 times and I&#x27;ve encountered about a dozen situations where I was really pissed off at some airline policy.<p>Two suggestions for you.<p>One: you might be, like me, a lucky one. Someone with an IT background, not too negatively affected by the Covid-19 crisis. Think about it for a second.<p>If my guess is wrong, apologies for assuming you fit that profile. Tell me more about how bad it is for you, if you&#x27;d like.<p>Two: you can deal with this issue by simply considering it &quot;lost&quot; money, and move on. Getting your real money back would be a pain in the ass. Right now, the Airline is still capable of giving you hours of rage and stress. Take away that power from them. End the issue in the fastest way possible.<p>It&#x27;s a pity that these things happen. In a modern, just society, a company and its executives should be immediately punished for this kind of behavior.')
