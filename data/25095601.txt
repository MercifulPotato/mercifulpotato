Digital and dynamic so faster spinning adds more time per rotation.<p>- Quality-feel dial for power.<p>- Quality-feel dial for function, or possibly buttons for this.<p>- Dial could be pushed for start or other feature. Push again for pause. Push and hold for reset.<p>- Door opens downward, horizontally mounted.<p>- Door has a handle; no door button.<p>- One single pleasurable beep or sound when finished. Alternatively: continuous sound modulated to convey how long remains. Alternatively: silent switch!<p>- Never beep unnecessarily nor inexplicably.<p>- Expire remaining time after a short while.<p>- Indicate when not empty but not running.<p>- Less noisy afterward than during.<p>- Large enough.<p>Make the bottom as flat possible while still rotating content.
