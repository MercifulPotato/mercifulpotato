You can pull into a stop and just swap trailers. The tractor battery can be a backup or a stabilizer.<p>The trailing trailer can be shaped to further increase aerodynamics. It can have drive wheels to stabilize the truck in high crosswind, and additional regen braking on major mountain descents, as well as additional power up the mountain, although EV motors should be able to provide torque for climbing.<p>In the end, all the alternatives are now chasing a technology ecosystem that is improving at double digit percents per year in cost and more than that in scale of production.<p>The &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; actually needs to beat not only what Tesla can allegedly do in 2-3 years from what they presented on battery day, but even better than that, because IF&#x2F;WHEN they get to scale, batteries will be at least half the cost of where they are now.<p>Same for nuclear. Once BEV and Wind&#x2F;solar&#x2F;storage stabilize their development curves, maybe nuclear or hydrogen can target a competitive price point.')
