They have to cut their prices relative to what they&#x27;d charge in that hypothetical anarchy where they need to provide everything themselves in order to operate. For example they can use clean water provided by their city, so that may save them the price of producing clean water themselves. But the competition gets that city water too, so amazon can&#x27;t profit from the savings of not cleaning water, or competition will undercut them. They have to pass the savings on to customers.<p>The only benefits they can really profit from are things no one else can get, which generally only amount to corruption for anything I can think of. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some, of course.')
