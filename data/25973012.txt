Some problems can be solved algorithmically with no search (e.g. computing a square root) and search can obviously be done in service of something other than problem-solving (unless you take the meaning of &quot;problem&quot; to be so broad as to apply to just about any activity).<p>I also intended the word &quot;search&quot; to be understood in a narrow technical sense:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Search_algorithm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Search_algorithm</a><p>[EDIT] Just to clarify, because I just realized that these two statements might seem contradictory:<p>&quot;The fundamental approach to problem solving is search&quot;<p>&quot;Not all problem solving is search&quot;<p>All problem solving <i>can</i> be cast as search, but some problems have heuristics that allow the correct branch of the search space to be chosen the first at every decision point with no backtracking required.  The &quot;search&quot; becomes degenerate because no backtracking is ever required.  The word &quot;search&quot; is generally reserved to apply only to algorithms that don&#x27;t have such strong heuristics and do require backtracking.')
