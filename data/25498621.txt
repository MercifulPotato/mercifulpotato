All photos are processed, through the lens, by the software on the device, and by the photographers&#x27; workflows. When you shoot JPG, there&#x27;s already a lot of processing that happens, and when you shoot RAW, you need to process that yourself from a dull, flat image.<p>Photographers rarely post un-processed images. Even before all of that, settings are chosen which alter the exposure, depth of field, focus point, color temperature of the image which alter the &quot;real thing&quot;. It&#x27;s common to think &quot;editing&quot; a photo is some cheating magic, but it should be considered the norm, and how people share their vision of what they want it to look like.<p>The AI can just automate a lot of the workflow or need to buy extra equipment, still up the human to decide how they want the image to come out.')
