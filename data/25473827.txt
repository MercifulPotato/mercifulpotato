That’s exactly the kind of cultural assumption I’m speaking of.<p>Case in point, I routinely run services without quotas or caps and what have you, scale out for load, and alarm on runaway usage, not service unavailable or quota exceeded.  I’d rather take the hit than inconvenience my customers with an outage. In this frame of mind, quotas are a moral hazard, a safety barrier with a perverse disincentive.<p>That principle of “just run it deep” works even at global scale, right up until you run out of hardware to allocate, which is why growth logistics are a rarely-discussed but critical aspect of running a public cloud.<p>The core learnings become, how to factor out such situations at all.  That might be through some kind of asynchronous processing (event-driven services, queues, tuplespaces), or co-operative backpressure (a la TCP&#x2F;IP) and so on.  Synchronous request&#x2F;response state machines are absolute murder to scalability, so HTTP, especially when misappropriated as an RPC substrate, has a lot to answer for.')
