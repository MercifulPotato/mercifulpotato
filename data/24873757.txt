So as long as RIAA believed (and that belief <i>need not be reasonable</i>) the legal theory of infringement that they advanced, there&#x27;s not a liability problem.<p>SUre, if they misrepresented their right to act on behalf of the legal owners of the works they claimed were infringed by it, or that would be an issue, but no one even suspects that they are doing that.')
