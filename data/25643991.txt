In their video on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;constructortheory.org&#x2F;what-is-constructor-theory&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;constructortheory.org&#x2F;what-is-constructor-theory&#x2F;</a> they simply claim that no constructor exists that can turn a cooked egg into a raw egg and that allows their theory to reason about thermodynamics. Now presumably this is meant to be about entropy and not merely the amount of energy. However given the exact right amount of energy it <i>is</i> possible for a constructor to &#x27;uncook&#x27; an egg, it&#x27;s just that this constructor will work only for <i>exactly</i> that egg at <i>exactly</i> that time.<p>The resolution is that you&#x27;re extremely unlikely to pick the right constructor but then we&#x27;re back to probability again. In fact anything the recovers the laws of thermodynamics simply ends up recovering probability theory as the laws of thermodynamics are inherently probabilistic.')
