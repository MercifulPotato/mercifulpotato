I worked on Lehman&#x27;s Tokyo electronic trading desk in 2008. When we went bankrupt, it wasn&#x27;t our clients, or even the exchanges which stopped our trading. It was our clearing banks.<p>Interestingly, we weren&#x27;t cutoff uniformly in all markets. NY desk was trading about 75% of regular volume for 4 days into the bankruptcy before someone (SEC?) told them to knock it off.<p>There&#x27;s a lot going on in Robinhood&#x27;s back office and legal teams of which we are not aware.
