We thought we were doing great just because we would pay our credit card off each month. But we were actually 100% relying on our future paychecks to survive.<p>- My wife lost her job 2 years ago and was out of work for a month due to COVID. The budget gave us an objective view rather than an emotional one. In both cases, we didn’t need to even rely on our emergency fund because of flexible budgeting.<p>- We are able to maximize credit card rewards without being concerned with spending too much.<p>- We are able to easily track our cash equivalent net worth.<p>Most of these things are not YNAB specific, but the software makes things so much easier.')
