He is genuinely wasting time in order to work around Apple&#x27;s developer-unfriendly platform. Not that I should be telling devs where they should spend their time... but I feel like so much effort is being devoted to fix Apple&#x27;s issues.<p>&gt; <i>When I&#x27;m debugging these issues, I&#x27;ll often times spend a few hours in IDA Pro (Apple doesn&#x27;t provide debug symbols, unlike Microsoft, which makes this process even more miserable than it already is), and after identifying the issue I&#x27;ll often have several ideas for &quot;clever&quot; workarounds. Which of them are acceptable for the App Store? Usually none!</i><p>Really, why we need to have very talented people spending their time in dealing with this, instead of contributing actual value on other parts of the project? Apple should be losing devs in favor of other better platforms, not the other way around. With less and worse products at their disposal, Apple users would then be well aware that they are choosing a platform that alienates developers.')
