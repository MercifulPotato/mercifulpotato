The amount of goodwill MSFT loses over this (hopefully isolated) incident has to be worth a few orders of magnitude less than the tens of millions of dollars that would be burned to actually fight the RIAA.<p>Smaller hosts could get away with not honoring DMCAs since the RIAA likely isn&#x27;t going to waste resources actually filing a lawsuit, but this yt-dl situation seems like the perfect setup for the RIAA to set a precedent outlawing video&#x2F;music downloaders if someone were to actually fight them on it (and until then, they can continue to take down video&#x2F;music downloaders until someone does counter it).')
