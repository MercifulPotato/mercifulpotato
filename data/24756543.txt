For a long time I didn&#x27;t have a car in the downtown part of a city I live in. Public transit+rideshare+zipcar was a totally fine substitute (like the author).<p>But owning a car is better&#x2F;easier&#x2F;more enjoyable&#x2F;more freeing! We didn&#x27;t do a fine-grained analysis on how much using zipcar+hertz would cost vs buying a car. The car isn&#x27;t costing a significant percent of our income, we were annoyed with alternative and wanted it, so we bought it.<p>If you used a blender 2x a year and it cost $1 to rent vs $30 to buy, would you really consider going through the hassle of saving money to deal with renting a blender? I&#x27;m not suggesting a car is the same significance for all, but certainly it can be rational to own one even for people in the same position as the author.')
