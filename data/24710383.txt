Item(by='jaclaz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602090820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709866, text='&gt;How I hate those.<p>Exactly, and rightly so.<p>But as well the &quot;negative&quot; ones <i>like</i> (I swear I have seen more than one of these) &quot;The item arrived but it is a darker yellow than what seen in the pictures on the site.&quot; which may have some meaning if you order - say - a scarf to match a coat (but you&#x27;d better go to a shop with the coat and find a matching colour scarf) but doesn&#x27;t really apply to - still say - a chainsaw or a power tool.')
