Google seems to think they need to create SREs out of SWEs. It took me far, far longer to learn distsys, network engineering, storage and everything else that goes into a platform than it did for me to learn to write grpc endpoints in golang.<p>I&#x27;ve been in ops for 10+ years building platforms. I&#x27;d love to be able to spend 6 hours a day coding but when I&#x27;m jugging 10-20 different products that have 1-10+ different languages involved (go, python, nodejs, javascript, ruby, ansible, terraform, puppet, chef) you really have a hard time getting super good at one thing. So most of us have to get good at one language just to pass the code tests, then it languishes because when launching a product I then spend 1-3 months writing something completely different out of biz necessity.<p>The most important skill to me for an SRE&#x2F;Ops is curiosity and pattern recognition, and #1 humility&#x2F;empathy.')
