I have bid on more than a dozen houses all over asking, 50%, waiving all kinds of inspection fixes and I have lost every time to all cash offers from out of state. While my experience may not be indicative of the market as a whole it certainly speaks to some sort of migration happening and &quot;Golden&quot; being on the list of these out of state people.')
