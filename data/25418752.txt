As far as I&#x27;m aware, GNU grep has no explicit SIMD in it other than memchr through glibc. While some libc implementations utilize auto-vectorization of sorts (musl comes to mind), glibc does have Assembly implementations of memchr for several platforms that do indeed make use of SIMD explicitly.<p>ripgrep does the same, except for Intel at least, its memchr is implemented in Rust using SIMD intrinsics explicitly. And it also has a specialized SIMD algorithm (taken from Hyperscan mostly) for dealing with multiple patterns: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;aho-corasick&#x2F;tree&#x2F;8b479a60906d20c38796fb7f2fd212616e64844b&#x2F;src&#x2F;packed&#x2F;teddy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;aho-corasick&#x2F;tree&#x2F;8b479a60906d...</a><p>Hyperscan takes this to a different level though. It has oodles more SIMD. I should have mentioned it in my original comment.')
