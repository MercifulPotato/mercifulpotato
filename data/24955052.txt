Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=[24955277, 24955980], score=None, time=1604177045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954764, text='&gt;Today it&#x27;s still okay by most for a woman to hit a man.<p>The context here is that a woman can&#x27;t threaten a man with violence due to being unable to injure or harm the man (I&#x27;m excluding stinging for a few seconds from a slap).<p>Whereas a woman is always at a great disadvantage for defending herself against a man, so if a man hits her, even if it&#x27;s just a slap, it indicates that he is willing to hit her, and might hit her harder next time causing damage.  This context makes the difference between a woman slapping a man versus a man slapping a woman.  A similar situation is if a very small child slapped an adult.<p>Note that my statement isn&#x27;t comparing women to small children, but to illustrate the role of differences in displays of physical power between two people.<p>None of the above is me endorsing any sort of violence or physical retribution, but I&#x27;m trying to explain most people wouldn&#x27;t be okay with a woman hitting a man in a way that injures him or causes long term intimidation, but why a slap in a sitcom is accepted.')
