It is disheartening and disappointing that some people decided to create an imagined instance of narrated mockery of a dead person by spreading a rumour&#x2F;lie that he had died ‘tazing himself in the balls repeatedly’ causing distress to his bereaved family.<p>Stripping a deceased person of their dignity via caricature is really a new low. This truly beggars belief and makes me very very sad. I hope the family finds peace.')
