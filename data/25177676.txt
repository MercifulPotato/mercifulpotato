That piece is configured to be open (so it can receive messages on Port 25) but is also limited to a set of IP address ranges that internal servers are using (so that it&#x27;s not generally usable by just anyone inside our network) and is configured to send those received messages out using Sendgrid.<p>I found the following Goland project just a few months back that seemed promising:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wiggin77&#x2F;mailrelay" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wiggin77&#x2F;mailrelay</a><p>And I&#x27;ll probably need to follow up with the developer again (or try and make the contribution back to the project on my own), but the main issue it had was that the IP range whitelisting wasn&#x27;t available (and even whitelisting by specific IP addresses seemed problematic, so in my testing I had to keep it completely open for it to work as expected).<p>If Maddy can fulfill the need instead though I can give it a shot ;-).')
