The mechanism: someone posts an issue and puts a bounty on it. A working fix is imported by a developer. The sponsor then grabs the diff and applies it to their own private fork of the code.<p>Most open source bugs never get fixed (or get fixed slowly), and this project would select further for issues that are not already being addressed for whatever reason. So it&#x27;s not unreasonable to think that many PRs would not be merged inside 6 months, even if they are valid fixes. (Raise your hand if you&#x27;ve ever contributed a PR to an OSS project and had it linger for &gt; 6 months.)<p>That risk, plus the low bounties identified by other posters here, seem very tough to overcome.')
