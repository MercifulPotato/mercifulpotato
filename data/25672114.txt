I try to get people to switch to Signal for comms with me and the hope is that if more people install it then they&#x27;ll use it to communicate with each other.  The majority of my contacts have not installed it. I am not yet worried enough about the current state of whatsapp that I&#x27;m willing to forgo using it entirely.<p>Signal, at least, is a very easy install and will just locate your contacts by their phone numbers (like WhatsApp) so the technical barrier is very low.<p>Edit: Oh, I came in to this thread without seeing anything about this new privacy policy. My comment was about the state before that.  I&#x27;m only looking at the change now.')
