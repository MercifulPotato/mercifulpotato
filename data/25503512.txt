Item(by='kristopolous', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608618029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502231, text='Historically, those who legislate and wield power have not invoked it in that way.<p>That&#x27;s the point. &quot;Deregulation&quot; is code for taking hundreds of laws and dumping them in a garbage bin. &quot;Privatization&quot; is code for stealing tax dollars and hiding it in offshore accounts.<p>I only care about the actual, real world material reality that has historically factually happened. The champions politic in a way that tends strongly away from rule of law as quickly as possible.<p>It&#x27;s a framework that gets invoked to go both ways. It&#x27;s a vendor&#x27;s &quot;freedom&quot; to not have to label, say, gmo, but then it&#x27;s the vendor&#x27;s &quot;rights&quot; to prohibit soy milk from using the label &quot;milk&quot;.<p>&quot;Freedoms&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; get interchanged to rationalize the preconfigured results. The dogma is a general tool.<p>It was the &quot;freedom&quot; of agrobusiness to flood mexico with corn after NAFTA and run the local farmers out of business and then it was their &quot;rights&quot; to the marketplace when mexico pushed back. The farmers didn&#x27;t have that same right to the marketplace, they didn&#x27;t have the same freedoms, only international capital does. How convenient.<p>That&#x27;s why the zealots always think it&#x27;s the right answer - it can be reshaped like a mound of clay to justify and rationalize whatever they want.<p>For instance the sanctity of contract matters when it&#x27;s with the gas pipeline company but not when it&#x27;s with the american tribes<p>When instead it&#x27;s a pipeline of people via a subway through a wealthy neighborhood like the  purple line extension in Beverly hills, all of a sudden the free market gets invoked to guess what? Reach the opposite conclusion.<p>It&#x27;s fundamentally a convenient power tool of capital. They used to use the Bible, now they use Friedrich Hayek. Skullduggery with the purest, most heavenly goals. Sure...<p>In practice, free markets are lawless raw power that bend the state to do their bidding like some feudal king, but now it&#x27;s  wearing a bowtie and a cardigan instead of a sceptre and a robe.<p>Same thing, different era.')
