Item(by='MzHN', descendants=None, kids=[25439803], score=None, time=1608100703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434753, text='As said in the tagline, your service is grouped with others that serve _disposable_ emails.<p>Safe use cases for services providing disposable emails are somewhat slim. If you sign up using a disposable email, and later the account ends up being less disposable than you thought, for example because it contains some personal data from you, then you&#x27;re taking a huge risk in not either using an email service that&#x27;s too-big-to-fail, or your own domain.<p>It&#x27;s easy to forget this, and use disposable emails for everything, so the users&#x27; biggest risk is you exiting or the service going out of business with the domain hijacked.<p>If you could somehow reduce the risk of using 33Mail to lower than it is to mess with big email services or custom domains - yes, I saw you can use custom domains with 33mail, but you still have to keep it renewed yourself I assume - then I&#x27;d be happy to pay whatever you ask for the service.<p>For how to guarantee to users that you will outlast the services they sign up for, I have no answers.<p>As we&#x27;ve learned many, many times, even recently with things like Oculus, promises mean nothing.<p>Other than that, I&#x27;d love to see a feature for having the option to generate anonymous aliases. That is, aliases in the format of &lt;random-unique-string&gt;@&lt;domain-that-is-the-same-for-everyone&gt; for cases where you don&#x27;t want to give your username to everyone.<p>Actually, having those two, a guarantee that your service is safe to use and unlimited anonymous aliases, would make 33Mail unique and something I&#x27;d actually use instead of custom domains. Because with custom domains the domain still links all my accounts together, becoming both a privacy and a security issue.')
