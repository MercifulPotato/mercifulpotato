I want to reply to a couple of them.<p>I like the idea of a decentralized platform, but I agree that the solution has to be a legislative one. What&#x27;s being lost is the &quot;national conversation&quot; on the subject and now private companies are deciding for everyone. Billions of people are now being told they don&#x27;t get to decide how they interact with society; instead, literally a few people are deciding on behalf of billions. There is very little way to spin that as a positive result. This is what democracy is literally for - &quot;we all decide together what we want the rules to be&quot;. I&#x27;m... honestly so saddened to see that people can&#x27;t see that.<p>If &quot;the people&quot; decide, and what&#x27;s happening now is what everyone votes for? Great! I may not like it but at least we know that <i>we used good means</i> since the means determine the ends. Right now, the means we are using is literally corporations acting as governments - making decisions for billions.<p>Re: idea has to pass the child porn test: agree. There&#x27;s a few others too like illegal incitement etc. A platform needs a meaningful way to detect and remove this (not only because the law requires it, but this is a protective measure to ensure everyone gets to interact on that platform instead of it just disappearing).')
