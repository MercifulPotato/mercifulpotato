Now in the second half I feel lucky that I found a topic that I am going deep on and I am using that to go wide in some other connected areas.<p>In hindsight there was some time where I had to actively force myself to stick with one topic longer than usual to go deep. Once that hurdle is taken I have less of a problem now integrating adjacent topics.<p>I also agree with the advice that focusing on one topic improves professional success. Long-term is TBD though.')
