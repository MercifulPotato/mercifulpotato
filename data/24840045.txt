The first book is merely a setup. If I may be allowed to mix my sci-fi metaphors, &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!&quot;<p>The first novel was never intended by Herbert to be &quot;self-contained&quot;, but the second novel never achieved the same popularity as the first â€” perhaps for obvious reasons, if you&#x27;ve read it. It&#x27;s not the sequel one expects.')
