The people deserve protections just as much as with their first job. It ain&#x27;t a fuckin hobby like you&#x27;re implying or you wouldn&#x27;t get paid at all.<p>It&#x27;s honestly disgusting. The term &quot;contractor&quot; is just a regression, in true American fashion, to disguising abuse of labor as both necessary and progressive. There is no benefit to the term if it does not implying a mutually arrived at negotiated paymentâ€”do you really think that slavery would be any less heinous with a &quot;flexible schedule&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s fucking disgusting and makes me deeply ashamed to be associated with the tech community. Americans have never needed to read &quot;Black Reconstruction&quot; more.')
