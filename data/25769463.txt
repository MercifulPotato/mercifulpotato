I want all the modern so-called &#x27;tamper proof&#x27; features that an OS has, but I also want myself to be in control of all of them. I am fine with switching them on so that only signed code is executed and let the OS maker handle certificate revocation and all that. But if I want to use it as a dev box, I also want the option to turn it off.<p>Ditto for customization - I want the ability to tweak and change tuning&#x2F;configuration parameters for performance reasons, for productivity reasons, for aesthetic reasons, but I also want a &#x27;force defaults&#x27; and&#x2F;or disable customizations option for when I&#x27;m setting up the computer for a family member, etc.')
