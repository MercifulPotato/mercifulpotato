About an hour on a bicycle<p>3) Not great. We have 2 small kids and remote work has been a constant challenge. We finally have a rhythm, but a covid surge (or worse a case in the household) could be looking any minute. I am busy around the clock with very little time for self-care.<p>4) Pros: short commute time, no pants at work. Cons: everything else.<p>5) kids are definitely a different game than wfh for single people.<p>6) Never. I like the ability to work from home, but the reality of doing it full time is souls sucking.')
