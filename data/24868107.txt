A few months in they started granting emergency extensions to anyone who wanted to stay (getting a flight home was tricky at that time, and still is).<p>Lots of people left but a core of nomads and expats have remained.<p>They have since slowly begun to dial back the giving out of emergency visa extensions but you can still get a new visa through the normal process. There are even people arriving in Bali recently, on newly-issued visas from overseas.<p>The scene is obviously quieter here now. There are no tourists, only nomads and retirees who live here.<p>Honestly it’s pretty nice and I’m glad I stayed.')
