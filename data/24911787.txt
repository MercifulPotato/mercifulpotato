I suspect that neither of you have actually looked to see what WWW sites out of the hundreds that youtube-dl works with actually <i>do</i> have changing HTML, and how many of the &quot;extractors&quot; are still happily working <i>years</i> after they were written.  (Sadly, the open issues list on GitHub, which would have helped to determine this, is gone, GitHub being a single point of failure.)<p>This is just entirely erroneous assumption and hyperbole, that everything is like YouTube, that things will change &quot;a million times&quot;, and that magically all of those hundreds of WWW sites will stop working and &quot;you will not be able to use it for anything&quot;.')
