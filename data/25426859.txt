Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608004991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424683, text='Pluralsight is one of those teaching platforms that I feel is done right because it selects for pedagogical talent. It recognizes that not all who are good at their craft are necessarily good at teaching and it <i>auditions</i> (yes, I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first head this) for those who are. (Most MOOCs on the other hand don&#x27;t do this, so  course quality is crapshoot)<p>There are so many excellent instructors on Pluralsight who are unknowns in the industry but who are competent at organizing knowledge and communicating it in a way that is easy to absorb. (imagine a bunch Gary Bernhardts producing the courses)<p>I&#x27;ve had to pick up C# for a fairly complex project at work a few years ago (I&#x27;d been working in Linux environments for over a decade prior, so I already had the technical knowledge but was lacking familiarity with a Microsoft dev stack). As most people know, learning C# is more than just about learning the language. It&#x27;s about navigating the Visual Studio environment and setting up an efficient workflow in the GUI. (Visual Studio conventions were and still are very different from how things are done in UNIX environments.) I started watching some videos on  Pluralsight -- and went from knowing nothing to deploying production C# code in 2 weeks.<p>I would highly recommend Pluralsight to anyone needing to pick up Microsoft technology quickly.')
