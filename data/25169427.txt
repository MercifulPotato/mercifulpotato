It&#x27;s a ridiculous idea because with such an immense amount of quality information freely available, the only real barrier is intelligence. We can&#x27;t democratize intelligence, so the sentiment smells a bit anti-meritocratic, rather than democratic (I think these two are often confused). It&#x27;s really no different from saying that mathematics is undemocratic. Furthermore, it&#x27;s patronizing to the wider audience by suggesting that they can participate in the field only after it&#x27;s been brought down to their level of understanding (by the democratizing gatekeepers of course).')
