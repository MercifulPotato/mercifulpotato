I&#x27;m not sure what that means, but I think it was something like, sit at an ultra cool street cafe, and watch what happens in night city.  To let the world come to me if I was only willing to listen and watch. A world where there is mystery and intrigue, but not fed to you. A world where you buy a coffee, later look at your bank statement, find that he&#x27;s copied your bank credentials, and stealing from his customers in small withdrawals. Only to learn he&#x27;s a small time side hustler with a thing for nutcracker dolls.')
