We aren’t.</i><p>I&#x27;m not, because the UK with its shift from coal to gas+wind and increases in energy efficiency is a much better one. And also a great example how nowadays nuclear means mostly cost and time overruns.<p>Meanwhile France is operating on a aging fleet of nuclear reactors(35 years old on average), which hasn&#x27;t increased in capacity for 20 years now. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s their plan when they will be forced to phase out some of the older units.<p><i>I’m very glad Poland and the Netherlands are actually planning to build nuclear power plants.</i><p>Well it&#x27;s not going to happen here because these plans were a vessel for corruption from the get go.<p>On the other hand solar is growing because it&#x27;s cheap and with two-way metering coupled with incentives homeowners have all the incentive they need to set up their own installations.')
