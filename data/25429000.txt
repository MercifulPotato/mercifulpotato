It might be slightly better now, but it&#x27;s not going to match the 20% or more of a modern photovoltaic system, which could be used to power electric vehicles instead (an ideal use of solar energy, because electric vehicles need batteries anyway so there&#x27;s no base load problem).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;cofco-sugar-ethanol&#x2F;cofco-expands-ethanol-capacity-in-brazil-sees-sugar-prices-flattened-idUSL2N27D0PK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;cofco-sugar-ethanol&#x2F;cofco-ex...</a>')
