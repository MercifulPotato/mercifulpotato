If we truly had freedom, it would be part of society, every government, the UN and considered a fundamental Human Right for individual groups of people to voluntarily group together and decide to &quot;leave&quot; their state&#x2F;nation&#x2F;entity&#x2F;vassal&#x2F;government&#x2F;faction, and form their own &quot;monopoly of violence&quot; within their geographic area.<p>But we don&#x27;t have that. We belong and are forced under subjugation to our individual governments without any say in the matter other than &quot;voting&quot; and &quot;community participation&quot;. We can dress it up any which way we want, but we&#x27;re forced into a relationship by virtue of birth and we have <i>no option</i> to leave.')
