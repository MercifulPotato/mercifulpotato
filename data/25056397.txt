After 8 months of people donating covid plasma, this doctor had no clue. It makes my blood boil thinking how many other people didn&#x27;t donate plasma because of this idiot-- I sent my wife back and told her to make a big fuss and ask for another doctor, who actually explained the idiot doctor my wife can absolutely donate plasma, they just ran different kind of tests, and my wife&#x27;s test result was more than likely meeting their own required antibody levels.<p>This was not a medical issue, it was a common sense issue -- if her test had a positive threshold level of 1.4 and she had a 4.9 result, how could this doctor not realize something was wrong with her requiring a value of &quot;80&quot;. Did she actually think that only Chuck Norris can donate covid plasma?<p>My psychiatrist bullshitted me about the mechanism of action of some meds she was prescribing (I knew because I looked them up as treatment options beforehand) -- she did prescribe the &quot;correct&quot; medicine as far as I remember, but she just did not know the correct mechanism of action.<p>The infectious dissease specialist in my hospital stay for COVID-19 told me the hydroxychloroquine she was giving me was a proven anti-viral medication that worked really well in their national acclaimed hospital.  Again, she was really clueless, she was just following protocol, she could at least have shut her mouth if she was clueless.  \nThey only gave hydroxychloroquine to otherwise healthy individuals because or cardiac issues the medicine was known to cause, OF COURSE those patients had really good outcomes, they were otherwise healthy, young individuals.<p>My wife is a dentist, she really likes her surgeon boss and his approach of telling patients the true odds of success of certain procedures and what to realistically expect out of them. But a lot of patients don&#x27;t like that. They want to hear the doctor has a 100% success rate with every procedure and that all his dental implants last a lifetime.<p>So part of the problem is the public that will choose a lying, perhaps clueless doctor with a god complex above an honest doctor that really knows his stuff and is honest and upfront with his patients.')
