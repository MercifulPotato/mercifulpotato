I’d start by looking at what they do and pull the parts that you like. Iterate from there.<p>Local teachers are somewhat overrated because you’re limited to what talent&#x2F;style is available within a small radius of where you live.<p>Khan Academy, for instance, was far better than what my public high school offered. Now there’s a wide array of educational resources on YouTube to supplement a curriculum. Even a single video can drive home a point that will be internalized for life. I can’t really say that about my public education.<p>Lastly, parent-lead homeschooling is better because you don’t have to worry about teachers sharing their political opinions as “facts”. This certainly happened to me and many of my colleagues growing up.')
