Also most vintage pro amps in excellent working condition or fully restored are more reliable than the cabinets, whose reliability mainly depended on how high it fell off the truck from.  You&#x27;re supposed to have spare guitars, cables &amp; strings anyway, plus tubes and an extension speaker to avoid show-stoppers if you only have one amp.<p>Transistor amps shouldn&#x27;t be turned on in direct sun either, but they can last quite a bit longer before expiration.<p>We had a very talented guitarist locally who had a great sounding Line 6 100 watt 2x12 which lasted a long time, but replaced by an older, longer-lasting Twin Reverb he regained a certain stonk that you could tell had an effect on the dance floor.')
