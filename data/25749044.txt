And don&#x27;t get me wrong. I was happy about the ban in this moment.<p>On the other hand I wouldn&#x27;t like to give all moderation power to private entities alone. If not opportune with current business model, company ethics are quickly changed (e.g. don&#x27;t be evil). As long as you have small decentralized shops and platforms that&#x27;s ok. With concentration of power a private company nearly acts like a utility. Maybe some kind of neutral and elected ethics committee could help large private platforms to maintain transparent and democratic standards. Would they have blocked him even earlier?')
