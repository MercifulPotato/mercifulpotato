Your proof is like some idiot writing Trump is an Alien Unicorn on a personal wordpress site then claiming mainstream news was calling Trump an Alien Unicorn.<p>&gt; No wonder you&#x27;re convinced of wild things.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m done with this level of dishonesty.<p>woah.<p>setting Taibbi aside, can you not see how news cycles were dominated by a &quot;Russian collusion&quot; narrative the first 3 years of Trump&#x27;s presidency? a narrative that largely proved to be exaggerated, false, and self-serving (it was great for business).<p>as recent as July of this year, the NYT published a story filled with anonymous sources and accusations of Russian bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan. within days, the media went into their typical &quot;blitz&quot; with this story and Joe Biden even had an ad ready to air in response to it. this story, like many others not only could not be corroborated by any mentioned parties, but proved to be &quot;less than conclusive&quot; and was later significantly walked back.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;russia-afghanistan-bounties.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;russia-afghan...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;u-s-officials-say-intel-russian-bounties-was-less-conclusive-n1233199" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;u-s-offic...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282646230779285504" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282646230779285504</a>')
