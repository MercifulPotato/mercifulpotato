I&#x27;m more lamenting the fact that there&#x27;s no good license for this (that I&#x27;m aware of, anyway).<p>&gt; As a small business, I would avoid these licenses as well because having multiple licenses kick in at different levels will be confusing and expensive. Iâ€™d rather use OSS or just buy commercial products.<p>You could just license it from the start and not have to worry about the license kicking in, though.')
