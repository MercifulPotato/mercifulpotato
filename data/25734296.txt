It&#x27;s a groupthink circle jerk. The difference, of course, is that &#x2F;r&#x2F;conservative is explicitly defined as a conservative community while &#x2F;r&#x2F;politics implies they are some sort of neutral community which they most certainly are not. At any rate, finding a diverse community of ideological people coming together to discuss politics with intellectual fervor is rather difficult these days. Part of the reason is the design of the software itself. HN does a better job of this than most because of very careful design choices and solid moderation. But if this could be accomplished for politics in general, I think it would be a good thing for society.')
