Item(by='freehunter', descendants=None, kids=[25088967], score=None, time=1605309007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25087798, text='I spent all day on my MacBook SSH’d into a remote Linux machine, does that mean the MacBook isn’t a general purpose computer? Does the ability to SSH into another machine mean your computer is not “general purpose”? Because he also used a lot of native apps in those posts. And if you want a local shell on iOS, like I said the app Blink will give you that.<p>You keep saying “many tablets can’t” but which ones? And why? Android and iOS can both be used as general purpose computers as I’ve mentioned. What other tablets are common enough but limited enough to make the distinction? You keep dodging this question and still pushing this complete falsehood even after you’ve been proven wrong. You’ve offered no proof or defense of your theory despite being asked directly and being proven wrong directly.<p>At least iPads and maybe android tablets let you rearrange windows although you don’t have to (which is the point). They let you “babysit” whatever that means, although you don’t have to. They let you back up your own data (my iPad backs up to OneDrive, not iCloud) although you don’t have to.<p>What is this “most tablets” when both Android and iPad allows you to do everything you’ve mentioned? Again... it sounds awfully like “I don’t want them to be computers so I’m going to claim they’re not” which was false when you first said it and now is starting to get pretty ridiculous as I keep showing you that you’re wrong.')
