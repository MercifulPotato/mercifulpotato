It&#x27;s surely true that Western governments use memes and similar content to convince people of things. Quite often they do so openly, with military ads and public health messages and such.<p>But China <i>dictates</i> public perception - in addition to sending messages, the government has full editorial control over all major social media platforms, and regularly intervenes to shut off discussion on any topic they&#x27;d prefer people not to hear about. It seems very unlikely Western governments are doing anything like that.')
