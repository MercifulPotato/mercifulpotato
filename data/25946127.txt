I’m sure it’s exhausting in many ways, and I know it’s basically a hobby. So despite my complaints I’m impressed and I love the concept. And I’ve noticed you are consistently responsive to users, despite this not being a job.<p>Pip installing QB usually leads to errors about missing or wrong Python QT libraries, and attempts to install those lead to other errors. I don’t expect you to deal with these problems; it’s what I’ve come to expect with large Python programs. Using a virtual env. did not solve the issues for me.<p>EDIT: or it will install, but then when I run it, I get an error about something missing or being the wrong version.<p>The nonworking video, I’m sure, is due to missing codecs.<p>“many ads and trackers are served from the visited page directly”<p>True, but the hosts file seems to catch most everything.')
