Especially scientists with their pet theories. I suppose it comes down to how people weight the evidence, they&#x27;re definitely biased toward weightings that support their favorite theory.<p>Just as I&#x27;m sure you are with your Hancock&#x27;s BS theory.<p>Is it really true that he&#x27;s only been peddling unsubstantiated stuff tho?<p>Didn&#x27;t he propose that the younger dryas ice age was caused by an impact, a claim later supported by more evidence, including nanodiamonds? I know the\ncause remains unsettled, but even if you read Wikipedia, which starts out saying the evidence for that is misinterpreted, it goes on to detail a bunch of solid sounding evidence. That&#x27;s there&#x27;s contention and ambiguity is not unusual for science, particularly such a speculative science as archaeology. But his proposal, at least, sounds neither crazy, nor appears to be unsubstantiated, as you claim.')
