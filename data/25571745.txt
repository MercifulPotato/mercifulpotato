I haven&#x27;t downvoted anyone in this thread BTW because I&#x27;ve been posting comments. When I post comments I prefer for them to stand as my input on the matter.<p>Most of the comments I&#x27;m seeing down voted seem to me to be somewhat extreme invective lacking in significant useful or interesting content. The bottom line is HN is about high signal low noise. Most of the downvotes are probably just on that criterion.<p>Another issue is that most of the people reading HN, including those vilifying Apple, probably own several dozen items manufactured in China. It seems somewhat unlikely that they can account for their supply chains in any meaningful way. There&#x27;s also the mob rule aspect to all of this, it wouldn&#x27;t be the first time &#x27;evidence&#x27; had been found of Apple or their suppliers playing foul that turned out to be fake. Look up Mike Daisey some time. So lets all take some deep breaths and look at what&#x27;s actually going on here.')
