I used to be in the camp that money was basically all that was necessary to drive an election. Trump&#x27;s campaign proved me wrong. The establishment did everything they could to discredit him. He spent basically half the money as his competitor. He still won.<p>I think money is still a problem in politics, but I think the model that money is the driving contributor is too simple.<p>As an aside, “neither” is an option in the U.S. but too many people have been convinced a third party vote is equivalent to throwing their vote away and thus it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy')
