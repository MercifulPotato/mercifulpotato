Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25817299], score=None, time=1610928906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815713, text='&gt; That ties the duration of a patent directly to how much value it provides to the company over time<p>Actually I think that idea causes the opposite of what is wanted.<p>A high value monopoly patent will stay locked up for a long time, well after the development costs and risk have been paid off. The consumer is paying high economic rent and the product has less supply.<p>A low value product is where a longer patent makes sense: the patent gives the inventor time to recoup their costs which otherwise wouldn’t happen.<p>That said, the world runs at a much faster pace, and patent durations should be decreased.<p>Software patents should be discarded (because society doesn’t get any value from publishing software patents although society pays high costs for the economic monopoly, and because small startups cannot compete with software behemoths). Unlikely to happen becaus software powers have monopoly profits which can pay to influence legislation or regulators. Also the US is capturing monopoly payments from the rest of the world so the US loves software patents (ironically given some of the historic reasons for the US kicking the British in the nads for independence).')
