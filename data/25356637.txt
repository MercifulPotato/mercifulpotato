In Spotify&#x27;s defence- they are actually really good at digging up old, unknown stuff that I really like. (I say all this as an ex-professional musician who spent far too much time flicking through vinyl in second hand record stores in his youth.)<p>Its not as if 80% of the music on Spotify is offensively terrible, its just that its not good enough to buy, and therefore it should come as no surprise that 80% of artists make less than Â£200 a year.')
