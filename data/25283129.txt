And it works for multiple people at the same time (unlike ones based on eye tracking) and it doesn&#x27;t require you to be standing in front at a specific position (unlike stereo screens).<p>However the one limitation I had in the landscape version is the effect is only horizontal because it works like the lenticular printed holograms you&#x27;d get as a kid.<p>But for something that sits on your desk or in a storefront, you don&#x27;t really look up and down the screen, so people don&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s only horizontal.')
