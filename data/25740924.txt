If everyone was just buying securities a microsecond vs a millisecond might not matter much. What happens is a lot of HFTs act as market makers. They arbitrage positions <i>they</i> create which screws over any non-HFTs. It also moves the price of securities for no reason which affects everyone holding that security. There&#x27;s also been plenty of cases of HFTs doing front-running and spoofing.<p>The effects of HFTs aren&#x27;t limited to HFT vs traditional traders. Their artificial arbitrage affects people&#x27;s retirement funds and the like. It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if they were just making money off other traders but instead they&#x27;re making money off everyone with money in the markets.')
