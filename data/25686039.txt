That peg has never ever been demonstrated (publicly).<p>All the other &quot;pegs&quot; are just cash trading. If I trade USDT&#x2F;USD on Binance...I don&#x27;t actually have USD. Even on that pair, my USD profit&#x2F;loss are denominated in USDT.<p>For anyone who disagrees with the above - please show me market where I can go sell my USDT directly for USD.')
