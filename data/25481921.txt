I guess it comes down to the question if a large enough portion of consumers actually know and care about this stuff and would be willing to reward a more open&#x2F;honest approach enough to actually keep a business running. It might ultimately mean that consumers would have to reward a site&#x2F;channel that doesn&#x27;t actually review product X - kind of hard to make a living on that when most revenue ist ad&#x2F;click based. There might be smaller outlets&#x2F;youtube channels that do exactly that and use patreon or similar support channels but the bigger sites apparently don&#x27;t want to bet on that.\nThere was some sort of attempt by consumers to highlight these issues a few years ago but that was completely curbstomped by the gamergate shitshow.')
