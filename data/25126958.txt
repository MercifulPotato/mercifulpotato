Item(by='Liron', descendants=None, kids=[25127538], score=None, time=1605635559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25126223, text='&gt; Because of the halting issue you cannot summarise reality into a set of axioms and rules<p>Conway&#x27;s Game of Life is a kind of reality summarized into axioms and rules, and most likely our universe&#x2F;multiverse is on track to being similarly summarized. The halting issue doesn&#x27;t get in the way of that achievement...<p>Once you have the intuition for why the Halting Problem (i.e. fortune teller paradox) is obvious, then Godel&#x27;s proof is just an XSS attack on axiom systems whose designers think they&#x27;re only &quot;about numbers&quot;, like how CSS is designed to be about styling but it&#x27;s also Turing-complete and vulnerable to XSS.<p>Russel and Whitehead were trying to simultaneously (1) invent a system capable of proving highly insightful claims about the infinite space of numbers, like &quot;there doesn&#x27;t exist a number between 1 and infinity with property P&quot; but (2) not a system that can encode a Turing-equivalent agent that creates paradoxes if it tries to predict its own future.<p>Godel was just the first to point out that condition (2) was already met just by supporting Peano Arithmetic, the same way a modern computer science undergrad can point out that CSS is Turing-complete or your regex-based HTML validator is vulnerable to XSS attacks.')
