It certainly seems like a very arbitrary condition. Basically I&#x27;m familiar with two definitions:<p>1. The abstract idea of writing an algorithm that supports a variety of types. This allows for casting, reflection, dynamic typing, etc.<p>2. The specific idea of a type system that allows for parameterized types (aka &quot;typesafe generics&quot;). This definition excludes castng, reflection, and dynamic typing.<p>Typically &quot;typesafe generics&quot; is what people talk about when they discuss &quot;generics&quot;, but since you chose to pick the &quot;dynamically typed languages are generic&quot; nit, I assumed you were talking about (1).')
