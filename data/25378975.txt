Is PornHub liable because couple users sneaked something that is illegal? Or is there something we are not aware of and PornHub engaged in it? There is no information on that.<p>If it is the case that only minority of users are responsible then Youtube is likewise liable and Mastercard should stop serving Youtube knowing that at any point in time Youtube has some users that have illegal content.<p>It is different to stop payments for illegal activity and stopping payments to a large corporation that has huge user base that has some users engaging in illegal activity.<p>If it is ok to do that then practically no current large company that has large user base could be served by payment organizations.')
