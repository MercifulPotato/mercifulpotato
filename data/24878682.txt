Fossil fuel lobbies are just too powerful. Carbon taxes are mostly weak or non existent. It&#x27;s the species level way of saying &quot;why don&#x27;t you just give up smoking?&quot;. Not that easy.<p>Yet it is apparently possible to make solar + wind + storage + demand shifting energy cost competitive even without subsidies and <i>very</i> competitive with subsidies. The fossil fuel industry hasn&#x27;t managed to shut it down. Species level nicorette patches.<p>One day we&#x27;ll be able to tax the shit out of fossil fuels - once it is a nearly dead industry without much political muscle. By then it probably won&#x27;t matter, though.')
