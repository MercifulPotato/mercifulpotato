I am taking issue with his general style. Also, I am not taking issue with him not givig break to some people.<p>He is not equal opportunity hit everyone kind of writer. He has friends and ennemies, gives massive benefit of doubt to ones and &quot;attack&quot; others. That would not be unusual, but it ridiculous to then frame him as fair one.<p>I stopped reading him when I realized the jokes and insults based on made up things or insinuations that someone is ugly and general crap are  more memorablable then his actual arguments. He is dismissive in funny way,  but he is dismissing straw man all too often or just not actually having any argument beyond insult.<p>I would rather remember latter then former.')
