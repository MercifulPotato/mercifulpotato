This is really different to how I as a physicist might use equations to express ideas to other physicists, and if I can&#x27;t exactly formalize what the equation means that isn&#x27;t always relevant.<p>This is of course an unorthodox way to frame what programmers do, but I think it&#x27;s relevant to your last comment. What is a good foundation for formal systems is an empirical question, and empirically, type theory is extremely important to programmers. Set theory not at all.')
