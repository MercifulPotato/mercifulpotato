Computers are great because we can control everything about them. Now we&#x27;re not allowed to do so anymore, because the manufacturers said so. And, since a computer today is likely connected to the internet, control is more important than ever. Because if you&#x27;re not in control, then who is?<p>&gt; I have a hard time figuring out why I’m so uncomfortable with Apple’s decision here.<p>Maybe because they, like most other tech companies, go on and on about security and privacy while time and time again showing they do not actually give one single fuck whatsoever about it?<p>&gt; choose between a computer secured against Apple or one where you are secured against others<p>Not quite sure I follow you.
