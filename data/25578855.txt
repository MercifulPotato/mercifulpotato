Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609305770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578805, text='<i>&gt; &quot;Scientific work should be judged on the basis of scientific merit, independent of the researcher&#x27;s identity or personal views&quot;</i><p>Yes, I get what the writers of the letter <i>say</i> they are arguing for. I&#x27;m just not buying it.<p>What is this &quot;scientific merit&quot;? What it turns out to mean, on closer inspection, is &quot;consensus of people who have scientific credentials in the applicable fields&quot;. Which is just as much of an &quot;artificial social construct&quot; as the BS they are complaining about.<p>In other words, the problem is actually much <i>worse</i> than these letter writers realize. As I said: the problem is not that a bunch of &quot;unbelievers&quot; who just want to decide things rationally are fighting against religious zealots. The problem is that <i>all of the sides who are fighting are religious zealots</i>--just of different religious sects. In science, for example, <i>nobody</i> is fighting for &quot;scientific merit is judged by predictive track record, and nothing else--if your theory makes wrong predictions it is wrong, period, no matter how many credentials you have or how many papers you have published or how many other scientists agree with you&quot;.<p>Note that this is not directly articulated in the letter either; but if you look at how science is being done today, including the science these letter writers are doing, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll see. At least, that&#x27;s what I see.')
