It is like a very ambitious Deus Ex.<p>I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to word this that doesn&#x27;t sound smarmy, but I feel like this style of game is not what your everyday gamer was expecting. It is reasonably complex, has morale choices and the combat is frankly lack lustre and more about the numbers. It plays much more like a 90s&#x2F;2000s RPG than a more simplified modern action RPG, clunkiness included.<p>For the reasons above I quickly forgive the clunkiness and bugs because what the game is offering is rare in AAA games these days.')
