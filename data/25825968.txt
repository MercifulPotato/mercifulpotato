It&#x27;s actually, probably better &quot;bang for the buck,&quot; although it won&#x27;t seem like it, on the surface.<p>The reason is that all those <i>little</i> things that go into high quality take <i>lots</i> of time.<p>I can write a pretty complete app that does some cool stuff in a day or two. I do it often, when I write test harnesses for my libraries and whatnot.<p>However, if you want that app to be ship quality, and highly usable, you&#x27;re looking at over a month.<p>The thing is, many folks would consider my test harness lash-ups to be their &quot;shipping&quot; product, and will use that as a basis for estimation.')
