And the experts will quickly grow tired of answering the same question since chat interface isn&#x27;t easily discoverable.  This will lead to experts slowly abandoning the community.<p>I haven&#x27;t been on the Rust server but I&#x27;d guess that one reason it&#x27;s useful is because your typical Rust developer already knows how to code and isn&#x27;t a complete newbie.  So you end up having conversation between seasoned developers who know how to read docs and can figure out basic syntax on their own.')
