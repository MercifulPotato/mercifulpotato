You can be blackmailed for being gay, or for having a serious medical condition that&#x27;s undisclosed. Neither of those situations is a &quot;well just don&#x27;t do that&quot; kind of thing.<p>The defense against blackmail is to make blackmail difficult (eg release DKIM keys), severely punish people who engage in blackmail, and guard your secrets effectively.<p>&gt; This is like saying don&#x27;t lock your doors so that nobody can break and enter into your house.<p>This is like saying the latch on your fence is a security mechanism. Nobody intended that fence latch to keep your safe or secure and hiding behind it won&#x27;t make you safer. Rip away the false pretense.')
