Marketers expect ever-more precise targeting to get better CPCs&#x2F;CPAs&#x2F;ROAS. This is especially true as an ad platform becomes more popular and CPMs naturally rise due to increased competition in the auction. When a company like FB&#x2F;GOOG innovates in the ad targeting&#x2F;measurement space every company will follow suit because their customers (advertisers) are going to ask for it. I believe market forces will continue to drive innovation in ads targeting until someone steps in and draws a line in the sand (eg regulation via the governement).')
