To avoid echo chambers.<p>Unless you are suggesting we ban all moderation, no echo chambers form due to selecting information sources you only agree with and information sources pandering<p>&gt; Even if private censorship is allowed, that doesn&#x27;t make it a good idea if it causes people to leave for some Voat-like cesspool where they won&#x27;t encounter ordinary people anymore.<p>censorship at least gets rid of the non true believers, the reason stuff like qanon spread so quickly is because they used sites like facebook and twitter and didnt stay in cesspools like 8chan, we cant get everyone but most is better than none')
