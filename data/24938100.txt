Once mass migrations and food shortages start, and starving migrants show up at the borders of higher-latitude&#x2F;elevation countries in amounts orders of magnitude larger than before, what do you think will happen? Will these countries, worrying about how to feed their own citizens as crops fail due to weather anomalies, open up the borders and accept doubling their population? Will the migrants just accept being refused to enter? In the meantime, powers will be jockeying for mining rights of newly-unfrozen, but still not habitable lands. With all that pressure mounting, how long it&#x27;ll take until someone starts shooting, someone else shoots back, and we&#x27;ll have a WW3 on our hands?<p>If climate situation degrades fast enough, we&#x27;ll wipe ourselves out way before the changing weather does.')
