This is why they complain.<p>Companies like Google make billions on ads. A overwhelming majority of Googles income is from ads. It isn&#x27;t just that Google served new markets or that publishers outsourced the work.<p>Ad systems use a bidding system. Google controls both sides of the bidding system. The system is setup in a way where Google has benefited more than others.<p>It reminds me of record labels and producers. They make the lions share of the money on record sales for most albums and music. The artists typically get a small share. Some artists have walk away with a medium income will selling millions of albums and having the label&#x2F;producers making millions.<p>The lower income to publishers has caused them to do more shock and awe type articles that aren&#x27;t good for us. They pay more inexperienced people less so there is less mentoring. Overall it means the quality of the published stuff has gone downhill.')
