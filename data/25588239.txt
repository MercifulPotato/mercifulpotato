This is pretty essential for any networked application where latency is critical, like voice and video and fast-paced multiplayer games.<p>As other commenters have noted, it&#x27;s a royal pain in the ass to set up WebRTC if all you want is UDP-style communication between a server and browser, since you need to wrangle half a dozen other protocols in the process.<p>However! A new API, WebTransport[1], is actively being developed that will offer a WebSockets-like (read: super simple to set up) API for UDP-style communication. I am extremely excited about it and its potential for real-time browser-based multiplayer games (which I&#x27;m working on).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;w3c&#x2F;webtransport" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;w3c&#x2F;webtransport</a>')
