People protesting against election fraud, aren&#x27;t.\nIf your idea of stability is the opression of the unprivelidge, then you are part of the problem.\nThis is exactly why corrupt government call protesters anarchists, so middle class people wouldn&#x27;t mind opression as long as there&#x27;s stability.
