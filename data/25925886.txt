These building blocks also being generally widely used, battle tested and more reliable than in house implementations.<p>* the development of OSS which drastically increase the accessibility of the previously mentioned building blocks to developers.<p>Both technically and methodologically, software development has seen tons of improvements since the late 90ies, early 2000.')
