In the few instances it has, these integrations saw little maintenance and were eventually removed. This makes some amount of sense with how rocky third-party APIs can be[1][2]. Generally, it&#x27;s easier for both ends when service providers write their own integration for a given platform.<p>As an aside, the timeline given by Spotify is somewhat disingenuous because it doesn&#x27;t include any of the times that APIs were opened up and is missing significant details about <i>why</i> rejections happened â€” for instance, early watchOS rejections (as far as I recall) had to do with the lack of a power efficient streaming API in watchOS. Once Apple had a streaming solution that was fit for public consumption (internal&#x2F;private APIs almost always <i>aren&#x27;t</i> and cleaning them up takes time), they added it to watchOS.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think iOS would be better if it opened up a little, but Spotify is no saint and has a tendency to embellish the story.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jod.al&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;guide-to-poor-api-management&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jod.al&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;guide-to-poor-api-management&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;circuitbreaker&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2&#x2F;6&#x2F;16979102&#x2F;spotify-ends-support-speakers-receivers-pioneer-denon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;circuitbreaker&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2&#x2F;6&#x2F;16979102&#x2F;sp...</a>')
