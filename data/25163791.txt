For an increase in total CO2 production, despite a slightly better CO2&#x2F;MW rating due to moving from coal to NG.<p>No one AFAIK, has managed to get their &quot;green&quot; energy solutions down to the levels france was in the 1980&#x27;s, despite the increases in cost that come with not only having to build energy production, but 2-3x the production in storage.<p>The day its actually cheaper to put solar on your average house with a tesla power wall will be the day there is a shitton of home equity loans being taken out to do so. Or for that matter people knocking on everyones door offering to do it for &quot;free&quot; to sell the power back to the grid.<p>Right now most of the green energy solutions are &quot;inexpensive&quot; because they are being supported by natural gas generators.
