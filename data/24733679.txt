IMO the fact that is 3%, 30% or 99% is irrelevant . What is important is that Apple uses it&#x27;s dominance to remove choice from  users.<p>I am sorry if fanboy will hurt someone feeling, but if  for example:\nGoogle (or Apple) would have a new rule that if you want your website to be opened in Chrome(or Safari) and not marked as malware you have to include Google Pay(or Apple Pay) and remove the Visa&#x2F;PayPal and all the other payment options and some person would say &quot;this is exactly what we wanted, no more choices - force everyone to a Google(or Apple ) tax , this choices are overwhelming my poor brain then tell me the correct adjective to describe this person that thinks removing choice and forcing the big coorporation way is the best thing.')
