You can&#x27;t say &quot;I have concept &lt;x&gt; which is made of core components &lt;y&gt; and corner cases &lt;z&gt;&quot; in one breath and then in the next say &quot;&lt;x&gt; is unambiguous without looking at &lt;z&gt;&quot; and unless you have a concept that depends on nothing else for it&#x27;s construction this applies recursively as well.<p>E.g. &quot;murder is always illegal&quot; is not true and a bad law&#x2F;take on the concept. Expanding the law to include &quot;murder is always illegal except when... &lt;other laws&gt;&quot; is only unambiguous if &lt;other laws&gt; are unambiguous. I don&#x27;t think I need to take it further to explain justifiable homicide isn&#x27;t unambiguously black and white or always possible to rule on without looking at intent of the various laws and what happened.<p>Bringing that back to the original thing this is true of any concept or law, including reviewing some remote apps and not others based on what they are for not that they are remote. I&#x27;m not saying I agree the way Apple regulates these is good I&#x27;m just saying I agree the fact some remote apps are regulated and others aren&#x27;t isn&#x27;t proof alone the regulation is contradictory.')
