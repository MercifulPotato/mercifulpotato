Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605478780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104945, text='You reason why you think the book is not worth reading, which is fine with me. Reasoning why other people should not read the book is fine as well. As far as I&#x27;m concerned you&#x27;re free to picket in front of the book store with a sign &quot;don&#x27;t buy this book&quot;, all of this falls under freedom of expression which is - barring illegal actions - a given as far as I&#x27;m concerned. What is not OK is to call for a book to be banned so others can not read it even if they want to. There are many books out there which espouse ideas which I do not hold with but I will not call for them to be banned.<p>I will not go too far into the whole &#x27;trans issue&#x27; since that is a minefield which can not be negotiated without having a current map which is likely to try to send me ways I&#x27;d rather not tread. What little experience I have with the phenomenon tells me that people who were &#x27;born in the wrong body&#x27; just want to be accepted for what they are without being forced into a cheerleader role for a team. The book - which I have heard about, having listened to several interviews with the author as well as having read Douglas Murray&#x27;s &quot;The Madness of Crowds&quot; - calls for caution in performing irreversible operations on children, something which I whole-heartedly support. As far as I know - from having listened to the author as well as several others lecturing on the subject - the large majority of children who present as &#x27;trans&#x27; end up as gay or lesbian, at ease in their own bodies. To me this makes it clear that a call for caution needs to be heard, given the irreversibility of sex change operations and the negative effects of puberty blockers.')
