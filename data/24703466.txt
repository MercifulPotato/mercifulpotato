The only danger is if people don&#x27;t have the originals for reference and think that details in the &quot;enhanced&quot; versions (that might be completely artificial) have more reality than they do; I don&#x27;t think the historians have a gripe if promoting these colorized, upsampled versions is done in a way that also promotes the originals.')
