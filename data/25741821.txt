Even with [some] people&#x27;s buy-in for reinventing the social experience that is the web, I don&#x27;t see the lean-mean profit-hyperfocused machines of the current social experience making room out of solidarity.\nStill, I want to hold the opinion that the payoff would be big for those who succeeded in meeting that challenge, so I want to also hold the opinion that folks are going to give this challenge a go in the coming years.<p>Edit: Regarding the question if I think its possible: I think innovation is a key, and I think that a big number of folks love taking moonshots, so I expect that people will attempt to tackle this and I think there is a lot of potential for surprising advances in this direction. I hold the opinion that joining a team tackling something like this is energizing for a lot of people.')
