Like nipples are the end of the world, but selling anything from cars to hamburgers with sexy women is A-OK. Just paste a sticker on the nipples at least, then it&#x27;s fine. Cheerleaders, boxing ring sign holding girls etc. etc.<p>In contrast, the European things you mention, like bathing and saunas and beaches are not about drooling over bodies, but just being normally without clothes, often among family. Not sexually.<p>I think these need to be distinguished. Sexuality isn&#x27;t equal to nudity.')
