Besides some minor bugs this game streams flawless in 4k to my Mac (which technically isn&#x27;t even a supported platform for the game, but is for Stadia). I bought the game during last weeks promotion with a free Chromecast Ultra and controller, so I would have at least had some hardware for cheap should the game itself suck, but the game is fun as well. I also no longer have any doubt that streamed gaming has a future and am actually looking forward to 5G coverage so I can play on mobile.')
