There had to be a time when that was not true, because as you go back earlier in time, if that continued back far enough it would mean the diameter of the universe was negative.  That&#x27;s clearly absurd.<p>But that leaves you with all this mass, inside the Chandrasekhar limit, but the universe <i>not</i> expanding faster than the speed of light.  And then it starts expanding.<p>All this presumes that time can be thought of as extending back before the big bang, which I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s actually a valid idea.<p>I have heard the claim that the laws of general relativity allow for a <i>white</i> hole as well - a singularity from which things go out, instead of things going in.  That may be an accurate picture, or at least a decent model.')
