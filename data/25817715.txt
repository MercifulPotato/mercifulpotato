Everyone who cooks efficiently is constantly switching between tasks, since you&#x27;re often waiting a few minutes before your next cooking step can occur. Maybe in a professional restaurant where your role is defined, then no, don&#x27;t switch roles.<p>But in your own kitchen? While my toast is toasting, you know I&#x27;m going to get a head start on the dishes, or chop those garnishes, or check in on a second dish, etc. If I cooked by focusing solely on each task until it&#x27;s done, I&#x27;d probably use 50-100% more time to do the same job maybe 10% better.')
