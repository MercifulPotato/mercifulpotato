I use it for occasional white noise when I am working. I enjoy their content, and wish there was more of it.<p>It&#x27;s okay to consume media in moderation. Netflix, flying a kite, fishing, game night with friends, and so on. If that is all one does, it interferes with Maslow&#x27;s other needs.<p>I don&#x27;t see a need to go to battle against Netflix, however, but perhaps teaching discipline and moderation in schools would be beneficial to society as a whole.<p>Sam Harris had a recent podcast episode on this topic. The discussant brought up the interesting point that cost of binging has decreased. Economics 101 would suggest that if we were rational and preferred more show consumption that we will consume more. A handy heuristic. So, if you personally find your consumption is too high relative to your production, their suggestion was to increase the costs to consume.')
