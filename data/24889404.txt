They were thinking mostly in terms of factories. Thinking of &quot;barriers to entry&quot; in terms of fixed&#x2F;marginal costs makes a different kind of sense for factories.<p>You can&#x27;t pay an $nbn &quot;fixed cost&quot; price to &quot;build a fb.&quot; That&#x27;s like the old outsourcing joke&#x2F;prank: Job: <i>Build me an app that makes $1m. Will pay $10k.</i> It also isn&#x27;t factory unit economics that determines success for a Google, FB or many other modern mega-businesses. Owning 1% of fb&#x27;s social media traffic does not yield 1% of fb or adwords&#x27; revenue. It&#x27;s more of a &quot;rewards to scale&quot; than an &quot;economies of scale&quot; thing. Revenue goes up. Unit cost may go down, but that&#x27;s besides the point for fb or adwords ad revenues. The scale itself matters, not the savings it generates.<p>TLDR: trying to examine google&#x27;s anatomy using a model based on Bell or Ford circa 1929 will result in confusing questions.<p>Meanwhile, monopolies have a logic of their own. They&#x27;re valuable, and therefore worth paying to have. That&#x27;s how deals like this should be viewed, imo. It&#x27;s strong circumstantial evidence of monopoly. The deal, in itself, shouldn&#x27;t be the object of objection.')
