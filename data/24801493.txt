Copyright gives fairly comprehensive control over use, however trying to draw a line somewhere down full-control, attribution or no control seems very hard.<p>As it is today you can use your full control to allow full use with attribution. Of course the &quot;unfairness&quot; probably comes from the fact that you can&#x27;t force others to do the same.<p>In my opinion the best option is to keep copyright at &quot;full control&quot; with a time limit. Probably 10-20 years. However that doesn&#x27;t solve your desire for only attribution.')
