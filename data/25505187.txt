Or even cheaper, if you have a desk facing a wall... there&#x27;s no light source, so turn it around or face a window.<p>Failing improved lighting fixing it... you need a good sensor and a lens that lets in a lot of light, especially if you are going to be in a poorly lit space.<p>Sony produced the absolutely perfect form factor for this... <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sony.co.uk&#x2F;electronics&#x2F;interchangeable-lens-cameras&#x2F;ilce-qx1-body-kit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sony.co.uk&#x2F;electronics&#x2F;interchangeable-lens-came...</a><p>It&#x27;s basically a sensor in a minimal body that you can mount a standard lens on and then place on a tripod (which opens up any mount &#x2F; arm thing).<p>Why then is it not popular?<p>It came too early, and wasn&#x27;t quite ready for always streaming video... both the software in this older revision and the hardware have issues (cooling the sensor for constant video is the problem here as it wasn&#x27;t anticipated to be used to stream for 10+ hours per day and struggles beyond 30 minutes as I understand). Additionally it only has a micro-USB connection, no HDMI or USB-C... and it really needs a single USB-C that can both power and handle the video. Things it doesn&#x27;t need: battery or flash - but I guess keeping them means it plausibly could be a stills camera if needed.<p>If that format included the equivalent of the Elgato CamLink HDMI to USB-C device and priced around $300 then I think it would be a wild success. The BOM suggests this is possible.<p>Sony already have a lot of the pro-streaming market along with Panasonic, but if Sony made a specialist product for home streaming then I would buy it instantly... as it would liberate my a7rii from the job.')
