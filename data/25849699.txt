Is there no data for South Carolina, or do cicadas prefer not to visit that state? Perhaps the website says somewhere, but I didn&#x27;t go down that rabbit hole.<p>I noticed this because Alabama is not listed as one of the 15 states, despite being nearly surrounded by cicada observations. And I know from experience that the northern part of the state gets swarmed with cicadas when they emerge.')
