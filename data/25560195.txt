Item(by='Mc91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609171192, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558587, text='&gt; there are still over three times as many apartments currently listed for rent in San Francisco than there were at the same time last year with an overall vacancy rate thatâ€™s ticked up to around 10 percent (and climbing).<p>In terms of prices, rent is &quot;sticky&quot; whereas the price of something like apples is not.  Meaning if apples are not selling, the price is cut quickly.  Rent prices go down slower, but high vacancies and high supply are a leading indicator that prices will go down more.')
