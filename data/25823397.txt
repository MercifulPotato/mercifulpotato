The Osram&#x27;s i gave in and tried (albeit at 40w equivalent and dimmable) had a green&#x2F;yellow-ish tint that i despised.<p>Recently accidentally picked up ikea&#x27;s tradfris (zigbee bulbs, dimmable (but not with dimmer), multi-white) and have gone on a zigbee spree after that. I hope they last.')
