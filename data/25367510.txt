I had a job in software development and due to very bad circumstances I haven&#x27;t had work in a very long time and close to running out of money. I live in the US and do not qualify for unemployment pay.<p>One thing I have lost is the ability to pay for internet other than whatever I get through my phone. This data connection is really throttled when I tether it through my PC and it&#x27;s pretty frustrating to do anything online with it. I thank sites like HN still exist which sip bandwidth. My slow connection is barely just passable for Reddit, and resource heavy websites like LinkedIn and several job web apps fail to load half of the time. Bad requests and timeouts become common. I&#x27;m also a member of a Slack group of professionals which is actually very helpful for people in my field to network and share job resources, which now I unfortunately cannot access because it takes forever to load.<p>Most shops and cafe public areas are closed due to Covid making it hard to use a public Wifi.<p>How do people navigate the web to look for jobs efficiently on a slow connection, when basically everything in my field is done online? Anyone else faced a similar situation and is it possible to fix without just throwing money at it (which I don&#x27;t have)? I can&#x27;t find anything locally about public assistance for decent internet service when job searching greatly depends on it.')
