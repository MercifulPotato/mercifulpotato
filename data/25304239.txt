I add just about everything I generate or want to record to Evernote, in one big &quot;notebook&quot;, and then I extensively use tagging to make sure everything is findable. I try to use every tag I might ever search for, for which this note would be relevant.<p>Sometimes I add content to existing notes, if they are relevant and include the same family of concepts. I often merge notes; e.g., I save all my tweets to Evernote via IFTTT, and then merge all of them for each given month.<p>I often add notes with no tagging at all, and I have a shortcut to search for notes with no tags, as a sort of inbox.<p>The ability to search everything at once is the key: I can search &quot;movies&quot; or &quot;startup&quot; or &quot;medicine&quot; and find everything with those tags, or those words in the title or text, or even in PDFs. (I use a Fuji ScanSnap to scan documents into Evernote, with fully searchable text.)<p>The biggest feature I wish for is transcription of voice notes or audio files, so the content would be searchable.<p>Evernote&#x27;s Mac app is notoriously slow, but it&#x27;s gotten better over the years. I still don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t make it as fast as the web app.')
