Pulling 9+ Gs, trying to sustain that for more than a second or two, isnt really possible in the vast majority of situations.  The air is only so thick at a given altitude.  The wings can only be so big before structural issues dominate.<p>And remember too that the whole dogfighting concept, the getting behind the other guy for a tail shot, means less and less in a world of all-aspect missiles that can fire in almost any direction.')
