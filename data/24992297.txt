Overhead is high compared to C. You don&#x27;t have low-level access to things like NaN-packing and you also don&#x27;t have a JIT available at runtime to speed things up.<p>In many cases it&#x27;s fast enough, but if you really need to write code in a different language that&#x27;s both fast on a CPU-bound task and interoperates well with Go packages, a better approach might be to write a compiler that generates Go code.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a weak point, but for a specialized use case. Most code is either not that performance sensitive or can be written to operate on homogenous arrays.')
