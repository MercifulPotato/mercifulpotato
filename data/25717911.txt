That&#x27;s all there has to be to it... fussing over how you season it and then throwing whatever food in there seems a little silly.<p>I cook a great deal and once in a while it&#x27;s time to scrape down (often because I made a big mess in the pan) the cast iron pan and &#x27;start over&#x27;.<p>My starting over just means ...
