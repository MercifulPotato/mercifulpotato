I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just an equivalence. I&#x27;ve always been fine when looking around for a domain and one is taken but it&#x27;s being used productively. The thing that feels annoying is finding a domain where the only thing it&#x27;s being used for is as an advertisement for itself. It feels kinda like coming across a billboard that says &quot;advertise here!&quot;.<p>The economist in me had to struggle to remember that if the prices are smart, it will lead to allocative efficiency. But it still feels a little ugly.')
