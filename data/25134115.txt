Santander does charge for unexpectedly going into the red I believe but SBanken just charges you interest on overdrafts up to 5000 NOK&#x2F; 500 EU).  SBanken also makes a little money managing the little I have invested in funds.<p>Santander is making money out of me because I am resident in Norway it doesn&#x27;t pay interest unless you are resident in the UK')
