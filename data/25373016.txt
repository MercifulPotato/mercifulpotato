A free market does not distinguish between the need for people to drink and the need for a billionaire to fill his pool with freshwater in a drought.<p>This can extend beyond non-survival needs to societal needs. Society &quot;needs&quot; educated workers who can contribute to the economy. Society &quot;needs&quot; you to be connected to other workers either physically or electronically.<p>Public ownership allows us to address concerns that would not be appropriate to be driven primarily by profit motive. Typically we see this in the form of services rather than the direct transfer of physical goods. Most people believe communities in remote regions should have similar access to utility networks and transport, the ongoing cost of providing these typically outweighs the revenue that could be charged, so the state steps in.<p>The fire service is a fairly universal example of a service that should not be driven by profit motive and we have good records of the damage that occurs when they are. The military would be another, it is not in society&#x27;s best interest if your primary form of defense is willing to work for whoever will pay it the most.<p>&gt; And what are the limits of these benefits, so that they only apply to important goods? Why wouldn&#x27;t we want even goods of lesser importance enjoy these benefits?<p>Current governance can be inflexible, it usually requires taking everyone&#x27;s viewpoint into account to minimise the risk of failure or of being viewed as misspending public funds. Our solution to this at the moment is to allow private enterprise to operate in the areas where the extraction of profit is likely to cause minimal harm. This increases choice but the downside is that it introduces a huge amount of inefficiency and waste.')
