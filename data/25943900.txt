Tesla has accomplished putting together the best mass market electric vehicle and selling it for a profit (with government incentives, albeit). There are a LOT of people who can figure out panel gaps. There are not a lot of people who can figure out how to make the economics and supply chain for electric cars work. The fact that they haven&#x27;t made that a priority speaks to Tesla&#x27;s priorities, not their abilities.')
