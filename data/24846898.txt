The project is maybe 3 years old.<p>InfluxDB is more recent and quite limited. Things like sharding is not supported and they stated it would never be supported except in a paid edition when they make one.<p>Prometheus is more recent. Similar story with scaling. They changed storage formats and rewrote once or twice in the past few years, it&#x27;s moving really fast. It&#x27;s more of a standalone product for server metrics (node exporter + prometheus + grafana), wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use as a general purpose database.')
