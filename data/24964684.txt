Improvement by factors of two or ten are commonplace, relying on details of how modern machines are implemented, and often lately by farming work out to multiple cores or to GPU cores.<p>Speed of the code is getting increasingly important as memory and storage sizes grow while clock speed stubbornly does not. Until Dennard scaling died, code got faster just by waiting. Now, making code faster takes work.')
