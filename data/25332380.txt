Standard QM seems to build its Hilbert space of wave functions from functions over R^3N. It has a Hamiltonian built out of the notions of that space. So configuration space seems pretty crucial. But configuration of what? If you say particles with positions do not exist, then what exactly is the relevance of this space? What is the primitive stuff whose behavior can be right or wrong from our perspective?<p>It is also odd to say that position cannot be measured. We can tell in an experiment whether something ended up over there or over here. It would be reasonable to then try to have a theory that correlates the position measurements with something that has a position. Now it is not necessarily the case that there has to be such a thing, but it seems like a reasonable first step.<p>We can even see trails of particles in cloud chambers and the like. Why is that an IPU?<p>I will grant that it does not have to be the case that the only possible explanation is that of particles with position. But it certainly seems like if there is such a theory (and, of course, there is), then it would seem reasonable to consider it as quite plausible.<p>It also helps to ask you what is real in your theory. Are wave functions real? They certainly can&#x27;t be measured in their entirety. Are operators the real thing? We don&#x27;t measure them, but rather get something close to their eigenvectors&#x2F;eigenvalues. Are those real?<p>Many worlds is the closest version with nothing added, but even that requires some kind of mass density function to make explicit connection with our lived experience. While it doesn&#x27;t add too much in the way of extra mathematical structure in the theory (integrate over the wave function in a certain way: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;0903.2211" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;0903.2211</a> ), the implication in terms of what it says reality is actually like certainly involves a heck of a lot of IPUs.')
