The weird thing about programming is that as a job, if I had a company car they&#x27;d be happy for me to call the mechanic to fix it, but if kubernetes ain&#x27;t working then that&#x27;s another job for the multihatted programmer. That sort of means, from a selfish point of view it&#x27;s better to pick one of the locked-in cloud technologies that you can&#x27;t fix (AWS or Azure has to!). But I suspect many do the opposite (I want k8s on my cv!)')
