Couldn&#x27;t they deplatform you too? Is there any law that says AT&amp;T etc. cannot refuse service? Otherwise, is there any way to get an indie data center on the internet without going through any other company?<p>Every other utility seems to be regulated. For example even if you have a Confederate flag or a picture of Stalin outside your house, the local electric and water companies are not allowed to turn off your service as long as you are paying the bill.')
