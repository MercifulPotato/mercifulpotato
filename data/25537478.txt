I switched from macOS to Linux, and i don&#x27;t see the point if you&#x27;re not getting something very valuable out of it.<p>I am however, in my mind, so i&#x27;m quite happpy. Specifically, i&#x27;m toying with immutable operating systems. I view that as valuable because i feel confident in the stability and reproducibility of my system. I&#x27;d probably switch back to macOS if they offered something similar to NixOS, but that seems unlikely in the near future.<p>If i use Mac for my next laptop i&#x27;ll probably stick Nixpkgs and HomeManager on it and touch the OS as little as possible outside of Nix.')
