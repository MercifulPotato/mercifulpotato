Item(by='barrkel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610702085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787035, text='Windows CLI apps aren&#x27;t &quot;fake GUI&quot;. There&#x27;s a flag in the executable header that tells the loader (and from there the rest of the OS) whether to ensure a console is allocated for it and wire up stdin&#x2F;out&#x2F;err if they&#x27;re not already wired up, but that&#x27;s it.<p>An executable won&#x27;t have its own window unless it calls CreateWindowEx one way or another, and any such window won&#x27;t be very functional until the app starts pumping messages, which is work it needs to actively do, with GetMessage and DispatchMessage. Obviously a CLI-only app won&#x27;t do these things, but it doesn&#x27;t need to go out of its way to not do them; it doesn&#x27;t need to fake anything, or hide or otherwise resort to subterfuge to conceal GUI elements.<p>There&#x27;s a stronger argument to be made in some COM scenarios; e.g. single threaded apartment threading model creates a hidden window so it can use the message pump as a communication and serialization mechanism. But even here it&#x27;s mostly just repurposing existing Windows stuff in ways which work well with existing GUI apps.')
