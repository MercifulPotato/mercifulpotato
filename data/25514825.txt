I&#x27;ve forced everyone&#x27;s hand on this because... whelp... we&#x27;ve recently acquired the business and we ended up finding that we can be critical to Stripe Webhooks processing for folks on the older Stripe API. We literally will take down your invoicing on Stripe when a customer cancels. Then we have the unsavory task of working with customers that have canceled, did not complete their deprovisioning and then flame us for causing them outages. I love a lively debate but if you&#x27;re a customer and love us, reach out to me NOW and I&#x27;ll hear your feedback. If you&#x27;re not a customer, then please, please if you never want to talk to your vendor, please go to ProfitWell or ChartMogul. Patrick and Nick are great guys and are crushing it and will gladly take your business. We are getting eaten from the bottom by platforms <i>AHEM Stripe</i> that are inspired by us, folks that clone us and you can see from our revenue transparency that we&#x27;re the last in line for making money. That is going to change--by helping customers that really want to make more... make more. If you&#x27;d like to give me direct feedback, give me a ring at 855 252 6050. (I&#x27;m also a CISSP™, CREST CRT™ and Brown Cybersecurity dude--so if you&#x27;ve any legislation that speaks to this, let me know--for you folks quoting CA--we have business customers and they are over 13.)')
