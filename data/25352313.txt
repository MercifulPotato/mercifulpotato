Not a mid-level got fired type like this guy who at best was a sales trader.<p>There is a reason he was mid-level and fired. All the best traders found jobs easier during 2008 and so forth.<p>Frankly, this guy committed fraud and scammed gov’ts of rebates with fictional trades it seems.<p>Mid-level for a reason, he couldn’t even figure out to go buy some tech stocks and go travel for 2 years.<p>Frauds like him make the legit ones look bad. he should return the funds or the Danish should put a nice bounty on his head and he can see how safe Dubai really is.')
