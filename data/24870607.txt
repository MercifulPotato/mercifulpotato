The sites both have a very clear political preference. And both are harsh towards the other. But the chans due to the way the work have less of a vendetta style activism and mostly ignore or ridicule outsiders.<p>There&#x27;s some rough language - I would say on average the chans are certainly more direct and less signaling, but the lows are pretty equal for both sites. Death wishes are very common on both.<p>And of course what you interpret as hateful is massively defined by your beliefs. If you define using wrong pronouns as such, then you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time on the chans. But so would you on Twitter for having a photo with a MAGA hat.<p>The chans can be surprisingly humane and supportive. Truly so and not just for social points. Their usual dismissive description is not matched by the actual content. Which is understandable since honestly at the moment, a very good chunk of the content is by bots and organized groups.<p>Related: I recently posted a long article on all sorts of c++ stuff on a technical Reddit. It also contained criticism of Git. People got their god damn pitchforks! They told me to give up my job, told me I&#x27;m a bad coder, they went through reddit and git histories, looked up accounts on other sites and sent me things to my private E-mail that carry a prison sentence in my country. And the mods didn&#x27;t even remove any of it. Because I criticized Git. But they do insta-ban people for using the wrong pronouns.<p>Things are not like they seem if you&#x27;re not in the &#x27;in&#x27;-group. Deviate just a little and people come for you - on Twitter like on Reddit. There&#x27;s no such thing on the chans.')
