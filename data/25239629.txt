Item(by='_dibly', descendants=None, kids=[25240029], score=None, time=1606590087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25239480, text='I don&#x27;t understand, so you don&#x27;t care and it&#x27;s okay if he cares, but if he says that people not caring is part of the problem then he&#x27;s an elitist?  What is your argument here, that he has no grounds to point out the apathy toward the long-term impact of your decisions?<p>You go so far as to validate the things he&#x27;s concerned about and reiterate that you just don&#x27;t care about them.  I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with pointing out the inherent shortsightedness of that line of thinking.<p>&gt;it’s disappointing to me that so many here simply can’t conceive that some people don’t share their priorities, and make conscious choices that reflect their own priorities.<p>Have you considered that those people understand basic human psychology and that they take issue with the exact priorities that they are speaking against?')
