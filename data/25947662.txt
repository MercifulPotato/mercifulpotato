If there isn&#x27;t a clear winner, I would hope that companies would err on the side of improving employee well-being by providing flexibility.<p>At the individual level, productivity in office VS at home varies depending on your personal circumstances, preferences, and role. I hope larger companies realize that a one-size-fits-all policy isn&#x27;t the best solution.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d like them to allow individual teams to decide what options they want to allow within the team (full-time in office, work from home N days&#x2F;week, full-time remote, etc.) Then the team can develop norms and processes for work and communication that make sense.')
