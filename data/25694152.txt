Of course if it comes up the right way for me, I will be happy to take your money. Do you think that&#x27;s unreasonable?<p>There is far too much opportunity for the election workers to cheat for me to trust them if they aren&#x27;t closely observed, no matter what they say afterward. That&#x27;s why observers were put there in the first place.<p>If the elections workers are not good at cheating, they may leave behind evidence, but a lack of evidence would not be convincing to me, because not all forms of election fraud will necessarily leave behind evidence, and there is too much opportunity for them to get rid of it.')
