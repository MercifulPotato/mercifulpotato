There is a rather old codec (SBC) at a few different bit-rates, and a couple newer better codecs from the last 10 years (aptX, AAC, ?). Apple does have the control to make sure better codecs are supported and used. It can be pretty hard to determine and control what codecs are supported and which one is used, this is almost always hidden and never mentioned anywhere.')
