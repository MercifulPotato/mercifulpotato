That is all nice and fine. Instead what the author <i>does</i> complain about is that fact that the (supposedly regulated) mechanisms for shorting a stock are fraught with loopholes and exceptions that make it possible for brokers and the DTC to create stocks &quot;out of thin air&quot; for the short sellers and never neutralize. This dilutes the company&#x27;s stock in the process and thereby damages the company&#x27;s shareholders.<p>It is an issue that, if true, should absolutely be brought to public and regulator&#x27;s attention.')
