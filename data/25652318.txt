The fact that the time is clock is moved <i>delays</i> the period where we suffer late sunrise significantly. If instead of DST being 2&#x2F;3 of the year it would be 3&#x2F;3 of the year, the remaining 1&#x2F;3 would be significantly worse for the portion of the population that is forced to wake up before sunrise.<p>As an example, there is a period now (before covid) where my partnerâ€™s commute started before sunrise during DST, then we would move to standard and happily the commute was back to during sunrise for a couple of more weeks. If we stayed on a permanent DST those extra couple of weeks would be darker in the morning. And I have a strong feeling that can have health implications for a broad subset of the population.')
