To cringe is to feel disgust or embarrassment that results in a physical reaction such as a grimace. Generally, this can be felt watching very socially awkward situations. Is this what you mean? Or is there a better word, like immature, silly, strange, or something? I think most people are not feeling socially awkward or whatnot referring to a community by a mascot or other title. It is just a silly word for “practitioners of a given language.” We do that with all kinds of term, roles, titles, professions, hobbies, etc.<p>Why does it make you cringe?')
