In fact if you don&#x27;t respond in time it may reflect badly on you.</i><p>Yep, you&#x27;re onto something there.<p>A particularly insidious effect is that although no one notices the pages you do get to, they <i>definitely</i> miss the ones you don&#x27;t. I have something like a 99% hit rate, but I&#x27;ve been given a very hard time on the few that I&#x27;ve missed.<p>&gt; <i>There is an approach that can be taken to focus sprints on only improving oncall but it requires management buy in. How bad is it? Is it something out of your teams control or is it something if you spend an hour over you can fix for good?</i><p>One issue is that many pages tend to be bucketed in err-on-the-side-of-caution type alarms. Like they might not even be directly indicative of a problem, but often are, but basically just need to have a human take a look.<p>Another is that although it&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> bad. I&#x27;ve seen teams at other places who&#x27;ve had it much worse and indeed we&#x27;re not even the worst off at the company. We have the typical corporate problem of underwater-all-the-time, so improvements aren&#x27;t super likely to be prioritized unless things move even further south.')
