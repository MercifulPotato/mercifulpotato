I don&#x27;t honestly know, for any of them, and I think people get trapped into arguing stuff they don&#x27;t know.<p>The outrage is that, regardless of how many people were violent at or around the protests for racial justice, the ones who <i>weren&#x27;t</i> violent were brutalized on many occasions. Lots of people, reporters and ordinary people, experienced it and documented it. And at the attack on the Capitol, no matter how many people were peaceful, the authorities gave the violent people strikingly more free rein.<p>Simply by arguing the statistics, I think you get derailed from what matters, which is how both sides are not equal.')
