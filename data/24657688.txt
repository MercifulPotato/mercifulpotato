We like to think of buildings as applications. We see the process of turning blueprints into buildings as an algorithm. It&#x27;s an algorithm we seek to optimize. We&#x27;re ambitious and relentlessly driven, yet humble and collaborative. You&#x27;ll join 1build in our first stage of development, in which we build an application to improve the process of converting blueprints into shopping lists and cost estimates. It&#x27;s a process that&#x27;s critical yet currently cumbersome for 3.2 million builders in the US alone.<p>Investors love us. We&#x27;re backed by top VC firms including YC, Initialized, Sequoia, and MetaProp. Our core team has experience at Apple, WeWork, Tesla, CloudKitchens, and Hipmunk, with academic backgrounds from Harvard and Princeton. You&#x27;ll join a culture of excellence at 1build.<p>Tech stack: GraphQL | Postgres | Python | Go | React | TypeScript<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;16399" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;16399</a>')
