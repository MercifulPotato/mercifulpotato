I am forced to keep a drive around with it so that I can run audio recording applications without glitches.  I have tried every optimization point that I am aware of, but latency mon shows a variety of problem in Win 10, most prominently with NDIS.sys.<p>None of those problems exist in Windows 7 for me.  It just works for music and it works cleanly without problems, just as it has since I first installed it.  Using GRUB makes it easy to maintain multiple OS&#x27;s, but it sure would be better if Windows 10 didn&#x27;t have the problems that it does.')
