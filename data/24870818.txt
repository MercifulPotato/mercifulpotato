By creating a folder with a certain name, users have access to all of the operating system&#x27;s control panels from within a single folder.<p>The shortcut is implemented by creating a folder with the extension .{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}. GodMode was the original folder name used when the feature was publicised, but any name can be used.</i>')
