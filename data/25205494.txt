If you instead, think of the &#x27;negation&#x27; as direction (as in a vector), it becomes easier to understand why multiplying two negative numbers makes the answer positive (You&#x27;ve basically turned around twice).<p>I actually prefer this visualization rather than the one with a number line with numbers going to the left of 0.')
