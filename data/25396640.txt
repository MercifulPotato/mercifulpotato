Ever driven a car?</i><p>Yes, and I take various precautions when doing so to reduce the risk to those around me. But, driving a car gets me from point A to B. There&#x27;s a trade-off. Near as I can tell from the available data from studies on the new vaccines, the risk and consequences of getting COVID outweigh the risks and consequences of getting the vaccine, perhaps by several orders of magnitude.<p>The number of both cases &amp; deaths have reached nation-wide highs, and basically all states are seeing upticks in prevalence, likely to be made worse by Christmas. The tests on the vaccines have shown it to be effective, and have had minimal side-effects (I&#x27;ve heard some reports of non-life-threatening allergic reaction, and 1 more serious case that is being investigated. There were 43,000 people in the Pfizer study alone, I think. That is <i>significantly</i> better than the confirmed COVID-19 case rate. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;covid-19-vaccine-from-pf...</a>)<p>&gt; <i>I may have some bias here because the only 2 times I&#x27;ve gotten the flu as an adult are the two times I got the the flu shot, like you&#x27;re supposed to do. So maybe that&#x27;s just coincidence, but my operating theory now is, no more flu shots until I get the flu again. If I do, then I&#x27;ll reconsider.</i><p>It&#x27;s just coincidence:<p>&gt; <i>studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine.</i><p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;flu&#x2F;vaccines-work&#x2F;vaccineeffect.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;flu&#x2F;vaccines-work&#x2F;vaccineeffect.htm</a>)')
