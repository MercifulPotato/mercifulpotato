Runtime correctness != compile-time correctness. This is all assuming you managed to convince everyone to use the same language and throw everything under 1 solution too.<p>I absolutely love that our application takes just a little bit longer to build than a smaller isolated microservice. This is when my computer is doing all of the hard troubleshooting work for me ahead of time. 32+ cores diligently seeking out my wasted time and banishing bugs before they can even make it into QA.<p>Determining that your types don&#x27;t line up during integration testing seems like a foolish approach if you value your time.')
