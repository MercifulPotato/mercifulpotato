Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611878225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950338, text='tldr; even if Robinhood does it&#x27;s own clearing (which I&#x27;m not suggesting they don&#x27;t) it&#x27;s reasonable to not risk their business to support the current market. Does &quot;the market can remain irrational longer than Robinhood can remain solvent&quot; apply here?<p>Any valid argument that would cause another clearing house to not be able to afford to handle these orders would seemingly-equally apply to Robinhood&#x27;s own clearing house; no matter who owns it, the clearing house can&#x27;t afford to go broke.<p>If someone is arguing that Robinhood should have the risk tolerance and reserves of a larger financial institution in order to service high volatility trades.... then maybe that person should use a larger financial institution to place these high volatility trades.')
