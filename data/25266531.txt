At boot time the BIOS would load the kernel from the floopy, Linux would open the fd device, adjust the device to seek to the beginning of the initrd, mount the initrd, then load and execute init.<p>But the later convention was to create a loopback device tied to a disk image, mkfs.minix it, mount it, copy the kernel and an initrd, and run lilo on the loopback device. Then unmount and decouple the loopback from the disk image and dd that to the floppy. It didn&#x27;t really take up any extra space and made it easier to update your initrd or kernel.')
