It could be cause A or the more rare but serious cause B. It takes imaging to determine whether it&#x27;s A or B. Elsewhere in the world, they just assume it&#x27;s A as the patient is &quot;old&quot; because it&#x27;s financially impractical to test for B. My wife on the other had has no constraints from ordering the imaging test even though 9&#x2F;10 times it&#x27;s &quot;wasted&quot; as it just confirms A. But the other 10% of the time, it saves the life.<p>We make a different tradeoff in the US, some of us prefer this trade off.')
