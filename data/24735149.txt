The term &#x27;Orwellian&#x27; has become so overused that it seems to have lost all currency. When we&#x27;re confronted with an <i>actually</i> Orwellian phenomena people seem to either not notice or not care. It&#x27;s not as though the viral propagation of false, misleading and harmful information began with social media, or even with the internet. This phenomena was alive and well long before modern technology, which has surprisingly done very little to change it.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely shocked how little backlash there&#x27;s been against big-tech censorship. I grew up as a liberal in the 90s and early 00s. Freedom of speech and fostering an environment for information to propagate freely were ideals held sacred. It&#x27;s been sincerely disappointing to see how many of my fellow so-called-liberals are willing to accept huge multinational corporations (of all things) censoring information &quot;For their own good&quot;.')
