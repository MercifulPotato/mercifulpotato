I still maintain a couple of project with it but it&#x27;s not my default choice anymore.<p>It&#x27;s a bit lighter than React but if you care about weight, Preact, Svelte, Mithril, Solid, Inferno, and others would be a better choice.<p>It&#x27;s not more flexible than React. Quite contrary. At least for Vue 2 (I haven&#x27;t used the composition API of Vue 3).<p>Having used both for some years, I find Vue to be more intrusive than React. In some aspects Vue is more pragmatic but OTOH it&#x27;s quite inelegant.<p>I recommend Vue to people getting started with modern front end, specially because you can use it without a build setup and just the JS basics. It&#x27;s great for backend devs, or designers that only know HTML and a bit of JS. I don&#x27;t really see the point for experienced JS devs.')
