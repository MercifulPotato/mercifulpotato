After all, a candidate can come off as likeable to one interviewer and unlikeable to another.<p>Versus just being able ace through leetcode problems - that&#x27;s a more objective criteria a candidate has more control over.<p>Personal anecdote. I interviewed at a FAANG, got rejected. They actually offered feedback, and one of the key reasons I apparently got rejected was that &quot;I asked too many (clarifying) questions&quot; about the leetcode problem.<p>Fast forward a year, I retry.
