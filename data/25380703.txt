Flash sites were rife with mystery meat UIs. They were also accessibility hostile. While you can commit a lot of the same sins on a web page you have to go out of your way to do so.<p>Besides all of <i>those</i> problems it was also a closed platform like the GP was decrying with Apple&#x27;s App Store. You can make a web app entirely FOSS with entirely FOSS tools and served from a completely FOSS stack. If you want to avoid any platform lock in it&#x27;s entirely possible. Flash was the literal opposite until <i>years</i> after it&#x27;s mobile availability was a meaningful concern.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;flash-99-percent-bad&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;flash-99-percent-bad&#x2F;</a>')
