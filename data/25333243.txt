The bottom line, AFAICT, it is not easy to accurately test air quality cheaply. Whenever I would find a device that claimed to test air quality I would find reviews by people who were testing that device that stated either;<p>It came miscalibrated from the factory.<p>OR<p>After a short period it would no longer be calibrated.<p>Turns out keeping an air quality testing device calibrated properly is really really hard, and definitely not cheap. So maybe the computing side of this is not really all the difficult, but the physical measurement side of this is absolutely not easy.<p>Eventually I gave up trying to find a device for my home because I realized I would have to really dig into the science hard, and I would have to spend more money than I was willing. And I was unwilling to do either.')
