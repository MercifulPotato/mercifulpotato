Alas nowadays policy advocates in his tradition seem to want the bourgeoisie state to write and enforce more rules, forgetting that those rules are unlikely to benefit anyone other than an oligarch.<p>&gt; pure capitalism only works in theory, never in practice.<p>Thats dogma and unlikely to be true.<p>&gt; In the real world, disparities in money are disparities in power, which ensure things such as bailouts and more fundamentally, banking laws that are effectively a license (for some) to print free money for themselves.<p>Its more accurate to say that &quot;disparities in power lead to disparities in money.&quot; Certainly there are other forms of power, like the ones people use to expropriate money and assets from those who have money and assets but less power.')
