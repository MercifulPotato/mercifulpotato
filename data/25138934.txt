(This also tends to happen more &#x2F; better in high-functioning environments, or work where it&#x27;s project-based and you have choices about who to continue working with next.)<p>If someone has written you off, they won&#x27;t go to the trouble of creating, thinking about, and giving feedback.  Because good feedback takes <i>effort</i>.  It&#x27;s a obligation of the other person to put thought into it, so you should learn to appreciate it.<p>In addition to the other advice about delivering it properly, giving concrete examples, etc. etc.<p>Give feedback as a gift to others, and receive it in that way.')
