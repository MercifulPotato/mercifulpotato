I always assumed everyone had this ability, it&#x27;s only in the last few years I&#x27;ve realized this wasn&#x27;t at all the case.  I was discussing study techniques with an anatomy and physiology prof, they were the first to really clue me in that it wasn&#x27;t typical to just &#x27;see&#x27; the entire human structure in detail. It has it&#x27;s ups and downs for sure though, not sure how people get by without it to be completely honest. The obvious perk is tinkering with mechanical items or woodworking, can essentially create an exploded part view with full manipulation&#x2F;rotation of parts, extremely useful in the drafting stage. It looks fairly close to the hologram view from the 1st Iron Man movie [0], just a lot more vivid. It didn&#x27;t register that it was a hologram the first time I saw the film as a kid, I just thought that was his mental image. It seems like a skill to me more than something I was born with though, biased of course, and I have gotten better at utilizing it in my day-to-day work. For one example of non-obvious utility, through a lot of practice, I am now able to read a function module, then keep the screen state of that function in the corner of my vision, almost like having a floating monitor, biggest difference is that I&#x27;m able to update the image on command to whatever I need just by thinking. The biggest issue I have with this, and why I&#x27;m still looking forward to high-res VR goggles to do the same thing, is the issue of interruption. It takes a lot of effort to build the state of 6 or 7 &#x27;screens&#x27; and it takes 1 stupid slack message to bring the tower down. The programmer interrupted comic strip [1] is something that I&#x27;ve passive aggressively had to print out and hang next to my desk.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i2.wp.com&#x2F;medialist.info&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;2018_10_21_medialist_hologramm_iron_man-e1540157872105.jpg?fit=927%2C534&amp;ssl=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i2.wp.com&#x2F;medialist.info&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heeris.id.au&#x2F;trinkets&#x2F;ProgrammerInterrupted.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heeris.id.au&#x2F;trinkets&#x2F;ProgrammerInterrupted.png</a>')
