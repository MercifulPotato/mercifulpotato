Actually, your comment would be excellent if it had been just the second paragraph. Unfortunately the first paragraph negated it (and then some) before it even had a chance.<p>That&#x27;s one reason why the HN guidelines include &quot;<i>Don&#x27;t be snarky.</i>&quot;<p>If you wouldn&#x27;t mind reviewing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and sticking to the rules when posting here, we&#x27;d be grateful and you&#x27;ll get much more interesting responses. Note these in particular:<p>&quot;<i>Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that&#x27;s easier to criticize. Assume good faith.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>Please don&#x27;t comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.</i>&quot;')
