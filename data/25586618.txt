And with just three sites it compares I could just check these sites by myself. So for now it lacks a bit of content.<p>However, something I would like to see and i think could be more niche-oriented would be similar as this but for physical releases. Discogs does have some retailers, but they need to manually upkeep their inventory in there. If you could scrape physical releases and show where I can order album X for the cheapest (shipping included) or even see where it is available to buy, that would be a service I would love to use.')
