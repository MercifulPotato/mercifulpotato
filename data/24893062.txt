Describe it in great detail. As you describe it, identify the parts of it that feel familiar, and the parts that don’t. With the parts that familiar, describe what you would do to address them. With the parts that don’t, try to identify how they might be similar to other problems and how they differ. Keep reducing the problem into familiar and unfamiliar. When you’re sure you’ve isolated the unfamiliar, research. See if other people have solved similar problems. If you know how to reference prior art, start there. If you don’t, or can’t find your answer there, take your refined query to humans.')
