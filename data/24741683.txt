Item(by='knorker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602361988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735300, text='Seems interesting from the Ted Talk (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xTkKSJSqU-I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xTkKSJSqU-I</a>) summary.<p>But note &quot;Leaders nudge people and the tribe to the next stage&quot;. In this case the leader sees where the tribe is going and is steering away from that sinkhole of unhappiness (constant workplace politicking doesn&#x27;t make anybody happy, even when perceived progress is being made) and unproductivity that is workplace activism.<p>Putting a fire extinguisher on that self-destructive behavior seems like the leader&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s not something you should be nurturing.<p>You may disagree about it being self-destructive, but that would be a different issue.<p>But thanks for the book recommendation. Adding it to my list.')
