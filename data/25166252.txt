He is verbose in his language but once you get used to it you can see his brilliance.<p>His core arguments on the KE are as follows:<p>- It is creating a schism in the American workforce, and those on the outside lack access to the necessary educational institutions to ever catch up.<p>- Our IP laws are stagnating our economic development by keeping it isolated to a handful of companies in each industry vertical. Compared to our past this prevents transitioning to an entirely new mode of production.  Compare that to history - if you wanted to open a loom factory during the industrial rev. you had access to the loom tech.  Not the case today. There&#x27;s also no shortcut like there was in the past. E.g. Put a farmer in a factory assembly line is NBD.  Put a plant worker behind a laptop and ask him to write a script?  Not happening.<p>--- Platform companies only have their dominion because an IP loophole states the individual&#x27;s data is not their property.  We make our data our property and companies like FB&#x2F;Google struggle to retain their power.<p>- It&#x27;s a form of work that utilizes the greatest human power, imagination.<p>- Under the right political structures this form of work ushers in a new human era.  Under the current it stagnates our potential.<p>Happy to answer specifics if anyone has any questions about his work&#x2F;perspective.')
