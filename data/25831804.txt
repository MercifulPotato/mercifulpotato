Some of those will ask for more benefits, others will play games of power, others still will simply refuse to stay once they stopped learning.<p>(In my industry and geo) businesses chose the opposite -- they slice and dice the knowledge into tiny bins so that a total newcomer can learn up quickly enough. This drives down wages but now requires many more people where a few should suffice.<p>Solution to that? Total subcontracting of sw development. Which is of course a slow death for the business, but a) at least it looks like a business model, b) death is slow enough so that managers have time to move on, c) this has a merit of being implementable. The alternative -- finding people who already know or learn very fast, and then keeping them -- is not for every budget.')
