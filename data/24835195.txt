Item(by='eska', descendants=None, kids=[24838752], score=None, time=1603183960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829635, text='This analysis completely misses the mark and spreads a lot of untruths.<p>The two major points are:<p>1. Discord makes money by letting users elevate their status, while offering core feature for free.<p>2. It is 10x better than other offerings.<p>Regarding 1, immediately after making that statement, the author lists perks such as bigger upload file size limits, better audio quality, screen sharing resolution, etc. These features are not about status, they are core. I therefore do not accept the premise that Discord is &quot;free to play&quot; like the mentioned League of Legends. Ironically, live game coaches for League of Legends will tell their customers to not share the screen on Discord, but on Skype, due to better quality and latency, for free.<p>Regarding 2, the 10x factor is obviously marketing speech for &quot;significantly better&quot;, but even that is factually wrong. As mentioned in 1), a lot of core features such as audio and video quality are limited, unlike rivaling software. Even IRC offered unlimited file sharing of even gigabytes in size (and therefore had a community around it). Meanwhile Discord will not even allow you to share short video clips less than a minute of length due to file size.\nSkype is being criticized, but what&#x27;s conveniently being left out is that Skype rose to fame before it was bought by Microsoft and had its architecture changed from peer-to-peer to server-client. Skype used to be much better than it is now and used to have less limitations, and was give-or-take better or worse than Discord. Certainly no 10x here.<p>The real point IMO, and other commenters have written about this in great detail already, is the ease of onboarding. The article only talks about the ease of joining a channel etc. and compares that to Skype for example, but calling somebody in Skype is also only 2 clicks. It&#x27;s really account creation and server joining (click a link). And the fact that competitors drove their software into the ground.')
