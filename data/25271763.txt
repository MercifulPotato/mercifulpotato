Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=[25272278], score=None, time=1606867716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25270612, text='You make good points, but I think you should revisit your assumptions.<p>Fission is so expensive mainly because of safety and regulatory concerns: radioactivity scares people, and so safety requirements are cranked up to 11: everything is overdesigned just so that current regulator is confident enough (next one might one up anyway), lots and lots of concrete and steel is used for containment etc. Additionally, the whole construction process is hopelessly bureaucratic and takes forever, requiring inspections of inspections, redesigns for things that in, say, coal plants would just be redone differently by contractor on site and so on. We most definitely could make fission significantly cheaper, and in fact it has been so in the past.<p>Now, fusion does not have similar safety requirements. If the plant blows up for some reason, there&#x27;s no significant radionuclide contamination. Therefore, there&#x27;s little reason to require safety standards significantly higher than those for coal plants (the boilers of which can also catastrophically blow up). This makes it significantly cheaper, due to reduced material use and construction time&#x2F;labor for containment, and reduced regulatory delays.<p>Your point about power density is also good, but I don&#x27;t think it matters very much in practice. Sure, fusion reactor might have significantly lower power density than fission reactor, but so what? Renewable plants are even worse when it comes to power density, yet it doesn&#x27;t stop them from being rolled out. We don&#x27;t lack space for fusion plants, even if they are much larger than equivalent fission ones.')
