Don&#x27;t reuse passwords!<p>On the security front, companies that are implementing 3rd-party sign-in can still get hacked and leak your personal information. If that information is supplied by Apple instead of you, it&#x27;s all the same. You don&#x27;t automatically get better security because you&#x27;re using 3rd-party sign-in, you only get better security if you&#x27;re being forced to stop doing something bad (reusing passwords, enabling 2FA) or if Apple is providing less information than an account would ask for during signup.<p>To Apple&#x27;s credit on that front, they do mask your email, which is a legitimate privacy improvement. But it would be better for that to be a generic service that allowed you to generate an anonymous email at any time for anything, rather than a perk that&#x27;s hardwired into an anti-competitive scheme to make it harder for you to migrate devices or change services.')
