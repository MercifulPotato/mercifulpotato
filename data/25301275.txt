IMHO that&#x27;s a good reason to use static-by-default (and also not to split a project into a myriad of tiny source files, since this usually means less functions can be made static). Of course in the end LTO will take care of unused functions project-wide, but you&#x27;ll not get a warning about stale functions that way.')
