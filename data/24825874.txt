Most of the smaller language Wikipedias are eager to use Wikidata, as it provides data on a scale they couldn&#x27;t achieve on their own. But the biggest Wikipedia, the English one, is very resistant to implementing Wikidata support, as they feel their local info is better maintained than Wikidata info. Which is true, but ignores the likelihood that Wikidata would improve very quickly if enwiki started using it. A very short-sighted and selfish attitude.')
