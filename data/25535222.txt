It&#x27;s just a great scapegoat for bad teams working under impossible deadlines: &quot;Our code is unmaintainable because Rails! We need 1 year to rewrite it in Go&#x2F;Elixir&#x2F;Java&quot;. I mean, because Rails has a flat structure you couldn&#x27;t ever take the time to reactor that piece of crap code you wrote for 2 years? really? You didn&#x27;t notice a model stopped making sense or growing in complexity? \nI see the same criticism with PHP. It&#x27;s perfectly fine, stop blaming the tool.')
