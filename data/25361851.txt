However, we aren&#x27;t having a healthy debate right now because the election fraud conspiratorialists are shouting their message without regard for the rebuttals. I think there&#x27;s something to be said for bringing the volume down to manageable levels so that we can actually have a debate. That said, I&#x27;m not remotely convinced that there&#x27;s any kind of evidence that will convince these people that there <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> election fraud--it feels like arguing with flat-earthers or blank-slaters or whomever--which isn&#x27;t so much to vindicate &#x27;censorship&#x27; (in general or in particular) as it is to express sadness at the state of our collective intellectual and political well-being.')
