There is nothing that would make me more happy than to see them come to a quick and timely demise.<p>That said, at least they are doing something to try to contribute to lessen the impact of their wrongs.<p>&quot;Won&#x27;t fix anything&quot; is true in the sense that is hardly compares to the damage Amazon does to the US economy and housing costs in the Seattle area.<p>It isn&#x27;t true in that it is &quot;nothing&quot;. I checked out this article hoping to see some juicy details of Amazon&#x27;s wrongdoings... and I got... a few links to other articles.<p>Could someone please put together some nice charts showing exactly how much Amazon is screwing everything up?

Like... duh... but I want to see some hard evidence that proves forever exactly how bad they are.')
