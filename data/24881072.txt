In some cases twitch streaming may also be fair use. Many video game companies provide explicit permission to streamers to stream their video game - e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xbox.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;developers&#x2F;rules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xbox.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;developers&#x2F;rules</a><p>Twitch is also different because now both the original video game and the streamer both have a copyright of the result, where in the screenshot case, the person creating the screenshot didn&#x27;t add anything artistic, so they dont have any copyright added to the result. Remember in USA, copyright is based on if you put something artistic into the end result, not how hard you worked (other countries are different, google sweat of the brow)<p>Wikimedia commons aims to be  a repository of stuff that you can definitely use no matter what, without worrying that maybe the heir to some video game designer from the 80s comes out of hiding and makes a fuss. The images are still allowed on wikipedia, they just can&#x27;t be in that section (think of it like the difference between debian main and debian non-free)')
