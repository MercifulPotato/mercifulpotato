The point of what I wrote, and what the article says, is that `-n` is equivalent to `2^N - n`, and thus `-n % n` is equivalent to `(2^N - n) % n`.<p>If 2^N - n happens to be a number that&#x27;s &quot;full of 1s where there were zeros&quot;, then that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be. I don&#x27;t understand why you think it &quot;won&#x27;t compute the expected modulus&quot;. That&#x27;s exactly what it will do.<p>If N is 32 and n is 5, then -n is 4294967291 and -n % n is 1. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether that was calculated on a ones complement or twos complement machine.')
