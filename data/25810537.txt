If Apple wants to make USB-C more valuable to users, they must ensure companies make more products for it and, therefore, remove such redundant ports.<p>I have an HDMI monitor connected to my MacBook via a USB-C to HDMI&#x2F;USB dongle, which also charges the computer, keyboard and trackpad, and another another via a UDB-C to DisplayPort cable.<p>I&#x27;ve been using my SDcard based camera less and less, both because my phones got much better and because they are much smaller. With an iPhone, which is a pretty decent camera, everything happens transparently and all my photos are automagically imported.<p>A reasonable docking station&#x2F;port extender is small and has all those ports. I keep one in my backpack (even though I used it like once while traveling).<p>I really prefer it this way. I&#x27;d also love if Apple went back into making monitors that could charge my Mac and offer plenty of rarely used ports on its back.')
