A single USB-C TB3 connection between a Macbook Pro and a USB-C dock has allowed me (since COVID19 work from home lockdown started) to:<p>* charge the laptop<p>* drive 2 1440p @ 60 monitors<p>* connect 6 USB2 peripherals<p>* have 1Gbit wired ethernet connection to my router (for low latency and stable connectivity for all that remote desktop work)<p>One of the monitors connects over USB-C to the dock and that carries video signal and USB upstream so I could plug even more USB-A devices in the monitor if I wanted to. Imagine how many cables and what a mess would be to get this many peripherals connected to a laptop without TB3, now I just plug one cable to the laptop, very impressive.')
