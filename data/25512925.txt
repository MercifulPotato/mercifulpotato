Instead, I write there notes about how the password should be derived, e.g. contoso.com|x4|s1. Even if someone gets to see this and even they guess the exact structure of this algorithm, they&#x27;d have to know the salt, which would take long time to bruteforce. Otherwise they&#x27;d have to wonder if x4 means &quot;4 times hashing&quot; or &quot;repeated 4 times&quot; or it&#x27;s something to do with the salt.')
