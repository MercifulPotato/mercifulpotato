Welcome to the Automated DMV, Mr. Smith. Your car registration needs to be renewed. Since you&#x27;re here, and we recognize you, and your car is in the parking lot, and we recognize that, too, renewal will be $122. You have three parking tickets outstanding, so we will add $150 to that. You have one red light violation, and we&#x27;re sending video of that to your phone if you want to contest it. But since the face and license plate match, we assume you won&#x27;t, so we&#x27;re adding $1025.  Your total today is $1297.&quot;<p>&quot;Right now, you have $475 in your bank account. We can set up an easy payment plan at $150 per month plus 3% interest per month if you like, with automatic deduction.  If that&#x27;s OK with you, just say &quot;Yes&quot;.&quot;')
