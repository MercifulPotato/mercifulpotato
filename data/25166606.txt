A new product manager&#x2F;AVP&#x2F;VP shows up and wants to gather power or just make their mark, so they rebrand or merge or kill a project to show they&#x27;ve done something. If something new is created, it immediately becomes subject to this dynamic.<p>The only Google products I use that I feel I can rely on for daily use without fearing the rug getting pulled out are Gmail, Gcal, Search, and Docs. (And I don&#x27;t know how they make money on Docs so I&#x27;m still nervous there) I&#x27;m not a PaaS users&#x2F;decision maker so that doesn&#x27;t apply to me, but if it did then I would still be very reluctant to invest there unless it was part of an easily migrated multi-cloud strategy. I though Music was safe and got burned on that with the YT migration, which is a much inferior player. Even basic things like shuffling a play list and having it endlessly play through it don&#x27;t seem to work.. at some point it wanders off to some random suggested song I don&#x27;t own and don&#x27;t want to listen to.<p>It will be years before I could feel comfortable making any other sort of Google service a daily driver for a given task, assuming they get their act together.')
