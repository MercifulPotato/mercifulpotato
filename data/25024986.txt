Item(by='arendtio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604834476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25017167, text='OT: On a monthly basis I seem to have problems with the Spotify Web Player (slow loading times, max cpu utilization for a few minutes before I can use the player, a not loading page on the first try, etc.).<p>A few days ago, I could not access the player and desperately wanted to listen to music, so I looked around in the Firefox dev-tools and unregistered the ServiceWorker. After that, everything worked just fine and I decided to deactivate ServiceWorkers for the Profile which I use for Spotify via about:config.<p>Every since, I had no trouble anymore. I know writing ServiceWorkers isn&#x27;t easy, but that is not my point. My point is, that I pay Spotify to deliver music to me in the DRM protected way the music industry demands for (not the consumer). So fixing things gets harder for me with DRM in place.<p>@Spotify: Please fix your broken software development process and deliver on your promises.')
