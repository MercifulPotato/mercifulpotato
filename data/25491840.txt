If anything, to me it&#x27;s just further illustrating how broken hiring, in tech, is. I&#x27;ll bet the guy running engineering at Starbucks started long before there were the requirements they have now and would never get hired nowadays. Likewise I&#x27;ll bet he has probably aided in creating a higher bar of every for others like himself.<p>Guy probably wouldn&#x27;t have passed a useless leetcode test back in the day, due to no formal training and they weren&#x27;t around yet. But I&#x27;ll venture to bet Starbucks throws the same useless tests at new entries essentially barring new entrants from following the path he did.')
