And it did indeed create a lot of noise. My understanding of how we moved on from that is that namespacing, aliasing, and in general better code structure started being used. Things are no longer global. How do you make parts of mathematical proofs non-global to the entire proof?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hungarian_notation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hungarian_notation</a>')
