And some of these multiples happen to coincide with numbers used in specific settings (navigation, astronomy...). How surprising...\nThey fail to explain how those objects would be used in practice according to their theory without modern highly accurate calipers.<p>Not even speaking of the general tone and wild ramblings scattered throughout the article.<p>Edit: The number series are not even correct.
