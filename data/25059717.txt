If you don&#x27;t care enough to write good code, you won&#x27;t. Yes, some languages make it easier than others to write good software, but that won&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re just banging out code without a care.<p>That said, I <i>do</i> miss the typiness of C&#x2F;C++ when I&#x27;m writing Python. I&#x27;d be interested to know how one enforces things a bit more strictly, even if it&#x27;s only by running a separate tool (so something to be run on every checkin via CI, much as I run static linters for C and C++ code).')
