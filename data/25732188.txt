Even if you happened to have a half a petabyte of storage available somewhere you would lack the bandwidth to exfiltrate.  The problem with Parler is that it was living on a shared cloud so it was easy for someone to spin up copies and use intra-DC copy mechanisms (or even simple volume mirroring) and the data was also small enough to be within reach for anyone who was curious -- it would cost you less than $5K to copy and then export the entire Parler corpus in less than an afternoon.')
