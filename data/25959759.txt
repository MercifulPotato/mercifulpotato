I started buying Eneloops, and they work alright.<p>Now I own 16 more electronic devices (8 AA, 8AAA), and I have to keep track of what device they&#x27;re in, their charge state, and their long-term health. I don&#x27;t have a great way of tracking ANY of those things.<p>Part of my motivation was to use them in camera flash units, where a small change in the battery life can result in the flash cycle time changing from ~1s to ~10s, without any warning - while I&#x27;m trying to take a photo of something quickly - so this sucks. This is a minor pain, because I can swap out for some fresh alkalines, but in that case, why even bother with the rechargeables?<p>They&#x27;re still nice in most other devices.')
