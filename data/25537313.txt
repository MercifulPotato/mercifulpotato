When I read an ML paper with authors from Google, I assume they have an angle. When I read an ML Ethics paper with authors from Google, that already went double. Now it’s triple.<p>So look at my argument differently. Every single scientific paper you read should be read as non-objective as a starting position.  If it can overcome starting from that position with data, methodology, and reasoning, it’s a solid scientific paper.')
