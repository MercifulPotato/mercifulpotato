I agree that there&#x27;s lots of that. I&#x27;m asking for examples of the violence being planned or premeditated. Those are two different things. The &quot;line&quot; appears to be in between those two things, and people (like you!) appear to be equivocating between them when they aren&#x27;t the same.<p>&gt;  support it yourself.<p>My (hypothetical!) lack of objection to generic violence is not the same as active planning and encouragement of specific violence. And I find your repeated attempts to equivocate between the two rather confused.<p>I&#x27;m asking for examples of the second, the active specific planning and incitement of violence. You&#x27;re avoiding engaging with that request, likely because, as I believe, you can&#x27;t find examples of that kind of behavior.')
