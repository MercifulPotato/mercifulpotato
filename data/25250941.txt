It&#x27;s true that Japan has relatively high suicide rates compared to my country (America) with an age adjusted rate of 14.3 vs 13.7 incidents per 100,000 (2016 numbers). But those numbers were both closer, and far below a number of other OECD countries that I wouldn&#x27;t normally consider to be areas with high rates of suicide. A few examples include Estonia (14.4), Belgium (15.7), Latvia (17.2), Ukraine (18.5), and Lithuania (25.7).')
