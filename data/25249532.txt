GA is not that.  Possibly because there&#x27;s already an ok solution (dot&#x2F;cross-products), the benefits of switching are pretty incremental (or negative in terms of net effort for people who use dot&#x2F;cross products a few times a year).<p>Category Theory is an example of a unifying theory that caught on. It took time, but my brain was able to assimilate to it quite quickly.  With GA none of it sticks for me - I have other tools that suffice (I work on games and have reasonably regular 3D exposure, but the traditional tools of calculus textbooks mostly suffice, and if I need fancy concepts they tend to come from differential geometry).<p>I remember another big war being to push gauge integrals into Calculus textbooks (as an alternative&#x2F;augmentation to Riemann integrals that vastly increase the scope of what can be integrated).  I assume that went nowhere, but that was a valiant struggle.<p>My breakthrough with the cross product was coming to understand it as a weird but practical tool rather than representing some fundamentally beautiful geometrical concept.  It might be one of the most well known weird mathematical tools.  The cross product of two vectors has no real meaning to me intrinsically (I don&#x27;t think it has or deserves a platonic identity) but it&#x27;s useful for talking about orientations&#x2F;picking right-angles&#x2F;planarity.<p>I can imagine at some point educators might become convinced about the utility of GA and things flipping, but it feels far from that tipping point still.')
