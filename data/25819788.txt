When I look at the graphs, I see nothing spectacular here, except for one.  In all cases, they pretty much mirror every other country, which over time shows gradual declines.<p>That is, except for Cerebrovascular.<p>I have to wonder, what of WWII?<p>1) Almost every single Japanese city of any size was firebombed, and the cities being mostly wooden, most of those cities burned extensively.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ww2db.com&#x2F;battle_spec.php?battle_id=217" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ww2db.com&#x2F;battle_spec.php?battle_id=217</a>\n(scroll down a bit for a chart of some of the cities bombed, 50+?  More, even?)<p>In fact, the number of deaths from firebombing <i>dwarfed</i> the two nuclear bombs dropped.  Now imagine all of that smoke, burning varnish + paint + wood for days or weeks on end.<p>You may think that burning wood is not an issue, but people have died from burning pressure treated wood, as an example, due to the chemicals in it.  I don&#x27;t know what sort of treatments 1940s Japan had in its mostly wooden cities of the time, including buildings 100+ years old, but you can be sure they had something.  Pressure treating has been around since the early 1800s, but even staining&#x2F;coating wood with chemicals to kill pests (insects), is almost a certainty.<p>How does this affect a person&#x27;s body?  There is a lot of talk about diet, and diet is important, but what about creosote, a common preservation agent used on wood at the time?  There are all sorts of potential side effects, and as we known from some other conditions, it can take a long time to manifest.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.gov&#x2F;topicpages&#x2F;t&#x2F;tar+creosote+exposure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.gov&#x2F;topicpages&#x2F;t&#x2F;tar+creosote+exposure</a><p>Or, perhaps, damage is done... but does not exhibit itself until old age.  Meaning, &quot;near the end&quot;, the thing which gets you is &quot;what has been most weakened.&quot;<p>2) Of course, there were the bombs.  There were birth defects, raised cancer rates, on and on.<p>3) People with &#x27;bad outcomes&#x27; in those graphs peaking up to the 1970s, would have been 20 to 30 years old or so in the 40s.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying here is, 20-30 year olds during WWII would show as a peak in graphs during the 70s, potentially.<p>Why do the graphs start right when those who experienced WWII as adults, would be perhaps dying due to the effects of those conditions?<p>Ah well.  Just thoughts.')
