Although every engineering standard publication (FHWA 2011; TAC 1999) identifies pavement width as the most influential safety feature, discussion is surprisingly scarce (Hauer, 1999)</i><p>The article itself asserts that &quot;traffic engineers&quot; believe this to be safer, that &quot;every engineering standard publication&quot; agrees.<p>Whilst the article may, or may not provide a conflicting view (I haven&#x27;t the time to read it right now), it 100%, completely and totally agrees that roads are built this way <i>to promote safety</i>.  It agrees, stating that this is why engineers are building roads this way.<p>The very best you can argue is that &quot;this is wrong&quot;, but you cannot argue &quot;the purpose is not safety&quot;, for this is why engineers are doing it!<p>You are literally misrepresenting things.  Please stop.')
