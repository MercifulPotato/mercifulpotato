I even remember one co-worker telling that when he moved to Helsinki, he tried using car once to bring his kids to school &amp; coming to work after. He switched to metro after that one attempt and said it made things much easier.<p>Furniture, materials etc. are not usually things you are transporting daily (or even monthly). Personally when I needed those, I just either paid for home delivery or rented car for few hours.<p>I won&#x27;t claim that there are no need for car (e.g. there are some routes that take a longer with public transport compared to your own car &amp; there are ares which don&#x27;t have many connections available), but it&#x27;s not as critical as some people might think.')
