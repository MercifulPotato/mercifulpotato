It is also apparently designed to reduce competition \nin the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter.<p>&gt;5. Thus, AWS is violating Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act in \ncombination with Defendant Twitter. AWS is also breaching it contract with \nParler, which requires AWS to provide Parler with a thirty-day notice before \nterminating service, rather than the less than thirty-hour notice AWS actually \nprovided. Finally, AWS is committing intentional interference with prospective \neconomic advantage given the millions of users expected to sign up in the near \nfuture.<p>Remember, these are unchallenged claims from Parler.<p>I think the only interesting bit here is the 30h vs 30 day notice period. The cynic in me is interested to see the contract: if there was a 30 day notice in it, I imagine Parler could have gotten an emergency injunction to stay online. Unless there isn&#x27;t or parler preferred to be &quot;taken&quot; off line for PR reasons?<p>Sorry if that view is a bit conspiracy-theory-esque...')
