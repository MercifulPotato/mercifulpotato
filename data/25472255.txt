This is Expensive since they&#x27;re made in very low volumes and the cost of the new fab line can&#x27;t be spread among many millions of units. Instead, a few thousand chips might be made.<p>2: By design, where redundant systems such as triple redundant memory or voting computers are used. This is probably the most interesting as you can get into issues like the Byzantine Generals problem here. All the redundancy can be implemented in a single FPGA by simply routing out the design 3 times and using voting logic, assuming the FPGA is large enough.<p>3: By shielding. Just fly regular chips in a shielded box. This causes thermal issues, but is sometimes necessary, such as in Juno, which has to deal with the enormous radiation flux around Jupiter.')
