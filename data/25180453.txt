In the Netflix CDN, each node has a fixed library that&#x27;s restocked at fixed intervals, at least that&#x27;s what I remember from reading their requirement document for ISPs interested in having a CDN node in their network. The Google CDN is likely more dynamic with nodes having region dependent libraries but nothing that you can&#x27;t manage.')
