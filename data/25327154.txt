I appreciate the project as much as anyone interested in it, but let&#x27;s be real here. On top of that, no router will work efficiently <i>right after</i> installation, firewalled or otherwise. You have to give it time to find other routers and make connections. It&#x27;s just not suited for the immediateness almost everyone expects from everything nowadays. It needs a major revamp in order to increase its adoption.')
