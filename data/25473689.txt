Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=[25476859], score=None, time=1608336927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25473338, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see any comments about water on this post?<p>Looks like it was deleted.<p>&gt; - Sending a few kg of water (or other shielding) to space costs a fraction of the price of a fast non-rad-hardened CPU.<p>It doesn’t sound like a few kg is going to cut it. Recall that a 1 kg of water is about 1 L, which gives you about 6 cm of shielding, which is simply not enough. That’s less than 50% attenuation of the ionizing radiation you find in space. Mass increases with the cube of the thickness. If you want 20 cm of shielding, that’s 33 kg, and something like 86% attenuation.<p>It seems to me like there are better things you can do with your mass, which also needs to be spent on things like fuel for stationkeeping. Lower mass also means more satellites.<p>&gt; - It really costs less than the extra development cost associated with having to use bespoke toolchains.<p>POWER is not exactly some obscure ISA. It is well-supported and battle-tested. You don’t need a bespoke toolchain.')
