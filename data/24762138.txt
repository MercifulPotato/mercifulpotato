But their ultimate goal is presumably to make money, so I don’t expect them to make it easier for their customers to leave unless they’re forced to by regulation or an improbable level of churn over this particular issue. I’m not arguing that it’s morally right (or wrong, for that matter), but it’s exactly what I’d expect them to do given their incentives.')
