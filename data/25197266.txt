There are a range of methods and approaches to do this. The average cost for Air Capture across modern approaches is $250&#x2F;Ton of C02 Captured and Sequestered.<p>There are other approaches besides Atmospheric Capture and Sequestration which hold more promise\n1. High concentration C02 Emission Capture at source\n2. Ocean surface capture and de-acidification<p>Wrote a quick article describing all of them linking to specific research papers and their results here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectcelsius.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;29&#x2F;capture-methods&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectcelsius.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;29&#x2F;capture-methods&#x2F;</a><p>I expect this will follow a similar journey to how solar panel adoption went... once things tipped over the critical ($&#x2F;KWH) where it made sense over grid electrical, people started to adopt. I imagine once one of the techniques reaches a critical $&#x2F;TON Captured &amp; Sequestered, governments or institutions will pay to build whatever machines to start. Right now things are too expensive using any method (i.e. using the best method, it would cost ~$12 Trillion dollars to capture and sequester ~49 Gigatons - the estimated carbon emitted in 1 year by humans in 2020)')
