I also wonder how much the implicit beliefs that &quot;unrestrained capitalism is a bad thing&quot;, &quot;markets naturally lead towards monopolies&quot;, &quot;antitrust law is legitimately necessary&quot;, etc are impacting peoples&#x27; reasoning here.<p>(2) If they can&#x27;t actually compete and provide superior value to whatever managed offering Amazon can scrounge together, that&#x27;s actually their fault. AWS&#x27; managed elasticsearch offering is absolutely terrible, speaking from experience. They block access to important APIs like `reroute`, any minor cluster change results in a whole blue-green deployment which very frequently hits a race condition that prevents the newer cluster from ever coming up healthy, requiring a ticket to be filed that takes multiple days to respond to if you don&#x27;t have premium support, etc.<p>So functionally the idea that AWS is going to fleece them because they&#x27;ll offer a just-as-good service for cheaper has not been the case. Elastic co&#x27;s managed offering is simply far superior.<p>---<p>Ultimately, Elastic has shown that they don&#x27;t actually want to release FOSS. They want to release proprietary software, and that&#x27;s why the (in hindsight very easy to foresee)  usecase of a cloud provider offering a managed service angers them so much. They don&#x27;t really breathe the FOSS mindset, because a true non-restrictive license (BSD, Apache 2.0 etc) means that a company can absolutely use your software to make money and that&#x27;s okay.<p>Anyway, Elasticsearch is incredible software and the Elastic team has made something truly incredible. I just wish they had a vision for monetization that aligned with their open-source beginnings. It&#x27;s clear that they don&#x27;t, and the sooner they stop pretending they&#x27;re offering a free or open-source solution here, the better.')
