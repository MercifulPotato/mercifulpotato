Megasatellites for solar gain control would be an intensely scarce, valuable resource, and a de facto superweapon - &quot;agree to our terms or you&#x27;ll never have good crop growing sunlight again.&quot;<p>Nobody would be willing to cede or share control of such a system to someone else. Wars would break out quickly, and no deployed system would go undestroyed for long.<p>The other plans I&#x27;ve seen seem problematic to me either morally (&quot;first world gets to keep its tech but you guys who are bootstrapping with carbon can go DIAF&quot;), technologically (&quot;We think there will turn out to be some way to capture carbon super-efficiently that we haven&#x27;t found yet&quot;), or reversibility (&quot;whoops, we put too much dust in the atmosphere - guess we&#x27;re starving three billion people for the next year or four, folks&quot;).<p>I&#x27;m not saying there is no possible solution - just that I haven&#x27;t seen a realistic one myself.')
