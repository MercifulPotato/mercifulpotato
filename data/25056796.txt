I actually like that and would actually be prepared to give that kind of thing a try (backed up with version control of course)!<p>I use assertions pretty heavily in my code anyway but strong static typing does most of the heavy lifting and I&#x27;m grateful for it.<p>The company ultimately dumped eiffel (that was ~20 years ago) because it had promise and hype but little else. Pre&#x2F;post-conditions remain as a framework for thought as much as for coding.')
