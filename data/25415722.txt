There&#x27;s no nice way to put that. My opinion of Mayer just halved reading that, I had no idea she had been misleading Yahoo staff. What a pity.<p>I worked at Google for quite a long time and had multiple 20% projects. One of them went into production and now has (I&#x27;m told) a team of more than 20 people working on it full time, so the idea they can&#x27;t go live to users or become real products is totally wrong.<p>A few things were consistently true when I was there even in 2006:<p>• Some people would claim 20% time didn&#x27;t exist or was theoretical<p>• Other people would be simultaneously taking it and launching new products based on it<p>News started as a 20% thing. So did GMail, if I recall correctly. Google Sets, if you remember that. There were many, I&#x27;m just picking whatever examples spring to mind quickly.<p>Now, can I believe that at times teams were put under pressure and some managers asked people not to take it? Yeah, absolutely. I spent my time at Google on teams that were doing maintenance and operational time work, first as an SRE and later on a did a tour on the front line fighting spam and hijacking. Those are the sorts of things where there are no product driven &quot;crunch times&quot; (except when there&#x27;s an attack). So the culture there is maybe more conducive to side projects.<p>But the idea that it never existed at all is just a lie, sorry. It existed for me across multiple parts of the company and a span of nearly 8 years.')
