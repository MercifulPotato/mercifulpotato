Being from a blue-collar fundamentalist Christian family he just got an elementary education in reading and arithmetic before apprenticing as a book-binder. However he was an ardent fan of the Royal Society&#x27;s public science lectures. He eventually wrangled a lab assistantship with the  college educated scientist Humphrey Davies, eventually to surpass him in important discoveries.<p>P.S. in a few months (Sept 21, 1821) is the bicentennial of Faraday&#x27;s invention of the electric motor- one of the most important inventions of the modern era.')
