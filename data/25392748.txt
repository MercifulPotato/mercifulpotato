Item(by='Kliment', descendants=None, kids=[25393273], score=None, time=1607727579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25392505, text='No vaccine can entirely prevent transmission of an airborne pathogen that replicates in the upper airways - there&#x27;s not enough blood flow there, so some replication will always happen before the immune system reacts sufficiently, and during that time transmission is possible. However, all available data suggests that the vaccine-initiated immune response would <i>dramatically</i> reduce the transmission probability by both reducing viral load and reducing the time window for successful transmission. This effect has not been measured with this particular vaccine because it can only be measured for a very short period immediately after infection. It&#x27;s very hard to do this unless you intentionally trigger an infection and that&#x27;s why we have no data. (This is called a &quot;challenge study&quot; and it&#x27;s been done with animals but not humans. There&#x27;s a plan to do one with volunteers in January.)<p>Lots of anti-vaccine fuckers have latched onto the &quot;it can&#x27;t prevent transmission&quot; part of this and are using it to discredit vaccines. Lots of people with insufficient information are repeating this statement because they don&#x27;t know better.')
