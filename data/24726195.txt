It is a very interesting language. Personally I find it fascinating (coming from imperative languages). Some blog posts are really worth the high ranking.<p>2. It&#x27;s an enthusiats language. They tend to be emotional on their subject. That&#x27;s why Rust is indeed overpromoted compared to other languages. People getting their stuff done are often using boring tools like Java, C&#x2F;C++ or Go and are not hanging around here in language threads very often.<p>Rust is not prevalent in the industry at all. People reporting how it&#x27;s used by Microsoft and Amazon etc. are not telling lies, but often forget to see the big picture. Compared to C&#x2F;C++ or Java Rust&#x27;s usage is tiny. Less than 1%. I&#x27;d say even less then 0.01 % worldwide in terms of people using it, lines of code written daily, project budget spend on. But how often are people writing posts &quot;Why we adopted Java&quot; or &quot;How we improved backend performance by 300% using C++&quot;? Rust is kind of vocal, so the overall picture of it&#x27;s usage is quite distorted.<p>Still, the usage of Rust has been going up the last 5 years. So it is gaining. And it&#x27;s a great fit for certain tasks.')
