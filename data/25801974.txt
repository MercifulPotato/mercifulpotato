There&#x27;s so many more languages now days than just Java. I would love for Swift to take off. Don&#x27;t get me wrong there is a lot in the Java ecosystem, but it&#x27;s age is showing. And it&#x27;s not lightweight. If I&#x27;m trying to spawn processes quickly it&#x27;s not Java. If I want to run 100 instances of something, the RAM is going to cost me. JS and other fast to boot languages are also much more adaptable to serverless.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s no room for Java any more, but &quot;just Java&quot; meeeeeeh.')
