Compare Wuhan and New York WAY less death in Wuhan, with a much harsher authoritarian style lockdown (maximum mental duress you&#x27;d think).<p>Or Melbourne Australia with a very strict lockdown compared with pick any major American city you like. Major difference in death rates.<p>Edit: The trolley problem is really easy if one option kills 10,000 people and the other one kills 5... that&#x27;s kind of difference we are talking about.')
