I&#x27;ve found the best way to do so is to start playing them, then sleep my phone (iPhone), and then press the sleep button again to get the video&#x2F;audio controls to appear. From there, I can start it playing again, but with just audio, and no risk of tapping other buttons. I assume it also saves some battery life to not have the video actually playing. If I were on Android, I&#x27;d definitely look for a solution like this!')
