(I would eventually tell my dad that I <i>did</i> feel like I had a fire lit under my ass before I found amphetamine, I just had felt like it was engulfing me and I couldn&#x27;t muster to move.)<p>I live abroad in South America right now and I fly back every three months to refill my script, that&#x27;s how much it has improved my life. Though I just took a year-long break from the drug.<p>Btw, I switched from Adderall XR to Vyvanse about half way through my amphetamine career. Definitely was an upgrade: a more gradual curve and ~no come-down.<p>Anyways, the talk of amphetamine and ADHD (whatever that loosely understood umbrella word includes) is a lot like the talk of opioid painkillers: yes, there&#x27;s abuse, but the conversation can&#x27;t just stop there.')
