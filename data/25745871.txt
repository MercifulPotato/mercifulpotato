If you did something morally reprehensible, then it doesn&#x27;t become outdated unless you apologize and promise that you&#x27;ll never do it again, or that you in the least admit that you made a mistake. I do not know if Facebook did that before ending their contract. Either way people and companies who misuse trust like that still deserve criticism. That&#x27;s the only way we can make sure that things change for the better.')
