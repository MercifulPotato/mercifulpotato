It’s great on recordings, and much cooler to be in the room with it live.<p>I’ve also recently come to love (especially the first half&#x2F;performance of) Terry Riley’s Persian Surgery Dervishes.  With just an organ and a delay pedal, he builds such a trancelike, subdued and dark yet pleasant mood.')
