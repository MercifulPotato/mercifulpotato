Once the big boys come. I think I&#x27;ve heard this being repeated ever since 2013. But hearing it for 8 years makes me believe somewhat less that most of these old school manufacturers will ever bother to do much. Except for Volkswagen, they seem to be taking EVs seriously.<p>Other old car companies sure do talk a lot, but there&#x27;s little action. They might have okish EVs, but no plans to truly mass manufacture them. Once they finally get to it, it&#x27;ll be too late.<p>We&#x27;ll see. Tesla is a &quot;big boy&quot; itself now. They got capital to make things happen.')
