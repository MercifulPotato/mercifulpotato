Trust is a resource like a rainforest: you can exploit it sustainably, or you can get a far greater profit by destroying it. Trusting people are a resource that can be exploited for fraud, which the internet is <i>great</i> at producing. It&#x27;s not really surprising that random organizations find low trust.<p>It is however very unfortunate, as historically being a &quot;high trust society&quot; has been a great advantage of the west.
