They have convinced themselves that their recommendation system maximizes engagement, so anything that pulls users away from that is a pottential threat to growth of attention directed toward ads. They will tolerate these power-user style methods as long as they remain statistically unpopular among users. I seriously doubt they would willingly provide a button that negates the fruits of the targeting work at the core of their business model.')
