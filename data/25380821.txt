If you&#x27;re an hourly freelancer with more work in your queue than hours in the day, it can make sense to order DoorDash so you can continue working billable hours. The alternative is to stop working, prepare food, and lose out on that marginal income.<p>Meanwhile, most salaried people or hourly workers on fixed schedules aren&#x27;t actually saving any money this way because they were never giving up billable hours in the first place.<p>A more accurate way to read this story is &quot;How much are people willing to pay to save time?&quot;')
