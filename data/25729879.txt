They can also be sold to multiple different entities looking to build bot nets or whatever it is that people who are always wearing Guy Fawkes masks while sitting in dark rooms do. If you&#x27;re paying just 5-20K, you&#x27;re kind of counting on the people who find the exploit being nice and doing the right thing.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s mitigated because people with the know-how to find exploits like that are usually well-educated and not desperately in need of money, but people can be greedy.')
