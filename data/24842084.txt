Julia-centric tooling for coarse-grained workflow orchestration, experiment tracking, data provenance, etc. would be nice, though I also think existing generic tools in this vein (e.g. Argo) could probably compose well too :)<p>A few different companies have nice in-house implementations of these kinds of setups, and Julia Computing is building a nice looking commercial product suite in this vein that I look forward to exploring more in the future (especially JuliaHub and JuliaRun).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;juliacon-2020-open-source-bof-follow-up&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;juliacon-2020-open-source...</a>')
