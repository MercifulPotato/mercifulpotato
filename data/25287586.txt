It shifts blame onto individuals and performs the old trick of providing a method to calm our conscience (I&#x27;m not watching videos in HD, so I&#x27;m good, we can go on as normal). This trick has been pulled on us rather spectacularly with plastics recycling: manufacturers print the recycling symbol on everything, we dutifully sort our garbage and put stuff into recycling bins, and we feel good continuing to use lots of plastic, even though all this does nothing for the planet.<p>Not to mention that the <i>actual</i> carbon footprint difference in this case is likely completely insignificant in the grand scheme of things.')
