It was a great movie and blew my mind. But it can’t compare to the original. There’s something \noperatic and timeless about the original that the remake doesn’t have. It’s much less polished but rawer in a sense. I think it will still be a classic 50 years from now and eminently watchable but I can’t say the same about 2049 as great as it was. The remake is a great movie but just a movie if you understand my meaning.')
