It refers to how much time a defender has had to fix their systems, a zero-day implying that even the most prudent defender could not have prevented the attack; and a day-1 (or day-x) attack implying that the defender might have closed the vulnerability if they had been sufficiently fast in monitoring for the existence of the problem and fixing their systems.<p>So there certainly could be zero-day exploits for vulnerabilities that are known but not yet fixable, perhaps because the vulnerability did not seem easily exploitable and thus not urgent to the vendor.')
