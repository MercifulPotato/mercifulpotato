The former is about quelling ideas and latter is about fomenting violence against &quot;others&quot;.<p>Conflating the two is disingenuous at best.<p>As for &quot;ideas&quot;, look at what Fox News has done to political discourse in America and tell me that&#x27;s a good thing. I&#x27;m against outright censorship but they really push the limits of &quot;free speech&quot;. From my point of view, they engage in stochastic terrorism and do not engage in good faith.')
