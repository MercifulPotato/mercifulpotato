If someone commits a crime we think they should get whatever comes their way, but people make mistakes and I want to live in a society where someone can screw up, but work hard to improve themselves and become a productive member of society. If you have two children and one is constantly bullying the other, you dont take the bullied child out for icecream everytime because that doesnâ€™t improve the situation in the long term. You put the time and energy into the misbehaving one to correct the situation forever.')
