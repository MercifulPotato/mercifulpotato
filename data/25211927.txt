Our (formerly 3) roosters definitely started showing aggression before 6 months. Furthermore, the repeated mounting of the hens is pretty abusive - chicken sex, I&#x27;m sorry to say, is pretty much rape.<p>That said, as you noted, on an industrial scale you would separate the roosters. But it&#x27;s not clear that there&#x27;s <i>any market at all</i> for rooster meat. Chicken meat is incredibly cheap and adds surprisingly little margin above the main input cost - feed. Roosters consume just as much feed but produce a lesser quantity of inferior meat. The margins are likely to be negative.<p>It&#x27;s an efficiency story yes, but of the &quot;you&#x27;ll go bankrupt with this idea&quot; sort.')
