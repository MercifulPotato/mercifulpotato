I&#x27;m sure they want to reach voters, not politicians.<p>But either way, why say &quot;old white&quot; when the point is that they are old enough to read print media. They are targeted because they are old, not because of their color. Why bring race into it, except for virtue signalling?<p>Besides, doesn&#x27;t the ad appear on-line as well?')
