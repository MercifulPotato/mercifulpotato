It&#x27;s ignorant of what actually has been happening to the oppressed people in this country since... forever? And is trying to equate someone, who is generally in a position of power (a middle class white woman) to minority groups who have experienced racism since this country&#x27;s founding.<p>Food for thought: In the (rough) words of John Mulaney, if you equate something to another word, but you won&#x27;t even say the other word, then one is clearly worse than the other.')
