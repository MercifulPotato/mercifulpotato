We obviously struggle with the downsides of large group size and these dynamics are often our bottleneck.<p>The nuance is: An organism can be highly evolved to tolerate something that is outside its optimal range. A fish might be evolved to tolerate really low oxygen. That lets them live where other fish can&#x27;t, less competition. But... that same fish&#x27;s &quot;optimal range&quot; for health or whatnot might be different. Same with temperature, where I think most of the research is.')
