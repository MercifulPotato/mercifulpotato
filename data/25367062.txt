I don&#x27;t know what I would call that practice but it is <i>not</i> any kind of &quot;open source circle of life&quot;.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a part of the product&#x27;s life cycle that&#x27;s in any startup book.<p>There are many start-ups <i>truly</i> committed to open source development. Conversely, there are many who are not but are pretty upfront and honest about how they are not. I don&#x27;t judge either one as I&#x27;d rather not be a zealot, and one ought to do what one ought to do.<p>However, there are also some companies (thankfully a minority, as far as I can tell) who are not really committed whatsoever to open source, but still <i>pretend</i> to be (often using marketing speak like &quot;the ideology is in our blood&quot;) for the sake of good publicity. <i>Those</i> I don&#x27;t like, but then again most of them are large corporations, so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s much one can do in that area.')
