Larger projects often get split into multiple sub-projects, especially in git-age languages like ruby, js or Rust. The same rules apply there: often such projects get created by their original authors and then work for the most part, so don&#x27;t see any changes for years. So the effects translate into multi-repo projects as well.<p>To give an example, in Rust the mime crate has over 14 million downloads, but the last git commit was in January 2020. So it will fall out of Github&#x27;s search index soon, even though it&#x27;s used by everyone who uses the reqwest crate, which is a lot of people.<p>In fact, likely some people will run cargo vendor and then upload the results to github often enough that it&#x27;ll show up in search results, but instead of the canonical location you&#x27;ll have to look at vendored repos... not really nice.')
