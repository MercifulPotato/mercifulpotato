Within a few months my friend moved from consulting to managing a data team at Amazon Fresh and a few of our meetup members nailed their dream jobs too. During COVID, meetups moved to online and we pivoted to build a digital service WOJO (from: work + mojo).<p>WOJO makes career change dreams more real and the process less scary. Our algorithm offers a personalised sequence of bite-size tasks allowing users to make incremental progress towards their career goal. Unlike human coaches, WOJO lets you move at your own pace and it is available 24&#x2F;7, to tackle the problem of lack of time and energy that many career changers have.<p>Becoming a startup founder is a career change for most of us so hopefully this resonates with a few of you and I could pick your brains on that. What was the most challenging part of your transition into entrepreneurship? What was the best thing you did to tackle this change of professional identity? If you have a minute to try our MVP â€“ does it resonate with the challenges you have been facing in this career change?<p>Thank you a lot in advance,\nLiz')
