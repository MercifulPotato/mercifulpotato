The price is determined by trades.  That&#x27;s what a trade is.  You can be sitting on 99% of a company, but as long as that 1% of shares is active in a market it will determine what gets reported as the share price.<p>And yes, someone with infinite resources can absolutely push a share price down.  Borrow every share you can and sell it at $1, for example.  Obviously no one does this because it&#x27;s a terrible investment decision, but it&#x27;s certainly possible.')
