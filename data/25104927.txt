There is some federal involvement, but it&#x27;s mostly up to the states to implement.<p>One often-cited advantage of this approach is that it makes it difficult to attack a presidential election because you&#x27;d have to work across different state voting systems.<p>So a national mandate would face opposition on the federalism issue.')
