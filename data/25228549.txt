The TB implementation is more limited than Enigmail expert mode, which I think was part of their original plan: open PGP up for wider use.<p>It&#x27;s a small team, and this was announced I think nearly a year ago. It&#x27;s a pity that apparently the import isn&#x27;t without issue, but I can see how they expect expert users to be able to fix any problems they encounter.<p>The whole multiple keychain-thing is or was not communicated clearly anywhere ever, I&#x27;ve stumbled on this before. That&#x27;s part of the bad design though, a keychain file would have made so much more sense and be easier to reason about than configuring it through arcane gpg incantations. I steered clear of it, but I&#x27;m surprised that Enigmail supported it (did it?).<p>Anyway, one &#x27;internal&#x27; ring is a very good idea, and I&#x27;m happy TB went that way. That was a very conscious decision, as Openpgp.js development is much more active and open, so don&#x27;t count on this changing.<p>The new UI could use some polishing (one or zero click encryption please!) but generally I am happy, and happy that I don&#x27;t need Enigmail anymore.')
