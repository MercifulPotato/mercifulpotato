That doesn&#x27;t mean that the spec has to be written once and frozen, as long as everyone is aware of the changes and adapts accordingly.<p>True! I wonder if there&#x27;s a good way to actually keep teams abreast. I actually end up writing specs by hand from time to time when I just want to get started quickly, but it can be such a pain.<p>Oh but one of the cool things I was able to set up is automatic generation of client libs (and pushing to a git repo) with GitLab -- it&#x27;s really awesome to be able to automatically generate client libs that match your API versions.<p>&gt; I have indeed started the development when I found that connexion does not completely meet my requirements. The main difference is that pyotr supports ASGI, so can work with any ASGI framework (I haven&#x27;t tried it with Mangum yet, but am planning to). Additionally, pyotr has a client component, which was inspired by Bravado.<p>So I didn&#x27;t actually know what ASGI was until I read your existing documentation! I&#x27;m not a huge python person but I&#x27;d heard of WSGI and some of the other variants but hadn&#x27;t heard of ASGI! Thanks for the background on the client as well')
