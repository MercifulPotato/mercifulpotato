They&#x27;re probably trying to ride the hype train.<p>That said, you should always wait for third party benchmarks from a source you trust, with benchmarks that relate to your production workloads. I like Anandtech, Phoronix, and Gamers Nexus for such reviews. The last, despite the name, includes a decent swath of non-gaming benchmarks, and they are incredibly transparent about benchmarking methodology, which I appreciate.<p>With the necessary caveat out of the way, some observations:<p>If the IPC gains are there, and we&#x27;re seeing similar or higher clocks (which seems to be the case), then you should expect a pretty good uplift to non-gaming performance.<p>The cache architecture optimization should also be a boon to many workloads outside of gaming.')
