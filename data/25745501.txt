Contributions go to a private email instead of a public mailing list. All development happens in private and pushed to the public in a version bump with no changelog.<p>So yeah it has an AGPL License (which is good) and meets the minimum of FOSS requirements, but it gives of the feeling that they&#x27;re following the letter, but not the spirit of FOSS.<p>I would definitely not use it or push any friend to use it.')
