There are lots of different people involved with a mixture of motivations. It&#x27;s not just playing out in a single forum, either.<p>And while I&#x27;d agree making a &quot;quick buck&quot; is a driving factor, arguably &quot;the&quot; driving factor, that term is also relative.

It&#x27;s out-of-place to talk about these folks making a quick buck when average trade times are measured in seconds and money is made based on having a PHYSICAL location that enables faster trades by nanoseconds.')
