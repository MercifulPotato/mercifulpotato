Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610404643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737744, text='&gt;  I agree that my question should be able to stand alone but I think it would not have worked well in this case. As it is, this popular post has been flagged and buried so oh well.<p>That is why those disclaimers should not be added: they don&#x27;t appease the mob while they might turn those who actually do support whatever it is you disavow away. In short, they have a negative net-value. As to the flagging, burying and downvoting which this place is rife with I can only hope that those who do the flagging and downvoting know they are part of the problem, not part of the solution but they can not suppress the urge to click that link or that arrow to ease their discomfort on seeing a differing opinion - there, that&#x27;ll show you, you witch, you heretic! - even though they know they poison the well by doing so. Eventually we will have to coexist in a mostly peaceful way (in the true sense of the word, not in the burning-buildings sense which it gained last summer) so we will need to be on speaking terms no matter our opinions. United we stand, divided we fight, fall, fail.')
