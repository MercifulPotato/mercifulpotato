Let&#x27;s not dispute and go with your claim of 25Hz.<p>Even then, the problem is that eyes don&#x27;t work like cameras or monitors. Our eyes don&#x27;t work with &quot;frames&quot;. Each receptor updates on its own time. It&#x27;s easy to see that, if the updates are staggered, multiple sensors could perceive higher frame-rates, even if they can&#x27;t individually.<p>However, there&#x27;s another angle to this. Disregarding input lag, which is a very real phenomenon and is greatly shortened by higher refresh, higher refresh rate monitors are able to show more &#x27;discrete&#x27; steps for anything that&#x27;s in motion. Our eyes (and brains) perceive this as movement &#x27;smoothness&#x27;, even if they can&#x27;t quite make out every single frame that&#x27;s displayed.<p>You should try that yourself. Do a blind test.')
