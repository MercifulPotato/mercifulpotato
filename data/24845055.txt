The app is fully functioning with the ability to check into a location like Facebook or foursquare.  Users can communicate with active photographers and schedule right there on the spot for photography.  The new price unlock feature enables photographers to assign prices.  Lastly, the sharing function gives customers the ability to think about the purchase you dont have to make the sale right away. Prospects can walk away with a link to the photos and decide to buy or decline.  All images are protected with a watermark, and all sales are final!  The app is powered by PayPal Braintree.  If you know a photographer or are a photographer yourself, please test the app.  The spooky season is a good opportunity to get photos while you are in costume.')
