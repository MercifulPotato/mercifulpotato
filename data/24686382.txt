Yes, I knew that packets coming in trigger a hardware interrupt that wakes up the thread processing them - but as we had multiple other threads actually decoding this data, there isn&#x27;t a good way to wake those up from the receiving thread. The sleep(1) and check for work was the best solution, as every other method&#x2F;API we tried had the same problem of ultimately being limited by the system timer interrupt, and we couldn&#x27;t get around it in any way.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say that there definitely isn&#x27;t a way to do this - but we never found it.')
