Just before the financial crisis the market average was around 25. Before the dotcom bust it was 25-30.<p>TSLA is at 1,671 LOL!!!<p>The market right now is around 40. Obviously technically we are in a recession but the stock market is going up. So where&#x27;s the crash?<p>What are your typical measures that we have a massive market crash coming? If people believe this they will move their money to something that shouldnt crash or at least are isolated. Amazon is sky high as well.<p>Bitcoin is at $40,000. Ethereum is way up as well.<p>Gold is way up.<p>Bond market is way down(implying people are buying bonds in droves) Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Switzerland are all negative interest rates.<p>The thing about the summer and covid lockdowns. People got out to spend money in the summer due to lockdown being over. We are now back to lockdown. Which means earnings calls are going to be bad.<p>Late spring we will be seeing the crash. People are moving their money now to safer places. Tesla, Amazon, Gold, Bitcoin, Bonds is how they are doing it.<p>When the crash comes, it will likely not be Tesla.')
