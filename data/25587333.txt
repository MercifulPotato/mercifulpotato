Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=[25589194], score=None, time=1609369339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586374, text='Their track record seems neither compelling nor skepticism-worthy, I think, often because a lot of their conclusions lined up with already widely accepted hypotheses (e.g. that MMR vaccines don&#x27;t cause autism and that MH17 was shot down by DNR), and a lot of the controversial things naturally remain unknown.<p>The most interesting - where public opinion was against and Rootclaim was for, and it was later shown Rootclaim was far more likely to be right - seem to be the deaths of Barry and Honey Sherman [0] and that MH370 vanished due to pilot suicide [1].<p>I think where the rubber would meet the road is if they&#x27;re ever shown to be correct about the Syrian chemical attacks [2], where they draw the opposite conclusion Bellingcat did, and of course about the COVID-19 origin.<p>If they do turn out to be right about those, that would grant them major credibility points, I think; though the conclusions there may never be known one way or another. If they are right about COVID-19, it would also make me view Bret Weinstein with a lot more credibility, since he&#x27;s been advocating the likelihood of the lab leak hypothesis for a while.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;rootclaim_track_record#barry_and_honey_sherman" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;rootclaim_track_record#barry_and_h...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;rootclaim_track_record#MH_370" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;rootclaim_track_record#MH_370</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;rootclaim_track_record#syrian_chemical_attacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;rootclaim_track_record#syrian_chem...</a>')
