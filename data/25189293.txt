As a semi-practical example use case my raspberry pi 3b runs shairport and pihole in separate docker containers which has been a breeze to configure and has no noticeable slowness. Just being able to try new containers and services without having to worry about messing up your root environment (which would take re imaging the sd card among other things) makes it worth doing for my use. I think if you’re comparing it to a production workload you’re in the wrong ballpark.')
