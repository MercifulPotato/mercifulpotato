More RAM, more cores, more GPU, more ports, eGPU capability.  It&#x27;s already a fairly convenient size that you can buy server racks and brackets for.<p>The new system design I want to see is an update on the 11&quot; MacBook Air or the 12&quot; MacBook.  I&#x27;d like to see if they can get a clamshell with good battery life and decent performance under two pounds and just wide enough for a full-size keyboard.  The 11&quot; MacBook Air is still my favorite laptop I&#x27;ve ever owned; I&#x27;m sad they discontinued it and didn&#x27;t refresh the design.  Maybe it can come back with an M1 or M2 chip, though.')
