Item(by='Zanfa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603378503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857907, text='+1 for Leap V2 from me as well, I&#x27;ve had it for a few years now and I only have good things to say about it. I actually bought the Herman Miller Aeron first, but didn&#x27;t find it very comfortable because of the hard plastic frame around the mesh seat, so I ended up returning it. The only thing I miss a bit is how the Aeron offered back support when you lean forward, which the Leap doesn&#x27;t do.<p>For me the Leap is less of a gamble, it&#x27;s much closer to a regular office chair than the Aeron, but still worth the price, it just makes other chairs feel flimsy and still looks brand new after the years I&#x27;ve had it.')
