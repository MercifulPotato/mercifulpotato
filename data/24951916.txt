Eastern philosophies tend to believe the truth lies between opposing views. In western philosophies, it is generally believed that one side is right and one side is wrong. We even see this in the adversarial basis of our judicial system (a fair fight between two parties will produce the truth). Our primary and voting system is partly to blame here. Extreme candidates in primaries get more support because their voters are more driven. Since primaries take place at different times, the first states might have 6 candidates and the last states to vote might have only one or two.<p>I think your last two paragraphs allude to a belief I have - democracy is only as &quot;good&quot; (rational, reasonable, logical, etc) as the citizens are. I wish schools taught philosophy of argument  classes (logic).')
