Apple deserves some of the negativity for not letting that happen.<p>However, known user hostile players trying to have a go at people&#x27;s personal devices under the guise of competition is something that we as consumers should be equally wary of. Because in the end, we won&#x27;t be given much choice. Monopolies are not something exclusive to Apple, and big players will use <i>their</i> own monopolistic power to coerce users to install their privacy invading app store.')
