Not &quot;reasonable chance&quot; according to your random opinion, but a judge and jury and various council go through a legal case and legally find him guilty.<p>If someone is running towards you with a knife shouting religious scripture, are you going to stand still and think to yourself &quot;I&#x27;m going to assume this person is innocent until they are convicted of my murder in a court of law&quot;? No, you&#x27;re going to consider the possibility that they actually might intend to murder you, and you&#x27;ll take appropriate precautions.<p>Innocent until proven guilty is a concept for the court of law, not for the court of public opinion. People are allowed to hold opinions and thoughts regarding how dangerous other people are.')
