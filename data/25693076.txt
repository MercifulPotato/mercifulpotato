Social media is on the list.<p>Ah, reading that opened my eyes because, personally, I really couldn&#x27;t disagree more. I suspect that disagreement on this is behind much of why people don&#x27;t see eye-to-eye on this &quot;private censorship&quot; issue. I know very few people who use social media, and I don&#x27;t see anything lacking from their role in society as a result. No offense, just my $0.02. :-)')
