They don&#x27;t serve the workers, they serve themselves (like pretty much any organization).<p>Tech workers are in so much demand that they don&#x27;t really suffer such a disparity of negotiating power, like workers in other industries.<p>Many software companies offer equity, which makes employers the shareholders. What&#x27;s good for shareholders is also good for a lot of tech employees.<p>Also, barriers to entry in software are almost 0. If you can&#x27;t get someone to treat you well, you can have your own software company paying your bills in 6 months, or VCs funding your startup.<p>Given all that I personally think the downsides of unions in tech would be much higher than the upsides. I would rather see more laws universally protecting intellectual workers like e.g. non-enforcability of non-compete clauses and alikes.')
