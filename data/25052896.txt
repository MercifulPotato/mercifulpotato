The question is, how far will they go?<p>Will they build a discrete GPU, or continue their AMD partnership, or try to convince everyone that their integrated graphics are good enough? Will they build a massive multicore chip to challenge Threadripper? Will they go to higher TDP and push single core performance even more, or will they relax and just use medium TDP parts that still outperform Intel&#x27;s best?<p>I&#x27;m excited to learn the answers to these questions in the next year or two.')
