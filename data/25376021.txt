Item(by='dustinmoris', descendants=None, kids=[25378348, 25376554], score=None, time=1607621200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25375754, text='&gt; you wouldn&#x27;t be able to easily move to the UK if it was not for the freedom of movement<p>Neither you nor I can know this at this point, since I&#x27;m already here.<p>&gt; The only reason you were able to _easily_ immigrate to the UK is because of freedom of movement<p>This is factually wrong and is at most your personal opinion. There are many reasons why someone can immigrate _easily_. For example the UK is currently recruiting many doctors and nurses and people of those professions will have it significantly _easier_ to move to the UK than others.<p>&gt; I have numerous friends and people I studied and worked with over the last 12 years in the UK that couldn&#x27;t stay.<p>I also have numerous friends and people who I worked with and they could stay. So could my family members who also moved to the UK from a non EU country.<p>&gt; Every time I discussed with them their visa situation and attempts to stay in the country, I thanked god that where I emigrated from, we&#x27;ve joined the European Union and I don&#x27;t have to deal with these issues.<p>This is partly the fault of having no control over EU immigration, forcing richer EU countries to have harsher restriction on non EU countries (this is even more true for other EU countries, the UK is already much friendlier in its immigration laws in comparison to the others in the EU).<p>&gt; You, as a EU national, can look for a job and work here without a permit, you can reside here without a permit, you can stay here after studies or employment, and from legal point of view, you enjoy equal, non-discriminatory treatment with same rights and access to employment, working conditions, social &amp; health security and tax advantages as UK citizens<p>Yes, so my EU passport elevates me above other nationalities. Not exactly something to be proud of in my honest opinion. I rather compete on an even playing field, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.<p>&gt; No, you cannot have the same and &quot;move to any other country in the world which isn&#x27;t part of the EU as well, so clearly my freedom has nothing to do with the current 4 &quot;freedoms&quot;.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s just your personal opinion and if I had a desire to move to another non EU country I&#x27;d probably prove you wrong. Where there is a will there is a way. I&#x27;m certain that I could find a job, get a work permit and build a life elsewhere and eventually naturalise there if I decide to call it my home.')
