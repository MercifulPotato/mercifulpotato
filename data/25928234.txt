That lie in turn gets retweeted by millions of people. Next, Biden posts a retraction. Do all of his followers also have to post a retraction? Does Twitter have to implement some kind of retweet retraction mechanic?<p>What if the original user is obscure and someone famous quote tweets a big fat lie instead of inventing their own big-fat lie? Does it make a difference if the quoter was agreeing with the original?<p>How do you deal with users who refuse to post a retraction or even leave twitter entirely? Is there an auto-retraction? Who decides if and when something is retracted?<p>&gt; The requirement to surface corrections as widely as the original item<p>Imagine for a moment you are running an obscure little website, &quot;The 2nd amendment times&quot;, and you post a little story on your blog about how Obama is getting appointed to replace Biden in 2024 and he&#x27;s coming to take everyone&#x27;s guns. All 17 of your readers read your story and laugh it off except one passes it on to Rush Limbaugh who Tweets it.<p>Now 17 million people blow up your blog. You are featured on Fox News and dozens of top right-wing pundits repost your site.<p>Who is &quot;accountable&quot; here? How would this get retracted? If you post a new article on the front page of your blog saying you dreamt the whole thing after smoking too much weed, does that make it all good even though only your original 17 readers are likely to see this correction?')
