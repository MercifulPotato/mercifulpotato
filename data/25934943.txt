Due to a lack of planning on multiple levels, I had to stay an extra two weeks.  I went to get a refill for a prescription I need.<p>The pharmacist was clearly unconformable with the discussion that needed to happen.  They informed me there would be a charge for the medicine.  After some back and forth because neither of us was fluent in the other&#x27;s language, it turned out they were asking me to pay the cost of the drug, an amount of money less than my normal copay, and something like 5% of what my insurance claimed the drug normally cost.<p>The pharmacist was most confused why I was happy to pay.  I don&#x27;t think they believed me when I tried to explain how much it normally cost me.')
