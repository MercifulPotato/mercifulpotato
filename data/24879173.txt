I looked him up.. and found that the movie <i>3 Idiots</i> was loosely based on his first novel! I love that movie so much, and it got me into the wonderful world of 21st C Indian cinema.<p><i>3 Idiots</i> (2009) and <i>PK</i> (2014) are my favourites. The best of the other recent Indian movies I&#x27;ve seen:<p>Barfi! (2012), Mardaani (2014), Lagaan (2001), Rocket Singh (2009), Dangal (2016), Dabba (2013), Black (2005), Rang de Basanti (2006), Taare Zameen Par (2007), Dhobi Ghat (2010), Secret Superstar (2017), My Name Is Khan (2010)')
