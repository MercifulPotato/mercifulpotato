I misunderstood the first time round. You presented a theory that Apple implemented Emacs keybindings for Cocoa text input widgets not because of Emacs per se, but rather, mainly for consistency with bash. It&#x27;s an interesting theory, but without a history lesson backed up by sources it&#x27;s still a theory.<p>For the record I don&#x27;t underestimate how much effort Apple puts into system-wide consistent behaviors in macOS. &lt;s&gt;Also, zsh&#x27;s default keybinding mode is Emacs mode.&lt;&#x2F;s&gt; (Of course, you did mention that.)')
