Cutter contains all the same components as r2, it just layers a GUI on top of them.<p>(I find the conflation of minimalness with elaborateness of GUI a bit amusing.  Like when people say that xterm is more minimal than gnome-terminal, when in fact the two have similar featuresets and xterm is if anything more bloated.)')
