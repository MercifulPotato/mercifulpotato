I&#x27;m not sure if blaming US actions for China&#x27;s social loss is fair. Bills to pay, kids to feed -- is that the responsibility of the US government? Without a doubt China is not the most innocent country. They push their weight around with other countries and significantly impact their economy. Did you forget how unethical and dangerous their government is? Tiananmen square, Uighur Muslims, Hong Kong, Taiwan .. my heart does not bleed for them, not for a second.')
