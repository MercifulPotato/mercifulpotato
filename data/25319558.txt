They often say this in a very nasty way.<p>5) She responds in a firm but not rude way that she believes they are wrong. She cites sources.<p>6) This person never responds again, and drops off.<p>7) A new person weighs in, generally rudely, making ad hominem attacks about her weight or whatever else they can.<p>8) She argues with them as well, never personally attacking them. She focuses on facts and statistics.<p>9) Over the course of hours she starts to accumulate likes and a significant number of people thumbs up her responses despite not saying anything.<p>I don’t know how she manages it, honestly. I can’t argue like this at all, it’s completely draining. She likes to think that because the threads are so active that hundreds of people are watching and she’s helping to change minds to think more rationally. But it’s hard to know for sure, and I don’t think most people have the psychological wherewithal that she has to deal with how abrasive and rude all these people are to her.')
