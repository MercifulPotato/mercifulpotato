But AWS continues to do a great job commoditizing their complements, and tackled SFTP back in 2018 when they launched...<p>“<i>... AWS Transfer for SFTP, a fully-managed, highly-available SFTP service. You simply create a server, set up user accounts, and associate the server with one or more Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets. You have fine-grained control over user identity, permissions, and keys. You can create users within Transfer for SFTP, or you can make use of an existing identity provider. You can also use IAM policies to control the level of access granted to each user. You can also make use of your existing DNS name and SSH public keys, making it easy for you to migrate to Transfer for SFTP. Your customers and your partners will continue to connect and to make transfers as usual, with no changes to their existing workflows.”</i><p><i>“You have full access to the underlying S3 buckets and you can make use of many different S3 features including lifecycle policies, multiple storage classes, several options for server-side encryption, versioning, and so forth.”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;aws&#x2F;new-aws-transfer-for-sftp-fully-managed-sftp-service-for-amazon-s3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;aws&#x2F;new-aws-transfer-for-sftp-f...</a><p>Because this did not exist for a decade, it seems most folks don’t know it exists today.')
