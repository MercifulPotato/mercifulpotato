Aside from those writing kernels, compilers, JITs, etc., developers don&#x27;t need to care, that&#x27;s the point of programming languages and compilers. Throw a toolchain at a developer and tell them to do it and they can do it.<p>Comparing RISC-V to OpenSPARC is comparing apples to oranges. One is an ISA, the other is a hardware project.<p>What do you mean by &quot;We barely have a decent ARM ecosystem&quot;. Are you talking about the tools to build for those processors? Or the tools to build new ones of those processors? Or the actual chips that are available?<p>I&#x27;m basically always within 10m of at least a half dozen ARM processors, and a handful of 8051s. At worst, RISC-V could be equivalent to ARM, without many of the parts that suck about it.')
