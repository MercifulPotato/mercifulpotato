What went unsaid is that with these offers the strong temptation is to move out to areas where you truly want to live, not to just another slightly cheaper large metro area with jobs.<p>Everyone I know who took these moves went to places like a large farm out nowhere, or a cabin deep in the forest, or to a small village in the mountains or on a faraway beach. Places which defined paradise to each individual, with wonderful quality of life (but no jobs).<p>Personally I was very strongly tempted to move to Kona (Hawaii) keeping my full silicon valley salary. Not exactly a hotbed of replacement tech jobs though, so I guess I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.')
