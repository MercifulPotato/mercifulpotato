That doesn&#x27;t mean people don&#x27;t do it anyway, but &quot;first pass&quot; scraping it is more efficient to respect robots.txt, and then you can come in with a human to figure out if anything behind robots.txt is surreptitiously possible to scrape. On the other hand, Google etc. do not care enough, they just respect robots.txt because they don&#x27;t need to index your site if you don&#x27;t want them to, it hurts you more than it hurts them.<p>DNT has no mutual benefit, the benefit is only to the end-user asking not to be tracked. The benefit is also not immediate, it&#x27;s somewhere down the road. Ignoring robots.txt can immediately cause problems for both the client and server.')
