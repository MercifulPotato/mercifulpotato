My point is not &quot;beauty should not be appreciated&quot;.  My point is that we should not dismiss models of nature based on aesthetics.  Nature has no preference on what we see as beautiful.  The video makes the point that beauty should be treated as a guiding principle, not as a hard and fast rule to sniff out truth.')
