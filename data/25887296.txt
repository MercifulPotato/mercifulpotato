Give it a few years.<p>Also, if you already have a competent io_submit&#x2F;O_DIRECT implementation then there are few material performance benefits to io_uring for databases. It mostly just cleans up the API. This has value from a code design&#x2F;maintenance standpoint, particularly since io_submit is lacking in the documentation department, but the lack of kernel support in most environments makes it a poor tradeoff at this time.')
