They may simply not choose to question because of fear of punishment, or for any other number of reasons.<p>&gt;Then when they&#x27;re adults they lack any kind of critical thinking skills because they&#x27;ve been miseducated and they&#x27;re easy targets for disinformation.<p>That is a giant leap of logic.. or faith. Case in point :- I went to a religious school (though, it was more of a hippie religious school), and many of my classmates became atheists later in life. :)<p>I think there a large room for even further nuance about how humans develop and all the factors that shape our thinking. Simply forcing a &#x27;critical thinking&#x27; class into the curriculum won&#x27;t give them any benefit any more than attending an entrepreneurship class will make you an entrepreneur.')
