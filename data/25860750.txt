You simply can&#x27;t fire someone for being in a protected class. No amount of &quot;process and chain of command, etc&quot; is going to change that. It&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t be fired by a manager willy-nilly for being black, but if it goes all the way up to the CEO it&#x27;s totally fine.')
