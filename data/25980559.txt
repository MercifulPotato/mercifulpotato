I spent a lot of time going out to meetups when I first started getting into VR. Meeting people, talking to people. Eventually, I started showing people the stuff I was building. That led to getting asked to do talks at the meetups about the stuff I was building. That led to more contacts. I ended up making friends with folks who would \none day make the connections that got me my current job.<p>Incidentally, when folks at my current employer started talking about hiring someone for my role, they kept running into people who knew me and had a high opinion of me.<p>Networking works in many directions. But it only works if you don&#x27;t go into it looking for it to work. I think the big key was that I wasn&#x27;t out to gladhand with folks. I was just out to make friends over a shared passion. It gives an authenticity to your speech that people can see.<p>[0] Which now has a big web and database component, all in service to the VR app that I&#x27;m building.')
