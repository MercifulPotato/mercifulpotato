The whole reason online advertising is so difficult to profit on is because Facebook and Google have sucked all the profit out of the room. The Open Web is a total shambles because of nonsense from Google and Facebook so many companies don&#x27;t even have an alternative to fall back on...  Now Facebook is claiming they are defending small business. What a joke.<p>Anything which causes Facebook to make this much noise must be good.')
