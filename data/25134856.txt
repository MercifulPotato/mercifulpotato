There are OTP extensions to IMAP.<p>With regards to TOTP, if IMAP server can auth via PAM, then you can use a TOTP extension in PAM (OATH IIRC). It does mean the user cannot auto refresh their e-mail as they&#x27;d need to enter the TOTP after a timeout again. If you combine that with the fact that people often use TOTP client such as Google Authenticator on their smartphone, then it doesn&#x27;t make their smartphone with e-mail client more secure. It would, however, allow a user to use a YubiKey as authentication method.')
