None of these can run Cyberpunk 2077 (properly) or MS Flight Sim (at all). I have no plans or wishes to buy a high end Windows rig... BUT I would play via the cloud, just to experience these games, and would not care if there are some compression artifacts (currently unnoticeable when I stream 4k movies) or if they are capped at 30fps.<p>I only fear latency, which is what makes games unplayable to me... I live in Argentina and the best ping I can get on Fortnite is 50ms, using servers in Brazil. There are few territories with low ping in the world.')
