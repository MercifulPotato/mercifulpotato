I would pay far less, $1&#x2F;month would be the point where I would begin considering it. There are just too many &quot;only $5&quot; services and they would add up quickly if I were to allow myself that amount of money.<p>The problem with this model, though, is support. A service with 100 million untrained end users each paying a dollar will need to provide quality customer service to 100 million untrained end users. It is much easier to sell ads to 10,000 &quot;affiliates&quot; who feel that they have some special arrangement and thus accept some responsibility of their own, and make $10,000 off each of those.')
