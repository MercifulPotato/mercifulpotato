In particular requiring law enforcement to <i>always</i> give a warning before using deadly force and ban shooting at moving vehicles will put them and the general public at greater risk. Sure police should issue a warning whenever possible but there are always going to be exceptional situations. For example terrorist attacks, mass shootings, and hostage situations.')
