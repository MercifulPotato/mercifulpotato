I had been handed so many terrible VB6 and VBA projects by that point, that I jumped into C# when it was released. Of course I also did a bunch of Java programming at the time as well, so the similarities were convenient and I found I had to think a lot less when switching between C# and Java versus VB and C#. At this point almost everything I do is in C#, except for one legacy application where they use VB as a scripting language under their forms UI. Thank goodness for C# to VB converters!')
