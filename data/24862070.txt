I don&#x27;t disagree with you at all on a theoretical level. Yes you need more money chasing the same goods.<p>I&#x27;m talking more about on a practical level in terms of the prices that most people will see&#x2F;experience when they are going about there daily life. I even cited very real examples of both demand pull and cost push inflation that have nothing to do with the money supply. These as far as I know are all examples acknowledged by economists as causes of inflation.<p>If for example tomorrow there were a super volcano explosion and a catastrophic decline in the world&#x27;s food supply, we would see a massive spike in food costs. Everyone needs to eat and the food supply would be limited, so prices will go up. Since food costs are an input cost for the well being of all workers around the world, we should expect that there will be upwards price pressure on many goods and services used to measure inflation most people actually feel and experience.')
