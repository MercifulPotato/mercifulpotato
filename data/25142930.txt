What?!? Creating videos isn&#x27;t creative?? Of course it is! You should be encouraging and reveling in this sort of behavior!<p>My seven year old runs around with my old iPhone 5.  We&#x27;ve locked it down to essentially be nothing more than a camera, but she&#x27;ll still make videos for her whole screen time allotment for the day.  I used to wonder if this was a &quot;good&quot; use of her time.<p>Then she discovered iMovie and now edits videos, adds transitions and music, makes her little sister an actor in movies... and I remembered when my parents worried about me spending hours in QBasic making little sine-wave art with music playing in the background.')
