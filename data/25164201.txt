It&#x27;s your body&#x27;s sense of its position relative to itself and to an extent the sense of position in your environment. It involves your inner ear, eyes, sounds, and even sensation of air moving over body parts<p>VR headsets gives your eyes visual cues that don&#x27;t necessarily match that of your inner ear and body positioning. Lag between your inner ear&#x27;s sensation and what your eyes see also causes problems.<p>Additionally your eyes aren&#x27;t just a pair of fixed cameras mounts in your skull. They constantly scan (saccades) a scene and change their focus and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s then constructed by your visual cortex. The world doesn&#x27;t have a depth of field effect applied to it, your eyes do that for you. Forcing both eyes to focus on a particular focal plane causes a lot of strain in because your eyes are not identical.<p>Besides human sensory input the lag and lack of precision of the game&#x27;s sense of your body really fucks with your proprioception. Using a traditional controller uses small muscles with fast reaction times and little of your large motive and balance muscles. You can split your focus easily on the events and visuals of the game and work the controls.<p>With VR you have to make a lot larger movements and use more of your muscles for balance. Most people are not highly trained athletes their game avatars are and do not have that level of coordination or muscle endurance.<p>VR basically short circuits a ton of your body&#x27;s senses or gives them conflicting input. Some people can adapt, many can&#x27;t adapt for long, and some can&#x27;t adapt at all.')
