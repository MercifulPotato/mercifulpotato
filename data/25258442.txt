Unified memory has been a thing for almost half a decade now. It become a thing as soon as AMD stuck the CPU &amp; GPU behind the same IOMMU ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heterogeneous_System_Architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heterogeneous_System_Architect...</a> )<p>Now you may ask, but why hasn&#x27;t anyone leverage this before? And the answer is they have, but it&#x27;s usually not worth doing because usually the integrated GPU isn&#x27;t worth using for anything. As in, the market for HPC software that doesn&#x27;t benefit from a discreet GPU is vanishingly small. So nobody really cares about it. But there <i>are</i> applications of this. Things like Intel&#x27;s QuickSync should be internally leveraging this on the relevant CPUs, for example. So those sorts of frameworks (like MLKit) will just be a bit faster and cheaper to spin up.<p>The rise in consumer software that does &quot;HPC-like&quot; workloads (eg, facial recognition, voice recognition, etc..) make this more interesting, but there&#x27;s nothing <i>new</i> here, either. It&#x27;s certainly not playing any meaningful role in the M1&#x27;s current performance. The bigger question here would be to what extent does Apple push this. Like is Apple going to try and push integrated GPUs for the iMac Pro? What about the Mac Pro?')
