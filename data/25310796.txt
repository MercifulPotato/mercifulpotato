I live in Canada and am really considering purchasing in bulk (20 technical books valuing at say $1,000) and ask my friend in US, who lives close to Ottawa, to send it to me when he goes shopping there. I doubt Custom would charge duty on it.<p>Example: The Elements of Computing Systems (Paperback)<p>Amazon.ca:  $41.56\nAmazon.com: $23.96<p>BTW this is just a mild example, check out Unix Power Tools, Third Edition (paperback).<p>The ratio is around 1.7346, while the spot USDCAD is about 1.2776. I can think of a few reasons, but I&#x27;d like to consel your opinions.<p>0) Should not use spot price for comparison<p>I&#x27;d argue that the real conversion rate (paid through credit card) won&#x27;t be too different from the spot price. May be a few percentage at most.<p>1) Delivery Charge<p>On Amazon.ca if I purchase over $35 then delivery is free, while on Amazon.com it&#x27;s a significant part of the cost (e.g. it shows about $10 for my Canadian address). However, this can be mitigated by making more purchases. For example if I buy another book the average delivery cost drops to $6.5. This is probably just a small percentage of the total cost if I go over, say, $200.<p>2) Less business opportunities in Canada<p>Maybe they just don&#x27;t have many supplies in Canada, so they have to get them from the US. But then again I doubt that&#x27;s the case for every book, plus the mark up seems to be a bit small if it really has to be transferred from some where in US.<p>Other reasons that you can think about?')
