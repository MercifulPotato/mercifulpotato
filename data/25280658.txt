I&#x27;ll read all the tutorials and documentation, get it running on my PC, then find a new language I like more later and dump this one. Is that hedonistic, such that I learn simply for the joy of learning, and probably forget a lot of what I learned later? If so, then am I deluding myself into doing so for others somehow, even though no one who knows me as a person even cares about programming languages or knows that I am into them?<p>Frankly speaking, your comment comes off a bit dickish to me, especially this part:<p>&gt; You may trick your mind into thinking you genuinely enjoy self-improvement')
