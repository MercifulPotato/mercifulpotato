It&#x27;s an instruction set that would... just require a new backend for clang&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;Java and mean nothing to me unless somebody makes something that just obliterates a Ryzen.<p>Why should developers care? We barely have a decent ARM ecosystem after years of ARM routers and Raspberry Pi. Now we are supposed to be enthusiastic we will do that yet again for RISC-V?<p>Is it because it&#x27;s somehow more open? But ARM wasn&#x27;t that closed afaik - lost of folks produced it.<p>And Sun Microsystems open sourced a 64 thread CPU, the OpenSparc and nothing happened.<p>So, in a nutshell, why?')
