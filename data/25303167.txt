First you have to ensure that journey distances are within walking range.  That means having stores, work locations, and living locations all within a kilometer or two at most (not everyone is capable of riding a bike at race speeds every day).  Paris, at least some parts of Paris, might have that in place.  So too maybe NYC or SF.  But a great many places are not setup that way and don&#x27;t have mass transit infrastructure to convert quickly.')
