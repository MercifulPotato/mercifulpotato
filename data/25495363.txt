Item(by='PaulHoule', descendants=None, kids=[25495569], score=None, time=1608562047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494800, text='The original Netflix recommendation challenge was floated back when Netflix was a &quot;movie by mail&quot; service where if you got a good or bad movie the situation would take days to play out.  In that case the difference between 90% and 95% accurate is something the customer can feel,  is good for the business,  etc.<p>Back then Netflix was buying retail DVDs so they also had an unlimited catalog:  they could start stocking a movie just by buying a few disks.<p>They negotiated with Hollywood for the rights to run a streaming service which was structured something like &quot;Netflix pays Disney $0.80 a month per subscriber.&quot;<p>At this point the &quot;Netflix optimization problem&quot; is:  &quot;buy content that will keep our customers coming back for the minimum amount of money.&quot;  Netflix withheld data about which movies customers watched from the studios because they didn&#x27;t want studios to know what they thought the movies were worth.<p>Then Netflix started to make its own movies because,  once the number of subscribers is large,  it is cheaper to buy then to rent.<p>The new optimization problem is still &quot;minimize costs&quot; but now Netflix is involved with the production of movies from the very beginning and will produce movies based on what plays well (or they imagine plays well) with the Netflix audience.<p>Is it good?<p>I don&#x27;t think so.  I saw cable channels become fat but disconnected from the consumer because they had a business model where they got paid whether or not you watched.  In the &quot;GAME PASS&quot; future you can play any Assassin&#x27;s Creed game you want for $10 a month -- I&#x27;d rather decide which games I buy myself instead of have it be done by some insiders in a smoke-free room.')
