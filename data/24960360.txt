Since deflate&#x2F;zlib&#x2F;zip&#x2F;gzip is used for other filetypes and containers (.docx&#x2F;.apk&#x2F;.jar&#x2F;...) and stuff like game resource files, so results can be surprisingly well, especially when comparing to traditional compressors that can&#x27;t handle the compressed data at all. On the other hand, newer compression methods like .xz&#x2F;.7z&#x2F;.rar&#x2F;brotli) aren&#x27;t supported (yet), so Precomp can&#x27;t do much about them.<p>Not being backward compatible is more of a protection in alpha phase and to avoid confusion, the error Precomp gives when trying to process files created with older versions could be changed to a warning. In most cases, the version check could be patched out and the data of older .pcf files would be restored correctly with newer versions.')
