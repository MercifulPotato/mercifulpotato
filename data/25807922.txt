I found pbs was outdated in terms of its UI and experience. We want to make the process more fun and more exciting.<p>Other than that, we want to also allow privacy for users. It would cost extra for users, but if they wanted, we want to serve as a midpoint for shipping. You want a book shipped to you, but don&#x27;t want your address sent to a random person? We will receive the book, and then send it to you.<p>Finally, we hope to have a larger inventory available. I couldn&#x27;t find books I actually wanted on pbs.<p>Past that, and this is way in the future, we plan to expand to anything that is worth trading. Videogames is next on my list, then after that, records. The list is slowly growing, but I think our potential for expansion and scaling is really high.')
