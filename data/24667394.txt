There are literally hundreds of titles in some of these series, so she can pretty much always find one to read or re-read, even if most of them are checked out.<p>I would dispute that this hurts sales—at least for us. The long hold times and 2-week checkout limit mean that I’ll often buy the ebook to complete it or read it without waiting in the queue.')
