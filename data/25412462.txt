It is probably the single most impactful change one can make.<p>I ordered a pair (via Zenni, just some regular polycarbonate lenses) that are at just the right optical power such that if I fully relax my eyes, objects 1 metre away are in focus. When my monitor is that far away, it&#x27;s at optical infinity and very comfortable to look at for long stretches. It&#x27;s a very noticeable difference: on the occasions that I forgot to put the task glasses on and wear my normal glasses by mistake, my eyes almost <i>always</i> end up feeling sore after a few hours.<p>I&#x27;m tempted to get another pair at 50 cm for laptop and phone use.')
