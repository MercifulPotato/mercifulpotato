We’re looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps’y stuff sometimes (because in a way it’s the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you’d have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, or SaltStack.<p>We’re also looking for a Solutions Engineer (this role is also available candidates in the US, as most of our clients are there), who would be helping customers with working with Spacelift, Terraform and Pulumi. You would also be creating various public content: guides, blog posts, demos, etc.<p>Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have multiple happy and satisfied clients.<p>We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don’t give us a business advantage, as well as sane working hours. We’ve got investment days on fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.<p>If that sounds like fun to you, email me at kubam at spacelift dot io!<p>PS: Fear not, no whiteboarding!')
