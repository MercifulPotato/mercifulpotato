They socialize, depend on each other, and teach each other. They all have means of communicating. Essentially, they have cultures. If you were to introduce cloned animals into the wild after natural ones had died, there would be no other animals of their kind who could teach them how to do various things necessary to their survival, or teach them how to communicate. Moreover, there is no guarantee that any future environment would be more amenable. For most animals, we would have no idea what that meant, no way to measure it.')
