Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602108364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24711958, text='&gt; Why have we decided that untrustworthy, sometimes poorly managed organizations are acceptable when operating in the interests of shareholders, but not when operating in the interests of workers?<p>The thing is, acting in the interests of shareholders is often acting in the interests of workers as well. Many workers are compensated using stock (RSUs&#x2F;options&#x2F;etc) which makes them shareholders. Even if that weren&#x27;t true, for publicly-traded companies, employees are free to invest their compensation into company stock if they so choose and can then both vote on shareholder resolutions and share in the company&#x27;s success (or failure). And even if that weren&#x27;t the case, acting in the interest of shareholders helps sustain jobs and create space for raises by attracting investment.<p>With unions, there are a few major issues I see, at least in the US implementation of unions:<p>- First, they often institute parallel management systems and sets of rules that govern the business. It can make work more complex&#x2F;rigid. These rules also often tend to favor employee traits like tenure. Over time they turn into something of a pyramid scheme, with the newer employees indirectly subsidizing more senior employees.<p>- They can create unnecessarily inefficient labor. For instance, I&#x27;ve heard stories from friends in manufacturing about how only certain employees are allowed to perform certain mundane tasks under the guise of &#x27;safety&#x27;, even though anyone could do it. It can be infuriating to hold work or delay customers due to rules like this.<p>- Unions erode individualism and localized control in favor of institutional control. Unions can become a conduit for implementing political stances as a result. For example, the NEA (largest teachers union in America) has taken a public stance on supporting critical race theory, including introducing factually incorrect&#x2F;biased material like the NYT&#x27;s &quot;1619 project&quot; into classrooms (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neaedjustice.org&#x2F;the-1619-project-resource-page&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neaedjustice.org&#x2F;the-1619-project-resource-page&#x2F;</a>). [Note I am not looking to debate this point here, but am just offering it as an example of activism using a union as a way to route political stances broadly, instead of allowing independent localized control]<p>- Unions erode competition in the market. This is especially problematic for public sector unions, where taxpayers have no choice but to fund a particular public organization. In general, I do not favor unions having exclusive rights to labor at a company. If there were multiple unions competing alongside non-union workers, that would be a more balanced&#x2F;healthier situation.<p>Ultimately I am not sure why unions have special provisions under the law. Workers seeking unionization are all free to form their own company renting out their labor services to customers. They get to act as a group, and negotiate as a group, but are still subject to choice and competition. Under this model, for those who don&#x27;t agree with a union for whatever reason, they have the freedom to sell their labor as individuals or as a company. This seems like a much better situation than having large number of workers subject to tyranny of the majority within the bounds of an exclusive union contract.')
