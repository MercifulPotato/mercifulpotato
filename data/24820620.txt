A slightly janky but very tidy way to know if a list of (hashable) things has any duplicates in python is to test<p><pre><code>  len(set(mylist)) == len(mylist) \n</code></pre>\nwhich probably loses on big O to some more clever approaches but is just fine for small n, and very readable.<p>Other trivially answerable questions include “what’s in me but not in this other collection”, “what’s in both of us”, “what’s in exactly one of us”, ... etc.')
