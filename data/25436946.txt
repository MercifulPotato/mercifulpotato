Your enterprise customers that are drowning in money can start using it and using that money you can grow your org by hiring more engineers. At this point you start working on adding new features and do cost optimization. Since your whole architecture was designed based on &quot;we have to ship this ASAP&quot;, you deliver some real nice cost reduction easily. Then you reflect this to your customers and gain goodwill and good PR.')
