And the operating cost per hour is 3x anything else.<p>The plan was to design a separate cargo version, but the orders and internal desire weren&#x27;t there.<p>Airbus ate at least $50 billion in losses on the A380, and counting. That was on top of many other problems affecting  other models, which is why Boeing and Airbus still make roughly the same number of planes annually, despite both having huge problems.')
