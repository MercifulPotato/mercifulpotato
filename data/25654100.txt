He tried some local classes, hoping they would teach more advanced material, but they were introductory and he spent his time tutoring the other kids (not a bad lesson in itself!)<p>We briefly tried GameMaker Studio 2, however we had no prior experience and finding out what functions were needed or called made it a high friction experience.<p>He has been playing Minecraft since a young age, and creates elaborate redstone mechanisms.  I like how this mixes creativity, spatial planning, and boolean logic, and doesn&#x27;t require learning a new UI or language.<p>Most recently we tried creating a Minecraft mod in Java using Forge.  I cannot state strongly enough: do not do this.  The Forge architecture is fundamentally broken, whereby it adds some functionality but otherwise forces you to code directly against decompiled Java classes.<p>Most tutorials only work with a specific version of Forge&#x2F;Minecraft.  There are no release notes or documentation, because there is no API.  (To be fair, the Forge aspect is documented, though I only found it useful once I already knew what it was trying to explain.)<p>So what started out as an exciting father-son project became something I dreaded.')
