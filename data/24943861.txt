I was biking and I &quot;struck&quot; a car that was heading opposite my direction and making a left hand turn across my path in the bike line and crossing my right of way. I struck the car on the side near the front passenger wheel at &quot;slow speed&quot; and was thrown over the hood of the car and then onto the ground. This incident was the cars fault for making a turn  without consideration of my right of way even though I, the cyclist, was the one who struck the car.<p>An SDC that freezes in front of cyclists is still dangerous to cyclists.')
