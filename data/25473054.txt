CSS didn&#x27;t even exist yet.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is suggesting that vcenter or something like it should have existed at that time. The point is that it could have certainly been introduced by the time css came around and started handling more than basic text styling. It&#x27;s been over two decades since that condition held.<p>The &quot;more complex layout model&quot; has been here a long time.')
