The simple truth is I want to know two different things, is it functional and would I like it.  Star rankings and even short text reviews don’t really answer those questions.<p>A 1 star review because it was DOA says nothing about failure rates.  People also have different preferences on things like cost, spicy food, or what looks tacky making a 3 vs 4 star review  mostly meaningless.<p>This is why independent reviews like consumer reports are so useful.   Look at a comparison between similar devices and consider tradeoffs.  Or find a movie reviewer with similar tastes and you can generally just follow their suggestions.<p>Net result reviewers and rating systems just don’t have great incentives which devolves into companies just gaming the algorithm.')
