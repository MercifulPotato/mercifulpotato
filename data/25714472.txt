You need to be more willing to use your gun than they are.<p>The US government has nukes, but they still got their asses handed to them in Vietnam and struggled in Afghanistan and Iraq. It&#x27;s true that if the feds truly want to squash an uprising they have the means to do it. But do they have the will to do it? At what cost? I can imagine a scenario where they&#x27;d be willing to use enough force to subdue unarmed citizens by not enough to subdue an armed uprising, which could escalate to civil war.<p>In short: there exists a scenario in which the second amendment enables the citizens to resist the government to an extent that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to otherwise. Whether this is a good or bad thing is something you can decide for yourself.')
