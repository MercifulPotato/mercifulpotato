Especially relevant these days, truth, politics, humor, cute are all orthogonal. Let the user make up their own ratings.<p>Support the fact that we don&#x27;t want to share everything with everybody all the time.  In fact, we don&#x27;t want any new friends to automatically be able to dig back decades to stuff we shared with our friends back then.<p>Do NOT ever show me a photo of my dead pet, friend or relative in order to try to get me to recycle old posts.<p>If you really want to be ambitious, support capabilities... so I could give you a pass to look at photos of a project I&#x27;m working on, and you could forward that pass to whoever, and they wouldn&#x27;t even need an account to see it... the pass is the key.  The pass could be revoked at any time, if abuse happens.<p>Just some ideas... I&#x27;ll build it, if a sufficiently large interest appears.<p>[Edit] Bonus points: Build a set of APIs that allow it to be accessed like imap folders are in email... with a number of clients and a federation protocol.')
