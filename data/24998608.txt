One advantage Intel has still is costs&#x2F;control of their node and would be very interesting to see production costs compared as might be that Intel has more margin in production they can shave.  Though they have stumbled keeping up with node progress and that has clearly been a cornerstone in the hurt they are getting in the market and AMD have capitalised upon that like champs.<p>Will Intel bring out a new architecture that will rise above all this as they did with the Core2Duo (actually typing this upon one of those cores), well - they need to.<p>But for me the shift on CPU&#x27;s does seem to be large and faster cache access and latency.  Say Intel released the same chips but added a very large SRAM layer - that for some applications would swing things for sure, not cheap but again - Intel controls and runs their own fabs, and whilst AMD could equally just do that, would the costs in them doing that with TSMC be just as comparable?  There is money to be made in fabricating or TSMC would not be doing so well financially of all this.  But that is a cost&#x2F;income that Intel are tapped into with their own fabs.<p>However it pans, competition has been good for the desktop x86 folks and so glad AMD back in the game and going strong.')
