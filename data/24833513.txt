Let&#x27;s say that your friends all hate Facebook, but continue to use it, because for them the inconvenience and switching costs of moving to a different social network (perhaps one you are offering to host for them) is higher than the cost of continuing to use Facebook.<p>With a federated network, not only can you encourage (or demand) your friends to use a host that you approve of, but also, the very fact that people can move from one host to another (and there isn&#x27;t a single basket containing all the eggs) means that these hosts are less likely to risk their reputation or be attacked in the first place.<p>&gt; even in federated networks like email, some hosts will become bigger than others and will eventually take over most of the users and traffic<p>It seems you are arguing both that federated systems lead to there being too many nodes to trust, and also that in practice only a few big nodes will be trusted.  I may be over-simplifying your points there, and I do think there are challenges with federated networks (particularly when federation is deliberately broken due to spamming&#x2F;abuse&#x2F;politics) but it&#x27;s worth having a clear SWOT analysis here.<p>Anyway, my point, as before, is that a network coalescing around a few big nodes is not a problem as long as there is portability of accounts between them.  I would rather trust 3 big providers who fear losing users to a more secure platform, than 1 monopolistic provider that&#x27;s too big to fail.')
