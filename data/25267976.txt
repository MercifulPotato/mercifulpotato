Even with a default deny macOS sandbox profile (much stronger than anything that entitlements or TCC can apply, but pretty close to the restrictions some Chrome&#x2F;Safari processes will run with) you still get an ENOENT instead of EACCESS when trying to access a path that doesnâ€™t exist. I understand not applying that behavior in default sandbox profiles but for apps that are built to run some processes in extremely aggressive sandboxes like browsers it would be a real benefit.')
