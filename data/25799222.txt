Item(by='refurb', descendants=None, kids=[25800005], score=None, time=1610762672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798727, text='<i>No shit prosecutors don&#x27;t want to make public statements that are even potentially stronger than what they can support in court, while in the middle of an active investigation.</i><p>But that&#x27;s EXACTLY what they did.  Turned out to be a massive exaggeration with no evidence to actually back it up.  Didn&#x27;t stop it from being covered broadly in the media and the &quot;correction&quot; getting no press at all.<p><i>I just said that &quot;starting a fire inside the fence&quot; is categorically different from your previous characterization that they &quot;set the building on fire&quot;.</i><p>But <i>why</i> did you say that?  And it&#x27;s disingenuous when the article I linked to showed a burned out door to the building.<p>And I know exactly why you quibble over &quot;inside the fence&#x2F;outside the fence&quot; because you&#x27;re trying to split hairs in an effort to downplay what it is - arson committed against federal buildings.<p>Again, proving my point you&#x27;re treating the antifa&#x2F;BLM side with kid gloves, but believing (without question) every single rumor and innuendo about the Capital Riots and ready to slap labels on them like &quot;seditionists&quot; or &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; and use phrases like &quot;kill squads&quot;.')
