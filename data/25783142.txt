That is terrible.<p>Fox News has entertainment departments, fought in court to have Tucker Carlson lie to his followers with impunity. They republished incitement to ramming attacks.<p>Bellingcat.. They just do investigations.<p>If you want to try to break things down into black and white left vs right, at least try to do it with comparable organizations. Or even better, try to refute the substance of the article instead of going to a media bias site to see how you feel they land on the political spectrum.<p>Even the site you linked has them listed as &quot;left-center&quot; with &quot;high factual reporting.&quot; How is this grounds to outright dismiss them? The slightest degree of &quot;leftness&quot; makes you want to exclude sources? Do you have any factual reason to be doing this, or is this your personal bias towards right wing content forcing you to seek means to exclude information you don&#x27;t like the looks of?')
