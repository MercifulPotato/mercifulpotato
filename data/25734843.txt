The DailyStormer got &quot;canceled&quot; by vendors for not even trying to moderate content that actively promoted violence (among other horrible things).  Now Parlor gets &quot;canceled&quot; by vendors for not doing a good enough job trying to moderate content promoting violence.  The bar for getting &quot;canceled&quot; is already moving down and honestly any company that is hosting user-driven content needs to have a plan for how to make sure they stay below that bar. Part of that plan should be projected scenarios about how low the bar will go....<p>Part of what is really dicey here too is that the result of getting this calculation wrong is basically annihilation for your service (unless you think you can operate without &quot;every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers&quot;).  The stakes are really high!<p>(Edited to fix my &#x27;raise-the-bar&#x27; analogy)')
