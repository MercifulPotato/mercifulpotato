What about works that integrate fuzzy logic and probability? eg. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1610.09156" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1610.09156</a> employs both fuzzy logic and probability; can those be understood in terms of fuzzy logic alone?<p>&gt; See Klir &amp; Folger for nice discussion on this (I forget the title, but it is called something like Uncertainty in Fuzzy Theory Applications).<p>Do you mean the 1988 book &quot;Fuzzy Sets, Uncertainty, and Information&quot; by George J.

Nearly almost all logics of probability that have been proposed in the literature are based on classical two-valued logic. After making clear the differences between fuzzy logic and probability theory, here we propose a {em fuzzy} logic of probability for which completeness results (in a probabilistic sense) are provided. The main idea behind this approach is that probability values of crisp propositions can be understood as truth-values of some suitable fuzzy propositions associated to the crisp ones. Moreover, suggestions and examples of how to extend the formalism to cope with conditional probabilities and with other uncertainty formalisms are also provided.</code></pre>')
