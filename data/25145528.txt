Generally every solver will out perform other solvers on at least some problems.<p>For general purpose use, Z3 is a good starting point.<p>I&#x27;ve had good luck with Boolector.<p>I haven&#x27;t really tried dreal. It is specialized for problems involving nonlinear predicates over real numbers, so it targets a different application domain than the other solvers.')
