The expectation that I&#x27;m here sitting all day watching and responding on the chat window is not good.<p>I solve it by configuring slack to send me email notifications and then close the tab. I&#x27;ll check email only a couple times a day, I&#x27;ll see it then and open a slack tab to respond, if needed.')
