Will you do it to any passing member of the public?<p>The fact that you trust someone with something doesn&#x27;t make it that you will trust anyone.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything on my body to hide to my SO, still won&#x27;t be nude in front of you.<p>The thing that need to change isn&#x27;t questioning whether you have anything to hide, it&#x27;s whether you trust the people involved and on the internet it&#x27;s a concept so hard for people to grasp. Believe me, whatever Google has access about me, I trust them with it, or else I wouldn&#x27;t have handed them that information. If there&#x27;s any single piece of information (or aggregate of information) that you wouldn&#x27;t trust them with, don&#x27;t put that there, and that include all the service OP put on his blog post.<p>Personally getting rid of my Google accounts is something I&#x27;m slowly working toward, not because of any privacy issue, but because of how they proved that they can&#x27;t be trusted to keep your account up, and that would screw me up quite a bit more than them abusing my privacy I let them have.')
