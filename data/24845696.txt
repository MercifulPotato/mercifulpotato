The difference between the way the same instrument family sounds on say Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot; (Dick Parry) sounds versus say Brandford Marsalis, Michael Brecker, Fela Kuti, Grover Washington or (god forbid) Kenny G is huge.<p>Of course &#x27;saxophone&#x27; is a whole range of instruments going from Low-E giants to saxes so small you have to have pretty small fingers to not hit two valves at the same time.<p>The mouthpiece and the reed thickness are a big factor in this as is air pressure, &#x27;tonguing&#x27; the reed and how you shape your mouth cavity. Endless variation.<p>But the basic harmonics are baked into the instrument, those would be very hard to change though I&#x27;m sure it is possible to manipulate which ones get amplified by the above changes to the environment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kZjZBe6o78M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kZjZBe6o78M</a><p>Is a nice example, it would be a pretty boring song without that raging saxophone.')
