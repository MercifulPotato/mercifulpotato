To be sure there are many non-male and non-white and non-hetero voices, but they are by no means the majority. If you take out the male requirement, the number becomes even smaller. Two days ago BBC radio 4 was broadcasting a discussion on literature. It had three men and two women, withe a male organizer. After that was the news told by a white woman. Then there was a segment on songwriting for musicals for the stage, given by a (presumably straight) older white man.<p>There <i>is</i> (sometimes) a &quot;women&#x27;s hour&quot;, but the fact that such a thing should show at least that male voices are at least slightly the norm. I couldn&#x27;t tell the race of the callers (and never mind their sexuality when a partner was not mentioned), but there were male voices there too.<p>Could it be that we just notice non-(white, male, hetero) voices more when they come on, and assume that white, male, and hetero is the &quot;default&quot;?')
