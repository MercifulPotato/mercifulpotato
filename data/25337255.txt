Even in those cultures that aren&#x27;t too athletic.<p>Anything to the contrary is highly controversial among both scientists and the general public. You usually only see this when politics are involved, and even then the opinion will be more evenly split. And this is such a benign subject!<p>Sometimes studies will find very little benefit or even negative effects, yet the conclusion will still include the obligatory paragraph talking about how exercise must be so great and necessary. Have to wonder how many don&#x27;t get published because the result was &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>Even without properly controlling for unrelated conditions [1], you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding a credible study that gives you more than 3-4 extra years (vs absolutely zero exercise).<p>[0] As in life expectancy, rather than some subjective measures.<p>[1] Which would only make the projected life expectancy gain go down not up. The studies that we have so far almost certainly establish a ceiling for life expectancy gains. It could very well be 0. There are very few plausible scenarios under which it would turn out that we&#x27;re actually underestimating gains. One would be that there&#x27;s some specific form of exercise that gives you big gains and most people just do it wrong.')
