I don&#x27;t work for any of the device manufacturers, but I put myself in their place to think about why I would object.  Maybe you should too as you debate over this.<p>It&#x27;s possible that a certain class of things in modern life are not repairable in the way that they used to be.  Things have generally been repairable because their size, complexity, and more importantly, their connectedness related to function is able to operate at the size of a person&#x27;s hands.<p>Your lawn mower, your car, your refrigerator.  These are the things that are self-contained and you can see the parts and handle them competently.  Those are the kinds of examples he gives.  He doesn&#x27;t talk about trying to resolder the memory controller on a hard drive.  Yet even hard drives have been around for 20 years, and no one talks about how they should be able to self-repair those.<p>Your cellphone is getting farther and farther away even from that.  Its parts are microscopic.  It takes an advanced factory to put those things together, and you demand at the same time that it be small and light and have good battery life.  It relies on communicating with other hardware that are upgrading all the time.   You don&#x27;t play networked Doom II on your old computer for a reason.   Do you use a 10 year old cell phone?  How many of your friends do?<p>People every day are giving companies the signal that they value <i>new</i> and <i>cool</i> and small and light over the ability to repair and keep hardware around for a decade.<p>Those tiny earbuds are selling like hotcakes.  They&#x27;re impossible to fix, yet people buy them.<p>With your purchasing choices, you are signaling what companies are incentivized to make.  Yet at the same time, you wish to tell the companies not to make those things in that way.  Are they compatible?<p>I mean, have you really thought about what would result if you imposed requirements that batteries be interchangeable now?  If those earbuds had to be maintainable by the user?  Would they exist in anywhere near the form they do?<p>I think you have to think about the unintended side effects of what you want, and not just imagine that the one thing you want is all that happens.  Very few people who advocate for this stuff seem to be responsible for designing the hardware, which makes you think whether they&#x27;re completely right.')
