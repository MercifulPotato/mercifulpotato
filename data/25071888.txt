A lot of the water in the world is process water, it&#x27;s created when things combust.<p>And much of the water consumed by plants is turned into carbohydrates which then gets processed back into water after combusting or being oxidized in a animal.<p>I actually highly doubt that any water remains that has never been broken back into its constituent atoms and then combined with other atoms.<p>I suspect the true answer is actually 0% of the water remaining today has ever been in a dinosaur.\n(I.e the atoms might have been, but not the molecule as a molecule.)')
