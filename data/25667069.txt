In PGE, the local search operators, those that expand equations (parse trees) by making small additions can get into situations where:<p>1. a pretty good equation has been found\n2. small modifications don&#x27;t have much of an impact, so it stays good<p>The solution I was thinking of is to do more bookkeeping and eliminate wasted work like this.<p>In a sense, you don&#x27;t really get stuck in the same was as GP &#x2F; Stochastic algos because of the memoization. You always have to be trying new solutions (parse trees)<p>Also wanted to explore DeepQ&#x2F;RL for helping to guide the decisions of what to expand and where to expand it.')
