The idea behind outsourcing is that you can spend additional hours doing paid work. You can&#x27;t look at your fixed expenses in terms of a fixed amount of each hour&#x27;s wage if you&#x27;re increasing the number of hours worked.<p>Of course, it also assumes that people can choose exactly how many hours they work at their regular hourly rate, which isn&#x27;t usually the case, but that&#x27;s a separate quibble.')
