It didn&#x27;t work well.   The last time I successfully did so was from 1996-1999.    Linux itself has improved immensely, but the pain of getting a laptop actually functioning is still pretty terrible.<p>The thing is 20 years ago the Windows and Mac laptops weren&#x27;t seemless either.. Linux wasn&#x27;t that bad in comparison.   In the meantime Linux hasn&#x27;t kept up.<p>It&#x27;s all fine if the goal is to mess with linux or contribute to linux.  You learn a lot and have fun.<p>If you&#x27;ve gotta be contributing to some other piece of software someone else is paying you to work on it&#x27;s not fun.<p>It&#x27;s too bad cause my job is working on software that&#x27;s only supported on Linux.   It&#x27;d all be great if we just used desktop linux workstations, but everyone seems to want to use notebook computers today.')
