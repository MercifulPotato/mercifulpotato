They could still defend the peg 1:1 completely. How? Well if someone wants to sell a bunch of tether, they simply print even more tether, use that to buy crypto on exchanges, and sell that crypto to anyone willing to buy it that generates dollars to pay of the person selling their tether. But that also leves them with the tether that was sold back to dollars, which they can then buy more crypto with an either just hold or also sell to generate dollars. The visuals of this from an outside ends up looking effectively like there was just ton more new money coming into the system when in fact the exchanges and new money took a hit, and the money printing people just raised their perceived holding without backing. That is to say, that in this case the event of someone wanting out looks like the market is rising. You can keep this going as long as your un-backed coin can be exchanged for other liquid crypto.<p>As long as they have a blindly trusted money money printing machine, they can use it to defend the illusion that it&#x27;s printing real money. This is thes standard playbook for a pyramid scheme. You use new money to keep the illusion of a big holding and you can keep that going as long as the illusion holds.')
