Then a (zfs + rsync + [zfs-git hybrid]) monster is born, which may or may not work.<p>Fyi have a look at zfs. It has some neat traits&#x2F;behaviours. So my thinking is, someone should write a database that uses gazzilions of files (instead of a file per table), a tiny file for each cell&#x2F;field in a table. Then use zfs for versioning of data (or git). Zfs can already do software mirroring to drive pools on the machine, so maybe add rsync for remote pools. Optimize it for SSD&#x27;s and you have a filesystem-database-replicating-versioned -based store.<p>Maybe just need a nice cli&#x2F;gui for zfs to make it easier&#x2F;safer to expose more of it&#x27;s interesting features.')
