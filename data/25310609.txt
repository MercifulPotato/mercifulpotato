Through the course of a year we had eight of these young adults come and essentially give their addiction testimony.<p><i>To</i> <i>a</i> <i>person</i> the story was this:<p>- high school sports injury<p>- prescription for oxycodone<p>- oxycodone dependency develops<p>- physician cuts off supply<p>- kids start buying pills in school<p>- one of their sources introduces them to heroin<p>Every single one of them.  The exact same story.  It was unbelievable.<p>I only say that to say that placing some controls around how you approach the oxy isn&#x27;t a bad idea.  Good luck and I hope you get feeling better soon.')
