I mean, they probably can, but recently I tried to use it (actually, it was LibreOffice Calc, so there might be my problem, but I don&#x27;t know if the difference really is this big) instead of writing a python or bash script (as I would usually do) and was unpleasantly surprised by how complicated the stuff that I would consider standard is, like concatenating columns, grouping&#x2F;counting unique values, dirty data semi-automated cleanup and such. Everything would require either multiple clicks in multiple menus to perform something that appears to be very ill-composable actions in Calc, or would require writing 50-line Basic script (on kinda ugly APIs) for something that I can do by simply converting all of that to csv and writing 5 lines of Python (or sometimes even shell text-utils, literally). My general impression was that it is not really a tool made with power-user efficiency in mind, ending up being not very efficient for anyone, since it isn&#x27;t very intuitive software to use for an excel-noob anyway.<p>So my question is, is this really the state of art for visual working with data-sheets, semi-manual data editing and such?<p>I was assuming that running a Jupyter&#x2F;Pluto&#x2F;RStudio and doing stuff in Python&#x2F;Julia&#x2F;R when you don&#x27;t indent to do actual data-analysis&#x2F;learning, but only something that seems like basic stuff&#x2F;preprocessing is more of a bad habit, because Excel was actually made to work with tabular (DataFrame-like) structures, but I ended up feeling like there&#x27;s no way I would actually prefer Excel for that.')
