Isn&#x27;t pumping heat from the center of the earth to the atmosphere more or less the same as having a larger amount of incoming solar energy? And certainly it would be hard to argue that more energy from the sun wouldn&#x27;t heat the planet. Wouldn&#x27;t the equilibrium temperature be both a function of energy in and radiation rate (which is also a function of temperature?)')
