If you are not willing to take delivery, it is probably better to sell a vertical spread so that there is a built in stop out. Here I&#x27;m speaking of transactions of a reasonable premium amount, not 5 or 10 cents.<p>While it is true that the upside is unlimited against a naked call (and the downside is 0 on a naked put), naked puts suffer from systemic risk that calls for all intents do not.  Both are subject to news&#x2F;events specific to the company in question, but the risk of the short call running away from  you because the market had a +20% day are well, fleeting.  On the other hand, unexpected economic news, politcal&#x2F;military events, liquidity issues, etc can tank the entire market 10, 20, 30% and have numerous times.  A rise of similar magnitude, to my knowledge, has only happened after market crashes (so you would then be alert to the upside risk).')
