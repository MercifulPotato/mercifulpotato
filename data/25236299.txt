I was taught to be embarrassed at much less than 15mph under my own power. Being lazy, I usually rode closer to 11-12 when alone, and the only slower bikes I encountered were small children. Many athletic cyclists zoomed by at 20-25.<p>I was also taught to assert my right of way when I have it, and be deferential when I donâ€™t. So the designation of the path does matter.')
