These shocks are typically preceded by electron plasma oscillations excited by electron beams streaming along interstellar magnetic field lines ahead of the shocks.... Relative timing between the cosmic rays reflected by the shock and the onset of the plasma oscillations allow us, for the first time, to estimate the energy, ~20â€“100 eV, of the electron beams responsible for the plasma oscillations. These observations are combined into a self-consistent model called the foreshock model that describes the interaction of shocks of solar origin with the interstellar plasma.&quot;')
