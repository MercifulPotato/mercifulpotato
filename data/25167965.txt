I am not sure why I never did. Maybe consumer desktop memory was less dense than server or workstation memory, and the published error rates were for the latter?<p>From 2008 to 2017 I had a 2008 Mac Pro at work with ECC memory, and from 2009 to 2017 I had a 2009 Mac Pro at home with ECC memory. I&#x27;d occasional look in the memory section of the System Information report and never saw any ECC corrected errors reported.<p>With the Mac Pros, it is possible that I just never happened to check the report between the time of a corrected error and the time the counter was next reset (assuming it resets every boot...if it is cumulative than I have no idea how I never got an error).')
