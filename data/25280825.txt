Most computers are horribly insecure - not all computers are hacked.<p>Having said that, Col Waldron mentioned in that hearing that they have pcaps of traffic going from one or more machines on election night to servers in Germany. That&#x27;s a very very crazy claim to make so if they can produce that evidence under oath (and how that was obtained is not super clear) then there&#x27;s going to be problems. I think it&#x27;d hinge on that.')
