It&#x27;s a form of natural monopoly if not monopoly-in-fact and that has to be accounted for if &quot;the people&quot; are to remain in control of their ability to exercise their rights.<p>So, one solution would be to foster an environment where Twitter et.al lose their power because they really CAN&#x27;T lock people in anymore and I would absolutely love to see such a future.<p>But unfortunately that isn&#x27;t where we are right now and the incentives around us are all set up to ensure it never changes.')
