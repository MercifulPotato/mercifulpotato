How exactly does the U.S. verify anything?  Basically the only way to do this would be to have control over some kind of verification system that comes from vetted and registered hospitals.<p>Even then you have so many problems.  There is no realistic way to even partially guarantee that forgeries won&#x27;t happen regardless of your vetting system.  And add to that the fact that the U.S. government has no control over regulations in foreign countries, so there is no way to force validators into compliance.<p>This sounds half baked to me.')
