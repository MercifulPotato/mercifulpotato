Any subsequent events such as a ‘faithless elector’ will have no effect on the settlement of this market. In the event that no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the projected Electoral College votes, this market will be settled on the person chosen as President in accordance with the procedures set out by the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<p>My guess would be that even though they view faithless electors as &#x27;subsequent events&#x27; they still view the outcome of Trump&#x27;s legal challenges as part of the election proper.')
