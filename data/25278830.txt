But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re really asking--it sounds like you want a career focus, which is different (and might be entirely unrelated to what you&#x27;re good at).<p>What do you enjoy doing over and over, where you lose track of time? What do other people tell you you&#x27;re good at? When you were young, what did you most enjoy doing? Start with those kinds of questions, and give them some real thought.<p>Based only on long personal experience, I&#x27;d also say: don&#x27;t waste time looking for an epiphany. That&#x27;s just not how things work. Also, often motivation follows commitment, not the other way around. In other words, we paradoxically often like and become good at what we decide to do.')
