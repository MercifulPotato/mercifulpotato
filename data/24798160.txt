I&#x27;d say my formative reads were:<p>- 1984 and Brave New World. The former should be mandatory reading for everyone, everywhere.<p>- The Bible. Going from &quot;I was raised Christian&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;m gonna read this and ask myself if I really believe this stuff&quot; (I do, but in general I deviate massively from mainstream evangelical Christianity).<p>- Dune. Yep, profoundly transformative. I&#x27;m bummed that some people I&#x27;ve recommend it to don&#x27;t seem to have had the same experience as I had reading it.')
