If you want to change a table, you can run an ALTER TABLE command.<p>But of course you don&#x27;t want to do this in the live, production database unless you&#x27;re a DBA who is doing an upgrade manually for some (probably bad) reason.<p>So, you can try out your ALTER TABLE commands in a scratch database, but you&#x27;ll need to save them to a migration script, and test the migration.<p>It seems like a weakness of this sort of live updating? Sure, you can modify your own running instance, but upgrading the production instance(s) will often still be a lot of work. Migrating a production database schema tends to be a tricky thing.')
