RDP etc.\nI guess for shh and rdp you can just run the Boundary cli with a the predefined target in a terminal embedded into the UI (MremoteNG, MobaXterm etc) but tools like winscp are very much used for sftp file transfers.<p>A desktop client with a list of services&#x2F;targets would also be great. Especially for the less technologically inclined individuals.<p>I know that people have their own opinions on port knocking but I find it as a good tool to remove a lot of noise, some pre built tool for that would be nice but could always just use fwknop-2')
