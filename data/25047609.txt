Your thoughts can make you sick. It took me a long time to realize that idea, to admit that psychosomatic effects are real and strong, that it&#x27;s not craziness, and yes doctors are usually not very useful with that.<p>Simple test: what were your thoughts and emotions 5 minutes ago? 1 hour ago? since this morning? and how were you breathing (slowly with good posture or rapidly)? If your brain is constantly circling thoughts with no cool-down with bad posture it&#x27;s guaranteed you will have physical problems.<p>For me the cure was a combination of:<p>- Slow breathing exercises<p>- Mindfulness (to learn to listen to the body and emotions, an to be aware and able to &quot;control&quot; thoughts). No mysticism bullshit, just having a brain and body at rest and present.<p>- Stoic philosophy : not worrying with things not in my control, not being affected by outcomes (e.g. objectively did my best and the boss&#x2F;client is not happy? That&#x27;s fine for me)<p>- Strength training<p>- Nutrition<p>- Financial security (I know I&#x27;m lucky but that doesn&#x27;t change the point)<p>- Edit: &quot;reconnecting with nature&quot;: again no mysticism, just outdoor walks, gardening, and taking the time to observe and appreciate while being fine doing nothing<p>The best I could describe my default state now is as being relatively at peace, with no negative thoughts circling, slowly breathing with good posture (that I can maintain while coding long hours for example). I&#x27;m still of anxious nature and still worry about the future, but only on the time period I will allow it (and not as a the permanent background noise). YMMV obviously.')
