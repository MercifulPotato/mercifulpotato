That isn’t acceptable in a fan creation from 2002, why is it acceptable for a AAA game in 2020?  It isn’t.  That’s why I returned the game.  Animation bugs and unpolished gameplay are disappointing, but not over the invisible, constantly moving line of “what is acceptable behavior for game publishers”.')
