The system is full of people who don&#x27;t know their job and have no real incentive to (can be difficult to fire government employees).<p>For example, I am involved with a case in which a state trooper made 4 or 5 mistakes, including mis-citing a statute so badly that the court system shows it as invalid and he lacked probable cause to write the citation under the statute that he tried to cite, and thus we were subjected to unjust restrictions for weeks. The trooper even lied to the judge. I filed a complaint and the subsequent investigation confirmed his mistakes, yet he still has a job... after lying to a judge in court to cover up his mistakes...  Did I mention that the judge in the case was replaced because he was arrested on multiple charges (gambling with campaign funds, perjury, etc). The courthouse will not give us replies to many of our requests, such as our petition under the pertainate judicial rule to dismiss the case. They can&#x27;t even issue a correctly formed subpoena duces tecum.<p>So yeah, I feel disillusioned with the effectiveness and legitimacy of the system. Our lives are ruled by morons. I&#x27;m considering contacting a civil rights lawyer so this stuff doesn&#x27;t happen to others in the future.<p>Second, intelligence is often the most overstated component to success according to many studies on the topic.')
