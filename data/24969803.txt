If your husband has just been murdered because of a riot instigated by a deepfake, it&#x27;s not a great comfort to know that it&#x27;s not really the &quot;fault&quot; of the deepfake but instead the &quot;fault&quot; of a broken civil society.<p>Plus, deepfakes have the potential to create much more noxious videos than real life. Real life videos depict real life people, flaws and complexities all included; deepfakes will be constructed to depict representations of the target that&#x27;re most likely to generate inchoate rage of the mob. It&#x27;s rare that the former happens to be exactly the latter.')
