That shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.  It&#x27;s probably possible for them to release a script that does it automatically depending on what information is preserved from the DEB in the APK with regard to types of files and how complex the thing you want to install is.<p>I don&#x27;t have much experience with DEBs, but have quite a bit with RPMs and their spec files which are used to create them, and this wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to do with an RPM (and you can convert RPMs to DEBs in many cases with utilities).')
