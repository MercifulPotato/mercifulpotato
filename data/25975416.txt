The actual development piece is a pretty small portion of the overall work.  The bulk of it is figuring out all the requirements, wrangling legacy systems and data into some kind of shape that can either be interfaced with or imported, documentation, support (including phone), client hand-holding, etc.  Yes it&#x27;s a lot of overhead, but this isn&#x27;t a run of the mill green-field SaaS app a few 22 year olds can crank out in a few weeks.')
