They&#x27;re things I stomach. I think I&#x27;d use OpenBSD if I were confident that after setting it up, it worked reliably, without changes, for the next few decades, with transparent system upgrades.<p>Part of that is working Bluetooth, power management, webcams, video conferencing, OBS, and similar. Historically, OpenBSD was behind Linux on working reliably.<p>Debian used to do this before:<p>1) It fell behind on hardware support, as laptops took over desktops; and<p>2) Ubuntu&#x2F;Fedora started putting out massive numbers of half-baked technologies, and everything building atop those.<p>I switched to Ubuntu, without Gnome, but increasingly, things don&#x27;t work without Ubuntu&#x27;s UX, and snap shows a future I don&#x27;t want to head down anymore.<p>I&#x27;ll look into arch linux, as someone suggested.')
