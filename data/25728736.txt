Executives often want to expand their kingdoms, even at the expense of shareholders. They also suffer from &quot;shiny new object&quot; syndrome - buying whatever&#x27;s sexy.<p>Potentially worse, there&#x27;s the &quot;winner&#x27;s curse&quot; in auctions. About 7 years ago, Joseph A. Bank tried to buy its larger competitor, Men&#x27;s Wearhouse. Men&#x27;s Wearhouse then surprised Bank&#x27;s execs by making a counter-offer. They got into a bidding war against each other, neither side wanting to &quot;lose,&quot; with Men&#x27;s Wearhouse &quot;winning&quot; by buying its smaller competitor for $1.8B. And we know, even pre-pandemic, how that story turned out!<p>Point is: don&#x27;t weigh too heavily what other people will pay for a company today... weigh more what your analysis suggests the company will produce in the future (<i>not</i> what other people will pay in the future).')
