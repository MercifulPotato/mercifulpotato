Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25672154], score=None, time=1610000784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667672, text='&gt; “Ballot stuffing” would require a lot more than sneaking in a suitcase of ballots<p>Actually it would not require more. Sneaking in ballots that do not each correspond to one legal voter&#x27;s actual vote would be technically and functionally sufficient.<p>&gt; which, to be clear, video surveillance shows is NOT what happened here.<p>Can you refer to the chain of custody that provides evidence that these are legal ballots? Can you share the part of the video that proves these are legal ballots?<p>&gt; The number of ballots needs to match the number of votes cast according to the voter rolls.<p>I&#x27;d need to see how these numbers were verified and what oversight was present. These ballots could have been added to the entries on the voter rolls when they were introduced into the counting facility.  Without a proper chain of custody, we don&#x27;t know. With suspicious behavior on film, we should investigate.<p>&gt; Is your theory that someone requested 18,000 ballots to registered voters at 18,000 different addresses and then returned them with matching signatures and also somehow ensured that none of them tried to vote themselves, which would have been immediately flagged?<p>No, my &quot;theory&quot; is that the chain of custody for these ballots (the ones hidden under the table and counted in the middle of the night <i>sans</i> (R) observers) has not been presented as evidence, therefore it is normal for people to wonder if they are legitimate ballots. I don&#x27;t need to theorize anything else in order to have legitimate concerns about election integrity.<p>&gt; also somehow ensured that none of them tried to vote themselves, which would have been immediately flagged?<p>flagging doesn&#x27;t do much when the flags are dismissed and the suspicious conduct explained as &quot;just normal activity.&quot;<p>&gt; In all seriousness I think you should volunteer to be an observer for the next election and you will see how crazy this sounds.<p>I think it would drive me nuts to witness misconduct, report it, swear to it in an affidavit, then hear three months of people denying my personal experience on the basis of claims by talking heads.<p>&gt; how crazy this sounds.<p>There are a lot of disturbing things about election 2020, but somehow one of the worst is this attitude that I&#x27;m crazy if I think someone might do something illegal or unethical to sway an election, or am not convinced by the evidence-free attestations of persons who seem unable to entertain another person&#x27;s perspective.')
