There are a bunch of them from a legal perspective, and maybe they will carry the day. They don&#x27;t necessarily make sense from a non-legal colloquial perspective.<p>From a non-legal perspective, one of the big harms (I would argue) is in the destruction of the business model for small ad-supported publishers. Google was taking 80% of money that should have gone to them, and digital and physical publishers (like local newspapers) have had a mass extinction.<p>That said, out of the ashes, rises the phoenix. Substack and other subscription models owe their opportunity to Google&#x27;s monopoly, and in many ways they&#x27;re the mammals in this ecosystem of dying dinosaurs.')
