Granted, some are electives, like high-level stats.  But even back in 2010, data science electives were available to fill the gaps.  I took three DS&amp;E classes in college with projects that were end-to-end platforms, where you&#x27;d have to collect, clean, and analyze the data, then build, test, and deploy models from it.<p>I would certainly hope that college courses are even more comprehensive after 10 years and an explosion in interest for the field.<p>Also, much like being a full stack developer, a full stack data engineer doesn&#x27;t need to know everything at a master level.  But that you can at least handle tasks at most points in the chain.')
