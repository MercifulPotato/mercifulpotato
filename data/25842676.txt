Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611117996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842535, text='&gt;nobody seems to be able to agree on exactly what Terrorism is,<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true.  Without looking anything up, I&#x27;d define terrorism as a tool to advance political goals through the use of violence and intimidation to create fear&#x2F;terrorize target groups.<p>That&#x27;s a very general description, of course.  However, I think it sums up &quot;terrorism&quot; pretty well.<p>I&#x27;ll now go and look up some definitions and see if I&#x27;m right.  Please stand by...<p>&quot;the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion&quot;[0]<p>&quot;the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.&quot;[1]<p>&quot;Terrorism, the calculated use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective.&quot;[2]<p>As you can see above, from the English language definition of the word standpoint, my definition seems accurate.<p>That said, <i>legal definitions</i> of &#x27;terrorism&#x27; by various <i>governments</i> (as well as sub-classes of terrorism) are not as clearly defined.  For example (not including quotes, as they&#x27;re all fairly long):<p>US Law[3] Defines &quot;international&quot; and &quot;domestic&quot; terrorism separately.<p>The UK[4] has it&#x27;s own definition as well.<p>As does the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.[5]<p>However, <i>all</i> of these include the more general definition I and the various dictionaries&#x2F;encyclopedia quoted put forward.<p>So, no.  I think we all, in general, agree what &quot;terrorism&quot; <i>is</i>.  The difference is in how legal codes treat such activities.<p>It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m missing the point here.  If so, please elucidate that statement.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;terrorism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;terrorism</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dictionary.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;terrorism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dictionary.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;terrorism</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;terrorism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;terrorism</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;18&#x2F;2331" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;18&#x2F;2331</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cps.gov.uk&#x2F;crime-info&#x2F;terrorism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cps.gov.uk&#x2F;crime-info&#x2F;terrorism</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unodc.org&#x2F;e4j&#x2F;en&#x2F;terrorism&#x2F;module-4&#x2F;key-issues&#x2F;defining-terrorism.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unodc.org&#x2F;e4j&#x2F;en&#x2F;terrorism&#x2F;module-4&#x2F;key-issues&#x2F;d...</a><p>Edit: Fixed typos, clarified language.')
