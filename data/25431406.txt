Crawling is hard, but actually one of the easier parts of building a search engine. There are less complete, but still pretty impressive public crawls available already, like Common Crawl.<p>The harder problem is what you do with the result of the crawl once you have it. You need to index it. This is one of Google&#x27;s deepest moats. Being able to serve any of hundreds of billions of documents in milliseconds requires an enormous amount of infrastructure and hundreds of careers worth of difficult software engineering.<p>I don&#x27;t see a good way to split indexing out as a separate company from the rest of the search engine. It&#x27;s tightly integrated with ranking. Generally a new ranking technique requires some new information to be associated with each document in the index, e.g. some precomputed scores that describe the document&#x27;s quality or fitness for different kinds of queries. At query time, you&#x27;re often just weighting and comparing these scores across documents.<p>If you had Google&#x27;s index, you&#x27;d be a long way towards being able to replicate Google&#x27;s results, but I don&#x27;t think that would lead to the kind of innovation you&#x27;re hoping for.')
