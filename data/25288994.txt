I routinely develop using release build only and only ever execute a debug build if I really have to drop into the debugger. U find that this gives me a better experience as it puts me closer to the actual end product in terms of UX and functionality in general. (I obviously still use things like asserts that are always built in even in my release build a so I don&#x27;t skip on bug detection just because it&#x27;s a release build)')
