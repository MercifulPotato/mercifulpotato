We had easy access to chromebooks, so it made sense, especially since you could have a teacher account where you could set up accounts for students. They have a similar teacher mode today, but getting it set up looks more involved, and I&#x27;m not sure what the features and pricing are.<p>I wonder who the main users are. Schools certainly make sense with the notoriously locked down computers.<p>There appears to be more free competitors now, so I&#x27;m curious what we&#x27;d use today. Eclipse Theia looks like VSCode, so that&#x27;d probably the most appealing to a lot of teams like mine. Eclipse Che&#x2F;Codeenvy looks like the most popular. There&#x27;s a lot more low-key options for sure. Has anyone tried Github Codespaces?')
