One mustn&#x27;t assume other countries are necessarily intended targets.<p>There is no reason to believe there was ever any expectation that ESP would work for spying, or that any actual effort was undertaken to try. However, a great deal of work went into convincing Americans that it had been attempted. Ultimately, that work has to be seen as the actual point of the operation. There is no clear indication of the purpose of the operation.<p>Jon Ronson&#x27;s (terrifying) book, &quot;Men Who Stare at Goats&quot;, explored the history of the operation and the group that perpetrated it. He made clear that it is not just historical, but an ongoing operation, a successful attack on the American public.<p>Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Star Wars &quot;Strategic Defense Initiative&quot; could very easily have been primarily a PSY-OP against the USSR. A great deal of money was spent with very little direct result, but the USSR military went apeshit over it and crashed their whole economy. (Disclosure: I flew to a semiconductor conference in Hungary in 1987, on SDI money via AFNOR, with a stopover in East Berlin.)')
