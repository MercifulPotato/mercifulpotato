Keeping it around long enough and word gets out that Domino&#x27;s is good again<p>That&#x27;s not how it went down, and that&#x27;s not how these things work. The Domino&#x27;s brand value was in the gutter and would&#x27;ve taken forever to recover - management had to greenlight an absolutely massive advertising campaign to let people know about the new improved product, which is the only reason you know about it. They spent a ton of money and there&#x27;s a chance it might not have worked. The prevailing theory at the time was that people don&#x27;t give a shit about fast food quality, they just want food that&#x27;s fast and affordable to shut the kids up for a bit.
