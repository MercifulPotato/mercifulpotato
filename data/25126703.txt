It&#x27;s a trust issue. Usually when a place is out of order, it isn&#x27;t an employee problem but a management problem. Isn&#x27;t it the job of the authorities to understand their population and know how to communicate important things to them? Or maybe millions of people are just stupid and deserve to die.')
