Republicans heavily gerrymandered country in their favor in 2010 and given that 2020 census is practically a failure, that advantage is  going to stay. Conservatives get to control the SCOTUS for decades. Voters from the red states enjoy unfair influence their vote gives them via Senate.<p>If after all this the electorate feels profoundly unheard maybe they should look at who they vote for.')
