We are talking about what masses are physically possible, whether or not we can measure all of them with unbounded accuracy.<p><i>&gt; there is infinity of digits available</i><p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways. If it is physically true that there are an infinite number of digits available to specify an object&#x27;s mass, then it is also physically true that there are multiple possible combinations of objects whose masses can sum to that same mass (in fact there will be an infinite number of them).<p>Conversely, if it is <i>not</i> physically true that there are multiple possible combinations of objects whose masses can sum to a given mass, there cannot be an infinite number of digits available to specify an object&#x27;s mass: there must be only a finite number of possible masses, and the numbers specifying the possible masses must be such that no two such numbers add up to another such number.')
