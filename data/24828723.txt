There are several stories of athletes switching countries, including South Korean speedskater Ahn Hyun-soo who became a Russian citizen and changed his name to Viktor Ahn to join the Russian speedskating team, after falling out with the South Korean skating federation.</i><p>It&#x27;s a shame, because I want to believe athletes and their coaches are honest people who strive for the highest possible standards, but it&#x27;s hard not to become jaded after decades of pervasive instances of unfair advantages, corner-cutting, and outright cheating.')
