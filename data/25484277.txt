Item(by='psykotic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608444657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483787, text='It&#x27;s true that ARM64 has a load-store architecture and fixed-length instructions (the latter depending on the former for encoding space efficiency). Other than that, the instruction set design is very far from minimalist textbook-style RISC ISAs like RISC-V. It has both flag-based branches and fused compare-to-zero-and-branch instructions. It has very complex immediate encodings. It has instructions for loading&#x2F;storing register pairs. It has pre-increment&#x2F;post-increment addressing modes of the kind that were hallmarks of CISCs like M68K and VAX.<p>It seems unwise to draw far-reaching conclusions about RISC-V or even ARM64&#x27;s intrinsic merits versus Apple&#x27;s CPU designers when there are so many variables. The frontend decoder hasn&#x27;t been a frequent bottleneck in Intel cores for a long time and they could scale it up more aggressively if they wanted.<p>Apple&#x27;s engineers did a great job. That seems to be the conclusion we can draw based on currently available evidence.')
