It depends a bit on the clients, but in the finance sector 1000€&#x2F;day are standard. Many colleagues tell me they would not work for less then 100€&#x2F;hour.<p>Coming from academia where you are lucky with a 2000€&#x2F;month postdoc position, this is insane. It feels completely detached from the rest of society. Even a professor, judge or director doesn&#x27;t make more then 8000€&#x2F;month (netto).')
