So language that&#x27;s a plain listing of that in a standard format isn&#x27;t copyrightable, because it&#x27;s just a straightforward way to list the uncopyrightable recipe. But if you use especially creative and unique language to <i>describe</i> a recipe, that particular language might be copyrightable. The <i>recipe</i> as a recipe is not; the language used to describe it can be, if it&#x27;s an unusual or creative way to do so. But someone can most definitely always use their own language to express the same recipe -- the same ingredients in the same amounts combined in the same ways, is not copyrightable.<p>This has until now seemed like it should also mean that the <i>API</i> as API is not copyrightable, and a straightforward implementation of something like `min` is also not, as it&#x27;s just the only reasonable way to implement `min`. But an especially clever or creative algorithm to implement a part of an API might be.')
