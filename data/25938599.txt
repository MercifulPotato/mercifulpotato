If I buy GameStop at $100 believing I can sell it for $120 tomorrow, I am buying that stock honestly believing in its current value so I&#x27;m not sure you can call it manipulation any more than another investor hoping to cash in on an expectation that a stock will appreciate.<p>How do you decide whether or not something is manipulation?  Everybody invests in stocks expecting them to go up - at what point is it nefarious?')
