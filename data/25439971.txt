Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=[25440939], score=None, time=1608103578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439220, text='&gt; She has a net worth in the 10s of billions (and deserves every cent).<p>I guess I tend to assume that the partner of overseas military raising kids alone for long periods of time, or the partner working night shifts to save for their child&#x27;s college education, or the partner that is always parenting because they can&#x27;t afford a nanny, or the partner that makes Christmas special on a shoestring budget, etc. would be as equally if not more deserving, yet they don&#x27;t even get 1&#x2F;100,000th of this settlement.<p>The sole determination of a partners worth in a divorce settlement is their partners income, regardless of their sacrifices or contributions. I&#x27;d rather see something merit based or earning potential based, even though I realize it&#x27;s impossible to do that fairly or accurately.<p>But to suggest Scott deserves every penny I think wreaks of unfairness to amazing partners that were left high and dry in a divorce for the sole reason that their partners didn&#x27;t become millionaires or billionaires. We can&#x27;t give every amazing partner $38B, but we could try to make it more equitable for all partners with similar backgrounds and earning potential.')
