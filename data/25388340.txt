Angular &#x2F; React was very much an east coast &#x2F; west coast thing for awhile, as one example.<p>Cypress was officed at ATDC at Georgia Tech (now downtown), so a lot of companies and startups in metro Atlanta adopted it and helped it take off. Further, any student from GT or SPSU trying to intern through ATDC (and probably ATV) would have been at least tangentially exposed to it, meaning these new grads &#x2F; young devs got exposed early enough in their careers as to be impressionable, and more likely to adopt something new. It also helps to adopt a technology when you&#x27;re three doors down from the devs.')
