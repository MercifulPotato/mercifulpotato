I tell the company &quot;Yeah you should totally pay me $100k, I live in high-CoL area, $FriendsAddress is my NYC address.&quot;  Then I simply don&#x27;t tell anyone at the company I&#x27;m actually doing my job from somewhere in West Virginia or Indiana or Wisconsin.  How would the company even know the difference?  On the rare occasion the company or someone sends me some work-related postal mail, my friend can simply forward it to me.<p>In practice I wouldn&#x27;t do this.  I&#x27;d simply walk away from a company that uses this offensive hiring practice on me.')
