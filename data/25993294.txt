Also poked at Brigade and Tekton (who sadly are now CI&#x2F;CD focused, not general EDA) and local Github Actions runners.<p>Workflow was mentioned in the Argo Events docs a couple times. Events is a pretty general system, but if you need to assemble more complex inter-dependent tasks, they had Workflow integration. I didn&#x27;t get super far in, look very deep at how the integration worked, or how pleased I was going to be using Workflows, as I was mainly interested in the EDA end to start.<p>Anyhow, picking through Workflow 3.0, my main interest is:<p>&gt; Argo Workflows v3.0 comes with a new UI that now also supports Argo Events! The UI is also more robust and reliable.<p>Really seems like Argo Workflow has been made the over-arching UI for both of these systems in this 3.0 release. There&#x27;s now some event-flow pages in Workflow 3.0, that will be interesting to check out. I&#x27;m very interested in how the APIs have all been updated, how the systems work together. Especially given Argo Event&#x27;s fall 1.0 release &amp; the new architecture[1].<p>One other cool feature from the Workflow 3.0 is Widgets. Embed some code in other pages so you can see build status, job status, &amp;c.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.argoproj.io&#x2F;argo-events-v1-0-released-b69668de0583" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.argoproj.io&#x2F;argo-events-v1-0-released-b69668de0...</a>')
