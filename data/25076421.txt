I don&#x27;t think it would serve Apple&#x27;s customers to get rid of binary signing either.<p>Since there are no legal ramifications for security bugs that cause downtime, or for bugs that cause other functionality that goes down, I&#x27;m not sure why this particular bug would be any different. It&#x27;s certainly not as bad as losing one&#x27;s Google account permanently without recourse.')
