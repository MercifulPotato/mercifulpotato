As an example, &quot;improper enforcement of the law&quot; might suggest that something was enforced which wasn&#x27;t the law. Is there a reason you&#x27;re set on this interpretation of my words?<p>In this, and the Scotsman case, you seem to have chosen an interpretation fits your argument. I&#x27;m not sure this is a good way to carry on a conversation, though. This whole discussion was about whether pindab0ter made a valid point. It&#x27;s not clear to me you are interested in understanding the point made. Maybe it&#x27;s easier for you to label it as a fallacy. I know that&#x27;s something I do frequently when I don&#x27;t understand something -- assume it&#x27;s incorrect.')
