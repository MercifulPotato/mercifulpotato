Item(by='Can_Not', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608644369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504895, text='&gt; There will be people who make life-changing mistakes because they didn&#x27;t have access to a viewpoint that catalyzed an insight that was important for them.<p>This goes both ways though. Some people will choose to transition their gender because internet people might over-encourage them, but far more people who should transition won&#x27;t because trans erasure, censorship, and discrimination was the norm until this decade. And technically, mostly still is the norm. You have far more &quot;don&#x27;t you dare imply being trans is ok&quot; IRL than you have &quot;don&#x27;t you dare imply being trans is not ok&quot; online.<p>And this comment leaves out critical facts. Medical professionals don&#x27;t just hand out pills and surgeries to anyone who just walks in. Individuals are given serious consultations where they can help get a diagnosis and then the ability to make an informed decision in regards to their options.<p>People who regret transition are actually a tiny minority. Why is it a tiny minority? Because medical professionals put a lot of effort into vetting patients.<p>People getting &quot;censored&quot; are actually just repeating &quot;somebody once regretted it, therefor no one should ever get it&quot; over and over again, usually in less honest wording, often just transphobia or bullying just for the sake of it.<p>In normal parlance, this is just called &quot;moderation&quot;.')
