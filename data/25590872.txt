Just to give you an idea of how it works: we the participants are free to register and get some points after every completed poll&#x2F;survey (the amount of points depend on how long it took). With these points we can access to a &quot;shop&quot; of small prizes, like headphones, small cameras, books, etc. I assume that the companies making the polls are the ones paying and probably they select the demography of the people to survey (we&#x27;re asked about this info on the polls). Maybe a model like that can work for you too.')
