And possibly keeping Apple devices  vpned to such a network.<p>I was looking forward to new Apple devices, but feel uncertain about the &quot;trust Apple but no one else&quot; approach.<p>Concerns:<p>1) Apple devices have been configurable to be respectful if not invisible in corporate or client windows networks.<p>You could use a Mac with a firewall in windows environments without being worried about setting off something on the network for unusual traffic. Especially for environments that don&#x27;t support some but don&#x27;t stop it either.<p>2) Corporate Windows networks can control the monitoring of telemetry and metadata to a higher degree than Apple now seems to. It could be a new gap in Apple when compared to others.<p>If the above are true, it&#x27;s not clear if Apple sees few Mac users in any corporate environment as an opportunity to grow, it&#x27;s only accelerating the consideration of other operating systems.<p>Apple also appears to be signaling that devices do not belong to the customer. The idea of we will protect your data, but trust your data to our policies, which we can change seems confusing. I&#x27;m considering the new iPhone for security, but this workaround seems like an affront to it.')
