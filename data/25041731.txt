Over the past few weeks, I had found a group that posts &#x27;deals&#x27;...on crap I don&#x27;t need, but usually promo codes to buy things for a dollar or two.  I&#x27;ve become a bit prolific reviewer since my wife and I compete for reviews&#x2F;helpful&#x2F;ranks(stupid, I know).<p>What do you know...Amazon started deleting my reviews.  20 or so deleted so far, and a lot of helpful votes gone as well.  If I try to re-review any of those, it tells me I&#x27;m not allowed to review this item from my account.  So great, I&#x27;m a scammer now.<p>Between fake reviews, and now this - Amazon effectively having wasted my time it took writing reviews, I&#x27;ve been ordering more from Walmart.  Sure they aren&#x27;t great, but they aren&#x27;t Amazon.')
