I used satellite internet for a month back in 2009 and it was brutal.  Minimum 500ms.  Literally had to break my lease to move to another place that offered broadband so I could actually work. I see starlink satellites are orbiting much lower but that would seem to only account for maybe 25% (?) of the gap between 20ms and 500ms.')
