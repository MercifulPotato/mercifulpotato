I struggle to think of any outside of the more popular browsers. The Snap and Flatpak sandboxes are good case studies in the practical limits of Linux sandboxing: it’s rarely effective without designing your entire app around it because the way most applications interact with the system was never designed for it. X11 probably being the most egregious limiter, followed by no standard trusted file access UI.<p>On the server, there’s a reason Amazon built Firecracker and Google built gVisor instead of just using the Linux sandboxing primitives. I think calling them “industrial grade” is pushing it when they’re rarely used as the first line of defense against code that is expected to be actively hostile.')
