Can we agree on that?<p>My point is that a broadly aggregated statistics like &quot;global IFR&quot; is too crude to be actionable. Easy to put in a headline, sure, but more potential for confusion than good.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;bulletin&#x2F;online_first&#x2F;BLT.20.265892.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;bulletin&#x2F;online_first&#x2F;BLT.20.265892.pdf</a>')
