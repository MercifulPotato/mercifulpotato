I didn&#x27;t want bitflags, this was just basically for an enumeration of channels&#x2F;parameters e.g Foo=0, Bar=1, Baz=2. Ideally I&#x27;d like one that was numbered automatically and also offered a way of enumerating the possible values at runtime. I can&#x27;t remember why I went back to constants in that case.<p>Another struggle I remember was just getting the max defined value. Again the Rust type is pretty Opaque because it hides the all-powerful discriminated union type. I love the Rust enum type, but I wish Rust also had a first-class dumb enum type, with all the C&#x2F;C# niceties (bitflags, runtime enumeration, selection of backing field). This seems like quite a different from what the rust enum is.')
