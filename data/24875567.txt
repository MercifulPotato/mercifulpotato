Item(by='jkaplowitz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603496285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873363, text='[Edit: I&#x27;m not completely sure how section 1201 interfaces with the fair use rules, but at the very least, a quick glance at the statute (as well as awareness of the First Amendment constitutional underpinnings of fair use) makes me believe the interaction does not entirely eliminate fair use in a context where section 1201 applies. It&#x27;s clearly complicated.]<p>The law makes it clear downloading copyright material without holding copyright or a suitable license is <i>usually</i> not legal, but exceptions exist in many countries including the US (where the exception is called fair use).<p>Some uses of youtube-dl with RIAA-member-copyrighted content very probably fall under that fair use exception, even if other common uses do not. For example, if a music critic wants to use youtube-dl to import a music video into video editing software to produce a review of it, interspersing only a small excerpt of the original video with commentary on it, that&#x27;s classic fair use and would be an easy win in US court if accused of copyright infringement.<p>If the actual and as-marketed purpose of covering those copyrighted videos by 3 of 94 unit tests is to make sure that such noninfringing fair uses of youtube-dl are possible with the technologies involved in those videos, I expect that the DMCA claim is invalid. If the actual or as-marketed purpose is to ensure that it&#x27;s possible to infringe those videos, then the DMCA claim is valid.<p>That&#x27;s a question of fact for a judge (in a bench trial) or a jury (in a jury trial). If the more favorable answer is true and credibly defensible in court, youtube-dl might be able to survive a motion for summary judgment, gain support in the court of public opinion, and lead the RIAA to consider settling or dropping the claim.<p>But if they were indeed trying to facilitating illegal circumvention or infringement, or if they can&#x27;t credibly prove otherwise in court, yeah this won&#x27;t end well for their ability to host youtube-dl in the many countries that now have a DMCA-like law.<p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a lawyer, just a former law student layman who remains a legal geek interested in and relatively informed in these areas. But I don&#x27;t claim to be authoritative and this is definitely not legal advice. youtube-dl should definitely involve a suitably expert and qualified lawyer if they&#x27;re going to fight this.)')
