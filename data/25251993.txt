I tried Clojure a few years back and I got a warm welcome, so I&#x27;d like to extend an invitation to anyone considering using Clojure for this year&#x27;s puzzles, head over to the Clojurians Slack and the #adventofcode channel and hang out. There&#x27;s no competitiveness and people just like to compare notes and discuss approaches. A lot of Europe representation too!')
