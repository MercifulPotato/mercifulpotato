If you upload 100GB&#x2F;day, that&#x27;s also about $120&#x2F;mo and if you&#x27;re storing about 1TB you&#x27;re paying like $350&#x2F;mo for such little storage you get.<p>Who wants to pay for upload?\nAt this point, why don&#x27;t you just run EBS backed EC2 yourself?<p>With that kind of pricing, you&#x27;d get like 15TB of space at rsync.net and it doesn&#x27;t leech users for bandwidth and on every parameters as AWS does. (If you use the borg discount, you get 40TB+ at $0.008&#x2F;GB!)<p>And at what benefit does it bring for the price difference? I see no point in using it. Maybe people don&#x27;t care to mention than not knowing it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;aws-transfer-family&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;aws-transfer-family&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;products&#x2F;borg.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsync.net&#x2F;products&#x2F;borg.html</a>')
