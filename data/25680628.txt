Rumors that Pence was there and it was Secret Service haven&#x27;t been confirmed; he had been in the Senate chamber and Secret Service had evacuated him, so it&#x27;s unlikely he would end up on the House side in a poorly secured area.  News reports indicate it was simply Capitol Police, possibly someone associated with the House Sgt at Arms since they have an office somewhere around there.<p>I guess the woman, despite being a veteran (Air Force... why is it the Air Force has so many crazy people?), was so caught up in LARPing that she couldn&#x27;t rationally evaluate that this was the last meaningful barrier to the House chamber and they might have more liberal rules of engagement or someone might panic and overstep their RoE to prevent an unauthorized mob from entering.  If she&#x27;d climbed through, she could have opened the door to the mob.<p>On the other hand, I can see the argument that shooting her was an absurd overreaction.  There were armed capitol police who had just come up the stairs behind her and that group of protesters, and they were doing nothing.  The news reports that the justification for the shooting was that she might have been armed, but if that&#x27;s really their rationale, it&#x27;s a bad one.  They should have retreated to the main chamber, because they weren&#x27;t in a good tactical position, trying to defend a barrier with windows large enough for people to climb through.  In addition, no such resistance was offered on the Senate side.  When you&#x27;re outnumbered that badly, unless you have special training like the Secret Service would, and plenty of ammo, you&#x27;re not going to accomplish anything by shooting anyone, unless they are overtly threatening people such that you think you&#x27;re going to die or be taken captive anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t think Capitol Police are legally at fault in any way for her death, but I think they did the wrong thing there.')
