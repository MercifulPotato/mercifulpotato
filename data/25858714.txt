I&#x27;m giving them the benefit of the doubt they didn&#x27;t mean anyone has to think about XEP-0027 in 2021. They implied they could break compatibility some day. So I think they&#x27;re talking about not having 2 current standards. How they see a transition working is still a good question though.')
