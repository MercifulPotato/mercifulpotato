Check out this video for a practical example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nUzLlHFVXx0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nUzLlHFVXx0</a><p>I&#x27;m in the middle of a big refactor and writing reusable custom hooks are an absolute savior to share functionality across components that may have nothing to do with each other.<p>Hooks are functions, which is why we can compose them to build new behavior from smaller ones. That&#x27;s the point. Just cause a thing is a function doesn&#x27;t mean its pure. Like I said above, hooks are often meant to contain the impure parts of your otherwise declartive and pure UI expressing the UI as a function of state.')
