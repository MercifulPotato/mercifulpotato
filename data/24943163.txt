They don&#x27;t need to, though, because people who want to run Linux are happy installing it on kit they already have.<p>I think if Valve built out their game streaming tech (stream from your PC in the background or stream from our cloud), offered a gamepass-like subscription, and make proton work for 100% of their games and tested all of them for compatibility, they would have the best offering. From the sales, usability, features, and catalog they&#x27;d be able to be competitive. With what Microsoft is doing, in a few years steam will be in a very bad spot.')
