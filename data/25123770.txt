I don&#x27;t want to have to see a GUI in my brain to do that. Similarly, not everyone likes having to use what is traditionally called a GUI.<p>For git, I prefer the CLI, though I use some helpers for completion, I have some scripts I wrote to show remote and local branches with their authors in different states of merge, etc. My guess is that in your GUI, you don&#x27;t have that level of customization, and probably didn&#x27;t even think it was an option. That&#x27;s the problem with GUIs for me.')
