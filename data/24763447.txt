Languages are not created in a planned, thought-through manner. Instead they are designed by human beings.<p>&gt; But what if they were, in fact, planned?<p>[snip good post]<p>There&#x27;s also the Le Corbusier Problem: A language has to be livable in order to be used, and everyone&#x27;s conception of livability is different, but few people desire to live in what could be defined as the logical minimum required.<p>Even mathematical notation is inconsistent and luxuriant sometimes; for example, we have sine, cosine, tangent, and so on, when we all know that complex exponentiation would suffice. That&#x27;s a multitude of functions which are all non-orthogonal variations on a theme! What wastage! What profligacy! A truly austere system would have very few, if any, named functions.<p>But, of course, humans can&#x27;t live like that, and few desire to try.')
