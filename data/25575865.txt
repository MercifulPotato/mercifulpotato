It doesn&#x27;t come across instantly as an acronym it just looks like a company name being yelled.<p>If it were an acronym I&#x27;d expect full stops between each letter. I find the long names far more descriptive and useful I can read that and go yep...topic has no interest to me. CIDER doesn&#x27;t have the same effect. This ain&#x27;t just this app that&#x27;s done it. Another app I had a similar mental struggle associating was slack.

Things are called what they are and namings generally pretty basic. I don&#x27;t find dealing with the naming in tech anywhere near as easy. It&#x27;s a bit of a barrier to learning for me tbh.')
