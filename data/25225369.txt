It&#x27;s completely undocumented. I&#x27;m smack in the middle of completely rewriting what I had yesterday, and I haven&#x27;t tested it in its current state. I&#x27;ve discovered PRAW and am trying to use it rather than make direct requests to Reddit&#x27;s API. I&#x27;m not yet convinced that&#x27;s a good idea. So it&#x27;s almost certainly somehow broken right now. I can&#x27;t promise I&#x27;ll maintain it or pay any attention to bug reports or pull requests.<p>But hey, sometimes random code on the internet just needs to be random code on the internet. Maybe it can inspire someone more competent and dedicated to a project like this to fire something up.')
