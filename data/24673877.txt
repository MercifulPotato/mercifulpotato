I have no idea where you got that idea, since the same sort of sources that teach you about these concepts are very emphatic about photons being massless.<p>Here is one of the 3-5 interesting facts I remember from my modern physics class: Two photons going the same direction have no mass, but two photons in <i>different</i> directions <i>do</i> have mass. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t remember the math well enough to explain it. Maybe this means your right about being able to put photons in orbit around each other.')
