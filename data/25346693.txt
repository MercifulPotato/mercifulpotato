It scales the UI, but it does not really change it to that degree.<p>Thanks! I have been busy with my day job lately, so I have just been trying to use my PinePhone with Phosh mostly. Lomiri is nice, but Manjaro Lomiri is not yet at the point where it does not break on upgrades, which makes it nice to play with but impossible to use.')
