I had an Intel 13-inch Macbook Pro before this, and simply running, for example, a high-viewer Twitch stream with chat open in the background would heat the chassis to ridiculous levels, and blast the fan constantly. On my M1, not only is there no fan, but the unit is completely cool to the touch with all of the same applications running. I&#x27;m impressed to say the least.')
