Porting 1000 lines of python 2 that deals with files encoded in various ways where it’s impossible to test all edge cases and where a failure might lead to huge liability charges is hard not because it’s hard to run 2to3 and do some random tests, but because you don’t know what you have missed. And still, a 300k lines of code project might be fine to just run 2to3 on and then find the bugs as you go. It’s a matter of context.')
