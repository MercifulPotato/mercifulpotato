Item(by='FabGenovese', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610992141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822365, text='No. I don&#x27;t know why everyone is getting so much fixated with the epidemiological aspect, that in our paper is barely mentioned. Ours is a technical contribution that uses results from groupoid theory and homotopy theory to provide a framework where different flavors of nets given in the last 30 years or so can be nicely interconnected.<p>Applications are not the central focus of this paper. There are about a ton of applied papers out there employing Petri nets in computing, chemistry, epidemiology etc. This paper is not one of them. We just mentioned, in passing, how different flavors of nets have been applied in the last decades. We deem this to be an interesting paper for people working in Petri nets theory, because it systematizes decades of research. I&#x27;m pretty sure it will be of little interest for anyone not directly involved in Petri net research. :)')
