In the blog post, I explain our rationale for focusing on Rust even though I&#x27;m aware there are many other things we could talk about. Primarily, I think Rust encourages good programming practices, and, by working through practical assignments, students are able to develop better habits and have a more cohesive experience than they would if we just gave them an assorted list of technologies to know. That being said, I do wish we had spent more time giving students a better awareness of what&#x27;s out there and talking about useful tools such as fuzzers.')
