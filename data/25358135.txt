It&#x27;s a war of unrest and faith in one&#x27;s country. For decades the west tried to arm revolutionaries to help overthrow unfriendly tyrants, but in recent years the west has become a target itself. Modern politics is tainted by this war money, which pays for ads and social groups and calls to protest that only seek to incite violence, not bring about social change. China is seemingly ahead of the curve, creating AI to counteract the effects of this external influence. As a nice side-effect it enforces nice homogenized citizens the way only AI can (with lots of false positives, who are real people who will get destroyed because they&#x27;re a false positive, but who cares, the ends justify the means etc.) but also, you&#x27;ll notice that Facebook and Twitter have been building up such self-inoculations as well, first with automated detection of COVID falsehoods, and then with automated detection of election falsehoods, and the latest is you can get a suspension on Facebook for posting a series of words that a dumb AI thinks is similar to a racist phrase.')
