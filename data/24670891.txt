Item(by='p0d', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601719097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670746, text='I was a church youth worker in the mid 90s when my friend gave me his Dad&#x27;s old 386 computer which started my interest in computing. I went on to buy a second hand 486 for Â£200 which was a big investment for my wife and I at the time.<p>My curious nature resulted in me upgrading my 486. I lost a night of my life trying to add a cdrom when I didn&#x27;t know what jumpers were :-)<p>I left youth work and got a job in a local school as the photocopy guy. I grew in confidence and was going out at night and fixing people&#x27;s computers to support my wife and son and daughter.<p>I was also studying part-time. I had just enough qualifications to become the school IT Technician when the opportunity arose. I went on to be the school Network Manager and grew the school network from 50 to 500 computers.<p>I left the public sector and joined a Saas company. I eventually became their infrastructure lead. By this stage I was managing a team running a Xenserver infrastructure spread throughout several data centres in the UK.<p>I created a website called <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeperiod.co.uk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeperiod.co.uk</a> when I worked in the school. A room booking system for schools. I left my job at the beginning of this year and was taken on to an accelerator program. So Freeperiod has become a company and I am also doing consultancy work.<p>Underpinning all this is a love for Linux. Faith is also important to me and I believe God has given me the desires of my heart throughout my career. Where there has been an interest I have moved into that field. I also understand now that employers need good workers. If you have a good work ethic you will enjoy your work and may do well.')
