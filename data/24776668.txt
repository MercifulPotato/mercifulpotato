There&#x27;s far too much TV that basically only has actual new plot elements in the first and last ten minutes, and then pads everything out to a full episode.<p>A world in which writers know they have, at best, 24 episodes to tell their story will hopefully result in much more focused story telling, and fewer filler episodes looking into the exciting history of what minor character C did 15 years ago.')
