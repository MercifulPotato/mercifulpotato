Every day you spend wiring up infra is a day you&#x27;re not iterating on your product, and from the accounts I&#x27;ve seen, most startups fail because they run out of money before they find PMF, not because they later got bogged down refactoring their V1 architecture.<p>I advise keeping architecture as simple as possible at first by building a monolith (or maybe FaaS if you&#x27;re really doing throwaway experimentation), and keep refactoring it until your domain knowledge has solidified and it&#x27;s clear where your service boundaries actually are; it&#x27;s very unlikely that you&#x27;ll get the service split correct the first time if you do it too early.')
