Also, high Isp is not desirable for a power-limited spacecraft such as cubesats because the input power scales with the square of Isp.<p>The efficiency of an electric thruster is a measure of the losses related to ionization energy, beam divergence, beam temperature etc. In theory Isp and efficiency are therefore orthogonal, though Low-Isp devices indeed tend to have a lower efficiency due to higher ionization-to-kinetic energy ratio.')
