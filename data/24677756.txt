It&#x27;s a lot of work to get it up and running, maybe 8 - 12 hours if you&#x27;ve never done it before plus an additional 12 hours getting Bluetooth, WiFi, USB mapping and iMessage working but it&#x27;s worth it. Once it is up and running it does &#x27;just work&#x27; plus it&#x27;s a hell of a lot cheaper. The only thing you have to worry about is doing it all again in 6-12 months if you want to stay on the latest OSX.')
