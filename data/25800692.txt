I think the changes were just the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back. People have been itching for a catalyst to get their friends and family to migrate away from Facebook&#x27;s manipulative software to an app that actually respects users and their privacy. It seems like it finally happened. Finally most of the friends I chat with have Signal or Telegram and I can justify deleting WhatsApp and Facebook. I&#x27;m hanging on by a thin thread to Instagram because it&#x27;s the easiest way for me to quickly edit and post my daily photos, but that could very easily be replaced because now it&#x27;s more about the image editing than the network effects.')
