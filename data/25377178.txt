I think a big reason to focus on higher-ROI (80&#x2F;20) is to reduce friction; I&#x27;d rather have a quite-clean living space the majority of the time than a perfectly-clean living space on rare occasion (I think 80&#x2F;20 thinking leads to a higher average level of cleanliness). You did say &#x27;if only my wife felt this way&#x27; so I assume you buy into 80&#x2F;20 for chores and she doesn&#x27;t.')
