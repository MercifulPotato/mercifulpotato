Many many outer layers have failed here. I wouldn&#x27;t blame an individual nor a department here. It&#x27;s one of those events that probably wasn&#x27;t in the scope. Additionally, roles&#x2F;security clearance levels etc. still work regardless of the account beeing open to anyone.<p>Things like Smartcards, Yubikeys, auto-lockscreen could have failed the same way. Maybe a GPO failed, or a windows update broke the auto-lock.... that&#x27;s why all these many layers exist.')
