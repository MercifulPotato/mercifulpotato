The engineering team is all-remote and based mostly around the Northeast US. We have internally built a suite of tools, reusable solutions, and underlying framework which allows us to build large projects with a modest sized team. We regularly reinvest in our tolling so that we can continually build bigger and better things for our clients. Thanks to this, development work is rarely boring or repetitive. As a team, we also set aside time to put down project work and come together to build interesting side projects.<p>What we are looking for in an engineer is creativity, strong frontend skills, and attention to detail. If you&#x27;re motivated by creating new things, this is an environment where you will thrive.<p>Tools and languages we use most: Vanilla JS, python, Adobe XD.<p>Bonus points for experience with Salesforce, Angular, Material Design.')
