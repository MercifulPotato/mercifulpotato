So much vibing with your comment, and this post :)<p>I spent a few years co-organizing a weekly &quot;civic hacknight&quot; event for technologists, designers, policy wonks, public servants, lawyers, and any engaged citizens who cared to show up. Trying to target each of their needs with a single sort of presentation felt like a red herring. We&#x27;d have 40-120 people, pitching and&#x2F;or joining community projects, we&#x27;d change venues every month, and we&#x27;d have a &quot;warm-up&quot; speaker and pizza to loosen up the vibe (no more than 20-min, incl Q&amp;A). <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;civictech.ca&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;civictech.ca&#x2F;</a><p>The unstructured formula is really powerful imho. At its best, it emulates the power of open source, where you don&#x27;t try to anticipate who&#x27;s the teacher and who&#x27;s the student -- you assume everyone is both, depending on which part of the room they&#x27;re talking to, and how loudly :) In my view, you just need to protect and amplify that fractal nature of the space, allowing it to operate at as many different levels as possible: individual self-intros to the room, the time-boxed room-wide presentation, the open-floor for pitches before work-time, the informal non-pitch convos when ppl don&#x27;t join groups, the two people catching up together in a corner or on the walk to post-drinks. You protect it all. You don&#x27;t let the people who love the speakers turn it into a speaker series (even when the calibre of speakers maybe makes you think they deserve more time). You don&#x27;t let the hackers dismiss the people who just show for the speaker, or who just talk and don&#x27;t work. etc etc. You protect and advocate for all levels of interaction, and don&#x27;t valourize one over the other<p>So much can happen when you design events that resist collapsing the possibilities of a space into a single narrative through-line -- if you preserve a point cloud for sampling by all, instead of pretending you can thread a single story through it. Single narratives are what you build for dosing into individual human minds when you have a set outcome or goal, but it&#x27;s not what we should foster when we&#x27;re trying to do computation on difficult, undefined and complex systems.')
