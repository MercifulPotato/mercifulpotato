Was it pure profit then?<p>We have an exact counter example. When Mozilla was almost entirely dependent on Google search bar revenue would you say the same thing of them? By definition it’s all profit because it cost nothing to make Google the default ...  except most of it went to pay operational costs because their other revenue was very small. Even supposing they then get more other revenue from other sources, you can’t suddenly say search bar revenue has switched from going here to going there. It doesn’t make any sense.<p>Also the Google revenue to Apple has scaled with devices sold, sell no devices make no Google money. Increase sales and you can demand more from google. It’s all predicated on making and selling devices, which takes people.')
