In the 1950s, Black Americans were harassed, beaten and killed for registering to vote; no such discrimination against Christians has ever existed in the US, or even in North America or Europe, where the games we&#x27;re talking about are largely developed and marketed.<p>I quite agree. There can be no meaningful comparison between Blacks in the 50&#x27;s and Christians in recent history.<p>&gt; no such discrimination against Christians has ever existed in ... Europe<p>Well, it hasn&#x27;t for a very long time, but it was pretty bad for quite a while: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Roman_Empire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Persecution_of_Christians_in_t...</a><p>Mostly I share this as an interesting historical tidbit; not to refute any of your points.<p>&gt; I agree that Christians are sometimes treated more critically in popular culture. But this is simply criticizing those in positions of power.<p>Of course, like all groups (be they religious, racial, ethnic, gender, etc), Christians are incredibly diverse such that there are no real criticisms that generalizes well, and all of these criticisms depend on caricature and stereotype which are (by definition) inaccurate and hateful. Moreover, to target a group for being &quot;powerful&quot; when that power is merely &quot;numerousness in a democracratic context&quot;--without any sort of evidence that the group behaves as a class, conspiring to increase or preserve the power of the group and to distribute that power throughout the group (to give privileges to constituents merely for being part of the group)--is lazy at best and hateful at worst (theories of a Jewish conspiracies spring to mind).<p>&gt; To quote a certain comedian: &quot;Christians won the world. The Christians won everything. If you don&#x27;t believe me, let me ask you a question. What year is it?&quot;<p>Maybe this is an amusing joke, but I don&#x27;t think it supports your point very well. Lots of different cultures have given us different conventions and standards. We tell time using a Babylonian counting system, but we wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;Babylonians won the world&quot;. Similarly, we use a semitic alphabet but we wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;Semites won the world&quot;. We use Arabic numerals but we wouldn&#x27;t say Arabs won the world. I could go on and on and on.')
