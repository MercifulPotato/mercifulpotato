A lot of brands are also making you pay a separate fee to be able to sell online and most absolutely prohibit you as a US dealer from shipping overseas.<p>All of these things + operating costs make the margins at your average local music shop very very slim. I ran one of the best shops in the world and we still struggled with this kinda stuff.')
