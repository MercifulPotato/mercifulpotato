They don&#x27;t even need to actually change anything: They can simply let Ma pay lip service to addressing regulator concerns and proceed with the IPO in another 6 months with very little lost except a bit of time. China then reaps the benefits of both another massively successful corporation and the perception of tighter regulation.')
