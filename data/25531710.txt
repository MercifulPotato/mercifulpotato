Their primary talent is having been in the right place at the right time and they&#x27;ve spun an entire self-help industry out of it. If they hadn&#x27;t gotten lucky early on, they&#x27;d just be dopey middle management parasites at some investment firm. These aren&#x27;t they people that can build anything, they&#x27;re just the middlemen between rich idiots and people with actual talents.')
