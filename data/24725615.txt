Item(by='jjoonathan', descendants=None, kids=[24729983], score=None, time=1602205013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725437, text='I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m no historian, so I&#x27;m not going to be able to draw up a comparative history of counter-racism approaches vs help-the-poor approaches, at least not beyond the obvious examples where an oppressed minority suddenly gets power, seeks revenge, and it inevitably ends very badly for both sides.<p>I&#x27;m an engineer. Systems theory is how I interface with these ideas. It has notions of &quot;gain margin&quot; and &quot;phase margin&quot; -- i.e. how hard you can push (or how long you can delay feedback, the two are somewhat interchangeable, which is often under-appreciated) before your attempt to build a self-correcting airplane wing, power delivery circuit, rocket that points up, etc stops being self-correcting and turns into a wildly oscillating self-destructive mess that you should count yourself lucky if it only destroys itself without taking its surroundings with it.<p>In society, we can&#x27;t calculate gain margin and phase margin, but we still have to decide how hard to push and if we push too hard, the system will still punish us. All of us. Nobody likes to hear &quot;push more softly for the cause you believe in.&quot; I sure don&#x27;t. But having screwed up this choice in an engineering context, I respect the possibility of screwing it up in a social context, and I see it as a strong argument for exercising restraint.<p>&gt; What does it mean exactly to stomp it out where you see it? How do we see it and how do we stomp it out? What if it&#x27;s hard to see, or difficult to stomp out?<p>We&#x27;ve stomped out most of the blatant, obvious racism that was easy to see, so from here out it&#x27;s largely going to be difficult. That is: option B, above. That&#x27;s how we go after the systemic racism: ensure that the system shrinks the influences of the past rather than growing them. In particular, we need to figure out what kind of support is necessary to give the next generation of kids a fair shake at life and give it to them. Even more specifically I&#x27;m thinking about federally funded health care, housing, and primary&#x2F;secondary education. It&#x27;s going to cost a lot. It&#x27;s not going to let us indulge in fantasies of somehow canceling out the racism of yesterday. But it might let us fix tomorrow.')
