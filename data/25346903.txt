It runs uncomfortably hot for rather menial tasks, and the fan noise is bothersome if you&#x27;re like me and are used to previous generations that were an order of magnitude quieter (I upgraded from a 2015 MBP whose fans were seldom activated). I also almost always use an external display, and just connecting the monitor (1440p ultrawide) causes the fans to spin up to an audible level every time.<p>As for the M1 issues, nobody knows except for Apple, but I would expect that most will be solved within the next year. There&#x27;s a lot of core functionality in that article you posted that I can&#x27;t imagine staying broken for more than a year.')
