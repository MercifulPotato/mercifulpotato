Also I don&#x27;t understand how &quot;streaming responses and push&quot; is different from the classic pub&#x2F;sub model that so many websocket frameworks are offering.<p>I tried to avoid socket.io partially due to irrational preconceptions but then learned that it has a lot of features that are needed in many applications. It&#x27;s also used by many people and has integrations into virtually every server and client framework.')
