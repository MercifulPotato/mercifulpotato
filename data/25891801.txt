The suburbs were biult for the kids of the boomer generation.  They are now old.  The kids of the kids of the boomers have different needs, mostly to do with money and work.  Thats where i disagree with the article.  It isnt about cars and work-life third places.  It is about not being able to buy a house, or not wanting to because we shift jobs&#x2F;cities every few yeara.  It is about higher bills.  It is about working multiple jobs, or working that one job 24&#x2F;7.  Those are the needs the suburb doesnt address.  Wanting to ditch the car is way way down the list.<p>It is sunday morning, 5am, and this kid of a boomer, with a good white-collar job, is about to drive to work.')
