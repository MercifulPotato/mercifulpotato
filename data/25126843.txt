There is usually a large mirror and lenses which should be redundant.<p>A NN trained on the physics simulation of a wobbling droplet of e.g. mercury should be able to use this &quot;predictable, deterministic&quot; partial mirror, to glimps everything needed to see. If a ferro-fluid with electromagnetic actuators is used-the shape of the mirror could be even modified by the observer NN in realtime, to sharpen, or block parts of the mirror.<p>If this would be acceptable to the astronomic community - we could mass produce Hubbles.')
