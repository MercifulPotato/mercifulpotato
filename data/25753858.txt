The original source file is copied with a .bk extension (e.g., InventoryManager.bk), to back up the original content. The backdoored source is written to the same filename, but with a .tmp extension (e.g., InventoryManager.tmp), before being moved using MoveFileEx to the original filename (InventoryManager.cs). After these steps, the source file backdoored with SUNBURST will then be compiled as part of the standard process.&quot;</code></pre>')
