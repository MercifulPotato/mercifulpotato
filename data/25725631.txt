This could include something like the encapsulation of an entire gate and circuit accurate simulation of an entire system of processors, memories, and interfaces, like say, a Super Nintendo (see MiSTer for more of this). This is a very different domain than a raspberry pi, and while the chip here lacks the resources to run something like MiSTer it will likely be used to run something like a microcontroller SoC with customizable peripherals. The $25 price point for everything and the kitchen sink is just right. The comparison to Arduino is much more apt than to the Pi.')
