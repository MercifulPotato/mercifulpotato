I had 2-3 crashes and saw some bugs like objects hanging in the air or the weapon not being visible.<p>Performance is fine. Bought the game a couple of days after launch and after reading the reports about horrible performance while downloading, I disabled everything under graphics, but then after a crash it reset its settings (yeah, I know) and it seems to work fine even with all settings on.')
