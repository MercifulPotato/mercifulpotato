Some uses seem pretty effective - neural nets sorting images of stars seems to have found some interesting things. Some uses seem fairly problematic - modern buildings seem like a complete disaster already to my naive eyes and less attention might not improve things. Moreover, as far as I know, the job of an architect is to make a building that is aesthetically pleasing and balanced but which also satisfies a lot of specific constraints - has a bathroom, doors don&#x27;t knock against each other when opened, sufficient lighting etc.<p>The thing is multiple constraint satisfaction part seems to be where neural nets seems to fail. Self-driving cars work mostly yet by not satisfying all constraints, they seem destined to be &quot;always five years out&quot;. GPT-III writes paragraphs that seem pretty well written yet it contracts itself quite often &#x27;cause it&#x27;s duplicating most frequent phrases, not considering the logical constraints humans (sometimes) need to take into account.<p>Which is to say, I&#x27;d imagine AI generated buildings would seem plausible till you noticed the doors to nowhere and similar stuff.')
