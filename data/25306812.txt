It&#x27;s a quite different relationship, based on a different level of expectations and trust.<p>To give a specific example: I&#x27;m a (European-based) salaried employee of a (US-based) company. Most weeks I spend rather more than 40 hours, one way or another, working on things for my employer, as I (mostly) enjoy my work and want to make the best contribution I can. Sometimes personal stuff comes up, and I may end up spending significantly less, but no-one&#x27;s keeping track at that level on a day-to-day basis. I don&#x27;t expect extra money if I work into the evening to finish something I&#x27;m involved in, nor do I expect to lose money if I spend the afternoon taking care of a family emergency.<p>I have in the past had a time-card that I punched when arriving at work, and again when leaving, and my employer paid me for the hours I worked; no more, no less. I&#x27;d call that &quot;wages&quot;. My current employer pays me an agreed annual sum; it does not depend on the total number of hours I work during the year, but it comes with an expectation of how I will spend my time and expertise. That&#x27;s a &quot;salary&quot;.')
