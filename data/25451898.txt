I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t be popular, but I refuse to use Firefox particularly, and would rather use chromium at this point, which, if you&#x27;d heard the way I trash google, you&#x27;d ask me what on earth was going through my head. It has gotten that bad.<p>They keep progressively crippling the browser. There isn&#x27;t a single Firefox major update, either software wise or news wise, that amounts to good news. They try to dress it up but the substance is always bad for the user. Recently, they artificially limited the extensions available in Firefox mobile. I uninstalled Firefox immediately on all my machines.<p>Now they&#x27;re firing the Rust team? Are these people stupid? Rust is pretty much the only thing Mozilla has going for it. I guess it&#x27;s time for Thunderbird to go as well.<p>The idea that Mozilla is somehow the only thing standing between Google and control of web standards is laughable. I used to buy it. But Firefox is funded by Google, and they&#x27;ll get what they want. And you can see plain as day that they&#x27;re getting what they want. At this point you&#x27;re more disconnected from Google&#x27;s influence using ungoogled-chromium than using Firefox. So that&#x27;s what I do. I feel more free online using a fork of a Google product than I do using Firefox. Imagine that.')
