You can then look at why they weren&#x27;t happy and see if it&#x27;s a real issue or not, and if it&#x27;s an issue relevant to you.  (For example, a doesn&#x27;t-play-nice-with-X downvote doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t plan to play with X.)<p>What is a problem is just presenting an average of the ratings, though.')
