I don&#x27;t believe you can get absolute time from them, especially given that Earth time is somewhat decoupled from Earth&#x27;s orbital dynamics.<p>What you can do is get time using GPS, like you would on the ground. Not sure if that&#x27;s possible for higher orbits, but definitely for low orbits. There have also been some experiments with laser-based synchronization (a PPS-style signal, I believe?) and you could get a coarse sync with a regular old radio uplink.')
