Item(by='bleepblorp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605811416, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25150991, text='HN has exactly the same groupthink hostility against countervailing views. The only difference between FB and HN is that HN groupthink enforcement is depersonalized and hidden behind the downvoting and flagging system, both to keep abusive people from needing to spend the time writing ad hominem replies, and to keep the ugliness out of sight from the casual observer.<p>Pay close attention to what gets downvoted and&#x2F;or flagged in threads about social media regulation, disinformation on the Internet, COVID-19--or anything else that touches the glibertarian worldview generally--to see what I mean.<p>HN policies just convert the level of hostility that is typical of under-regulated message boards from overt hostility into passive aggressive sniping and mechanized bullying.<p>This post itself will be downvoted in due course, because it goes against HN&#x27;s own accepted narrative.')
