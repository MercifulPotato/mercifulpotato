The one thing I realized was that if this scales beyond the typical 5+ close-knit team, there should be one person whose only job is make sure the remote teams are &quot;working.&quot;<p>I would treat this akin to a Project Manager but knows how to tweak things for remote. I have wrote few Job Descriptions with the designation in the lines of  &quot;Remote Team Liaison&quot;, which is more of syntactic sugar for &quot;Head&quot;, &quot;Lead&quot;.<p>However, I&#x27;d love that this is one of the characteristics of almost every Project Manager, HR, etc. instead of a separate person.')
