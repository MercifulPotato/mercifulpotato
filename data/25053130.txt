And lots of them <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have rules separating and delaying the count of mail-in ballots, anyway, which meant that differences in mail-in ballot patterns (which there almost certainly were because of partisan differences in who voted mail-in, entirely predictable given partisan differences in advocacy for and against mail voting) <i>wouldn&#x27;t show up clearly in the count timing</i> the way it does in places where the process delayed starting counting mail-in ballots.')
