Item(by='UncleMeat', descendants=None, kids=[25660801, 25669967], score=None, time=1609957865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659693, text='&gt; Which phones can I buy to enjoy the freedom of general-purpose computing (and not suffer from non-mature ecosystem)?<p>Does Libram not count? Why do you get to also demand a mature ecosystem? This feels like demanding that corporations build a product specifically because you want it. There are precious few markets where we demand that businesses provide a product that the market wouldn&#x27;t naturally demand, and I personally don&#x27;t think that a general purpose computing phone should be one of those.<p>This whole discussion also feels a bit disingenuous now that you&#x27;ve brought up FLOSS, since Android has never really satisfied FLOSS-advocate goals. So why would it matter to you if exec privileges are changed?')
