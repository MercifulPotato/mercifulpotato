Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609815935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641219, text='Wow, I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen an 86 square foot hotel room. I live in what&#x27;s locally a small, 50-year-old suburban ranch home in the Midwestern US, but even my guest bathroom is at least that big.  That really drives home the disparity behind the &quot;we&#x27;re all in the same boat&quot; memes where one boat is a yacht and one&#x27;s a castaway raft - though most seaworthy rafts are on the order 86 square feet...<p>For me, quarantine was the best couple months of my recent working life. My home office is way nicer (quieter, fewer interruptions, better computer and peripherals, better chair etc) than my work office, I got to have brunch, lunch, and an afternoon snack with my kids, had no commute, played fetch with the dog or took walks in the woods for breaks, got a ton of projects done around the house and in the workshop, played with my kid in his play room, and I&#x27;m a bit of an introverted hermit so being home without a stream of social visitors was really a cherry on top.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to properly say sorry or thank you to urbanites for whom quarantine was more like a prison experiment. I guess I&#x27;ll try with &quot;I&#x27;m sorry that your experience was so difficult. Thank you so much for caring and for going through that quarantine.&quot;')
