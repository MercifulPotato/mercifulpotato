I&#x27;m not saying the author is wrong, but there&#x27;s a lot of questions here. How does Keystone hide itself from the Activity Monitor? Is there a Keystone process if you run `ps aux`? Did you run dtruss&#x2F;strace? What is it doing when Chrome isn&#x27;t running that causes it to degrade performance?')
