But in general, I disagree. Especially because of the way in which we use technology now. Our smart phones are becoming a bit of an external brain to us. It holds contacts, conversations, searches, notes, musings, etc. We use it to recall a fact or answer a question without really even thinking about it. Maybe what we really need is to slow don’t think it is only a problem now because smart phones and the like aren’t really designed to improve our lives, but as ad delivery platforms to manipulate us into buying products and services we probably don’t need. I would love better tech that helped offload mental tasks my human brain isn’t great at, but computer brains are, and let me focus on things my human brain is good at as well as things I just would rather think about.')
