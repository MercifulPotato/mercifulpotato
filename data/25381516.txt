Adobe claimed that they could get Flash working on the first Apple iPhone in 2007. When Adobe finally bought Flash to Android, it required 1GB of RAM and a 1Ghz CPU. Even then it ran badly and drained the battery.<p>The first iPhone had 128MB RAM and 400Mhz CPU. The first iPhone that met those specs came out in 2011.<p>One of the biggest knocks against the iPad in 2010 was that you couldn’t view the “real Internet” without Flash. Adobe promised Flash on the Motorola Xoom that came out a year later. Adobe was late leaving the Xoom in the unenviable position that you couldn’t view its Flash based home page on the device.')
