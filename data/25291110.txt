It seems to me that people who are already in the drugs business are at an advantage if we change the law to make things legal. I don&#x27;t like the idea of enriching people who earlier made a living out of murdering their rivals, and I get this suspicion that they aren&#x27;t going to immediately drop their whole muscle operation when they go legit.<p>I simply disbelieve the idea that a random legit businessperson could decide to go into the drugs trade without fearing harassment from the existing players, as well as gain knowledge in the area without having to associate with the formerly criminal.<p>What are some ways to address this? Any early indications from other places?')
