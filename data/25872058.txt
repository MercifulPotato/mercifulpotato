Rocks and volcanoes kill people, but they&#x27;re not amoral.<p>In any case, humans are intrinsically moral â€” we&#x27;re either moral or immoral or some mixture. A group of humans working together do not suddenly become amoral. Claims that the law obliges a group of people to act in an evil way if they wish to do this that and the other are false, but even if they were true, it does not absolve the people who choose to act in an evil way; you can obey the law and therefore act in an evil way.<p>Google is a moral company, which does evil.')
