What was that?<p>An example, is the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KH-11_Kennen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KH-11_Kennen</a> system, which wikipedia says was launched in the 70s, has multiple iterations, and is <i>still being used</i>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KH-11_Kennen#Imaging_sensors_and_camera_modes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;KH-11_Kennen#Imaging_sensors_a...</a><p>Shows some of these versions, and blockIII seems to have very nice resolution.  Launched in 92, supposedly.<p>And yet, as these <i>all</i> of the programs?  I doubt it.  For example &quot;Big Bird&quot; (KH-9) and KH-11 were used in parallel.  I bet others existed too.<p>I&#x27;m going to say that throwing out &quot;No, it couldn&#x27;t be done&quot; in the 80s is hard for me to believe.  Was it done?<p>Well if not, it was very close to the 80s, as in the very early 90s.')
