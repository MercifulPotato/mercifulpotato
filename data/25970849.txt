A short squeeze in and of itself is absolutely not market manipulation. Sometimes it just happens. But <i>creating</i> a short squeeze <i>can</i> be market manipulation.<p>&gt; &quot;Market manipulation&quot; itself is not necessarily illegal, if you just mean doing things that will effect the market in a way to bring profit to yourself.<p>I’m not quite sure what you mean by this. Market manipulation is a concerted (and sometimes coordinated) effort to artificially influence the supply or demand of a security. Market manipulation often relies on false information but false information is not at all a required element of market manipulation.<p>Where things get interesting (and fuzzy) here that I’m not quite sure where the line is between a group working together to influence the market and just... the market. I suppose its theoretically possible for <i>everyone</i> in the market to coordinate against one or a few players. To my knowledge there’s never been a situation with such a large coordinated effort.<p>That said, there are definitely a handful of individuals on WSB who got the ball rolling and have profited heavily. I definitely think the SEC could make the case they&#x27;ve violated the Exchange Act and potentially the &#x27;33 Act depending on what % of $GME the group controlled.')
