Item(by='inflagranti', descendants=None, kids=[25396255], score=None, time=1607751319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395700, text='&gt; The difference is that direct democracy doesn&#x27;t scale.<p>I hear that every time Switzerland is mentioned. I&#x27;ve yet to see a strong argument to suggest <i>why</i> it wouldn&#x27;t scale in this day and age.<p>What I think doesn&#x27;t scale is centralized systems like France, where all money flows to Paris and rarely any back. Switzerland on the other hand is extremely federated, to the point each canton, often smaller than average cities, have their own school system. Most tax money stays on the local level and didn&#x27;t go to Bern. This independence IMHO is the critical factor for scaling that would work for moch larger countries.<p>As to the homogeneity: US has one language any natively born American speaks. Switzerland has 3, with a considerable political divide between the French and German spanking areas. Finally Switzerland has 20% Foreigners vs 10% in US. So again I would very much challenge you there.')
