Car drivers: “get out of the road it’s for cars!”, pedestrians: “get off the sidewalk it’s for pedestrians!”<p>In many places there just isn’t safe areas for cyclists that doesn’t end up putting them in conflict with other users of streets.<p>One thing that’s hard on a bicycle is to keep your cool after a collision or near miss. You end up with so much adrenaline pumping that anger often comes.<p>Like others on this thread have mentioned though, getting angry at people in cars is not helpful, best case they feel bad, worst case they become angry  and now have a multi-ton weapon on their side.')
