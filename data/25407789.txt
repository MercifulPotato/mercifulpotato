Item(by='khaledh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607877756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407713, text='I agree on the distinction between internal vs. external complexity; this particularly resonates with me: &quot;the Go runtime is relatively complex internally but it permits simple APIs and programming models for users...&quot;. I probably should&#x27;ve made it clear that the external interface of a system (whether it&#x27;s a UI or an API) should be simple and abstracts away the internal complexity.<p>To go back to the human body analogy, while the internals of the human body are complex, the external interface is extremely simple: you eat to get energy; you sleep to get rest; you use your reproductive organs to reproduce; etc. You don&#x27;t have to learn how the internal systems work to operate your body.')
