Apple removed them because: <i>Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues</i><p>And AWS said:<p>“Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms,&quot; the email reads. &quot;It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.”<p>If they were removing the illegal content, then why did AWS say they don&#x27;t have an effective process to remove it? If they can show that they already have effective moderation, then they should win their lawsuit against AWS and quickly be back online.')
