Jumping into a new codebase can be intimidating but I use Pycharm for the preview windows for function definitions, the option+f7 find all usages of a variable, and a few other features. IdeaVim is also the best vim emulator that I&#x27;ve tried in any IDE. But I&#x27;m also too deep into neovim to stop using every feature + plugin while writing and editing code, so I usually have Neovim running in the Pycharm terminal and jump back and forth between the Pycharm editor and terminal based on my context (writing or reading)')
