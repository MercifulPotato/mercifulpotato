It can be the case that the vaccine confers strong immunity against the variant or that it doesn&#x27;t confer any immunity at all, it&#x27;s not necessarily predictable or linear.<p>That said, what I&#x27;ve seen immunologists saying is that they expect the vaccine to still work well, because they wouldn&#x27;t expect months of mutations to add up to the variant escaping the vaccine.')
