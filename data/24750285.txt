Item(by='paulmd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602461890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24749178, text='Yes, high-end is a thing but high-end gaming monitors have tripled over the last 3 years or so, and now they are to the point where they are competing with premium televisions which offer a better overall picture quality.  So you really have to figure out what you actually want.<p>IPS contrast is not good and OLED contrast is amazing (it&#x27;s the only way to get &quot;real&quot; HDR except for VA which has poor motion clarity), with the only real downside to OLED being burn-in (it&#x27;s gotten massively better over the last few years but heavily UI type stuff in lightmode-type color schemes with fixed elements is the worst case scenario, this should not be your daily driver for Excel spreadsheets).   But again, you have to bear in mind that you could literally buy <i>two</i> OLEDs for the price of that &quot;premium&quot; IPS monitor, so if it doesn&#x27;t become obnoxiously burned within 2.5 years or so (assuming a 5y lifespan on your IPS monitor) you are coming out ahead on burn-in.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m also not sure what 4k 120hz tv you&#x27;re referring to. Do they exist?<p>Yes, LG&#x27;s OLED series has supported 4K120 input (not strobing&#x2F;interpolation, true input at 120fps) since the last generation (C9, support continues with CX).  Also supports HDMI VRR.<p>CX adds 120 Hz black frame insertion - so it can take 60 hz and alternate between a signal frame and a black frame for additional motion clarity.<p>&gt; How do you get a 4k 120hz signal into such a device?<p>For the LG OLED series, HDMI 2.1, from an NVIDIA 3000 series or Radeon RDNA2 GPU.<p>Or, display stream compression over DP 1.4, which is what the 4K144 gaming panels are currently doing (none of them currently support HDMI 2.1).  Also, that currently only gets you to 4K120 without chroma subsampling, another disadvantage of the current &quot;gaming monitor&quot; crop.<p>&gt; And how am I meant to fit it in my 3ft deep desk?<p>Wall mount.  CX 48&quot; wall mounted 3 feet away is probably about the same as a 34&quot; ultrawide that&#x27;s 18&quot; away (which is what I&#x27;m currently using) I&#x27;d think.  Certainly a &quot;big&quot; monitor but the people who are really up shit creek are the ones with shallow desks and&#x2F;or who are  currently situated in a corner and can&#x27;t wall mount.')
