Intel basically did - &quot;you need Xeon to do exactly what an i7 does + ECC, it just costs 5 times more... We just fused the ECC part of memory controller of i7, so buy Xeon.&quot;<p>The entire discussion is about why ECC is not common and why ECC matters. There is no technical reason for ECC to be uncommon aside purposed market segmentation.<p>Of course, there is no intrinsic availability of ECC udimms for the retail market currently, however that does mean ECC has no use or benefits for a small extra production cost.')
