Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604349010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972753, text='&gt; You could let the user pick between the two options, I guess.<p>If both options are likely to be extremely undesirable to a substantive fraction of canceling users, that&#x27;s the best option.<p>If there was a most-likely-safe option from the user perspective, choosing that by default and having it confirmed would arguably be better UX, but I don&#x27;t think &quot;keep everything that used to be private and make it public&quot; is really a &quot;clearly-safer option&quot;. Nor, even in the cases where it is safer, do I think that this presents the confirmation well.<p>&gt;  But really, most everyone cancelling something like this needs to go through their stuff and decide for each item: &quot;Keep, but make public&quot; or &quot;Delete&quot;.<p>Some people do, but I bet lots of people have collections that very easily fall into either &quot;Delete all&quot; or &quot;Keep all and make public&quot; by the time they cancel (if only because they are only canceling after everything to which that decision wouldn&#x27;t apply has been migrated to an alternative service.)')
