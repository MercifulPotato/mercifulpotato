When I bought my first computer in 1980, an Apple II, lower case required a hardware mod. Lisp had already been around for decades.<p>In every major system one can now hide upper case conventions, but they too often default to old man shouting &quot;GET OFF MY LAWN&quot;. And of course, those parentheses. One can easily represent trees by a notation that does away with most parentheses, but instead they&#x27;ve become a loyalty test.<p>At $20 or even $30 I would have bought the PDF for this book, to keep my library complete, to support all Lisp efforts. $40 made me think. This is a pure optimization problem; one should roughly want to maximize revenue, but favoring number of copies sold for the side benefits. I doubt that $40 achieves that maximum.')
