In that case, the analogy helps since most races have minimum qualifier rounds before you&#x27;re allowed to enter.<p>I&#x27;ve got no arguments there. But that&#x27;s the kind of thing RH [et al] were founded to confront or change, wasn&#x27;t it? Or were they just circumventing previous regulation about market interfaces? This is where we get into the weeds and me out of my depth.')
