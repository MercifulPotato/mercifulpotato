That is how batteries perform at a certain age. Batteries are consumable parts like tires and ink cartridges.<p>It&#x27;s like returning an ink cartridge at 50% capacity because it&#x27;s only got half the ink left. Yes, that&#x27;s the point, that&#x27;s what cartridges do.<p>This feature is designed to always get the most out of a battery. Is that really something to complain about?<p>I guess this is where it&#x27;s a perspective issue.<p>- You&#x27;re saying that a new battery starts out at &quot;100%&quot; and that after a year or so, Apple throttles is down to &quot;80%&quot; because it can no longer keep up with how it came out of the factory. Apple designed a function that reduces the performance of a system that&#x27;s defective to hide the defect. That would be strictly negative.<p>- What I&#x27;m saying is that the battery starts out at &quot;120%&quot; out of the factory (which you can confirm, when you buy a new mac check out the Batter mAh vs. design rating in System Report) and eventually drifts towards &quot;100%&quot; over time. Apple designed a system that allows you to get that extra 20% at the start, when it&#x27;s available. That would be strictly positive.')
