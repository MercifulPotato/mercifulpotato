Matrix is woefully immature, and suffers from a lot of issues, but I think is closer to being a functional Slack&#x2F;Discord alternative. XMPP is much more mature, and works very well for chat, but doesn&#x27;t have a nice package that does all the Slack stuff--at least not that I&#x27;m aware of. I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong there. I know it <i>can</i> be done, but if it can&#x27;t be deployed quickly by an already overstressed team member, what chance does it have?')
