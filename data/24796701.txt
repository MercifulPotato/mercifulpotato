In the US you can&#x27;t lie to a Federal Officer, you can&#x27;t distribute or possess images of child abuse and you cannot advocate for a direct an imminent threat of an individual.<p>Those are all pretty reasonable. You CAN have a fictional representation of child abuse (writing&#x2F;drawing) which is illegal in the UK, Australia and pretty much any other country except Japan.<p>Speech is tricky. Every country has limitations. China has freedom of speech in their constitution, so a law by itself is not enough to ensure you actually have that freedom.')
