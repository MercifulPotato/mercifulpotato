The only people complaining about it are very very early beginners, who don&#x27;t realize that removing that mechanic would completely break the game balance and make it unplayable. It is an advertised feature, not a bug, in this specific scenario.<p>I don&#x27;t think that we can say the same about paid reviews on Amazon. It isn&#x27;t a rule (i.e., Amazon doesn&#x27;t require every seller to offer gift cards in exchange for 5-star reviews), and it doesn&#x27;t exist to increase the value that Amazon marketplace provides to their customers, it does the opposite.<p>P.S. I actually agree with what you said completely. It just that the comment that brought up the videogame analogy didn&#x27;t realize how completely different the situation there was, so it ended up derailing the further chain of arguments.')
