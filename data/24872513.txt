Neither are they &quot;decades behind&quot; in lithography, nor in launch, nor in satellites.<p>Their first reusable rocket is due for a test launch in a few months, their second domestic carrier is in construction, and in hypersonics they are, by the DoD&#x27;s own admission, well ahead.<p>They have a fully domestic rocket online with a launch reliability over 94%, and their launch cost is only barely higher than that of the Falcon 9, at around 70 million dollars vs 50 million. They are also building a super-heavy, 140 000 kg LEO rocket.<p>In silicon tech, they have a 14nm fab online, which is hardly &quot;decades behind&quot;.<p>In sat tech, they have pretty much all they could ask for.<p>I don&#x27;t really get this viewpoint. China doesn&#x27;t really advertise their capabilities, but it&#x27;s clear that they aren&#x27;t far behind in more than a few crucial sectors, and clearly ahead in others. At this point they are near  competitors of the west.')
