Item(by='bostik', descendants=None, kids=[25617271], score=None, time=1609620649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615041, text='Yup, according to these &quot;researchers&quot; having robots.txt on your website is enough to warrant a CRITICAL vulnerability.<p>No, I&#x27;m not joking. That&#x27;s one of the reports I saw in November. I&#x27;ve also had to triage the claim that our site supposedly has a gazillion *.tar.xz files available at the root. All because the 404 handler for random [non-production relevant] paths is a fixed page with 200 response.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, running a bulk vulnerability scanner against a website and not even checking the results has as much to do with security research as ripping wings off of flies has to do with bioengineering.')
