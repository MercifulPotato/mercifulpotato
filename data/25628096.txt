Say you&#x27;re stopped at a function call, you call it, and it does the wrong thing. You edit a variable that&#x27;s passed as an argument to the function and call it again. Now it does the right thing. Great! You fixed the bug, right? Except that you don&#x27;t actually know that your program can actually ever end up in that state naturally.<p>Where did that variable originally come from? Was it entered by the user? Was it read from a file? Was it from a table? If so, does the table contain the modified value? This seems like a recipe for problems to me. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine in simple cases where you&#x27;re just changing the value of a constant or something, but it seems really likely to lead to incorrect reasoning about the code while you&#x27;re working with it in any but the simplest of cases. Am I blowing this out of proportion?')
