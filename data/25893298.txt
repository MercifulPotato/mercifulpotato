Everyone is racist, but it&#x27;s only bad to be a racist if you have power. White people have all the power and so are the worst type of racist. To deny being racist is to be fragile and also proof that you&#x27;re a racist.<p>So &#x27;someone with the political attributes of Right, but who is not racist&#x27; doesn&#x27;t exist.')
