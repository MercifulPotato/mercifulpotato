It&#x27;s hard to know, and would be very hard to ethically test.<p>Before discussing this, I&#x27;d like to make sure I don&#x27;t strawman the point you&#x27;re trying to make: the only way I can interpret this, as of now, is that you think it&#x27;s &quot;reasonable&quot; to believe that girls inherently have more potential than boys. And, even disregarding that, that it would be reasonable to grade based on &quot;potential&quot; than on actual performance.<p>I ask to make sure because there&#x27;s no way I got that right. Mind you, some groups of people say stuff like that in earnest so I&#x27;m not sure if this is an instance of that or, I hope, I misinterpreted.')
