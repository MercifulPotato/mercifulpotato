For example, they&#x27;ll say, &quot;Yep, we have an on-call schedule. People go on every few weeks (probably meaning: 3-4 days every few weeks), and it  gets a few pages, but isn&#x27;t too bad.&quot; They&#x27;ll generally refuse to get into specifics, and most people who are excited about the new opportunity, won&#x27;t drill into it.<p><i>After</i> you join, it&#x27;s kind of too late. Best case you&#x27;ve got a team who&#x27;s also willing to go to bat with you to get some fixes in, but more standard case, you&#x27;ll find yourself on the wrong end of a pager without a huge amount of negotiating power unless you include the nuclear option of just getting out.')
