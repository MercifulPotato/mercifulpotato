Win-win scenarios are very rare.<p>As a thought experiment, if you gave half the population 1 million dollars, then that would drive house prices through the roof and the unlucky half of the population would be enslaved to the lucky half paying high rents. The lives of the unlucky half would be absolutely ruined. There is no good there. It&#x27;s zero-sum but in a way it&#x27;s worse because it was 100% luck and those who worked hard were punished.<p>To have real equality, you need equality of opportunity. Equality of outcomes is not equality; otherwise it&#x27;s not equal if someone sacrifices less and gets more rewards; they are privileged, they are fortunate.')
