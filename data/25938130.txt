It has some internal state, which gets set by some action taken (perhaps indirectly) by the top level.  And that state is &quot;reachable&quot; by getting the next random number, but that random number may not be a direct representation of any part of the generator&#x27;s state.  Also, after initialization, the generator&#x27;s state should <i>not</i> be alterable by the rest of the program.<p>So to me, that&#x27;s not really &quot;reachable&quot;.  The entire <i>point</i> of encapulating that state in the random number generator is to make it <i>not</i> reachable.')
