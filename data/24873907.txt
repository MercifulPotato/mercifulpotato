If one person borrow it, photocopies it twice to share with two others, then they&#x27;ve broken the law. And yet nobody in either case has made more or less money.<p>I am in favor of copyright law that prevents <i>profiting</i> from another person&#x27;s work, but not against copying. Once your idea is public knowledge, there is no reason for it not to spread freely given how easy it is to transmit information now.')
