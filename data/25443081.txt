Item(by='susam', descendants=None, kids=[25443205, 25444519], score=None, time=1608129936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25442993, text='&gt; I feel like I&#x27;m in the minority in that I prefer to NOT learn things by just &quot;diving in&quot;. I am much more successful when I start from the absolute fundamentals.<p>A bit more off-topic, but this resonated with me. I too feel more comfortable when I start with the absolute fundamentals. When something does not work, knowing the fundamentals helps me to reason about why it does not work from the first principles. On similar lines, I did a relevant &quot;Show HN&quot; post here today:<p>Emacs4CL: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;susam&#x2F;emacs4cl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;susam&#x2F;emacs4cl</a> (35 lines of ~&#x2F;.emacs to turn Emacs into Common Lisp dev environment)<p>It bothers me a little when someone new to Common Lisp or Emacs is encouraged to start off with Portacle or Spacemacs directly without appreciating the extensibility of Emacs and how SLIME fits in the environment. The Show HN post on Emacs4CL I have linked to above is an attempt to promote a more DIY approach to setting up one&#x27;s development environment for Common Lisp without having to spend a lot of time.')
