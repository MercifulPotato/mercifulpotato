Here on HN there&#x27;s at least one horror story a month about issues someone had with Apple, from ever changing terms, to review process that takes for ever - while still doesn&#x27;t manage to catch many real offenders (especially in terms of privacy issues), but slows down legit devs trying to quickly fix bugs and close the security holes in their apps. It has become a layer over a layer of bureaucracy which more and more seems to be it&#x27;s own purpose. Honestly there are much easier ways to make money as a programmer.')
