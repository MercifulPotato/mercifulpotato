Parts Express seems to carry Dayton Audio branded versions.<p>Can&#x27;t say how well they work but a stack of IF board, DSP only, and Bluetooth programmer cost me around Â£50. Looks like the DAC resolution is better on the Beocreate though. No idea how good the amp is either - there are plenty of bad TPA3116 boards so sidestepping that problem might be worth the premium too.')
