Those benefits are not meant for them. They are taking resources from law-abiding citizens &amp; residents. The cost of illegal aliens far outweighs any amount they pay in taxes [1].<p>&gt; At the federal level, about one-third of outlays are matched by tax collections from illegal\naliens. At the state and local level, an average of less than 5 percent of the public costs\nassociated with illegal immigration is recouped through taxes collected from illegal aliens.<p>&gt; Most illegal aliens do not pay income taxes. Among those who do, much of the revenues\ncollected are refunded to the illegal aliens when they file tax returns. Many are also claiming\ntax credits resulting in payments from the U.S. Treasury.<p>A significant fraction of those illegal aliens <i>actually commit fraud</i> by using someone else&#x27;s SSN. And a large amount of others pay <i>zero</i> tax, because they are paid under the table.<p>Spare me your criminal-coddling, all illegal aliens should be deported immediately.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairus.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2017-08&#x2F;USCostStudy_2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairus.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2017-08&#x2F;USCostStu...</a>')
