Item(by='peterwwillis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603428826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858021, text='My negativity comes from this specific solution. My two main problems with it:<p>1. It&#x27;s the exception, not the rule. Most of the time there aren&#x27;t collaborative solutions. Most of the time people work in their silos and make something work for themselves. Often it&#x27;s corporate-funded, and those corporations have no consideration for others being able to pick up the work once they&#x27;ve abandoned it. The fact that there&#x27;s 10 of the same thing to integrate is proof enough. It&#x27;s just gotten so ridiculous that somebody finally had to address it. Turns out it&#x27;s a company that has to deal with all of those implementations anyway.<p>2. This is one tool figuring out how a bunch of other tools can integrate into it. It&#x27;s <i>like</i> what I&#x27;m proposing, if you assume the least work possible to achieve maximum laziness for your own specific tool and use case.<p>Their solution wasn&#x27;t &quot;hey, it looks like a lot of things use secrets. maybe it&#x27;d be cool if we made one way for any system with secrets to interoperate with any other system, and try to get it adopted by existing vendors.&quot; Their solution was &quot;hey, we just need to get all these other things to work for the one tool we&#x27;re using.&quot; Rather than &quot;how can we make this more composable, more compatible, easier to implement, for everybody... even if they&#x27;re <i>not using our tool</i>...&quot;, it became &quot;how can we make this easier for just us?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what is always happening, has always been happening, in this space, for nearly 10 years. Either everybody latches their custom tech onto a single platform and no real open source solutions get made, or everybody spits out incompatible, overbuilt, underthought, opinionated solutions for their own problem. We don&#x27;t build standard solutions in the cloud world, we build log cabins.<p>I mean, just read the PR. They&#x27;re talking about coding into this &#x27;standard&#x27; support for each different implementation. Like &quot;this is a <i>vault</i> secret, and this is a <i>gsm</i> secret.&quot; That&#x27;s the opposite of what I want. I want it to say, &quot;this is what a secret looks like. now you figure out how to use it.&quot;, or, &quot;give me your secret. I don&#x27;t care who or what you are, because we all speak the same secret language.&quot; That is what an internet standard is supposed to be. Not &quot;this is a bind9 DNS record, this is an AD DNS record, this is a RedHat DNS record, this is a Route53 DNS record&quot;.<p>The &quot;container landscape&quot; shouldn&#x27;t remotely resemble what it does today. The idea of a &quot;container&quot; should have been standardized in an agnostic way, without requiring all the (admittedly useful, but also completely unnecessary, and often burdensome) features Docker threw into their tool. Yes, many people&#x27;s lives were made easier. But a whole lot of other lives were made harder, to the point of small economies built out of badly re-implementing and custom-integrating into one precious and incompatible concept.<p>I would call Kubernetes the open source Active Directory, but Active Directory is literally ten times more standards compliant.')
