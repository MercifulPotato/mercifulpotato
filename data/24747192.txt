Item(by='jka', descendants=None, kids=[24747223], score=None, time=1602435470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24747037, text='Thanks for providing references - there&#x27;s some subtlety in the analysis you link to (on ourworldindata.org) about the human impact of nuclear energy production.<p>While it does state that nuclear and renewables are both comparatively much safer for humans than other forms of energy generation, it does contain <i>two</i> different harm rates for nuclear.<p>You&#x27;re quoting a little selectively by stating that nuclear is safer; that corresponds with the 2016 study.  The other study, published in 2007, states that renewables are safer.<p>Relevant snippet from the explainer section in the footer drop-down in the article:<p>&quot;The largest differentiator here is the period which the Sovacool et al. (2016) estimates cover. They report normalized death rates over the limited period from 1990 to 2013. This means the 1986 Chernobyl accident was not included. Sovacool et al. (2016) only include deaths from the Fukushima accident, with 573 attributed deaths. It is useful to note here that not all deaths were a direct result of the accident: for Fukushima, there were no direct deaths from the disaster; one confirmed death from radiation exposure; and the rest noted as premature deaths from evacuation and displacement of populations in the surrounding area.&quot;')
