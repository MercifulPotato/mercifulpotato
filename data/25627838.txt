For me, Clojure feels like the one alternative JVM language that really offers a more-than-merely-incremental productivity boost over Java for a lot of everyday problems. (Scala also has its strong spots, but I find them to be fewer and further between.) And also, conveniently, it lets you really easily switch to Java for the bits that Java does better.<p>It&#x27;s maybe the quintessential Cassandra language, though. As a dynamic functional language, Clojure is a great complement to Java. And, while I&#x27;ve also never <i>really</i> been comfortable with macro programming, compared to Java&#x27;s accumulated decades&#x27; worth of XML and code generation and bytecode munging and and dependency graphs that have been sent through a wood chipper by annotations, s-expressions and macros strike me as a delightfully clean and maintanable-looking breath of fresh air. But all that stuff also makes it a bit of a tough sell among the kinds of folks who haven&#x27;t long since abandoned Java for a language like Ruby or Python. A bit like trying to sell tie-dyed shirts out of a VW bus at a Barbara Streisand concert.')
