The reality of starting a business, or even running a business in general, is that cash is limited (isn&#x27;t it always?).<p>It&#x27;s not about &#x27;working for free&#x27;, either. It&#x27;s recognising what the reality is. Working for a startup is a choice and a trade-off. IMHO, wanting to work for a startup but only 9-5 is a little unrealistic.')
