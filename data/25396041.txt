This whole site is really &quot;tech industry news&quot; with some hacking sprinkled in, but its name at least is based on the idea of the hacker ethos. That whole thing about decentralization, distrusting authority, information being free? A curiosity for how things work and logical investigation rather than letting someone else do your thinking for you? Disinformation is a huge problem and I understand the impulse to grab for the easiest available solution, but this is fool&#x27;s gold and anathema to what hackers and Western democracies claim are the foundations of their belief system.')
