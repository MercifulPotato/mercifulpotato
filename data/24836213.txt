There&#x27;s like 150-200ms of delay (just guessing based on how it feels, haven&#x27;t timed it properly). It&#x27;s as bad as Skype in our testing.<p>It&#x27;s probably fine if that&#x27;s what you got used to, but going from low latency to higher latency is so jarring that I can&#x27;t see us ever moving from mumble as long as it&#x27;s still supported.')
