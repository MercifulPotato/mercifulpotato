An ambiguous one-liner from a popular individual triggers thousands of replies and retweets.  I&#x27;ve been thinking that we need a Twitter alternative, but with a minimum limit on the number of characters and no images or gifs. Setting a minimum limit to perhaps 300 - 500 characters will eliminate much of the trolling and the noise.')
