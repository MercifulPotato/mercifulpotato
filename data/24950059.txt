The one time I bought a used iPhone from a shop (reputable one), I received a device sold as &quot;refurbished as new&quot; with a clearly subpar third party display (protruding, wrong colors). Had I not known how the phone is supposed to look like I wouldn&#x27;t have a great opinion of Apple&#x27;s build quality.<p>Now, Apple does have authorized and official repair shops. Clearly they don&#x27;t have enough of them and they treat them quite poorly too. When I called one that I needed replacement AirPods Pro (already with a ticket from apple), they told me the wait time is 3 weeks because they can only source 1 part per week (and the two earpieces and the box are counted separately).<p>Apple is fine if you live in a country with Apple stores, but outside of that it&#x27;s a big risk.')
