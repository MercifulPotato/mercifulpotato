It suggests openness to conversation that I appreciate. So an upvote for you.<p>To the point that veganism requires industrialized farming: this may be true, I don&#x27;t know. I think we <i>do</i> know that widespread veganism would reduce some of environmental harms associated with industrialized farming, because:<p>* A lot of currently cultivated farmland produces feed for livestock (Vox estimates 36% [0]);<p>* This paper [1] estimates that switching land currently used for animals to plants would lead to a manifold increase in nutrient output per acre;<p>* The BBC [2] estimates that &quot;A meat-eater’s diet requires 17 times more land, 14 times more water and 10 times more energy than a vegetarian’s;&quot;<p>And so on [3] [4].<p>I don&#x27;t think we know for sure what would happen if the world stopped eating meat, but I think overall, environmentally and ethically, it would be an improvement.<p>(To a point about worse nutritional profiles of vegan vs. \nomnivore diets (raised in [4]), I think the answer is to eat oysters, clams and mussels, which are high in iron, protein, and fish oil, but don&#x27;t have capacity for pain&#x2F;experience, as far as we know. This is called ostroveganism and I picked up the idea from Michael Huemer [5].)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;8&#x2F;21&#x2F;6053187&#x2F;cropland-map-food-fuel-animal-feed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;8&#x2F;21&#x2F;6053187&#x2F;cropland-map-food-fuel...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;115&#x2F;15&#x2F;3804" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;115&#x2F;15&#x2F;3804</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbcgoodfood.com&#x2F;howto&#x2F;guide&#x2F;what-would-world-look-if-everyone-went-vegan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbcgoodfood.com&#x2F;howto&#x2F;guide&#x2F;what-would-world-loo...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;what-would-happen-if-all-americans-went-vegan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;what-would-happen-if...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;114&#x2F;48&#x2F;E10301" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;114&#x2F;48&#x2F;E10301</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.calpoly.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=2174&amp;context=bts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.calpoly.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?artic...</a>')
