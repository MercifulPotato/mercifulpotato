You also have the added assurance that if the arbitrage opportunity goes away before you can take advantage of it, the entire transaction fails and you only lose the Ethereum transaction fee. It&#x27;s essentially risk-free arbitrage.<p>This paper [1] dives into detail about how these arbitrage mechanics play out on the blockchain, and how both arbitrageurs and miners manipulate transactions in order to make a profit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1904.05234" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1904.05234</a>')
