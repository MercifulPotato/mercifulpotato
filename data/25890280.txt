Let&#x27;s remain literal. It&#x27;s a word denoting the concept of freedom for individuals to extract and use value from their activities to secure an economic base for themselves. Groups of the rest of us can then form independent judgements on those activities and regulate them by law. In this way, all-powerful sanctions are available for governments and regulators to haul in those activities which pollute our world. Separation of function is key to this process and is absent in communist societies hence the appalling pollution created by the USSR in its heyday. Sadly, governments and their regulators do, in the main, a woeful job in performing their regulatory duties.')
