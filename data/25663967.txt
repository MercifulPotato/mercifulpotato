Do you have a link I could check out? I exchanged with someone a few days ago who is working &#x2F;has worked in the insurance sector. Could you send me your contact information or add it to your profile? I&#x27;ll ask them if they&#x27;re interested in getting in touch with you or take a look at your product.<p>&gt;<i>Trying to land our first (fairly large) customer at the moment!</i><p>Nice. We&#x27;re coming at it from the other way: we&#x27;ve had organizations as clients for our <i>consultancy</i> and we built complete custom machine learning solutions for them [as in, sometimes doing 3D printing to serve data acquisition, writing libraries for BLE devices, to the models, and web&#x2F;mobile apps, as they wanted us to completely handle everything]. After doing that for many years, we clustered problems we consistently ran into, and <i>then</i> decided to build our internal platform to help us deliver better.<p>&gt;<i>Can you share any more on what your plans are especially from a business perspective?</i><p>First, keep our sanity. It feels really good to see all the tedious work we don&#x27;t have to do anymore on the consulting side because of what our tool does for us. We continue to do consulting to keep our finger on the pulse, plus the problems we solve are really cool and diverse.')
