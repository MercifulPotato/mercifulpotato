Type 1 who switched away from Eli Lilly insulins (Humalog and Humulin N) to the Novo Nordisk (Novolin R and Novolin N) equivalents sold at Wal-Mart.<p>Much more planning involved, and a big adjustment compared to Humalog and Humulin.  My A1Cs are also a bit higher (6.1 instead of 5.9) to give myself more safety margin.<p>-----<p>Why&#x27;d I switch?  First I pay less out of pocket than I did compared to insurance co-pays for the name brand stuff.  That is, $90&#x2F;mo for short-acting, long-acting, lancets, test strips and syringes... compared to $170&#x2F;mo in insurance co-pays for the Eli Lilly and Abbott equivalents, and probably around $800 MSRP.<p>The second is I no longer need to wait for refill authorizations which too many doctor offices drag their feet on, in addition to insurance companies enforcing only a tiny number of refills per auth (<i>as in, requiring a physician&#x27;s authorization for the insulin you&#x27;ll use until you die EVERY SINGLE MONTH</i>) which creates yet more delays and sometimes numerous phone calls to get a prescription refilled since you constantly need an authorization from the prescribing doctor.  <i>&quot;If they keep messing up, why not switch doct--&quot;</i>  I have.  Four times, across three different HCOs, and three different insurance companies.  They all screw up and fail to respond to the pharmacy on occasion, sometimes for several months (and a dozen plus phone calls) in a row.<p>It wasn&#x27;t even about the cost anymore.  The ridiculous bureaucracy with the ultimate position of, <i>&quot;it&#x27;s the patient&#x27;s fault&quot;</i> held by every other party forced my hand.')
