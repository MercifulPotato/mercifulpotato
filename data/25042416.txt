A program on your computer wouldn&#x27;t make much sense unless you understood the inner workings - processes, kernel, ABI, CPU, etc.<p>Maybe one day we will find out as we learn more about the brain. Until then we just have to live with this magical mystery. The real question is how we deal with the ethical issues. We could learn a lot more about the brain if we could &quot;break it&quot;, test it, experiment with it, etc. But obviously we can&#x27;t do that with the human brain. Maybe start with simpler animal brains and then work our way up?<p>If we could triangulate the parts of the brain where consciousness resides, then perhaps we can disable that portion and create brains to experiment on? But then again, if we disable the part of the brain responsible for consciousness, how can we study consciousness?')
