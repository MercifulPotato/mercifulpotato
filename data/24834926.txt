We talked about the news and recent events in class around that time. It wasn&#x27;t anything profound, but our classes definitely talked about it. This was also in the years following 9&#x2F;11, so it was an unavoidable topic. We even had mock elections where we&#x27;d &quot;vote&quot; for real, current politicians.<p>If I&#x27;d only heard about the news and world happenings from home, I&#x27;d have a very different and far narrower view of things.<p>And it&#x27;s not just politics. No clue why you assumed that. Schools put you in a room with kids from different backgrounds, different interests, different likes and dislikes. I see a lot of praise about homeschooling on HN, but the ones I&#x27;ve encountered (including cousins in my own family) mostly come from very isolated religious families seeking to shield their kids from the outside world. Maybe it&#x27;s different for very wealthy people growing up in the valley or with other great resources provided to them, but most of the homeschooled people I&#x27;ve been around have had trouble acclimating to a world that isn&#x27;t sanitized for their existence.')
