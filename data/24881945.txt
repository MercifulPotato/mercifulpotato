These are often extremely broad and restrictive, especially if you don&#x27;t live in a knowledge labor friendly state like California.<p>I currently have a noncompete that restricts me from working in a management or ownership position at &quot;infrastructure&quot; companies for the next year.<p>How do you think about this? I am specifically asking in the context of starting my own venture. Do I really need to be unemployed for an entire year to be in the clear?')
