What this sounds like is disrupting meritocracy &quot;we &lt;insert combo of minority identities&gt; president or engineer... etc&quot; but in reality is nothing but an extension of confessionalism, which never works. Look at where such politics ends (Lebanon&#x27;s current crisis &lt;-- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Pact" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Pact</a>, Iraq&#x27;s current crisis &lt;-- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mei.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;nation-or-religion-iraqs-hybrid-identity-politics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mei.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;nation-or-religion-iraqs-hy...</a>). Increase representation by fixing the pipeline problem not instating qoutas without sunset deadlines or criteria<p>scientism: the usage of phrases such as &quot;believe science&quot; when talking about social issues like abortion \nwhere worth is assigned to lives and even ignoring it completely when talking about puberty blockers. Never mind how anti-scientific &quot;believe science&quot; is.<p>American exceptionalism: A lot more subtle than the right&#x27;s &quot;shithole country&quot; comments but no less dangerous, look no further than how Poland is talked about, or Hungary... etc. Can&#x27;t fathom how different societies look at issues from other perspectives. This is a form of cultural imperialism.<p>All of the above are subject to your definition of left and are points of debate within the left too.')
