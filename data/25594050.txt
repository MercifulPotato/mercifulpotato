It&#x27;d certainly be nice if everything just automagically worked about accessible UI but we&#x27;re not there yet (getting anything to automagically work in UI is a pain still).<p>As far as what we can do about it I suppose outside of somehow translating thoughts into perfect UI automatically we can try to add coverage to these projects as we can prioritize it. After all that&#x27;s why they are being built in the open with an open license, so others can help add functionality.')
