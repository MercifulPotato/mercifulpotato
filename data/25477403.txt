These opt-out websites largely do not work and, besides, the law in most places legislates opt-in and not opt-out.\nApps continue to ignore any privacy setting, including facebook.<p>It is sad that we need to rely on Apple to make that change, but I am happy for any incentive Apple has to do so. I am sure it will take quite some time before we see something comparable on Android, if ever.<p>Again: Our rights as consumers are blatantly ignored. All current methods that are supposed to implement these rights are useless and largely ineffective.<p>Devices need to ensure that no one can grab data without consent. Apple does this.\nIt is good.')
