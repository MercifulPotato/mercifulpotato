What I was trying to point out, and maybe didn&#x27;t point out well enough, was that China and India have different systems, values and expectations, meaning that businesses expecting a like for like replacement will eventually end up being disappointed.<p>Doing business in a federal democracy comprised of diverse states and population like India and a top down controlled economy like China has different implications, no matter what. There is a very valid case for India improving conditions for people to do business there, but even if those things happen, the value proposition will still be different when compared to China and in the end, at some point, a compromise to profits will have to be made in favour of values.')
