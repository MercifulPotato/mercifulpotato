China and India aren&#x27;t half the world&#x27;s population. And their share is falling.<p>Even if they were:<p>1. India is (partly) English speaking, so it doesn&#x27;t fit the split.<p>2. If you exclude the English speaking world (let&#x27;s say 1 billion people) and China + India (3 billion people), you&#x27;re still left with almost 4 billion people. Out of which about 1 billion live in developed countries or are middle&#x2F;upper class in developing countries. So that&#x27;s a big market. Japan, the EU, Latin America, etc.')
