Fix the staggering wealth inequality first before you even think about having hope of addressing stereotyping and racism.<p>Downvote me all you want, but this is history.  I’m not saying racism isn’t real, it’s very real and very ugly.  It’s part of human nature to stereotype others, just as it’s human nature to fight and hoard resources.  We have to combat these innate tendencies as a community by FIRST ensuring that all our people have the ability to live comfortably.<p>The unfortunate reality for most marginalized communities in the US is that they simply don’t have the time to sit and wait for the economic policies to shift back to favoring the middle class.  They have to act now.')
