Maybe they just add strips of magnets to a usb-c so you can still use the port with a normal usb-c cable and still benefit of magsafe with the proprietary adapter.\nAnyway, I did enjoy MagSafe when it was there but I don&#x27;t think Apple will go back. They&#x27;d rather focus on making sure you only have to charge your laptop at night.')
