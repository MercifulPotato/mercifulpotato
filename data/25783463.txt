Some people walk 20 feet to their car, 200 feet to the elevator, 20 feet to the cubicle, then end the day back at home without scarcely moving 1000 feet by their own leg.

Well, it could be our addiction to staring at a phone screen for hours at a time in total silence, unmoving. It&#x27;s probably a combination of things, like the fact that americans are working more hours than they were 10 years ago and now have to sacrifice a good nights sleep to get all their personal business done when they aren&#x27;t working:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;american-work-habits-culture-change-2019-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;american-work-habits-culture...</a>')
