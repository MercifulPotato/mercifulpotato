Even before taking into account the lack of 55+ patients, it&#x27;s possible that the half-full could be a lot less effective than it seems and&#x2F;or the full-full dose a bit more. Rather than stealing his statistics and pretending I can do the math, I&#x27;ll quote liberally from Derek Lowe&#x27;s write-up[0]:<p>&gt; In the larger cohort who got the two regular doses, vaccine efficacy was 62% (<i>with a 95% confidence interval of 41% to 75%</i>). There were 27 cases in the 4440 treatment patients, compared to 71 cases out of 4455 patients in the controls. Meanwhile, in the half-dose-first group, efficacy comes out at 90% (<i>with a 95% confidence interval of 67% to 97%</i>). Both of those 95% CIs are a bit of a spread. In this group, 3 out of 1367 patients in the treatment group came down with coronavirus, compared to 30 out of 1374 in the controls. That control-group infection rate is definitely higher than what was seen in the two-full-dose group, which makes you wonder if it’s running randomly high (which would make the half-dose group look better than it really is) or if the larger full-dose group was running randomly low (which would make it look worse than it really is, but remember, with its larger sample size there’s correspondingly somewhat less room to believe that it was that far out of whack). We need to add in to these calculations the news that the half-dose group included no patients older than 55, and to wonder what effect that had on the numbers, too. The paper reports a combined overall efficacy of 70.45 (95% CI between 54.8% and 80.6%), but how much you trust that one comes down to how different you think these two groups are.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-efficacy-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.sciencemag.org&#x2F;pipeline&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;th...</a>')
