And what&#x27;s unsafe takes into account the prevailing conditions (so you can be ticketed when going the speed limit if, say, it&#x27;s raining), and also the fact that deltas in speed are more dangerous than absolute speed (so if the speed limit is 55, everybody else is going 60, and you&#x27;re going 40, <i>you</i> may well get a ticket &#x27;cause you&#x27;re creating a danger.<p><i>Almost sounds like the police can pull over and search whoever they like</i><p>Yep, that&#x27;s true within 100 miles of the border - an area that accounts for the vast majority of US residents. I&#x27;ve been stopped several times near the Mexico border for no <i>real</i> reason; one office asks me questions for a minute or two, just long enough for their drug-sniffing dog to make the full round of my car and come up empty.')
