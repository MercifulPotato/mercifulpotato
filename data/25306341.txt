Item(by='gofreddygo', descendants=None, kids=[25307215], score=None, time=1607108873, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304288, text='Excellent practical advice.<p>That part of just following the solution for the first 50-100 problems is spot on. It resonates very well with my experience learning math by first following the &quot;solved&quot; examples, fully understanding them, then solving similar &quot;simple&quot; problems, repeating them till they fit into muscle memory and only then attempting the challenging ones.<p>First challenge I faced with leetcode is they do not have a concept or technique map. Similar to the chapter index in any math textbook, each dealing with a specific technique, concept or pattern. For example the idea of using a hash to store a running sum is useful for a class of problems like finding the longest sequence that adds to a specified sum, longest sequence of equal no of 0s and 1s. Yet, there was and still isn&#x27;t a page or resource where such a pattern was described.<p>Solving leetcode feels like swimming upstream, one problem at a time, looking for patterns. Some are well described (Kadane for example) but most aren&#x27;t. I looked around the web but couldn&#x27;t find any resources that helped me with this.<p>I wonder if we could, at your experience, list some concepts and techniques that can be repeatedly useful. I believe that could cut the prep time by a good degree.<p>Second related problem to this is retention. With this master technique map, it would become easier to review and revise quickly. (I tried spaced rep, not useful) The most effective strategy for me has been to put everything in one book.I have multiple index pages with lists of similar problems pointing the page numbers with the solution.<p>I have been able to get better at data structures using this approach now I&#x27;m at the leetcode phase.<p>Appreciate your response.')
