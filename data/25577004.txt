Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=[25577879], score=None, time=1609289280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25576906, text='They would have a legitimate reason to doubt that all cards individually opted out and so they&#x27;d probably send people a letter or post a notice somewhere (updated ToS, idk) that there is now a new form that makes it more annoying for you to opt out (have to enter other details, send a letter, whatever) and that opt-outs after date X (when the mass additions started happening) have not been processed.<p>Or you do it like the EU and make excessive data processing opt-in. (Where by &quot;excessive&quot; I mean something that doesn&#x27;t fall within recital 47 of GDPR: &quot;legitimate [e.g. marketing] interests of [the company] may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that [users&#x27; rights] are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of [users]&quot;. It&#x27;s a grey area where this line is exactly, but Visa can&#x27;t simply do whatever they want. They have to tell you what data they process, but nobody reads that, and for unexpected (arguably excessive) things they&#x27;d have to ask you to opt in.) But I guess that&#x27;s a little beyond the scope of this comment thread.')
