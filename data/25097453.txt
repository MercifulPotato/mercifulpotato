It isn&#x27;t people going out to show off for example - it is people who want want food.<p>The competition mentality in hospitality businesses is cut-throat and deeply ingrained. If they saw a profit margin, they would attempt to push the delivery service out of the market. If I&#x27;m a regular at Toby&#x27;s Popular Take Away, it seems unlikely that Toby would sit quietly while Uber made money. He would try to muscle in on the distribution too.<p>It is unlikely that the market share they are fighting for is defensible. A lot of people aren&#x27;t fighting for it at the moment because there is no profit to be found. The app part might get commoditised or done in a community manner or by some random dude as a side project, it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to get local businesses on side with an idea like that. It doesn&#x27;t need to be a big company.')
