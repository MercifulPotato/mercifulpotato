I look at the amount of data processing the software I&#x27;m building does, compare it mentally against the amount of data processing a random videogame from 10 years ago did, and ask myself (and the team), how come our software does much less work than that game, and runs much slower than that game did a decade ago?<p>(And the answer very often boils down to: lots of unnecessary parsing or string processing, and bad choices in data structures. Both relatively easily fixable, if one bothers to look for it - and both mistakes that could have been avoided in the first place at little to no cost in developer effort.)')
