The Chinese 地理 is literally &quot;Earth Science&quot; (a term also used in English but with a broader meaning of all sciences dealing with the earth including geology and geophysics as well as geography) . Spanish &quot;geografía&quot; means &quot;earth description&quot; but isn&#x27;t as self-documenting because to recognize this you have to go outside the language to Ancient Greek.')
