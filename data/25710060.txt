Your language and imagery is... kinda violent.  It&#x27;s not an argument about principles, with nuance, you&#x27;ve got enemies.  You&#x27;re warning about &quot;blowback&quot;.  You&#x27;re saying that the insurrection is &quot;vindicated&quot;.  You&#x27;re implying that this action against Parler is a foreign conspiracy too.<p>Now... is that one post beyond what HN should allow?  Probably not, and it&#x27;s not my call, we&#x27;ll see what dang says.  But imagine a whole community of people like you warning constantly about imagined terrors and existential threats.  And everyone gets to one-up each other.<p>That&#x27;s what Parler is.  Before long you get senior thought leaders like the President&#x27;s former attorney (or whatever Lin Wood is) expressly calling for the Vice President to be executed to stop an imagined &quot;steal&quot; of the election.  And then the mob attacks the VP and congress trying to do exactly that.<p>It has to be stopped somehow, right?  We can&#x27;t have online communities pushing real world violence.  And it all starts with content moderation.  The reason this seems so extreme is that it should have happened LONG ago.')
