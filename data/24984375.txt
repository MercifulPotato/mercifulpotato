I wonder if what Florida police took as 10 miles a day was in Florida or on the A.T. \nIt probably makes for a big difference as the Florida Trail is much flatter and the terrain should be easier though I&#x27;m not sure the middle of the summer is the best time to hike it, and the heat + humidity could have slowed him down in different ways.<p>As to the A.T. â€” I think it&#x27;s not just the grade that is to account for the low mileage but also that the season is not as narrow as on the PCT&#x2F;CDT.')
