Instead we have this weird system where a bunch of people jump through hoops to be here legally and a bunch of people don&#x27;t, and Democrats pick and choose when they care about either one. There&#x27;s no predictability, rule of law, consistency or sense on this issue from either party.<p>I began immigration to the US under a Democratic administration and finished it at the end of a Democratic controlled Congress and another Democratic administration. It was consistently a badly run, non-sensical process. So FOH with claims that Democrats would like a country with open borders or that they&#x27;re much better at running a sane process.')
