When I lived in St. Louis I lived right next to a homeless shelter. I&#x27;d hang out with some while waiting for steet food to be cooked (the dudes sleeping on the step to my condo). I often would offer them food. They usually turned me down. I asked one and the reason was that if they had food that gave them the runs they were in deep trouble.
