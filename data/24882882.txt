I&#x27;m a bit more sympathetic to a comparison between Central Americans migrants -&gt; US and Uighurs -&gt; China, although there are striking differences even between the two: foremost, Uighurs are Chinese citizens, and Central Americans are not US citizens, which is a major, major difference. As such, Central Americans are not, by definition, a &quot;US minority group&quot;. I had assumed you were comparing the present situation of black Americans and the Uighurs.<p>Lots of things made me angry when I was in my teens and 20s that I look back on now in my 50s and understand much better (eg, I was furious at the lack of US intervention in Bosnia. I now understand much better the reasons driving non-interventionism, and I&#x27;m able to see the compassion driving it, even if I don&#x27;t always agree.).<p>Edit: And BTW, it wasn&#x27;t I who flagged your response, despite the ad hominem. But those things rarely play well on HN, as I&#x27;m sure you know.')
