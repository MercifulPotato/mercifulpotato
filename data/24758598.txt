I imagine the latter, when seen all the way through, is much more attractive to recruiters. Although, I don&#x27;t have any solid anecdotal experience with recruiting to validate that claim.<p>I just think it&#x27;s important to not classify all projects outside of your job as &quot;shallow&quot; side projects, and then completely discard them career wise like the article seems to be doing.')
