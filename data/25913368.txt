I can&#x27;t find the link, but I thought I saw people saying that this was idiomatic to use in many cases for Google Cloud, rather than compiling the schemas into the binary.<p>That feels weird to me because compilation was always the traditional &#x2F; intended use of protobufs, whereas dynamic reflection was for a few non-critical debugging tools.  I guess my point is that Google has a very specific computing environment and set of problems, and when they get exported to the outside world, they start to get warped because of the different set of problems.  That feels like what happened with Borg&#x2F;Kubernetes as well.  I seem to see a lot of regrets about Kubernetes lately, from primary authors and operators.')
