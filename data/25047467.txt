You should have seen our previous version of the landing page.. it had tons of security details but we got feedback that a normal user won&#x27;t be able to understand it and it might overwhelm them at best. The feedback was that people might not want to use something that they don&#x27;t understand. That&#x27;s why we cut down on the security jargon and tried to keep it dead simple. But seems like a little bit more info might actually help based on the feedback here ha. So thanks for the feedback!')
