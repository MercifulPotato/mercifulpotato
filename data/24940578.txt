There is no way people actually believe the whole world can go Dutch, right?<p>I hope this doesn&#x27;t come across as overly-aggressive, but it seems to me like you don&#x27;t really understand much about how the Dutch lived below sea levels for centuries.<p>Yes, over many centuries, they have built all sorts of contraptions in order to gain more land from the sea or lakes. But this is expensive, takes up a vast amount of skill and planning and is only feasible in certain terrain. The Netherlands is also a small and very rich country. To believe that the whole world can do this is complete insanity.')
