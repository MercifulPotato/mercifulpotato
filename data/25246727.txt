Item(by='willfiveash', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606672793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25242182, text='I&#x27;m using Pushover (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushover.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pushover.net&#x2F;</a>) to send notifications to my Apple devices.  To make use of it easier on command line I wrote a simple Python script which I&#x27;ve found to be very useful for things like allowing Transmission to send notifications when a download is finished or in scripts that do backup jobs which take a long time, letting me know when my Mac has booted, etc...  Reply to this comment if you&#x27;re interested in my script (note that the pushover site has good examples of how to call their API).')
