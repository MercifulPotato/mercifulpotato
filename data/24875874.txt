It&#x27;s the public narrative that makes laws and funding disappear and reappear every 4 years, not to mention continuous brainwashing in climate groups.<p>But realistically speaking, I take your point. I just don&#x27;t want to dismiss nuclear for the wrong reason. We need to make a choice of how much energy to build where, using which technology, and by when.<p>Let&#x27;s make it.<p>Realistically people are going to hate on nuclear for stupid reasons? Fine, then please let us find an energy mix that works where we reach our climate goals. And we can still adjust those projects whose start-by date hasn&#x27;t passed if, say, fusion is looking good. We just shouldn&#x27;t wait and pray, as we&#x27;re currently doing for the most part, because that mistake will catch up to us. Rather, let&#x27;s make the plan and only adjust parts with other parts that work rather than leave huge, huge blanks.')
