Do you mean that, to get it to compile as C++, you have to add an explicit cast?<p>Yes.<p>&gt;  That isn&#x27;t a significant burden.<p>But once you do it your &quot;C&quot; code is littered with a lot of unnecessary casts that increase the verbosity of the code and could hide errors. With pre C99 code it would also hide default int errors if the include for malloc gets lost at some point.')
