Maybe it&#x27;s accurate if you&#x27;re not doing controlled breathing. I haven&#x27;t had someone else watch me and compare. (I am also a trained vocalist and do a fair amount of yoga, it might be that it&#x27;s only accurate for people with minimal breath training, or people with more exercise-focused breath training.)')
