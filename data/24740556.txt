I have extremely limited resources. A serialized packet going to the server can be no more than 20 bytes in this case, it needs to fit in a default size single BLE packet.<p>My app developers came back with a message ID field that uses a UUID. A 256bit store, 16 of my possible 20 bytes.<p>The whole packet as they designed it was only 6x larger than could possibly fit.<p>They used int... not having any idea what a int64_t was or that because the value could only ever be 0-20 that a uint8_t was most appropriate. Oh but the language they’re using doesn’t have 8bit ints I guess so then it was a discussion of “what is but shifting” and who even uses this weird operator &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; !?<p>I have a hundred examples of the above. Embedded is a different world, I consider that “how computers work” territory.')
