The statement that there is no OSS business model is completely untrue. Let me give you a few models that work:<p>* Run a hosted service (ex: Algolia, Wordpress.com)<p>* Sell enterprise subscriptions which include packaging and support (ex: Red Hat)<p>* Sell professional services (ex: Hortonworks prior to Cloudera sale)<p>* Be a boutique consultancy (too many to name)<p>* Sell OSS relevant products - security or management (ex: Fossa, Snyk)<p>* Have an open core model where foundation is open but management&#x2F;integrations are closed. These companies will also move the closed stuff over to the open side as the market dictates which will cause them to continually innovate (ex: Cloudera)<p>* Dual licensing based on usage. Consumers get one license, business gets another.(ex: mySql)<p>* Open source package subscriptions for developers (ex: Tidelift). This is a very cool managed open source model which is pretty encouraging.<p>OSS is the amazing way to do guerilla marketing that results in an emotional connection with your user. That alone is monetizable.<p>I can keep on going and going. There is definitely a way to make money. There is definitely a way to build a scalable business. Just because something is hard doesn&#x27;t make it impossible. And lastly, for those who spend their days looking for solutions, this isn&#x27;t a black and white issue. Look for the grey and you can unlock millions&#x2F;billions in value.<p>(background: Former red hatter, part of 3 OSS startups, huge OSS fan if done right. personally like the hosted OSS model the best)')
