If you want to read scheduling code of linux, no one forces you to read 5M+ lines of driver code. If linux was just a microkernel, and distros shipped drivers, you&#x27;d still have to read roughly the same number of lines to understand linux scheduling. If you want to read the entire linux code, you can still do it, just ignore the driver code if you&#x27;re not interested in them; otherwise in your scenario you&#x27;d be reading driver code in distros as well.')
