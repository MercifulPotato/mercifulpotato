Raising a militia for defense in the context of the US south has pretty clear implications.<p>Just because there&#x27;s a right to bear arms in the US doesn&#x27;t mean the public there has any effective resistance against state coercion or violence. History doesn&#x27;t bear that out at all. Likewise over history in countries that have no right to bear arms there have been many instances of the population resisting state coercion.<p>Guns are fairly easily obtained in a licensed and registered manner here in Canada and in many other countries that have large rural areas, etc. for the purpose of hunting and sport. Sure, hand guns or assault weapons, no.  And yes, there are no constitutional guarantees of this. But it&#x27;s mostly irrelevant because the public is on the whole supportive of the notion that guns like cars and pesticides and other things are a fairly dangerous tool where the public as a whole gains from carefully watching them.')
