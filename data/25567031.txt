No one is helped if the gaps make it impossible for students to understand the concepts.<p>&gt; <i>These gaps leave ups to leaps of faith at our beginnings and thorough proofs as we mature.</i><p>As a student who had been in such a situation, I can say that <i>both</i> of those seriously impacted my and my colleagues&#x27; understanding of the subject.<p>I&#x27;ve had professors who didn&#x27;t explain their reasoning for certain steps at all and others who &quot;explained&quot; it by simply reading through the mathematical proof. That was about as helpful as getting thrown into vi without any help documents vs getting thrown into vi with just a copy of the full source code next to you: Neither helps you understand how to actually <i>work</i> with vi.<p>I believe the goal of, say, a mathematical lecture should be to explain the basic idea of a mathematical tool and the reasoning why it is there and how one can use it. I believe if students have understood that, they will have less need to dive into some hairy details of the actual proofs as well.')
