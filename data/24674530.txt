People are made or feel culturally obligated to read them. So the Grapes of Wrath (3.97) has a lower score  than Anarch (4.62) the 15th Gaunt&#x27;s Ghost novel set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. This is because the only people who are likely to read the latter are people likely to enjoy it.<p>Clearly though, different movies and books server different purposes. Is Schindlers List a better movie than Airplane! Sure, but I&#x27;m not going to put on the former when I want a few laughs.')
