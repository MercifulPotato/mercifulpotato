Where large lifters like this will really shine is in allowing automated mining factories to be sent to various space rocks in order to allow further, larger projects to be built in place.</i><p>The way I see it, a lot of interesting things are <i>closer</i> than Mars. There&#x27;s plenty of space rocks near Earth, that could be nudged into Earth orbit and mined, ultimately enabling orbital construction. I&#x27;m hoping a whole economy in cislunar space will eventually take off. That would go a long way towards making servicing Mars cheaper, too.')
