Amazon didn&#x27;t become the company it is today by burning out hardworking and talented engineers for no reason. In the scenario I am referring to, the engineer did a very poor job of communication and receiving feedback. When your company is as big as Amazon, you&#x27;re going to have some people who didn&#x27;t quite fit. The people who succeeded there don&#x27;t spend their time talking to journalists or complaining on HN<p>Overall, I spent my time there working with ambitious and smart people. And money-wise, I feel like you can&#x27;t work at a safer place in the tech industry then at a FAANG company, particularly Amazon.')
