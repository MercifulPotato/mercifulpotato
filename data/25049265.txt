Armor and swords or not, you can&#x27;t fend off vast numbers of opponents by yourself for long. That street fight you posted lasts only a few seconds, it&#x27;s just that the video has been edited to stretch it out to two minutes.<p>Taking advantage of their numbers doesn&#x27;t require experience. Kindergarteners gang up on each other. It&#x27;s instinct.<p>&gt; if a knight could be taken down by a bunch of peasants, why did invest so much time and money on knights and armour.<p>For the same reason we invest in soldiers today. As a group, they can be a formidable force. But if a single one gets mobbed by 20 enemies up close, chances are he&#x27;s going down no matter how elite or well trained he is.')
