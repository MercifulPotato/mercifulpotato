Within a few years all of these machines will age out and be replaced with m1 powered machines. At that point the idea of developing on ARM and deploying on x86 will be unpleasant<p>Is it not at least somewhat possible that at least some of those Apple laptops will age out and be replaced with GNU&#x2F;Linux laptops?  Agreed that developing on ARM and deploying on x86 is unpleasant, but so too is developing on macOS and deploying on Linux.  Appleâ€™s GNU userland is pretty ancient, and while the BSD parts are at least updated, they are also very austere.  Given that friction is already there, is it likelier that folks will try to alleviate it with macOS in the cloud or GNU&#x2F;Linux locally?<p>Mac OS X was a godsend in 2001: it put a great Unix underneath a fine UI atop good hardware.  It dragged an awful lot of folks three-quarters of the way to a free system.  But frankly I believe Apple have lost ground UI-wise over the intervening decades, while free alternatives have gained it (they are still not at parity, granted).  Meanwhile, the negatives of using a proprietary OS are worse, not better.')
