You can&#x27;t chose not to ingest micro plastic. And you&#x27;re right, air pollution is a similar issue, should we ignore rising issues because we&#x27;re already dealing with existing ones ?<p>By the way, nobody is telling you to be scared. Micro plastics in placenta is, apparently, a fact, micro plastics being dangerous to us is a fact, chose how you feel about it but don&#x27;t shoot the messenger.')
