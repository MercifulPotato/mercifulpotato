Let&#x27;s say you buy $100 worth of Bitcoin in the past. Now the value of your coins is $120.<p>If you decide to send $5 worth of bitcoin as payment for something, they consider that a taxable event. You sold X amount of bitcoin, which appreciated 20% value from when you bought it. That X amount was worth $4, now it is worth $5, so you would owe a tiny amount in capital gains tax on $1 you gained.<p>Edit: This exact same scenario happens for Foreign Exchange, but the government excludes most transactions under a certain amount because it&#x27;s too complicated for travelers. Also, the rate of USD to EURO doesn&#x27;t fluctuate as wildly as crypto can, so the gains are minimal anyways.')
