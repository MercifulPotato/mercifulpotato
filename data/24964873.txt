I discovered that Konsole crashes when unlimited scrollback is enabled and &#x2F;tmp becomes full.  Submitting the crash report requires answering a pop quiz, and if any of your answers are unsatisfactory then you get a message that your report is not useful.  Navigate that gauntlet and then you are asked to create an account and write a bug report, and your crash dump becomes public.<p>Good software needs a <i>really easy</i> way to report bugs and get back to work.  And people to triage the reports.  I do not work for KDE, but the bug reporting process treats me like I do.')
