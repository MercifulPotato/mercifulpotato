Airing of grievances is a perfectly legitimate form of grief.  When my (very popular, publicly beloved, but privately  abusive) dad died, I didn&#x27;t speak my mind at his funeral because of attitudes like yours.  People with an incomplete understanding of his person wanted to censor my experiences in order to relish in the good times.  My grief process would require several years of counseling.  They were there for a party, and most of them experienced a day or less of grief.  The truth is complex.  The weirdest reaction to &quot;cancel culture&quot; is people who would censor the truth in favor of fantasy, but complain that their fave artist is the one being censored.')
