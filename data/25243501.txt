It&#x27;s not appleness of apple itself that is sad, but the fact that <i>everyone</i> jumped that boat of &quot;knowing what&#x27;s better for you&quot; and then started to push it over the limit of sanity. Commercial effort is understandable, they do private business at least, but even free&#x2F;open software catched that disease.')
