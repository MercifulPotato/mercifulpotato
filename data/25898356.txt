Are there plans for more backends? RISC-V, Wasm or Scheme (not Chez specific)? Wasm would be interesting as that would also enable a path to integrate with Graal.  I understand that Wasm doesn&#x27;t yet support native tail calls, so that would have to have to be addressed.<p>&gt; A Racket-implemented layer of Racket CS must be translated to Scheme to run on top of Chez Scheme.<p>That contract between Racket and Chez for how Racket runs on Chez, I think that is fairly interesting from a language engineering perspective. It seems like it could be a nice RRRS (Revised Report on Racket on Scheme).<p>What are your thoughts on Shen?')
