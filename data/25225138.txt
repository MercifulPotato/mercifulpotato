Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25225182, 25245214], score=None, time=1606444573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25225090, text='I noted that it sounded like an attractive nuisance. I failed to list all the ways in which it was an attractive nuisance and only focused on the part where it&#x27;s obviously costing a small town money.<p>Then HN pedantry and argumentation kicked in.<p>The townspeople clearly see it as an attractive nuisance and not as free publicity. They chose to change the name because it&#x27;s such a nuisance. Now a bunch of people on HN feel the townspeople were wrong to handle it that way and have a zillion criticisms and solutions.<p>The townspeople didn&#x27;t ask HNs permission or opinion. And a lot of the comments here before I noted that it&#x27;s an attractive nuisance were basically junior high style humor listing all the towns with &quot;bad word&quot; names and giggling about it -- which I initially participated in and then deleted those comments to try to behave in accordance with HN rules and treat the article in a more serious fashion, at which point I made my comment about it being an attractive nuisance.<p>And that&#x27;s apparently where I made my wrong turn for the day. And there is no cure for where that took me, it seems.')
