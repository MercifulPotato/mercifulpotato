Then, they&#x27;re still not very healthy because they &#x27;grew from scrub&#x27;.<p>They have to then die of natural causes one at a time and be replaced by a single healthy one. Maybe another 50 years. Finally you have a stable healthy forest.<p>Or, you can just plant 100 trees per acre in a grid. And mow the volunteers until you have what you want. 20 years maybe.')
