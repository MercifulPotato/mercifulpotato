The almost realtime map from ucte.org which updated every 3 to 5 seconds on my Pentium3 933 with only 512MB Ram in the browser.<p>I think it needed some plugin, either Java or Flash, but you could zoom in or out, either to the whole of Europe, or down to the substations in the cities and towns.<p>It was like google maps or similar. AND it had <i>all</i> the transmission lines, power plants, and substations.<p>And color coded lines, with KW&#x2F;MW&#x2F;GW and arrows indicating the direction of energy flow on them.<p>Anybody could view it without having an account there. At least I did, from time to time.<p>This way of viewing it in realtime is now gone, or at least not accessible to the general public anymore.<p>Does anybody know some equivalent?<p>Sites with bargraphs and charts need not apply.')
