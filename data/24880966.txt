I can&#x27;t see the reason that Rust is not as functional as OCaml by your standard, as both fill four boxes out of seven (only OCaml has currying, only Rust has typeclasses). It can be argued that Rust was not <i>originally</i> designed as functional one, but that would be absurd because it doesn&#x27;t relate to the current language.')
