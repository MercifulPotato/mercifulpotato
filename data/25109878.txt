The computer with a handicap just plays in very weird ways, and that is not really helpful for learning. I also played the computer at first, and level 3 is the first level where it actually puts up a fight. But it plays very weird combinations of strong moves and then completely blunders at times. The problem is that it blunders in a very non-human way, so it doesn&#x27;t help you that much to learn how to take advantage of the kind of errors a human tends to make.<p>The rating of the computer on Lichess is also kinda weird, you can&#x27;t really rely on those. I&#x27;m a pretty weak player (I have only played a bit online recently), I did beat the level 3 computer on Lichess when I concentrated well enough on a game, but I&#x27;m certainly not 1400 against real humans.')
