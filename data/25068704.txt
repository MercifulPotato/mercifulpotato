Of course that won&#x27;t work for everything (game won&#x27;t auto pause, might continue polling for mouse input, ...).<p>AFAICT Proton already lies to games about the fullscreen resolution and silently upscales the result instead changing the monitor resolution (which I think might be the single most awesome thing Proton adds) so this isn&#x27;t unprecedented.')
