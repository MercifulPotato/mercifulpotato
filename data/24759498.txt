I have been working with a grid in ~2001, running Java-based GUI apps on thin clients from a distributed cluster of several sparc machines. Was an interesting concept with unclear economics (likely useless with the internet connection speeds of that time). It’s not difficult to imagine it as an alternative to GSuite with much less resources required on the client.')
