I think the MSG&#x2F;Chinese connection was because the restaurants would add it to their dishes, which was at the time kind a unique thing - even though many <i>processed foods</i> contain MSG, having it added to your <i>prepared food</i> would be as strange as them adding Yellow #5 to your dish, and the reaction no different.    There’s a quality of integrity to prepared dishes that most all but the modernist restaurants trade upon. Chemical additives, in the days Red Dye #2 scares and the rest hardly need a racist explanation to understand the aversion.')
