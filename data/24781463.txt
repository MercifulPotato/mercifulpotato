Item(by='qwerty456127', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602708777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24778899, text='&gt; Why not?<p>Because a computer&#x2F;smartphone is practically an organ, a brain extension. Letting other people read its content without limitations is like letting them read your actual memory and thoughts (including those you&#x27;d like to keep private between yourself and your partners of all the kinds - business, sex, whatever) and probably even plant a backdoor for spying on you in future (I don&#x27;t know about the US TSA but Chinese border  authorities are known to do so). I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable about that.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t really study terrorist methods.<p>What if I, occasionally, do? Out of pure curiosity. I believe I have googled and downloaded a lot of content which could be found suspicious although I hardly ever had time to read that so far, pure curiosity and information hoarding are my only motivation.')
