If you launch the &quot;waste&quot; into space in them you&#x27;ll be launching a lot more mass than just the 30kt. I don&#x27;t know the exact ratio between cask mass and waste mass, but it could easily be 10:1.<p>Also, I&#x27;ll repeat that throwing away valuable nuclear material just because it&#x27;s called a &quot;waste&quot; product is stupid. Paying a lot of money to throw it into space is even dumber.')
