I’ve never denied them!  All you and Eli have managed to do at this point is try to nitpick the linguistic deficiencies of my explanations, which are inevitable anyway since I’m not a physicist with a specialization in space-time theories.<p>And whether I “get it” or not is secondary to the point of whether you have truly managed to confirm or disconfirm the time travel paradox, which I still claim you have failed to do.  It is <i>simple</i> to wave away a time travel where you do something compeletely <i>benign</i>, like frickin’ wave or greet your former self.  Try dealing with something of consequence, like killing your former self (as in: the person in that point of time-space which carries the mutable signifier of “yourself” which is younger than yourself) or giving yourself a kilogram of gold from the future, which I think would violate the law of preservation of energy or whatever.<p>Is time travel backwarks possible or not?  If it is, see the questions in my previous comment.<p>&gt; No. That was not the premise.<p>And yet if time travel backwards is possible you simply <i>cannot</i> deny that one would <i>experience</i> (!) that time travel as steps 1–3.  Temporal <i>experience</i>.  Hah!<p>There’s absolutely nothing hard about the concept of time being immutable; that’s how children’s cartoon handle time travel, not as two timelines where the <i>first one</i> gets erased right after the second one “happens”.  (Okay, okay, they probably use both of these tactics.)  The true puzzle is time travel which introduce paradoxes, which your original comment says absolutely nothing about.  But maybe you’ve answered that in another comment (I have only kept up with this subthread).  If not, you should probably try to do that instead of dewelling on this minor philosophical insight of yours.')
