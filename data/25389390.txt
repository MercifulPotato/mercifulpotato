Tough trade-off.<p>Melting point of aluminum is too low. Burning point of epoxy&#x2F;carbon fiber is also probably quite low, but it&#x27;s also famously hard to work with and get reliably good results that you can actually inspect. Titanium might work, but is also had to work with and tends to crack.')
