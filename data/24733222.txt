What about the day they decide to censor you instead?<p>What about it? People get banned from Twitter all the time - literally every hosted platform and service moderates and bans content as they see fit. The terms of service you agreed to when using that platform likely includes phrases like &quot;for any reason&quot; and &quot;in perpetuity throughout the universe.&quot;<p>So I guess I make another account? Or go somewhere else? That&#x27;s not exactly the boot of fascism stomping on your face forever.<p>&gt;However, we also have to be realistic about the fact that the largest tech corporations are now more powerful than most countries.<p>No they aren&#x27;t. Countries have armies and the monopoly on violence. Countries can arrest you, torture you, confiscate your possessions, make your beliefs illegal, and murder you. The only thing Twitter can possibly do to me is delete my account or ban me. They only control their one platform, they don&#x27;t control the internet or the entirety of media. They&#x27;re not going to send me to the gulag or throw me into the ovens. They&#x27;re not going to erase me like Stalin.<p>To say that <i>any</i> social media platform is more powerful than most countries is ridiculous.')
