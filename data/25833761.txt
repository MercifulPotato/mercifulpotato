Then they expanded and added the &quot;radio&quot; part, where you paid less if you have a radio (and no tv), including car radio.<p>Then they added internet streaming, and expanded the definition of &quot;tv&quot; to &quot;any device, capable of viewing streamed content&quot; (pc, smartphone), so if you have a smartphone, you have to pay for tv, just because you have a device capable of watching a stream.<p>There have been many calls to just encrypt the over-the-air broadcasts, and create usernames and passwords for paying customers for streaming, but they prefer the &quot;catch-all&quot; definitions of &quot;tv&quot;, so they can collect monthly subscriptions from pretty much every household in the country.<p>Our private tv stations are not much better... the most viewed one, did a nasty deal with the cable&#x2F;iptv operators, wanting either a lot of money for their tv channels as a searate option, or less money if their tv stations are put into &quot;basic&quot;(=cheapest, smaller) cable packages, so they forced a price increase for every cable&#x2F;iptv subscriber and there&#x27;s no way to cancel just their channels.')
