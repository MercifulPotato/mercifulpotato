My Dad is the same.<p>Steve Jobs anyhow, always wanted to make the computer as user friendly as possible, so that anyone should be able to use them - not just some super skilled tech person (which is what I meant in my above post). Hell, Steve even hated the concept of a multi-button mouse... deeming it as something unnecessary if the UI was simple enough.')
