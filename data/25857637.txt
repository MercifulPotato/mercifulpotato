In November, I had a total of 5126 streams, which gave me 14.611 USD.<p>If we extrapolate that to 1 million streams, it would be $2850, but Gary is saying he&#x27;s getting less than 2% of that.<p>The aggregator I&#x27;m using (my only middleman) takes 15%, already subtracted from the numbers above. Gary&#x27;s middlemen apparently take over 98%. That sucks, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be the fault of the streaming services.<p>One caveat to note about these numbers is that the value of streams seem to differ a lot between countries. It&#x27;s possible that Gary has more listeners than I do in less-lucrative countries. I don&#x27;t think it could cover the whole difference. The most likely explanation is that Gary&#x27;s record company is taking most of the money, and&#x2F;or he has to split it with others who were involved in the creative process.<p>If anyone is interested in my earnings data (further analysis, charts, peer review, whatever), it&#x27;s available here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dolkow.se&#x2F;files&#x2F;streams_nov20.xlsx" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dolkow.se&#x2F;files&#x2F;streams_nov20.xlsx</a>')
