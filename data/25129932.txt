If you want mainline kernel support, that requires even more work that many vendors just aren&#x27;t providing.<p>A locked bootloader is just one issue to overcome for Linux support. A lot of the real issues come down to the lack of an enumerable bus on ARM SoCs, along with a lack of drivers.<p>Without vendor support from Apple to support Linux, these devices will be like the millions of iPhones and iPads that don&#x27;t run Linux and will never run Linux.<p>Most ARM SoCs that are sold explicitly as mini Linux computers also have this problem. Many of them are stuck on old kernel forks, because vendors didn&#x27;t give the proper support their SoCs needed to run a mainline Linux kernel.<p><i>tl;dr</i>: For Linux to be a viable option on Apple&#x27;s SoCs, Apple needs to put in a lot of work to explicitly support Linux. Without that vendor support, you will never be able to download a Linux ISO and install it like you can on an x86 Mac.')
