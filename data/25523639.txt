Some of the participants receive my message, others not. When I check the message details it says &quot;message not sent&quot; or &quot;not delivered&quot; (not sure which one) for some group members while it does not display any errors other members.  \nAs far as i noticed, no error means the message was delivered but even when it showed an error it could be that people actually got my message.<p>This error seems to happen a lot more often, when i send messages via Signal Desktop.')
