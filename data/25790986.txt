Someone can&#x27;t periodically destroy a bunch of peoples&#x27; meager shelter in completely unproductive &quot;sweeps&quot; without developing a view that they&#x27;re less than human.&quot;\nAgain I may be wrong but where I live there are no &#x27;homeless villages&#x27; like there are in the US.')
