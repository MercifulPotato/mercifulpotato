This doesn&#x27;t mean that the thicker membranes were better due to being thicker, but because they happened to have a better structure. If the thinner membranes can be manufactured with that structure, they will most likely still be better.<p>Article abstract says exactly this:\n&quot;They found that variability in local density most affects the performance of the membranes. Better synthesis methods could thus improve performance without affecting selectivity.&quot;')
