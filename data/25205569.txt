(Note that this makes your statement basically tautological)<p>And given that China&#x27;s main problem is its population (which is basically impossible to reduce much more right now and they&#x27;re still dealing with negative side-effects from their effective but not-very-nice One Child policy), not it&#x27;s emissions per person, China doesn&#x27;t have as much to reduce. Whereas if the US lived at China&#x27;s level of emissions per capita, then the world&#x27;s <i>total</i> greenhouse emissions would drop by over 10%.')
