And it helps especially big sites. It&#x27;s kind of the new RSA&#x2F;AES&#x2F;SSL hype (SSL 3.0 released in 1996, IE shipped with Win95 already supported SSL 2, then Win98SE shipped IE 4.01 if I remember correctly, and ... people were amazed. Ecommerce was all the rage, and boom, dot-com boom.)<p>But it&#x27;s hopefully done properly this time. :)<p>It&#x27;s the next logical step. There&#x27;s no rush to implement it, even if it&#x27;s nice and shiny.<p>Both Firefox and Chrome already has built-in support for DoH. So encrypted DNS is already getting taken care of.<p>There are an increasing number of providers to choose from: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;curl&#x2F;curl&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DNS-over-HTTPS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;curl&#x2F;curl&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DNS-over-HTTPS</a><p>And rolling your own is always an option.<p>Info leak, trust a 3rd party, invest your time, pick your poison :)<p>I think the infoleak is not that serious, because in most cases a passive observer will have the IPs you connect to, and currently it&#x27;s pretty easy to just enumerate the IPs of the &quot;top 1 million websites&quot; (I have no idea if anyone on Earth still uses the Alexa toolbar at all, or if it exists at all, but that list seems eternal somehow).<p>This is basically where the hiding in the noise strategy is made possible &quot;thanks&quot; to CDNs. If there are thousands of sites all hosted on a handful of IPs then correlating who views what is getting increasingly harder.<p>We shall see if this kind of slow but steady activism helps with government censorship on the long term or not.')
