It would require a significant increase in federal income&#x2F;FICA taxes.  And in the enormous portion of federal spending that Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid is, it doesn&#x27;t even include outpatient services&#x2F;medications for everyone over 65.<p>Of course, this would be mitigated by the elimination of health insurance premiums and other redundancies, but a federal taxpayer funded solution would result in a more transparent wealth transfer, whereas the employer sponsored tax deductible health insurance gimmick allows for better discrimination on who receives healthcare, and ideally reduces the amount of wealth transfer by reducing the healthcare many people receive.')
