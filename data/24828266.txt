The flavor profile was tweaked around the saccharin sweetener they had to use when it was introduced.<p>The flavor difference is on par with the difference between Coke and Pepsi: real and detectable, but all pretty much the same if you&#x27;re not paying attention. Especially since Tab no longer uses saccharin alone.')
