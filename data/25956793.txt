Item(by='egwor', descendants=None, kids=[25957188], score=None, time=1611925283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955927, text='The original parent is &#x27;This is worrying indeed because the negative reviews are clearly justified.&#x27;. I don&#x27;t agree with this and the thread explains why.<p>There are two issues to your comment:<p>1. Trading (including risk management) is really complicated. It isn&#x27;t something that you can pick up in 30 seconds after downloading an app. This exact scenario (where broker stops taking orders on a stock likely due to internal risk limits) is a great example of an unusual scenario that has to be risk managed. This isn&#x27;t some nose-upturned view but a fact.<p>2. Many of the comments here are made in good faith but it is pure speculation. 500K reviews were apparently posted and automatically removed. In any usual day we&#x27;d assume this was the usual spam. Again there&#x27;s speculation about why there were removed. My point here is that there needs to be time to actually find out what happened.')
