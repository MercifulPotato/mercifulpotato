Item(by='ronaldj', descendants=None, kids=[25997321], score=None, time=1612223789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25995094, text='Ford Fiesta owners got this awful Sync 2 system and a poorly designed transmission. When I purchased, the Sync system seemed like something I could deal with at the time. It aged poorly. It seems like it is getting slower, but that&#x27;s probably just in comparison to using newer systems with CarPlay.<p>I also have this added bug where sometimes (once every 6 months or so) the Sync system gets stuck on when I turn off my car and open the door. The screen goes off and the radio keeps playing. Only way to resolve it is to disconnect the battery.')
