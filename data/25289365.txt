To be clear, the ARM Macs are way more exciting than I expected, and I&#x27;ll probably buy one at some point.  I also do not think Moorhead&#x27;s Fortune article was perfect, but Gruber&#x27;s righteous indignation is grating.<p>These statements are pitted against each other, even though they are both very much true:<p>&gt; emulating or translating apps ... is necessarily going to be ... somewhat incompatible at best ... But Apple’s Rosetta 2 ... is a technical marvel.<p>He&#x27;s upset about this quote from Moorhead&#x27;s review:<p>&gt; there were some very positive things about the new laptop. The new M1 processor is impressive, but far from perfect — it has many warts<p>Moorhead perhaps punctuated this poorly, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that the warts refer to &quot;the new laptop&quot; in general, not just &quot;the new M1 processor&quot; in particular.  Yes, his problems are generally software related (although he cited fan noise as a complaint), but that&#x27;s a huge part of the product.  Lots of people would love to use an M1 Mac without macOS, including one particular Finn.<p>Gruber can say, &quot;There is no &#x27;Well, here’s the downside&#x27; with regard to the state of Apple Silicon,&quot; but that remains to be seen.  How much of the M1&#x27;s advantage is due to a trillion dollar company buying up every last bit of TSMC&#x27;s 5nm production capacity?  Can they scale the unified memory architecture much beyond 16 GB?  If they can, great; they&#x27;ve truly lapped the field.<p>&gt; There is no balance, if by balance, you’re looking for a story that says any PC hardware, ARM or x86, is competitive in any way with the M1 Macs for low-energy computing.<p>This review wasn&#x27;t about &quot;low-energy computing.&quot;  It was about using a new Mac as a replacement for an old Mac.  This is a real, shipping product, not a beta.  You can snicker at Moorhead&#x27;s Microsoft-centric workflow and choice of apps., but that&#x27;s his perspective.')
