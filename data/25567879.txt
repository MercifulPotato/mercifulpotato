I don&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s airborne, but that there isn&#x27;t much evidence to suggest vaccinating the elderly and first responders is the best way to stop the spread.<p>Fatalities, not infections.  Average age of death is in the high 70s or 80s, so vaccinating the elderly is definitely the best way to drop that particular metric.')
