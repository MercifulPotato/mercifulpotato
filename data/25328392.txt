Item(by='TedShiller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607303641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327493, text='An easy way to understand the M1 is that Apple simply &quot;iPhone-ized&quot; the PC (or the Mac). Instead of having the modular architecture that PCs are known for (motherboard with separate CPU, RAM, hard drive, GPU, and chips for ports etc), everything is mashed together. This gives the best performance but very little modularity and zero upgradability. It&#x27;s great for Apple but kind of shuts out all other ecosystems. It&#x27;s unlikely anything but macOS will ever run on M1 since Apple won&#x27;t open up the specs, and why should they? It is also another step into the direction of total throw-away culture.')
