That means that I will be unsupported through 2021 and won&#x27;t see the money until 2022, correct?<p>There is no &quot;don&#x27;t receive benefits&quot; anywhere. Everybody gets $12,000&#x2F;year every year in both cases. Then separately people who make more than $48,000&#x2F;year pay more than a total of $12,000&#x2F;year in taxes or phase outs.')
