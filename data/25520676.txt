If you&#x27;re willing to take lower salaries, lower your minimal salary requirements to receive more of them.<p>Dictating salary reqs up front does two things:<p>1. Reduces time wasted on folks or orgs that don&#x27;t want to pay your rate.<p>2. Immediately moves discussion away from a dance around salary to salary _negotiation_. Any good HR org that can&#x27;t meet your salary reqs and still wants you will try to compensate in other ways (stocks, RSUs, benefits, bonuses, etc).')
