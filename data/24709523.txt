You realize iphones since Xs forward are using A12+ chips, they don&#x27;t even have the intel &#x2F; T2 combo being talked about as far as I know. And then to get access you need to install a keylogger PHYSCIALLY into the macbook. All this is &quot;possible&quot;, but you can probably do a keylogger without breaking T2 and get equivalent access at the end of the day.')
