I&#x27;m the original author of that post.<p>&gt;  Insight, as an aggregated platform for comparison. It seems pretty obvious that the endgame of this product would be just another Amazon. Why would it turn out any differently for the &quot;curators&quot; on the Insight &quot;platform&quot;?<p>Perhaps some of the writing was unclear, but I just wanted to clarify that Insight the is not a centralized service. It&#x27;s an extensible mobile browser where you can choose as the user what the alternative services will be.<p>We suggest a few out of the box because we think that&#x27;s important to making extensions lower friction and easier to discover, but ultimately you can override them with your own choice.<p>I think this is important to give the user that power in client app, and our schema for extensions is expressible in JSON for interoperability.<p>Thanks for the comment and for pointing this out!')
