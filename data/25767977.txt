It kinda has to be as any gas which touches it will instantly condense to it or freeze to it. You then have a dual cryostat of liquid helium and liquid nitrogen cooling down the assembly (within the vacuum). The helium and nitrogen cryostat also have a vacuum shield. The nitrogen (liquid at 77K) is a sacraficial coolant which is far cheaper than liquid helium (liquid at 4K) that you need to get to these temperatures. Your&#x27;re right that thermal radiation is an issue so you have to be careful with the placement of any windows or mirrors around the device.<p>Souce. I have a PhD in physics where I used equipment cooled to 4K.')
