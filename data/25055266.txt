I live in an urban area, and people are quite concerned about the dropout rate (and more to the point that I think you&#x27;re trying to imply but are dancing around for your own reasons, the racial achievement gaps). But I guess we put a different spin on it: we are ashamed of it, we should be ashamed of it, and we bring it up a lot in political races and on billboards and in conversations about who to elect to the School Board. Have we been effective in fixing it? Not really. But it&#x27;s not because of propaganda purposes -- it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a hard problem that&#x27;s intertwined with questions of financial capital and stability and health care and justice and environment.<p>Anyhow, in the United States, all citizens have the vote, and an uneducated urban vote and an uneducated rural vote are both votes, though due to our unequal representation the rural vote is &#x27;worth&#x27; more.')
