One is to think about what the effect on the world would be if people follow one strategy over another.<p>The strategy of &quot;help those around you&quot; results in rich people who live in rich areas with multi-million-dollar-homes helping those that live in merely million dollar homes (because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s around). And if they venture too far geographically, they end up feeling alienated, apparently. Furthermore, these people, rather than taking the tremendous power of their wealth, do something &quot;with their own minds and hands&quot; - which is presumably serving some soup in a soup kitchen.<p>My observation is that it&#x27;s really unfortunate that many people feel the need for a personal connection, and therefore do less good than they could otherwise. My response is to ignore the ill-fitting kluge that is the evolution-installed software I have.<p>When you know that a $3 donation protects 2 people from malaria for about 3 years, can you really think you can do more good with your hands and mind than to just protect those people with $3 you have?<p>You can get your warm feeling of having done good through doing something, and then use your money to give to cost-effective charities regardless of how &quot;alienated&quot; that makes you feel.')
