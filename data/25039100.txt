You don&#x27;t have to (and in fact are generally discouraged to) offer end users a degree of flexibility that makes your life harder. To be especially clear about this: <i>do not mirror your DB schema in your GQL schema</i>; it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>But, even should you have to support a complex schema, the fine article showcases a number of great mitigations that cover basically every possible issue.<p>The only issue that I don&#x27;t think is covered here is that collecting all this data up and sending it all at once can sometimes be slow or even time out, and there&#x27;s no mechanism really to allow GraphQL to defer the collection of some fields until they&#x27;re ready. It&#x27;s coming very soon (in the form of @defer; to the spec, to graphql-js, to Relay, and to others) but it&#x27;s not quite here yet.')
