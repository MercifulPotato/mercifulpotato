But it doesn&#x27;t happen. At least, it doesn&#x27;t happen that much, and I would guess it happens much less in China than in the USA (though I&#x27;d be curious to see actual shrinkage numbers).<p>QR codes seem to have largely supplanted cash and credit cards in mainland China, whatever hypothetical downsides they might have. And the very limited hypothetical advantages of NFC (it&#x27;s unclear to me what they actually are, but let&#x27;s grant they exist) don&#x27;t compensate for the fact that an expensive terminal is needed, so NFC isn&#x27;t displacing QR codes in the near future.')
