Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=[25961207], score=None, time=1611941840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959519, text='I also have a cryptocurrency, it&#x27;s called IdiotCoin. Only a single idiot exists and I own it. It can be divided into 2^64-1 dolts. If you want to buy a dolt from me, the cost is one US cent, however, for every dolt purchased I will double the price of the next dolt.<p>So you see, the value of dolts will always exponentially increase, provided the US dollar doesn&#x27;t inflate even faster. This is great because it means that no matter when you purchase a dolt you are guaranteed to see the value double as soon as someone else buys a dolt from me. If you buy a dolt from someone else the price could of course be lower, and they&#x27;ll be giving you one hell of a deal!')
