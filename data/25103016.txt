Because 35mm film is generally to be considered a good bit higher resolution than 4K.<p>Or the noise properties of film grain, which is a separate issue from resolution? Which shows up some in well-lit conditions, but is even more obvious in nighttime shots? That&#x27;s certainly easy to add.<p>Or are you talking about lower-quality lenses (e.g. chromatic abberation), or focus issues?<p>Or something else? I don&#x27;t know at all what you mean by the &quot;aliasing and sharpening&quot; that you claim professional digital cameras perform. (Since we&#x27;re not talking about iPhone camera processing, but rather the cameras movies and broadcasters use.)')
