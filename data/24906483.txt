Item(by='Hokusai', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603799260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906165, text='&gt; Use of x.509 user certificates to access many government services online<p>You are right. That&#x27;s the part about &quot;easy tax collection system, and many other public technologies&quot;.<p>But, even in big cities, the people with money are technology uneducated. Many of them tried to move to tech before the dot-com bubble. But to move money from hosing to tech was the worse investment ever. 5 yeas later the tech stocks were worthless while housing was booming. Bad timing, but the result is that investors saw tech as too high risk, and hosing as a safe ever increasing investment.<p>&gt; Spain has also some of the poorest regions of Europe<p>That is true, but I do not see that as part of the problem. Madrid and Barcelona are in the top 5 metropolitan areas of Europe. There is limitless potential in that cities.<p>Mainly foreign investments is using that potential. That is the reason I moved to Sweden, I wanted to be closer to where the important decisions are taken. And Swedish companies are really kind on empowering employees, it is way worse with countries were top down management is more prevalent.<p>The poor regions are going to need help form the most developed ones. But, that is not possible if the economy of large cities is also based in tourism.<p>Remove London from the UK and you will see what I mean. The UK is a rich country, but it starts in London. Spain is poor because Madrid and Barcelona (and other big cities) are not using their citizens full potential.')
