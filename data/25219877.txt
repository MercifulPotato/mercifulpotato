It sounds dubious that a lot of engineers leave to work in Chinese startups.<p>Out of EDA companies that are in US, only Synopsys, and MG comes to mind.<p>MG is now Siemens, and they are now full tiers behind Synopsys, and Cadence, after their sale.<p>So no wonder of the exodus.<p>I heard a saying &quot;EDA industry is much like CAD software, but worse.&quot; People working on top tier EDAs need to be heads above their peers academically, know both tons of rarely going together disciplines like computer science, and process engineering, but they are also very poorly remunerated for their outstanding level of knowledge because the industry is so tiny.<p>And yes, I never saw a shortage of Western engineers working  in China, with them often calling themselves &quot;labour market refugees.&quot;<p>The West is set on to effectively exterminating whatever serious industries they have left, with loss of semiconductor manufacturing being the most glaring, and extreme example.<p>Some chips these days simply don&#x27;t have datasheets in English.')
