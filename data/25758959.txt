Whereas anybody I am sure in the big tech decision making on this was treating this as &quot;shouting fire in a theater&quot; <i>exception</i> to speech. I think it will be very harmful if the &quot;legitimate speech&quot; interpretation becomes the dominant view - in that case we are effectively setting a precedent here that inciting a riot to overturn your own government is  legitimate free speech.')
