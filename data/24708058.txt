Item(by='Spivak', descendants=None, kids=[24708427], score=None, time=1602078110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707588, text='&gt; We&#x27;ll have to waste brain cycles coming up and alternative spellings of methods to stay away from copyright infringement.<p>You do realize that if literally all you do is change the names and spellings then you&#x27;ll still be in violation of copyright, right? Translating a book into another language (where the names and spellings of every word are different) is still copyright infringement. The fact that the names and spellings are the same just provides evidence to the judge that copying occurred.<p>If you just rename all the methods and their argument variables you still open yourselves up to a lawsuit because all the plaintiff is going to do is show the judge a mapping between their and your names and it will be plain as day as to what happened.')
