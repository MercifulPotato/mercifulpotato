What you don’t want your text only receipt?!<p>So I reached out to a few of my users to figure out why they were flagging their receipt as spam... turns out they don’t differentiate between the “spam” button and the “delete” button. So really they just didn’t care to have their receipt (perfectly legit) and are clicking whatever button removes it.<p>The button could say “Launch Nukes” and if removes the message from their immediate view they’ll push it.')
