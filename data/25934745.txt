Modules&#x2F;namespaces support decomposition the same way that objects do, and historically they became popular because of and in tandem with object-oriented languages. So it&#x27;s true as others have pointed out that they can and do exist in other paradigms; I would argue that is evidence of the influence of OOP and the fact that its best ideas have been incorporated all over the place.')
