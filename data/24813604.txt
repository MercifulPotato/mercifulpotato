They&#x27;re generated via correlation of expenditure to 3rd and 5th grade reading and math scores. But if your argument is that increased school funding is an inefficient or even ineffective way to increase 3rd and 5th grade reading and math scores (or, more subtly, if you think those narrow measures aren&#x27;t durable through 12th grade) then the TCF study isn&#x27;t really a rebuttal to that argument at all, is it?')
