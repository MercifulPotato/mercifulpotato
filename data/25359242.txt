Just ask for a certain time to do feedback, prepare a list of things to talk about, and then in a private space candidly talk about them.<p>It&#x27;s one of the things that the Air Force expects its leaders to do, and I&#x27;ve always liked that. I&#x27;ve found people to generally be surprisingly willing to discuss topics on both sides of a feedback session.<p>Usual things to talk about would be expectations of what they&#x27;ll do at work and all the related tasks, their work performance &amp; what&#x27;s helping and hindering it, how they fit in to their work-center both professionally and emotionally (do they feel detached, are they getting along with folks?), if there are recommendations from them for the work-center and how to improve the system.<p>Depending, it can take 20 min or go on for hours. I&#x27;ve found feedback sessions like these to be very useful and productive though, and less awkward than some people assume.')
