I have no sympathy anymore for anyone in the coal industry except front line workers who are being hung out to dry. It&#x27;s Bob&#x27;s turn to be hung out to dry. He&#x27;s a terrible person (based on his actions, not just in the case of trying to prevent worker health claims but also wiping out pensioners of his company), and the evidence is very public.<p>I’m sorry for your friends and acquaintances. People care, it’s just always an uphill battle.')
