Curious what you’re seeing are the salary bands in competitive low-cost locations?<p>We’re currently most familiar with the bands in Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, and UAE. What we’re seeing there varies widely, but can probably be thought of as breaking down into two separate scales&#x2F;salary bands: those paid by local companies and by international companies sourcing talent in the region primarily for affordability, and those paid by international companies sourcing talent in the region primarily because they need strong engineers.<p>In the former, the band for junior engineers straight out of college with no work experience is ~$800-$1800&#x2F;month. In the latter, it’s $2500-$4500&#x2F;month. For senior engineers, in the former it’s around $5k&#x2F;month and in the latter it’s $6k-$10k&#x2F;month.<p>Of course startups sometimes seek strong talent but can’t afford the range, so they may pay on the lower end but make up for it with equity, career growth, etc.')
