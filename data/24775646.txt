So when my wife says she would like to watch something she&#x27;s been wanting to watch, and I look it up, I find that it <i>used</i> to be on Netflix but it&#x27;s not there anymore. It&#x27;s been like that for <i>every</i> movie she&#x27;s asked about.\nI&#x27;m wondering why having Netflix at all. It feels like a pointless waste of money, something my wife now keeps mentioning, and I&#x27;m very close to terminate the whole deal.<p>Netflix, you&#x27;re wasting my money. I&#x27;m not getting what I expected to get from you. I will be spend my money on something else than you.')
