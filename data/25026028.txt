It also would be nice to compare the production of proteins and carbohydrates, they may have a very different shield.<p>For carbohydrates, I think the best plants are potatoes and corn (IIRC wheat and rice have lower efficiency).<p>For proteins, the best plants are soy and chickpeas. They actually host bacteria to fix the nitrogen to produce the proteins.<p>Even for &quot;free&quot; electricity, there are many uses. Like making Aluminum or mining Bitcoins. (And there was a recent post about using the surplus of electricity to make metallic iron, and then burning the iron, but I&#x27;m not sure if it makes economic sense.) You can use the profits in a reforestation program to capture the CO2.')
