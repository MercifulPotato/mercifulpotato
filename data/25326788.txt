I see Jeff&#x27;s interpretation as more legalistic: this is the policy, while mine is based on practice: the policy isn&#x27;t enforced, and here&#x27;s what people actually do. And like I said, it brings me no joy to see that Jeff is lying to justify this.

I can show you raw data and you can draw your own conclusions no need to listen to me or my interpretation whatsoever.')
