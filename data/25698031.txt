We&#x27;ve been trying for YEARS to get net neutrality written into law for ISPs, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much of a leap to make for speech on Twitter.<p>The individual posters they suppress come and go - today it&#x27;s the Trump family, tomorrow, who could it be? Last summer, it was BLM.<p>The problem is that tech platforms have no financial incentive to not amplify inciting speech. They economically benefit from people staying enraged and in their bubbles. This is platforms shirking responsibility, and perpetuating the system that allowed Trumpism to thrive. Deplatforming Trump will not stamp out white supremacy, and it won&#x27;t improve the frustration of material conditions that are felt by working class people both left and right. If Twitter wanted to really make a difference in the world, they would stop selling user data and stop selling ads that earn them profit.')
