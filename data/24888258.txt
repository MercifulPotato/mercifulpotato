Note that most of the money sent, wasnt even touching venezuelan banking system, as most venezuelans already have US bank accounts, money was just moving from lets say argentina (common country for a venezuelan to immigrate) to US, not to venezuela<p>But transferwise decided that is better to block 20millions possible users in need of humanitarian help [4], because they didnt want to check if those users were in the OFAC list that is not even 100 people long.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;26h0u2W.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;26h0u2W.png</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;venezuela-related-sanctions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;venezuela-related-sanctions&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Venezuelan_refugee_crisis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Venezuelan_refugee_crisis</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disasterphilanthropy.org&#x2F;disaster&#x2F;venezuelan-refugee-crisis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disasterphilanthropy.org&#x2F;disaster&#x2F;venezuelan-refugee...</a>')
