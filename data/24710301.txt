I wonder what that&#x27;s for? Making it a bit harder to reset the clock and disconnect internet to work around time limits? Do they do game rentals on PlayStation?<p>It might be to keep the SSD storage alive if the unit is disconnected from power, correct me on this if I&#x27;m wrong but I think SSD&#x27;s can lose data when they lose power for a long period.')
