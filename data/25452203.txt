The internet says I have ”the sexiest job of the 21st century”, but I think my previous job was more enjoyable to brag about at birthday parties.<p>Hits way too close to home!<p>As a bullshit data scientist, I cry a little inside when people ask me what I do. Whilst I deeply miss academia for the same reasons in that post, I absolutely don&#x27;t regret leaving. I do however, regret quitting the bank&#x2F;quant job I got immediately after finishing my PhD. Was far more interesting, challenging, productive and way more useful than the absolute nonsense I typically work on now.')
