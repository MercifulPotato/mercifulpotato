These people give up the right to sick leave, workplace security, and supposedly career advancement. Personally, I only contract in the UK because there is little career advancement beyond being a senior engineer anyway, and the rate more than makes up for it. I&#x27;m a fairly middling engineer in London, I&#x27;m 24 and I made 120GBP last year (I just have to be content I&#x27;ll never make anything more than that).<p>You&#x27;re right in attributing the difference in pay to corporate culture in the USA. In the USA where a senior engineer at a Silicon Valley style company will be seen as a key part of building the product, as if they were a product manager.<p>At nearly all the companies I&#x27;ve worked for in London, engineering has played a subordinate role to product managers (who also stand the most to gain from a successful project). This subordinate nature often takes the form of siloed access to business data: where I frequently have to fight to run queries on PowerBI; or to sit in client meetings.')
