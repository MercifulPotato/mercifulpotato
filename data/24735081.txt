It&#x27;s to highlight that one doesn&#x27;t have to be very sophisticated to commit ad fraud (which is absolutely true). It also has some really odd ideas (e.g. they contacted the Chrome team to let them know about the existence of the stealth plugin in, and were surprised that the Chrome team said that the browser was working as intended so there was no action for them to take on their part... they similarly drew a false equivalence between defending account creation vs. defending click fraud). They also seemed to think that sites should be <i>blocking</i> bots, which is of course not what you want to do, because that provides a feedback loop to the fraudsters so that they can figure out how to overcome the measures. You want to proceed as if it is working, even let it show up in the ad campaign data at least initially, and as much as possible make corrections in ways that make it difficult to determine which traffic has been identified as fraud.')
