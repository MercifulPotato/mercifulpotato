It seems like it&#x27;s always some fame chasing YouTubers&#x2F;people who dont deserve being on the Trending list instead of actual cool videos and content. People are gaming the algo hardcore to make tens of millions for themselves. The James Charles &amp; Charli D&#x27;amelio entire crew of like 10 people who are always in the trending list, Soundcloud rappers, etc. Then, on the flipside, you have the YouTube algo punishing content creators and shadowbanning their videos of content YouTube doesn&#x27;t like, great example of this is any of the popular firearms channels. You&#x27;ll never see any of those in the Trending list despite them having millions of views.<p>Are you a LGBTQ makeup artist rapper who gives money away and plays Minecraft?
