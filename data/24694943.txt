The CEOs for example.  They permit the engineering management class to be mediocre-performing parasites, they don&#x27;t really understand how to measure their performance or the performance of the teams under them.<p>It&#x27;s the cluelessness of the top management that enables this horrible principle&#x2F;agent problem.  It&#x27;s as if you had a stock broker who would give you reports every month about how well he&#x27;s doing, but you aren&#x27;t capable of understanding whether your assets are increasing or decreasing, and you don&#x27;t know how to add up the numbers for yourself or care to learn how.  And it&#x27;s their own fault for, in tech organizations, not caring enough to be taught how to manage their managers better.<p>Note: it may even be that some things are difficult to measure, but I don&#x27;t see even a reasonable attempt to vet the engineering management class.<p>Another note: I&#x27;m not sure top leadership looks for any qualities in &quot;management&quot; other than &quot;seems like someone with a rough attitude that will push people hard&quot;, even if they&#x27;re pushing people hard without knowing what the people are even doing.  It&#x27;s a &quot;whip-holder&quot; role rather than any kind of attempt to make work more efficient.')
