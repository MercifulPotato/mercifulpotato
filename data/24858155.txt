If you were to start a business bringing in phones in bulk you would have to pay the import duty after transportation and logistics cost which would leave a negligible margin for you. It can only be viable if you choose not to pay the import duty in which case it&#x27;s smuggling (if you&#x27;re bringing in with intention to sell).')
