That is kind of you to ask.<p>I joined Ambrosia in late 2002 as part of a &#x27;sandwich degree&#x27; as we call it in the UK. I was doing a 4 year BSc in Computer Science, where the 3rd year was spent as a year in industry. For that I moved to upstate NY to work for Ambrosia. It was a dream for someone who had grown up modding EV (like so many here apparently!).<p>I returned to the UK and kept working for Ambrosia from the UK whilst finishing my studies and for a while after. Andrew offered me a role at Ambrosia and I _agonised_ about the decision as I loved the company but ultimately I was too afraid of moving to the US without an end date there. I often wonder if that was a mistake.<p>I then did freelance web dev for a couple of years, before going back to Uni to do a PhD in AI. I found out I was going to be a father, and freelance web dev wouldn&#x27;t cut it any more so I joined an SEO consultancy (Distilled), having taught myself a lot of that building small company websites.<p>In February of this year, the SaaS project I led at Distilled spun out as its own company SearchPilot (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchpilot.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchpilot.com&#x2F;</a>). I know SEO doesn&#x27;t have a great reputation on HN, but what I love about SearchPilot is it applies A&#x2F;B testing to SEO to remove the mystery, hand waving, and everything else. My focus is on the product and the network infrastructure side of things, but we are a small team so I get to do all sorts.<p>I do miss both the fun of working on games, and being part of the joy people would experience (as this thread shows). I also miss the AI research, as it was an interesting set of intellectual challenges.')
