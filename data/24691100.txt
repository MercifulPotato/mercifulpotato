Which due to things like leap years is impossible.<p>Just a small note, as we&#x27;re talking about assumptions, but this is clearly untrue. Consider - for decades, humans wore watches that knew the day of the month, but not the month - you were just expected to turn the day forward on the 1st day of months following non-31 day months. Similarly, we can imagine disposable cameras that ask the user for the current day on first use and simply assume leap years don&#x27;t exist, and require the user to correct the date for any leap years. You might call this a silly design, but systems often have to interact with external systems that have silly designs. I believe I actually owned a toy PDA (a device for a child, not an adult) that did not have a year back in the 2003 or so.')
