I&#x27;ve worked my way from zero a few times and now have some assets as I approach 40. Wealthy people see the poor as consumables thirsty for opportunity. Also while climbing the ladder there are tons of people who are just closeted sociopathic sadists who have no assets but just get off on manipulation. Another thing I learned was when the work gets to be worth over about $250,000 it&#x27;s hard to tell the difference between funded people with vision and trust fund kids that have disbursements over some interval if they are building something so they do not plan to succeed. They intend to use me as a therapist and prostitute while they grind it to zero and start again.<p>The only method I&#x27;ve found that works for transitioning class is to make rich people feel like they are missing out on something they can&#x27;t buy. Being an appropriately confident jerk that is willing to starve rather than give them an endless loop of scope creep. Charge more than even I think I am worth and when they tell me that&#x27;s too much politely tell them good luck. It cuts down on the noise of non-serious actors and makes people that want to be serious take note.<p>I barely have an inkling of how hard that would be if I wasn&#x27;t a white man with an abnormally deep voice. I&#x27;ve seen how women and people color are discounted and expected to be silent when speaking real truth and someone who sounds like what bossman thinks reflects them gets boosted without question.<p>What a mess. Glad you saw through the &quot;rules&quot; of the game and made it work for you. Cheers.')
