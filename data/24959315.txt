Item(by='knorker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604236862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959200, text='&gt; An easy litmus test: are you advocating harm to a person for merely existing in the world<p>This a dog whistle. Please define &quot;harm&quot;, and &quot;existing&quot;.<p>This phrase is so often used by people who say &quot;silence is violence&quot; (it&#x27;s literally not).<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being honest in your argument, here. You are implying lynchings and holocaust, but is that truly the debates you&#x27;re applying your litmus test on? I highly doubt that.<p>Are you not more likely to apply it to:<p>* trans women competing in sports with biological women<p>* abortion<p>* pronouns<p>* equality of outcome<p>right?<p>I&#x27;m not even saying I disagree with you on any of those points. But your &quot;litmus test&quot; allows you to point your finger where the harm is, and shut down debate, cancel the person, and &quot;punch a nazi&quot;.<p>And you also consider yourself as having monopoly on defining what pros and cons fall under &quot;harm&quot;, and &quot;existing&quot;.<p>E.g. if you define misusing pronouns to be harm, someone else could define compelled speach to be to surrender the right to your own thoughts (2+2=5, from 1984). Again, I am not saying I disagree with you on the point, but both sides here have a very good case for screaming &quot;harm!!!! I have harm here! Just for existing!!!&quot;.<p>Same with a trans woman competing with a biosex woman. &quot;Harm for just existing&quot; applies equally, actually, to both women. Now what? You&#x27;re just stuck screaming &quot;fascist!&quot; to each other. Why? What are you actually trying to accomplish?<p>You will <i>lose</i> people with this attitude, not gain them. See Sweden and Trump.<p>&gt; Then I have no interest in hearing your toxic and hateful opinion<p>I don&#x27;t think you know what &quot;hate&quot; means.<p>&gt; I sure hope you&#x27;ll be afraid to voice it around me.<p>So you&#x27;re admitting that your argument is based in threat of violence?')
