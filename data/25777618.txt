I know exactly what you mean when you say that it makes you feel alone even when you&#x27;re around people and that it saps all color from life. Recently, I have also made the connection to me moving around a lot as a kid. I think this might have subconsciously taught me that people come and go and so it&#x27;s not worth it to invest time and effort into building relationships with them. I was also an outcast in middle school and even though I didn&#x27;t really mind then I now believe that I built up a thick shell around myself during that time.<p>Can you say more about your efforts to be more forthcoming and open? I have tried that, but I&#x27;m constantly worried about oversharing. I have to consciously assure myself that I&#x27;m allowed to talk about myself. Part of the problem seems to be that I can&#x27;t help but feel like the people that I think of as good friends see me as more of an acquaintance.')
