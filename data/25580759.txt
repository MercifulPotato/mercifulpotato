If you look at Australia&#x27;s parliament, you&#x27;ll see that even though Labor and Liberal are the biggest party, they &#x27;only&#x27; make up 60% of the seats. That&#x27;s not really good, but it&#x27;s a far cry from Canada&#x27;s 82% (or the US&#x27;s 99%)<p>&gt; I would suggest you look at the actual examples in the wild<p>That&#x27;s a very good suggestion.
