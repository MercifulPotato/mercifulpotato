Most of the time we spend 80% of our time on things that dont matter and 20% on those that do.  The key is to get more focused on spending more of our allocated time on the things that matter and be compensated as such.  For example lets say you get paid $10&#x2F;hour but you are only productive 20% of the time thats a net loss of your time and company time of $8&#x2F;hr.  If we can convert that $8 to productive time we gain and the person gains as well.  This is the goal of Unlimited Salary.')
