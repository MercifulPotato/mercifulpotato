I did learn computer science though.<p>Same here, but they did toss me into the deep end and force me to prove myself.   I&#x27;ve always thought of higher education as more of a filter than a press.<p>&gt; CS has always been applied math as much as physics is.<p>Completely agree... I spent my college days taking courses that counted towards both a CS and Math degree.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  My favorite anecdote is making basic paint programs to flood fill the area of a shape... using CPU algorithms, filling a circle is only a few lines of assembler code while filling a triangle is a nightmare.  Using a GPU, triangles are native while converting a circle to a set of triangles is a nightmare.  CS has always been as much about physical hardware and operating systems as it is about software.')
