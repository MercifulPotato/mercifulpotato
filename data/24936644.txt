If someone who was known to be in Trump&#x27;s presence produced a journal entry from a third party, also known to be in Trump&#x27;s presence, saying, &quot;Dear Diary, Trump wore a full body costume today...&quot;, and you then said that the sourcing of the journal had been &quot;debunked&quot;, I&#x27;d expect something more than just the naked assertion that the journal was not legitimately sourced, with no serious investigation of the claims of the party producing it.<p>At least two recipients of emails from the laptop have confirmed their authenticity.  Now, maybe there&#x27;s still some forgery happening here, I don&#x27;t know.  But the idea that it&#x27;s made up from whole cloth is no longer plausible.<p>Can you point me to a specific sentence in the Greenwald piece that you think is &quot;debunked&quot;?')
