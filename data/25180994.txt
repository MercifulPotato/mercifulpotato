Item(by='jjcm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606078477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25180893, text=' &gt; “You need a color for errors, and a color for successes, and a color for warnings.” is not necessarily the only way to design errors, warnings, and successes.<p>It&#x27;s not the only way, but it is the best way. Straying too far from semantic meanings of colors can create confusion for users that expect a certain thing. Can you imagine if your bank had a two buttons - &quot;delete account&quot; and &quot;cancel&quot;, where the delete button was green and inviting and the cancel was red? Danger <i>should</i> be semantic if your app has any sort of high risk actions involved in it.<p>It&#x27;s fine if a game or a rss reader uses their own funky palette that shows off their brand, but any time you start handling money you should really stray away from that.')
