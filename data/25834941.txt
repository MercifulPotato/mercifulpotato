They don&#x27;t <i>really</i> out-compete, they just use their existing vendor lock-in to gain an advantage. And really, by using your dominance in one &quot;market&quot; to gain an advantage elsewhere ends up feeling like a bit of a grey area.<p>&gt; To add insult to injury, Amazon made the mistake of leveraging the ElasticSearch brand a few times too many in ways that just rub the ElasticSearch people the wrong way.<p>You&#x27;re phrasing this in a way like Amazon &quot;leveraging the ElasticSearch brand&quot; isn&#x27;t a trademark issue. Is &quot;leveraging the trademarks of another company&quot; suddenly okay (as long as you don&#x27;t do it &#x27;a few times too many&#x27;) as long as you&#x27;re Amazon? What if Amazon started selling smart thermostats by &quot;leveraging&quot; the Nest brand?')
