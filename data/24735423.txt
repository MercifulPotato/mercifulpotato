Note that Fly Maid did <i>not</i> charge them without their consent; they merely made the option available without them having to enter any CC info.<p>The reason I’m pressing this is because we’re talking about a YC alum + illegal behavior, which to my knowledge might even be a first.<p>Hopefully a lawyer might chime in with clarification. If Fly Maid was not authorized to utilize any of HomeJoy customers’ CC info during the course of business, regardless of acquisition, then this seems pretty clear cut.')
