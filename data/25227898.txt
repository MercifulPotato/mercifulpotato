If it had not been for the song  &quot;Under the boardwalk&quot; I&#x27;d have had no idea what that was referring to.  We call it a &quot;Pier&quot; round these parts. Taking Crosswalk as a reference, Boardwalk sounds like it should therefore refer to a place where you walk on some boards... such as where there are roadworks... or a wooden bridge... or outside the saloon in a Western.')
