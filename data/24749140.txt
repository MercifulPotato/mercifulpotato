Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602450719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746397, text='Matt Yglesias makes a great point about differing views of environmentalism in his new book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aei.org&#x2F;economics&#x2F;the-case-for-one-billion-americans-my-long-read-qa-with-matthew-yglesias" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aei.org&#x2F;economics&#x2F;the-case-for-one-billion-ameri...</a>.<p>&gt; The reason I say “eco-pessimist” rather than “environmentalist” is that to me if you’re an environmentalist, it means you’re somebody who takes environmental problems seriously. You are aware of the literature on the problems of air pollution. You’re not saying the Chinese made up climate change. I’m 100 percent on board with that. I think we need to take that seriously. I think we need to invest money in green electricity and in the electrification of our vehicle fleet. But I think if you are smart about environmental problems, you recognize that to resolve climate change, you either need a cataclysmic fall in living standards — and that’s not going to happen — or you need new technologies and a new technological paradigm.<p>&gt; Still, it is a fundamental difference in worldview. Some people are very driven by a pastoralist notion that we can conserve our way to solving the problem. A billion Americans is not about that. It is about a bigger, richer, more dynamic society.<p>I think nuclear is part of this difference in world view. Even if windmills and solar are part of the solution in the short term, that’s not going to be enough in the long term. You need keep increasing the amount of available energy. You’re not going to create a Star Trek society without investing in nuclear.')
