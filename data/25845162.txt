Blocking possibility of unistalling is just one example. Another is that it downloads new version of apps theought CC and does not remove old one. It also gets a lots of memory and storage for no particular reason.<p>But it is not only CC. I am asked once per some weeks if I want to remove Flash. I didn&#x27;t ask about showing these spammy popups. But Adobe knows better. The pop-up has two options: uninstall or remind later...<p>And if I don&#x27;t want to uninstall Flash? It seems it is not my decision what software is installed on my computer according to Adobe.')
