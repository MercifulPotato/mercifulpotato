Item(by='Uberphallus', descendants=None, kids=[25658767], score=None, time=1609938895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656986, text='&gt; Do you also think that introversion and extraversion are opinions shaped by the environment?<p>I don&#x27;t know how intro&#x2F;extroversion might be shaped or not by the environment, never gave that a thought.<p>&gt;  Does really bother you so much if so many people intrinsically prefer a different lifestyle than what you believe it to be the best, that you are basically willing to call them brainwashed by the environment?<p>I don&#x27;t get bothered by the comment, but rather by the implications. I just describe it: car over anything else, as an opinion, is largely a side effect of cheap-gas + city-sprawl approach to development, which is the archetype of urban unsustainability [0]. It&#x27;s no surprise that the US leads (along with Australia, guilty of the same sin) per capita fossil fuel consumption, close to an order of magnitude higher than the European average, and doubling Germany, the industrial powerhouse of the continent.<p>People in the US are car centric not unlike in North Korea they&#x27;re Juche-centric: it&#x27;s often (or always) the only option.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the same everywhere across Europe outside of strict city centers, just replace Walmart with a local shopping center (Spar, Aldi, Leclerc,...). If you&#x27;ll ever visit one, you&#x27;re guaranteed to find them packed with people.<p>Maybe we&#x27;ve lived in different parts of Europe? There&#x27;s like 2-4 levels of proximity in all major conglomerates (e.g. Carrefour &gt; Carrefour Market &gt; Carrefour Express, Monoprix &gt; Monop&#x27;, etc).<p>Even though the smaller the more expensive, they&#x27;re invariably cheaper than even just starting the car, and a no-brainer if you value your time at minimum wage.<p>Spar is largely just proximity shopping so I doubt you&#x27;ll see it crowded, Aldi is hard discount so they tend to just build big where it&#x27;s cheap (causing the problems you describe), and Leclerc has no proximity to my knowledge but has more central and bigger locations than Aldi.<p>Check locations of AhorraMás&#x2F;DIA in Spain, Carrefour in France, or Фора and Сильпо in Ukraine (or at least Kyiv), to name a few I&#x27;m familiar with. Every neighborhood has them, even residential ones, and you only need to go to a mall or a big hypermarket in exceptional cases.<p>The closest thing I can compare Walmart to, in Europe, is Auchan, with roughly the same ratio of supercenters&#x2F;hypermarkets to neighborhood stores (3:1). Interestingly, Auchan is losing money because as Europe becomes denser, people shop less and less at hypermarkets.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;scitable&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;library&#x2F;the-characteristics-causes-and-consequences-of-sprawling-103014747&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;scitable&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;library&#x2F;the-charac...</a>')
