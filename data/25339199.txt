As long as you support Ubuntu it&#x27;ll probably be good enough for most people. I say this as someone who doesn&#x27;t use Ubuntu, because I run Steam (and games) in an ubuntu:20.04 docker container precisely because of how many games and direct-from-manufacturer software equates &quot;supported on Linux&quot; with &quot;supported on Ubuntu&quot;.<p>(I don&#x27;t have any problems, and I get the benefit of compatibility, not cluttering my host OS with 32-bit libraries, and controlling what information the software can access from my system - no worry about it stealing my browser cookies, for example. The only problem is I have to use the Proton runtimes instead of the new &quot;Steam Linux Runtime&quot;, because the latter requires cgroups and thus would need a privileged container, but it&#x27;s very rare to find games that don&#x27;t work with Proton - recent examples I came across being Chip&#x27;s Challenge and Hardspace:Shipbreaker.)')
