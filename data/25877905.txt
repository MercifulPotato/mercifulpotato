Item(by='0x138d5', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611359523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25877654, text='&gt;I would personally love to see a &quot;web&quot; where you have to comment...as your public self. Post messages...as your public self (not just on an individual platform level). So on and so forth.<p>That&#x27;s Facebook though. And in my anecdotal experience the only reason most of my friends group has ever used Facebook is to post in private groups and events and use messenger. Scarcely any wall posts, very few posts in public groups. No opinions or politics whatsoever. Maybe the odd activist sharing some &quot;wear a mask&quot; message.<p>Those who engage in public discourse under their own names on the platform are by and large kind of ... strange.<p>Using your actual name for everything would be an amazing tool for building up a profile on you. Either you lay out your hobbies, interests and political standings for the whole world to see or you stop participating in those communities and discussions. And the profile won&#x27;t be about only you, but your employer as well. If a load of engineers at X start posting more about tech Y or methodology Z you can deduce internal workings from that.')
