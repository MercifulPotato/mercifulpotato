I&#x27;m mostly doing Nesper for myself, partly as a way to learn the ESP&#x2F;FreeRTOS libraries as I&#x27;m more familiar with the Arduino ones. However, I&#x27;d like to make it more approachable by adding some docs. One nice thing about Nim is that it provides much nicer API mechanisms that are easier to comprehend and document. Though the ESP-IDF docs are pretty comprehensive.')
