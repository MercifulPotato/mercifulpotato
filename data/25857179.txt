I think it might be a factoid that music listeners spread around because it makes us feel better about what seems like an irreversible movement in the industry (which benefits us, since we get to pay less money for music).<p>But in the end, if we want to incentivize artists to focus on making good music (as opposed to merch) we should probably be paying them for the music. That’s not to say we can will the current streaming trend out of existence (we can’t), but we shouldn’t necessarily let ourselves feel good about where this is going.')
