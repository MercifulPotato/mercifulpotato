In this measurement, the e&#x2F;m was proportional to the angle between the electron source and the detector. Dunnington asked his machinist to arbitrarily choose an angle around 340Â°. Only when the analysis was complete, and Dunnington was ready to publish a result, did he accurately measurethe hidden angle.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slac.stanford.edu&#x2F;econf&#x2F;C030908&#x2F;papers&#x2F;TUIT001.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slac.stanford.edu&#x2F;econf&#x2F;C030908&#x2F;papers&#x2F;TUIT001.p...</a>')
