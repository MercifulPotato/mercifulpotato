I was chatting to a Lexus dealer a couple of years ago and asked about the claimed 5.5l&#x2F;100km of the RX450h (SUV). He said &quot;the way our customers typically drive, it&#x27;s closer to 10l&#x2F;100km&quot;. If you drive like a grandpa you probably can get the claimed economy, but most people aren&#x27;t going to do that.')
