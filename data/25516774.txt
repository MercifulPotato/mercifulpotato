These are two quite simple concepts often overlooked in CS and emphasized even less in programming languages. Lattices are natural to CS in that any time you have an order or even any binary relation, that imposes some structure on your values, and knowing the&#x2F;solving for unique fixpoints (considering also continuity conditions) can be powerful, for instance the most general type of an expression, the &quot;final&quot; result of a recursive definition, infinite streams, final states of an imperative program and so on.<p>Seems to me that Flix would further blur the line between logic and functional programming (using what looks like some Prolog-esque search and datalog integration), amazing!')
