Companies would save money for training, and graduates would be ready for their jobs.<p>But in longer term, it is actually &quot;win&#x2F;lose&quot;, because if three years later the fashionable tools change, the companies that optimize for saving money on training would simply fire their existing employees and hire new graduates.<p>For the students, it is better to be the kind of person who understands the deep principles and can learn new tools as needed.<p>And the companies have a choice to either offer job trainings, or offer higher salaries to people currently working in other companies who already have the needed skills. (Or whine about market shortage and import H1B servants.)')
