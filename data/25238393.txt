Among all certs, only two that did help me somewhat were python and java certs. I learned python in the process and used it, learned new concepts in Java that still help me.<p>I don&#x27;t remember a thing about all others because I don&#x27;t use them at all anywhere. They look good on the CV but that&#x27;s about it.')
