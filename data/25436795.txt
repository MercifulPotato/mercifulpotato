The composition was good but they definitely looked like they were taken on a phone camera. Overall just very &quot;flat&quot;, no pop. There are some points where you can see the sky clips the image out and that scenario stresses a lot of cameras&#x27; sensors if not properly mitigated.<p>I would not be happy if these pictures were hanging on my wall.')
