They&#x27;re a side effect of experience, and the 10 years doing the job is the only way to properly get them.  The things I most often hear from potential employers when we ask what we should focus on more in teaching them are &quot;soft skills&quot; and &quot;troubleshooting&quot;. My response is now to ask which of the long list of technical skills we teach we should drop or reduce in favour of more soft skills (none) and to remind them that when they say they need employees who are good with team-mates and clients and good troubleshooters, what they&#x27;re describing is an employee with experience and I simply can&#x27;t generate that in a two-year program. Fundamentally, that part of the education is the on-the-job part, and it can&#x27;t be skipped.<p>We do work at those, but fundamentally, skills at (1) working well with a variety of people and (2) understanding systems and their interactions well enough to hypothesize and test for causes of faults are both things you can have more or less talent in, but they&#x27;re fundamentally skills that come as the result of substantial experience working with different people and working with complicated systems.<p>You probably can&#x27;t properly learn these without spending the ten years, but you <i>can</i> choose jobs and colleagues and experiences that will help you learn them better.  Better to focus on emulating how people learned these skills than trying to skip the hard part.')
