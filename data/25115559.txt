If their devs are 100% utilized (which I&#x27;m sure they are), then fixing any issue -- even a 30-min one -- is going to mean that a different issue is delayed.<p>This has not been my experience.<p>If you work at a company where it&#x27;s possible, I strongly suggest shadowing a supporter for a day. You&#x27;ll leave with a 5 page long rage-list of issues that weren&#x27;t adequately captured (and would take you a few minutes to knock out) and a new relationship established that will help unblock that bottleneck of information flow.<p>IME, this is in part because supporters aren&#x27;t as familiar with the technical aspects and don&#x27;t know how to frame the issues they encounter in a way that would get traction with either PMs or engineers. As such are not well prioritized relative to issues that are fleshed out technically. I&#x27;ve worked at a company where supporters were spending huge amounts of time resolving issues that I knocked out in 5 minutes after shadowing and materially improved their operational efficiency.<p>In a word, what&#x27;s missing is a culture of ownership.')
