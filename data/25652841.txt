And it’s not the last thing we should do, it’s economical today if you live in a mild climate. I installed one in my house a year ago. The initial cost was ~$500 over a similar gas water heater but it qualified for a $1000 rebate making it cheaper than a gas unit. Cost of heating is less than I used to pay for an old gas water heater. It might not make sense in a region with cold winters, but in a moderate region they make a lot of sense.')
