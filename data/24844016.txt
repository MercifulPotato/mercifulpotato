I&#x27;ve done a couple projects using Amazon Rekognition (and Google&#x27;s equivalent) to:<p>- automatically detect scene changes (cuts in the video)<p>- annotate the video with a transcription, and<p>- perform facial detection and image classification<p>With Rekognition alone; it&#x27;s entirely possible to give it a 1 hour home movie, and code up how you&#x27;d like your computer to generate a highlight reel for you. &quot;Show me everyone&#x27;s face at least once, prefer smiling faces. If there&#x27;s a gap of &gt;4 seconds without dialogue, cut it down to 4 seconds.&quot;')
