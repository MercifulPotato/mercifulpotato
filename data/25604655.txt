It is higher before major symptoms start (before it moves from UR to lungs), and so it goes down over time. You can be dying of COVID and test negative altogether if you’re fully past the initial stages (though you won’t be contagious, which is arguably the real point of the test). So a) a newer variant will definitely have a higher viral load on average just because people are more likely to be at an earlier stage in the infection cycle, especially if it is more transmissible, b) if a virus theoretically stays in the upper respiratory for the duration of the infection, it’ll have a higher average viral load while being less dangerous (in that sense, they are inversely correlated).')
