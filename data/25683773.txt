PR is a thing after all and using Spot fits perfectly.<p>I seriously doubt there&#x27;s any difficulty with safety or &quot;being good enough&quot;, as I&#x27;ve yet to see an application for Spot that couldn&#x27;t be done just as well by conventional already existing means.<p>BD is a group of enthusiasts that build cool robots, not a company that primarily develops robotic solutions.')
