That was the whole point of the end of the Obama admins shift to Asia strategy.<p>&gt; Just freaking get out of the Middle East already.<p>Troop levels are the same today as they were in 2020. And I also don&#x27;t think this is a novel idea, everyone wants out, but you have to do it in a way that doesn&#x27;t leave us in a worst situation than just staying, and that is ridiculously hard. Nature abhors a vacuum.<p>&gt; Globalization has not been good for the working and middle class.<p>This is a mixed bag. Look around and tell me that the general middle class American is worst off than they were in any other decade of modern America. We live safer, cleaner lives. What we don&#x27;t feel is security, which is a consequence of 40 years of treating the government as an entity that is the problem, and not an entity that can be the solution.')
