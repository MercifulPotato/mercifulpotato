Jaw started clicking at 8 and 20 years later I developed chronic pain. For the past 3 years I have seen Dr. after Dr. and every doctor dismissed my pain and gave me generic stretching&#x2F;exercise. I finally found a TMJ expert who create mouth inserts to extend your jaw forward for several months, followed by physical therapy and then a lip tie&#x2F;tongue tie procedure. The first day I wore my mouth inserts I could literally breathe better.')
