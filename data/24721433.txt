We need repetitions driving vehicles in order to operate them effectively.  If you don&#x27;t have enough repetitions driving a vehicle when something goes wrong you&#x27;re not going to be able to operate the vehicle at all.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;m skeptical that driverless vehicles can factor in all the ways in which someone might maliciously cause accidents or damage to these vehicles.  I want to see what happens when someone figures out how to provide false input to the sensors on the vehicle.')
