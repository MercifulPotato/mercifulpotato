Not cheap though!<p>If you’d like to reliably detect when someone is home (their phone is on wifi), you can dive into Homebridge. The plug-in you want is this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;homebridge-people" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;homebridge-people</a><p>With the homebridge-people plugin, you can expose an occupancy sensor in Homekit, and trigger a scene when everyone leaves the house, for example. Or the inverse, when someone arrives home. This is more reliable than the built in Homekit location based triggers, because those work with GPS. You don’t always want your lights turning on just because you drove past your house.  :)')
