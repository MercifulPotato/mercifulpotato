Why are people here so excited about this?<p>What I&#x27;ve gathered via osmosis here about Apple silicon is.\n1. It will only be in macs, you cant buy the chips or mobos to build your own machine.\n2. Theyre very energy efficient.\n3. Their performance is okish.<p>Doesnt really seems earth shattering.. Like, if they were a super low energy alternative to the duopoly of amd or intel, that would be pretty cool.\nBut if u buy a mac nowadays, its like a console with set stuff in it that u cant change or upgrade.. Now that stuff will be improved &#x2F; updated in newer macs, does that not happen regularly anyway?<p>EDIT:\nSeveral people saying the performance is amazing.. Can u link me to some benchmarks? The only numbers I can find are these.\n&quot;In Geekbench 5, the A14X yields a single-core score of 1,634 and rakes in 7,220 in the multi-core test.&quot;<p>These are very low scores, like, my desktop gets many times that.. My old work low&#x2F;mid level laptop from 4 years ago had 3000 single core and 11600 multi-core score.')
