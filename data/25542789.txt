Item(by='incrudible', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608982454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542603, text='&gt; It really isn&#x27;t, and failing to understand what a scientific paper is shows a crass and fundamental misunderstanding of what science is and how it works.<p>Again, you fail to differentiate between what things are in practice and what you think they <i>should be</i>. I agree with you on how things <i>should work</i>, but not how they actually work in practice.<p>All the actual science in the paper doesn&#x27;t matter to the outcome. When Boris Johnson goes in front of the public and claims that this virus &quot;might be 70% more contagious&quot; and that therefore more lockdowns and travel restrictions are needed, he&#x27;s drawing on papers like these.<p>If the paper just presented data and refrained from drawing scary conclusions like &quot;there will likely be a huge resurgence unless...&quot;, it would be a different matter. Notice all the weasel words such as &quot;likely&quot; or &quot;probably&quot;. It&#x27;s easy on the conscience to make poorly supported predictions by just adding some words that make the claims <i>technically</i> weaker.<p>&gt; It really isn&#x27;t, and it boggles the mind how easy you come up with conspiracy theories to find alternative explanations to obvious and undisputed facts.<p>You&#x27;re now diverting into strawmanning and baseless accusations. There is no conspiracy and I never claimed there was. There is human behavior, which is fundamentally <i>not</i> rational or scientific. One scary sentence in a paper has more impact than all the carefully aggregated data. Dramatic conclusions drawn from weak data make the headlines. This happens all the time and you must&#x27;ve noticed at some point yourself. If news headlines were based on fact, cancer would&#x27;ve been cured hundreds of times over, every year. It&#x27;s only when you look at the details that the data doesn&#x27;t hold up. Why would it be different for COVID-19, of all things?<p>&gt; In fact, you should think your assertions through. I mean, you&#x27;re somehow accusing a scientific paper of being rubber-stamped facts while at the same time complaining it&#x27;s propaganda? Come on.<p>There&#x27;s nothing mutually exclusive about something being &quot;scientific fact&quot; and &quot;a (de-facto) propaganda tool&quot;. For instance, there&#x27;s scientific data that shows that people of African descent have lower IQs than those of European descent. This data is being used for propaganda purposes by white supremacists. To the outcome, it just doesn&#x27;t matter how weak the data is or what the <i>intentions</i> of the authors were.')
