Item(by='petre', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610958213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812259, text='Great advice. I&#x27;ve also had a great experience with fast growing plants such as Limnobium Laevigatum and Sagittaria subulata in the mid&#x2F;backgroud of nano aquariums. Limnobium being a floating plant is easy to remove, no trimming required. It shades the rest of the aquarium, inhibits algae growth and biofilm because it uses up nutrients and grows like crazy. Sagittaria throws runners everywhere and will eventually fill up your aquarium if left uncontrolled. I cut runners in the foreground every time I change the water to give the other slower plans (crypts and dwarf hairgrass) a chance to grow.<p>I&#x27;ve used HCC without CO2 but it&#x27;s rather high maintenance and I don&#x27;t want to cut shrimp while trimming the carpet. If it&#x27;s not maintained regulary it it will peel off and start to float, creating a mess. Micranthemum tweediei &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; is probably a better carpeting plant choice than HCC for beginners. My other Iwagumi style aquarium that once had HCC now has a nice &quot;carpet&quot; of Cryptocoryne Parva after several years. It takes a lot of time to grow but it&#x27;s quite beautiful once established.')
