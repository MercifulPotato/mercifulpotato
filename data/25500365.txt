Nowhere did I say that racism is the &quot;only&quot; thing; please don&#x27;t put words in my mouth.  But it is, by and large, the root of the majority of the problem.<p>I&#x27;ve already spent more time than I care to on this topic, so I&#x27;m not going to go digging again, but if you look at studies around general police behavior (who they are interested in, who they detain, how long they detain them, stats around escalation, arrest vs. warning rates for same offense, etc.), it&#x27;s pretty clear that police target -- whether consciously or subconsciously -- non-white people, and black people in particular.  You can call that &quot;bias&quot; or &quot;prejudice&quot; or whatever you want; I call it racism.<p>But regardless, bottom line: black people are killed by police at a disproportionately large rate when compared to people of other races.  That is what the data shows, plain and simple.  I&#x27;m not really interested in quibbling over vague claims that racism has little or nothing to do with it, as that&#x27;s clearly false.  If you want an acknowledgement that racism isn&#x27;t 100% the entire picture, then sure, ok, fine.  (Though you don&#x27;t seem particularly interested in venturing forth any suggestions or data pointing to other causes, so I question your motives here.)  But racism is a huge contributor to these disparities.  If tomorrow we could magically eliminate racism from everyone&#x27;s mind, I guarantee you ant disparities would be so small as to not really garner anyone&#x27;s attention.<p>So here&#x27;s my question for you: what are those other non-racism causes of this disparity?  And if you can name some, do the causes of those causes not actually boil down to systemic racism in the end?')
