It certainly wasn&#x27;t the blue wave anybody thought it would be this year, nor in 2018.<p>One thing I&#x27;m not holding my breath for in 2022 is seeing the Democrats in the House leverage their decreased majority into a larger majority, or even retaining the House considering mid-terms are always a bad time to be a member of the President&#x27;s party. That, and after this past election there is a net increase in the number Republican trifecta States, an increase in the number of States under Republican Governors, and redistricting season will soon begin.')
