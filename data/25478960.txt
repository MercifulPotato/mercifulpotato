People are angry not just because the game was released buggy and unoptimized (although maybe standards are higher on consoles in this aspect). People are angry because they were promised a groundbreaking game, a landmark game, and got an unremarkable mix of Deus Ex and GTA. Except for raytracing, there&#x27;s nothing exceptional about this game. No new mechanics even.<p>I watched the disaster from sidelines, but what makes me angry is that the hype was so strong it made gamers fight each other, blame each other, and make excuses for the company. Gamers are not to blame for the game except for the fact they preordered. The deceptive behavior was rewarded and costs were recouped from preorders alone. Yes, CDPR is taking a reputation hit, but fans will believe what they want to believe.')
