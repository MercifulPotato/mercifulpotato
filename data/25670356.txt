Go for solutions that are built on Matrix or XMPP, the primary contenders in this space. Both are open networks with plenty of open-source software, public servers, paid hosting (i.e. you are not the product) and self-hosted options.<p>Personally I&#x27;m in the XMPP camp, and working on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snikket.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snikket.org&#x2F;</a> specifically as an alternative to WhatsApp and the other centralized services.')
