Item(by='erklik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609810163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640403, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t that their right?<p>That&#x27;s a great question. I don&#x27;t know if it is. Unless they are shareholders of the company (granted, many FTEs are shareholders), what is it that gives them the right to influence a company based on their own personal values?<p>&gt; Shouldn&#x27;t the people doing the work of the company get a say in that company&#x27;s future?<p>I mean if the outlook is for the company to continue to make profits. Sure. However, here, the profits are trumped by politics, and personal values. Why do the personal values of some employees get to decide&#x2F;influence the future of a company?<p>&gt; What if they like their co-workers and parts of Google, and want to use their (supposedly) meritocratically-won power to exercise control over the things that are close to them? That hardly seems like privilege to me.<p>It&#x27;s called compromise. I have stayed in jobs where I wasn&#x27;t paid enough but my manager was pretty awesome. I compromised.<p>Same for these employees. The &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; attitude stems from the fact that the &quot;contract&quot; implies a give and take relationship. The power granted to the employee is only if that employee continues to provide value. If they stop providing that value i.e. provide their skills and knowledge to work on projects that benefit the revenue of the company, then that power is gone.<p>It seems to me that the personal values at play here are redefining what people seem to think of this. Let&#x27;s pretend that the personal values were something else. Let&#x27;s say that I, an employee of Acme Company, refuse to work on any work that is not FOSS yet also want to continue to be paid by the company. That sort of thing would usually not be defensible. I believe that most people would side towards the employer in that scenario.<p>Why is that essentially the same situation i.e. Employee refuses to work on projects based on &quot;personal values&quot; is somehow acceptable?')
