You will need a calibrated mic, but result is you can do Sonos style adjustments to calibrate for a room on any set of speakers:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hifiberry.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;hifiberryos&#x2F;hifiberryos-room-equalisation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hifiberry.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;hifiberryos&#x2F;hifiberryos-room-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hifiberry.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;boards&#x2F;hifiberry-dac-dsp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hifiberry.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;boards&#x2F;hifiberry-dac-dsp&#x2F;</a><p>They maintain a list of supported microphones.<p>You can even bake the configuration into the HifiBerry DSP once done, it doesn&#x27;t need the Pi attached to apply the room correction. The included HifiBerry OS software has a setup process that makes calibrating the room with mic just as easy as the Sonos system.<p>I was huge into Sonos ecosystem, but recent actions with how they treated owners of earlier equipment have left me cold on it. This works forever once set, assuming you don&#x27;t move the speakers. Works with any old speaker&#x2F;amp combo you can output a phono&#x2F;optical signal to.<p>its purely opinion etc, but I am just as happy with results from this system with nice pair of bookshelf speakers as I was a pair of Sonos 1s, and it will work as long as the board lasts.<p>I am shocked hifiberryOS hasn&#x27;t found more fans, its really impressive for what it does for little money with a supported DSP. The hardest part of this is cloning an image to an SD card, rest is plug and play. You could eBay the calibration mic once done too.')
