Item(by='nwienert', descendants=None, kids=[24902628], score=None, time=1603739573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894132, text='I think there&#x27;s a difference between meta-drama and discussion of improving the algorithm itself to avoid meta-drama.<p>I&#x27;d actually honestly like to hear your reply on the proposals for flag rule changes. I think they would work, and would improve the discussion quality. We&#x27;d get more &quot;out of the box&quot; stuff - far left or right, but also just more out there ideas.<p>Finally - you spend a ton of time on the meta stuff. I read over a few pages there. You say often you don&#x27;t have time for it. Perhaps it&#x27;s time to try making some changes that would reduce the burden? And not ones that further lock it down, but instead add some transparency?<p>You guys already have vote brigading rules, flag brigading seems natural. Adding cost will improve the quality. Making vouches more precious would improve the quality.<p>Perhaps add a meta column to the topbar and direct&#x2F;move all meta discussions there? I know your reply will be &quot;this will only further it&quot; but I doubt it, they could then avoid the home page altogether.<p>Only trying to help here, but I think you&#x27;re now so meta-tired you&#x27;ve forgotten that meta discussion can be constructive and there&#x27;s perhaps really simple changes that would reduce a good chunk of these complains.<p>Final note - seems like a lot of the complaints are all going the same direction. Maybe they&#x27;re valid and not just drama.<p>Edit: let me reframe it in a way that may be helpful: if you could reply to <i>every</i> meta thread with a single link to a static page on HN, a small write up that included a changelog of the latest rule changes you&#x27;ve implemented, a clear policy enumerated, and a link to a &quot;meta&quot; area where you&#x27;d automatically move comments&#x2F;threads, you&#x27;d save yourself a ton of time going forward, and I think you&#x27;d gain a ton of positive goodwill on the site. You&#x27;d conquer the meme thats been building for years as well.')
