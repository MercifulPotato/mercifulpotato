Should this shared library expose an already built and purged css file?<p>Should each of our applications do its own purging? If so, how do I prevent the same m-1 to have two different values, one from the shared component library and another from my own application?<p>If I have to add node_modules&#x2F;my-library to the purge directories... Wouldn&#x27;t that still leave styles for components I might not be importing in my application?<p>Should I have a shared tailwind.config.js?<p>These are the things that worry me about using tailwind in a larger context than a small&#x2F;single project.')
