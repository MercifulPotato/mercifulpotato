How can one measure what is &#x27;worse&#x27;: having one&#x27;s DNS hacked vs any other service getting exploited?<p>What data does the machine contain? What credentials does the machine provide? What networks are the machine connected to? How much &#x27;value&#x27; does any of this data or network control have, or rather how much value would be lost if said data, device or network got hacked?<p>The measure of all of these things is context specific, and depends entirely on the exact circumstances for each particular exposed device.')
