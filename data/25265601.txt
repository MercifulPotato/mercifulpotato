During work I also help the kids get through their school day, so my workday gets a bit longer, then after that I have my own schooling in the evening, and then there&#x27;s no time left.  So I steal it from sleep time or else I get nothing at all.<p>Can&#x27;t tell you how much I look forward to 1) being done with OMSCS, and 2) the pandemic ending and the kids going back to in-person school.  Never going to complain about teacher salaries again (not that I really ever did, but still...)')
