I don&#x27;t think background checks should be allowed for employment or housing. Same as credit checks.<p>A person is either safe enough to be in society, or not. There should NEVER be an in between state. And before you say anything:<p>1. Yes I am fine with previously convicted murderers living in the same building as me. Teaching my children. And being my co-worker. I want to be able to trust the &quot;justice&quot; system to allow people back into society when they&#x27;re able to.<p>2. Yes I&#x27;m fine with sexual predators living in the same building as me. Teaching my children. And being my co-worker. For the same aforementioned reasons.<p>3. Yes. I&#x27;m fine with any person with any crime history that the courts and various other medical institutions have deemed that they can be a normal citizen to do what they want.<p>For the group of people that &quot;maybe they&#x27;re safe but we&#x27;re not sure but we don&#x27;t want to keep them in prison&quot;. Then you need to give them a very good stipend and let them live in relative peace. Also, don&#x27;t limit their housing. Housing limits should never be done. Think of this situation as a &quot;disability payment&quot;, because it is a state induced disability.<p>What someone did in the past shouldn&#x27;t matter to anyone if that person has been rehabilitated.')
