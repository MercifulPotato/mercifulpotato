I&#x27;ve had moments in life of similar grief and it always felt borderline absurd. What&#x27;s striking to me is that it makes you feel like not only is life going to shit at that moment, you&#x27;re not even allowed to be dignified as a person for a while. I get why it happens though, as I&#x27;ve made the same mistake to others. Cultural reflex, perhaps?<p>For me personally, the best interactions I ever had during those times were when people would talk to me like a normal person. Asking about things about the events themselves, the person, anything about the topic that came to mind like any curious person would. If it was too much, they were happy to move on of course. It was really nice.')
