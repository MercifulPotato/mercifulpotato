You just need some specially trained forces to have training for the 1% of situations.<p>I don&#x27;t think cops should carry guns on their person as a rule, either: I think they should stay locked in their cars, with paperwork to be filled out every time they unlock that lock. I think cops should be respectful of the public when possible, even if the public isn&#x27;t. We expect this out of retail employees, after all. There should be thought behind every single time a cop takes out a gun, before they grab it.')
