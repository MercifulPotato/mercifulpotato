So far he hasn&#x27;t been able to identify a single person who was arrested and active on Parler:<p>&gt; Do you know how many of the people arrested in connection with the Capitol invasion were active users of Parler? Zero. The planning was largely done on Facebook. This is all a bullshit pretext for silencing competitors on ideological grounds: just the start.<p>&gt; For those asking the basis for that last claim: I spent the weekend reporting on the removal of Parler from the internet, including reviewing lots of documents and interviewing people associated with the companies involved, including Parler.<p>&gt; The article will be up shortly.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348619731734028293" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348619731734028293</a><p>I would be more interested in hearing if all these prominent figures in the Capitol protests were active across multiple (or all) social media platforms, which often seems to be the case. If that is true, then it makes for an even stronger argument that Parler has been singled out.')
