Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=[25341267], score=None, time=1607395523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25340912, text='One, I think this cop will argue he <i>was</i> following basic gun safety, that he was authorized to use deadly force against anyone or anything in the house. I don&#x27;t think this cop was incompetent nor would his replacements be; I think he was doing what he was trained to do, and they&#x27;ll train his replacements the same. You&#x27;ve got to make his actions fireable, first. You can&#x27;t just wish they were.<p>Second, we won&#x27;t fire the cops who don&#x27;t follow basic gun safety - we will <i>at most</i> fire the ones who get caught on video as part of a story of national importance. This cop isn&#x27;t the one bad-trigger-discipline cop in that department, let alone the country. Fire him without figuring out how to systemically fire them all, and cops will dismiss it as politically-motivated persecution, have some protests about #BackTheBlue or maybe even a work stoppage, and then go back to business as usual, with the same trigger discipline.<p>And the fired cop will get a job in another department.<p>I agree you can have both. I just think you can&#x27;t have one without the other.')
