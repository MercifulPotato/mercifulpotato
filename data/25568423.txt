So in your case, it’s possible that if you get them to bed two hours earlier, they’ll just wake up earlier.  However, getting them to bed several hours earlier might work better. Ours are almost-3 and 5 and both sleep ~12 hours, but if they go to bed late will probably wake up early and things go to pot.<p>That said, I’ve zero idea how to switch sleep modes, sorry.<p>Our lifesaver was “healthy sleep habits, happy child” by Mark Weissbluth.')
