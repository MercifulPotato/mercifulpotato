He explained that they sent the second piece of large equipment primarily because of the re-dispatch problem.<p>If they get a second call which <i>would</i> require the engine, they didn’t want to risk having the fire personnel on scene in the little rescue truck and away from the engine, delaying response to the fire. (For the same reason, they wore the full turnout gear to support medical calls.)')
