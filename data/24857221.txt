It&#x27;s been MICROS~1&#x27;s primary tactic against competitors for at least 1&#x2F;3 of a century now and nothing has changed: now the company just _says_ it likes FOSS.<p>Does Windows set up dual-boot if Linux is installed first? Naw.<p>Does Windows read or write Linux filesystems? Naw.<p>Has MS open-sourced any significant or important parts of Windows where it won&#x27;t benefit directly? Naw.<p>It is in MS&#x27; direct interests if PowerShell or .NET are supported on other platforms; it makes them more credible tools.<p>Did we get source for Explorer or anything? Naw. Calculator. Big fat hairy deal.<p>Has MS open-sourced any obsolete products that might actually be of use or interest, such as the final versions of MS-DOS (25 years old) or Windows 9x? Naw. They contain things like Explorer and so on that are still used. Can&#x27;t go actually _helping_ people.<p>It&#x27;s all marketing flim-flam. Don&#x27;t believe the hype.<p>Linux is doing great on phones and servers and so on. On the desktop, only ChromeOS is not a rounding error. So, if MS can embrace-and-extend the Linux desktop, and make Win10 a better desktop Linux than Linux, then it helps MS and it helps Win10.<p>And with what it learns from that, it can apply to WSL in the datacentre and on Azure, where it can make Windows Server a better Kubernetes than Kubernetes.<p>Which, let&#x27;s face it, would not be all that hard.')
