Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612122570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980654, text='&gt; We have such an antiquated system that we can&#x27;t actually be confident who owns the stock at any point until you do some super-slow settlement process that takes two days[2].<p>We know who owns almost all the shares. It&#x27;s Cede &amp; Co. They own almost all the shares of all the publicly traded companies. But if you sell shares that aren&#x27;t owned by Cede &amp; Co, it takes longer to process them, because corporate transfer agents are sloooooow; supposed to deliver in T+2, but more like T+7.<p>My understanding is a brokerage is only allowed to lend your shares if you have a margin account; and possibly only if you have an open margin position. Of course, Robinhood pushes a margin account on everyone, and that turns purchases with unsettled cash into a margin position; apparently RH doesn&#x27;t allow that in cash accounts, even though most established brokers do.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m not sure why anybody would choose RH as a brokerage. They seem less reliable, their UX is bamboozling, most established brokerages charge the same $0 comissions and give more of the payment for order flow to clients, established brokerages (tend to) have much more excess capital on hand to meet increased collateral requirements, established brokerages can enable settings to limit risky (to the brokerage) trades in volitale stocks without blocking all trades, and RH is decidedly non-transparent.')
