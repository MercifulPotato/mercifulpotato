In a study of 30,000 people, enough people will get infected within a few months to give good statistics. At the current rate of confirmed cases in the US, you&#x27;d expect about 10 people in the study to get infected each day (fewer if half of them are vaccinated and the vaccine works).<p>Without a placebo group, how will you measure effectiveness and safety? You need to monitor a statistically equivalent group of people to determine the difference in rates of infection and disease, and to look for side-effects.')
