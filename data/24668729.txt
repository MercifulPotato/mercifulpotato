You&#x27;ve been a lot of fun to talk with, so thanks for that.<p>&gt; I guess my natural next question is, why do young people (to generalize) feel screwed over by our current economy?<p>If I were to guess, it&#x27;s probably because young people have experienced now not 1, but 2 major crises in their lifetime (2008, 2020).<p>Young people also have congregated to some of the most expensive metros in the US, and those localities have done a terrible job building enough housing to keep up with demand.<p>I think the collective angst is justified, but needs to be contextualized so that we don&#x27;t prescribe the wrong solutions.')
