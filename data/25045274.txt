Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605011831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045003, text='&gt; Twitter succeeded because (and I&#x27;m not au fait with the details of how exactly) they managed to onboard a lot of high profile users from a variety of different walks of life. Everybody else came to hear what they had to say.<p>I have to disagree with this. I originally joined Twitter in 2008. It started as a true social network. People joined to interact with their peers. Before the celebrities invaded. This is how Twitter initially caught on. It was actually fun back then. It later morphed into more of a &quot;news&quot; network, which is how Twitter describes itself now. But when the celebrities invaded, that&#x27;s when Twitter started to become a cesspool. It&#x27;s true that the celebrities made Twitter a huge &quot;success&quot;, but there would have been nothing in the first place without the initial social network. The celebrities invaded because the people were already there.')
