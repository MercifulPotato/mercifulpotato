Its like a nod of responsibility. Here, you are allowed both when you are considered an adult (18). That&#x27;s post high school. Students get to travel for free with public transport (either throughout the week or in the weekend, they have to pick either). How nice is that? Its great, unless you live in a rural area. Instead, kids here get proud when they get their first scooter (at age 16 when still at high school).<p>What you say about car freedom for rural life, sure. I wasn&#x27;t on about rural life though. I don&#x27;t know how good the public transport is in American cities (it is very good in Amsterdam, but also perhaps even better in say Berlin).<p>I&#x27;m curious about that (didn&#x27;t get to use it when I was in USA). I would guess that someone who lives in New York City who doesn&#x27;t own a car can rent one if they go to say Pennsylvania. But my guess would be, like in Amsterdam, they don&#x27;t need one when they reside in New York City.')
