If history has taught us anything via failed states, lassiez-faire governments, and the like  it&#x27;s that <i>power consolidates.</i> Soon people would band together, form factions&#x2F;tribes, and you&#x27;d be subject to <i>their</i> power.<p>Democracy kind of sucks in all of the obvious ways, but at least it&#x27;s actually possible and sort of works. This can&#x27;t be said for the delusional notion of living in your own little self-sufficient kingdom (in a world of over seven billion people, lol) where somehow you magically don&#x27;t have anybody exerting influence on you, ever.')
