Perhaps the difference is that I wasn&#x27;t studying in the US, but I don&#x27;t remember any grave epistemological chaos.<p>History is full of things that can&#x27;t be proven. We&#x27;ll never be able to know for sure if the (battleship) Maine was destroyed by Spanish sabotage or if it was simply a tragic accident. Or take for example, the question &quot;Did Germany start WWI&quot;. It sounds like a yes or no question, but the reality is far more complicated. Failure to understand this complication causes real problems (in this case WWII).<p>edit: removed American sabotage theory regarding the Maine, as it is rather unlikely.')
