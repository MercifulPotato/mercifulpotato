I was merely making a joke about that since they referenced that in their comment. They also mentioned:<p>&gt; the last LCD panel manufacturer in the US closed around then and we could no longer manufacture LCD for our military vehicles<p>Where did they say it was a good idea or a bad idea? Where did I say it was a bad idea? My reply was commenting specifically on the fact that the party he supports literally tried to manufacture the one item he was referring to and failed at it.<p>Maybe YOU&#x27;RE the one with little value added to this discussion other than getting triggered.<p>EDIT: Just to clarify - you seem to be only focusing on one part of my comment an interpreting exactly what you want to hear. Maybe take a step back and realize what&#x27;s important to you.')
