They clearly state the price. You either think what comes is worth it in the box or you don’t. They could exclude the power adapter while simultaneously increasing the price by $200 per unit. If people do not like it, they won’t buy it.<p>I don’t understand why there is this expectation that something is “owed” to the consumer market. If this was a bad decision on their part, and it drives a lot of consumers away from their products, it will show up in their sales numbers and they will course correct. Sort of how they did on their Mac keyboards.<p>My guess is that no one will care about the missing power adapter. I certainly don’t. If it increases their margin, good for them. If it is offsetting increased build expenses elsewhere, fine. But I would imagine $30 on a $1000 device doesn’t really move the needle for most buyers.')
