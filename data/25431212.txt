The whatsapp backend and protocol may have changed significantly to essentially just be a clone of open whisper systems.<p>The front end, however, remains significantly better on WhatsApp than on Signal.<p>I continue to use both daily, and as much as I loathe Facebook, I still prefer the UX on WhatsApp way more than Signal. That they look similar is more down to the fact that messengers today all look the same (look at facebook messenger, iMessage) than that WhatsApp has taken Signal&#x27;s front end. If anything, Signal is slowly trying to emulate WhatsApp features, in a more privacy-preserving way, which understandably takes time.')
