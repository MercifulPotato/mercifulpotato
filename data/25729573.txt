Instead of giving money&#x2F;help to a developing country, you should foster local industry by committing yourself to buy ten thousand gadgets produced locally. The local cleptrocat would have difficulties siphoning off the money as the products would need to be demonstrably produced. Then, once the gadgets are produced and people employed, you do not need to even export those gadgets, but just auction them off locally, so the gadgets end up as increase in local welfare. In the best case you may even make a small profit...<p>Of course, it is difficult to judge what the locals produce best, but somehow I still think that induced demand would be helpful, and better than just dumping the money there.')
