Asking you to list out all the risks is rhetorical because you can&#x27;t list your unknown unknowns.<p>I wasn&#x27;t challenging you to actually list them but to show you that you can&#x27;t claim the ability to weigh the risks against the benefits like you claimed since there might be risks you&#x27;re not accounting for.<p>So you might counter with &quot;well then by that logic we shouldn&#x27;t do anything for fear of the unknown unknowns&quot;<p>But to that I would say the difference here is you&#x27;re playing with an system of immeasurable feedback loops too complex for anyone to model.<p>What&#x27;s being introduced here is another feedback loop with no backsies, and what if we find out later we&#x27;ve made a catastrophic mistake?')
