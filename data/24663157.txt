I also use VSCode and DataGrip via snap w&#x2F; classic confinement, and all of these work flawlessly.<p>I also have Slack installed, with classic confinement. It had issues with clicking links causing a separate Firefox process to be launched, rather than re-using the one I already had open. This was resolved with a config change inside firefox (weirdly enough), and is a common issue. Otherwise, it works great.<p>Development tools like node and go, those are another story. NodeJS is officially distributed via snap, and appears to run relatively well in classic confinement, but I&#x27;ve also ran into some really strange issues where, for example, a node process starting a child node process either silently fails or takes multiple seconds to start up, which causes issues in our company&#x27;s testing framework. Go is not officially distributed, but is kept up to date by the community, but has major issues interfacing with VSCode (even though both VSCode and Go are in classic confinement!)<p>Overall, I really think Snap is a massive step forward in package management for linux. About 80% of applications I use are available there (versus maybe 40% on apt, 50% on apt if you include &quot;run these dozen commands to use our custom apt server because we derive pleasure from making life miserable for our users&quot; and 20% on flatpak). But, it has very obvious issues even non-technical users would see immediately. Hopefully they can work through them.')
