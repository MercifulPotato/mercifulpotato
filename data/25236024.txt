Where can you drive a car without taking a driving test and getting a license?<p>In the US, driving instruction is basic, and easy to pass and most people have long forgotten it. Trying to suggest they are &quot;Educated&quot; is ridiculous.<p>&gt; 30lb going 20mph bikes are absolutely a threat to pedestrians.<p>Absolute nonsense. The number of pedestrians injured each year by cyclists is tiny, likely zero most years. eBikes don&#x27;t change this because fundamentally. Cyclists (acoustic or electric) are much more alert than car drivers because if you aren&#x27;t alert on a bike you get smashed by someone in a car. Cyclists don&#x27;t hit pedestrians out of self preservation. Hit a pedestrian and it&#x27;s going to fucking hurt. People in cars hit pedestrians without even noticing.')
