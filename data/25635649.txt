I&#x27;d rank them 4 &gt; 6 &gt; 5 &gt; 3. 4 is clearly the best though, everything just seems to hit the perfect balance between simple fun and complexity, and the writing and character rpg elements made me want to play with different play styles. 6 is big, but I find myself getting bored in the middle game. 3 and 5 are just worse than 4 in essentially every way. All are fun though.')
