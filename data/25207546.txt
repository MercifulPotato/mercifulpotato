Item(by='bscphil', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606298033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204844, text='&gt; Agree to disagree on Big Sur, I love the new look. Keep in mind theyâ€™re calling it macOS 11, so there are probably bigger and less superficial changes down the road.<p>Agree. Hardcore Linux user (custom KDE theme) here, and I have to say that macOS 11 is <i>easily</i> the most aesthetically appealing desktop theme I&#x27;ve ever seen. Just completely mops the floor with everything else, especially the previous version of macOS. The changed margins &#x2F; white space are great, colors fantastic (eerily similar to the ones I use on KDE), perfect font rendering (as always), and I <i>really</i> love the changes to Finder.<p>In terms of actual usage I have quite a few issues, of course. Requires some heavy work with Karabiner and settings changes to make it usable, in my opinion, and you still can&#x27;t beat KDE because of its customizability. But in terms of pure visual appeal it&#x27;s unmatched. Apple&#x27;s visual design team is the best.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t use the App Store at all (at least as far as I can help it), nor do I really use any Mac specific apps (Photos, QuickTime, iTunes, etc) since this is a development machine, so a lot of rough edges are probably invisible to me.')
