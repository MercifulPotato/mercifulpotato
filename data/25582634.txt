Wal-Mart&#x27;s price sensitive nature and similar stores meant that most of what was offered was 10% less in price, but 30% less in quality &#x2F; how long it might last.<p>Now on Amazon everything is a race to the bottom on price and quality and, it is really hard to find something that is good quality and if you do ... someone is probably willing to sell you a fake.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten a few items I thought were fakes, and when I post a less than glowing review (not even mentioning my fake suspicions) I&#x27;m often contacted and offered a free product for removing my review.... I refuse to take these offers, but I wonder how many people do.<p>Rather than what I sort of expected, Wal-Mart trying to be Amazon... Amazon seems desperate to BE Wal-Mart...')
