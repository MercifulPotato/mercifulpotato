I think the foundations were a bigger deal when git was newer. Other DVCSes have decent foundations.<p>Going against git is an atrocious user interface (if it were good then [1] would be neither funny nor sad). Most people just memorise a few commands and if they stop working they transfer their changes elsewhere, delete the repo, and start again. Sometimes a team will have a “git expert” who has merely memorised a few more commands and is better able to get a repo out of a broken state. Git fails badly at an important for a developer tool: largely getting out of the way.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net&#x2F;</a>')
