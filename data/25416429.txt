Bulk foods (more properly called staple foods) do just fine in regular soil where ever they are being grown, and do so reasonably efficiently.<p>But for cucumbers, tomatoes and a whole pile of other veggies vertical farming quite probably will work just fine and cost competitive with normal greenhouses.<p>A vertical farm does not compete with in soil agriculture in  open air, it competes with greenhouses. Staple foods are an entirely different class of problem.<p>In IT terms: don&#x27;t complain that the more efficient CPU factory doesn&#x27;t make your memory faster, it isn&#x27;t meant to do that.')
