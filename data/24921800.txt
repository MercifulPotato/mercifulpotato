Where have you been since 2016? Democrats and media is pushing Twitter, YouTube and Facebook to increase censorship of right-wing viewpoints.<p>&gt;Also let&#x27;s not conflate social media (dumb-pipes for following anyone) with newspapers and cable &quot;news&quot; (editorial, selective).<p>Social media is exerting more and more editorial control and acting more like a publisher and not a platform. I get that there will always be some of standards that not every person will like (since those companies do not want their networks to be used for crime or spam, for example), but the way Twitter and Facebook shut down the Hunter Biden is insane and I don&#x27;t understand why nobody is not bothered by it.')
