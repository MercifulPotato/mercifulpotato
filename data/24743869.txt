With the election coming up, its in Trump&#x27;s interest to look tough on immigrants. H1Bs are easy targets, they don&#x27;t have any political rights, and a large number of them will likely never have those rights.<p>You can&#x27;t target family based immigrants because their families might already have been naturalized and have voting powers. The family GC recipients would also eventually get naturalized, and you don&#x27;t want to upset potential voter base (however, tiny it might be).<p>&gt; There has been no meaningful legislation changes to H-1B program in over two decades and I donâ€™t think that there is political capital to make those changes .<p>This makes it even better. You get to throw punches which makes you look tough, but also doesn&#x27;t really hurt the other side. Sort of win-win. Although I do think the other side in this is the H1B sponsoring employers and not the folks actually on H1B.')
