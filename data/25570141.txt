Dan agrees there is no essential complexity. On logs: &quot;this task ... is still nearly entirely accidental complexity&quot;. On query and plot: &quot;I think it&#x27;s unbelievable that essential complexity could have been more than 1% of the complexity I had to deal with&quot;.<p>Brooks claimed in No Silver Bullet that 2x programming productivity improvement is unlikely because now essential complexity dominates over accidential complexity. Dan is trying to demonstrate that it is completely untrue.')
