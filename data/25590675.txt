Leadership means that they make some of the tough decisions and fess up to them later.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with managers who only asked questions and let the team decide everything. The problem is that the team is generally already stretched really thin and isn&#x27;t really free (in terms of workload) or equipped to make decisions. When the manager essentially delegates all of the ugly and messy work to the team (i.e. decision-making) I end up wondering what they&#x27;re actually doing.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to ask and field questions about what everyone thinks about a subject in order to make decisions (and maybe that&#x27;s what you meant), but in my experience the second part rarely happens. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel overwhelmed with being asked a bunch of questions when I actually desire concrete guidance or direction. Granted that&#x27;s a case by case thing but I feel that managers who do the former aren&#x27;t that good at the latter in times of need.')
