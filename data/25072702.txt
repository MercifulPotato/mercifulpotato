Fedora always supports current release n and n-1.  There&#x27;s even a window when n-2 is still supported after a new n is released.<p>Even then you aren&#x27;t <i>forced</i> to update.  I work with a guy still running Fedora 29.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that personally but his machine still works fine and is rock solid stable.  Probably not the most secure though :-P')
