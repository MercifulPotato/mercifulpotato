The thing is everyone started creating an &quot;analytics platform&quot;, only that they just do it for money, thinking it&#x27;s really easy to implement and don&#x27;t care about the actual product, user experience or quality in general.<p>My point is, yes, the analytics market is crowded, but it&#x27;s mostly crowded by low-effort players or archaic products.
