I&#x27;m currently responsible for delivering technology platforms to ~180 data scientists.<p>I find the data scientist label misleading.<p>Roughly 70% of of the data scientists I&#x27;ve encountered are actually Excel analysts with little experience outside of a Windows desktop bar Facebook on a Mac. They&#x27;re unable to use basic software engineering tools such as git, vscode and python. Excel users and their managers are hostile to solutions that aren&#x27;t excel-like. They will fist-fight you if you restrict them from downloading and exploring data on their computer. Few understand their compliance&#x2F;legal obligations.<p>Another 20% are familiar with a wide range of tools - such as Matlab, R, Jupyter notebooks and various ML&#x2F;AI toolsets. As developers they&#x27;re unaware of the tech stack, short of &quot;I installed ananconda and it doesn&#x27;t work&quot; but are happy to work in the cloud and learn new tech. They understand PII requirements and memory&#x2F;cpu limits but don&#x27;t always demonstrate the latter in practice. Nonetheless they produce the bulk of your analysis, having studied classification, and reasonably cost efficient if you pair with a SWE.<p>The final 10% have mastered containers, venvs, wheels, cloud sdks and how to configure their software in environment independent way. They require help to achieve production quality but are great self-starters. Given enough time and support they&#x27;re able to quickly replicate this effort and teach others. As relative superstars they&#x27;re in high demand which makes capacity planning difficult. This pushes up their premium.<p>IMO the best data scientists are 1 in 10. Because we&#x27;re desperate for quality almost anyone can assume the title meaning the market open to new comers - you just need to be skilled in Excel (harder than it seems - most developers can learn a lot observing an analyst&#x2F;consultant use Excel).<p>To answer your question: No - you&#x27;re not too late. Just by posting here I expect you&#x27;ll be in the top 30% - an asset in demand.')
