Subtract current H2 percentage in the system and multiply the result with network throughout (plus storage headroom). That&#x27;s quite a lot slack to pick up before running out of storage for regenerative H2 production.<p>Sure, those 6% are a local maximum which further limits how much a hypothetical production point could push into the network, but that&#x27;d be more of a tactical problem (where to deploy the tech) than a universal limitation. And a solvable one, because the inputs to the conversion are quite transferable.')
