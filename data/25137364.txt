A drop in app fees by 15% is a <i>substantial</i> win, and the reason that drop happened is because Apple is now scared of critics, bad PR, and how that might impact future legislation against them.<p>The number of hot takes I was seeing about how the Apple&#x2F;Epic fight benefited literally no one and it was just two companies arguing about who got to take all the money... it&#x27;s very clear from this program that the overall pressure on Apple has been making a difference.<p>It&#x27;s not so large a difference that devs should now stop fighting for better terms, but it&#x27;s positive to see Apple at least partially show signs of cracking, or at least acknowledge on some level that they&#x27;re frightened about the potential outcome of this fight. And there are a lot of small devs who are going to be making a lot more money just because of this minor victory.')
