Item(by='gavinray', descendants=None, kids=[25277985, 25278227], score=None, time=1606926099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277337, text='I have mild moral qualms with killing and eating animals (treat others the way you want to be treated).<p>But unfortunately, meat protein has some of the highest biological value, outside of egg whites&#x2F;whey&#x2F;dairy proteins.<p>When you factor in how cheap low-grade meat is, it winds up being incredibly economical to just eat a bunch of $2&#x2F;lb chicken and whatnot. Especially if you&#x27;re trying to eat upwards of 200-250g of protein a day, it gets expensive fast.<p>So I have sort of accepted this hypocritical double-standard, where I recognize that what I am doing is not entirely ethical but at the same time it&#x27;s too practical for me to give up. Plus, I love meat.<p>Lab-grown meat at somewhere near the price of regular meat has been a dream for me because then I get to have my cake and eat it too. Don&#x27;t have to give up meat, or try to substitute non-meat proteins for it, and no actual sentient being has to suffer and die in order for me to continue doing so.<p>Huge win-win, can&#x27;t come soon enough.<p>I would eat the plant-based stuff if someone could prove comparable biological value and the price was the same or only marginally higher, too.<p>I really don&#x27;t care, as long as it tastes (doesn&#x27;t even have to look) like meat, and the bodily effects are identical.')
