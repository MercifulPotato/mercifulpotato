(For that matter we should have taken strong steps before Thanksgiving weekend.)<p>It is extremely unfortunate that this is hammering small businesses; if the US had responsible federal leadership (if the Senate &amp; White House hadn’t just sat on their hands for 7 months) we could do something about this (fingers crossed for January), but counties and even states have limited ability to provide large-scale relief of the type required.<p>But waiting to impose the same restrictions until the state mandates kick in, if inaction results in cases continuing to rise along their current trajectory, will lead to even larger economic devastation than decisive action a few weeks sooner.')
