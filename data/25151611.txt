This telescope is one of the very few which transmits radio waves as well as receiving them.   The transmitters are used for radar mapping of solar system objects, as well as ionospheric research.   Reproducing this instrument in space would probably cost as much as the ISS.   It would be a Large Hadron Collider class investment.')
