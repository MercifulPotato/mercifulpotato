There are many, myself included who required this in portable form for many years previous to that. (My use case was GNS3 and EVE-NG labs when I&#x27;m out and about and internet was patchy)<p>I reached out to G Screen in 2010 with funds ready to purchase their dual screen laptop prototype and unfortunately wasn&#x27;t able to.<p>I made my first quite basic prototype a little while afterwards.<p>When Project Valerie was announced I thought at last I can now buy the dream - alas it wasn&#x27;t available - so I just doubled down on my prototypes.<p>I have personally and professionally had a need for more portable screen real estate since at least 2005.<p>Also you are definitely mistaken - No one cares what the engineers toolbox looks like as long as the engineer GETS THE JOB DONE in a timely effective manor. Those are  literally the only metrics that matter.<p>Some people are more effective with a 1 screen laptop. Some prefer n screens. Bottom line is I am more effective and can react to anomalies faster if I can view multiple infrastructure monitoring tools without the constant tedious minimising and maximising especially when at customer sites or at the data center.<p>Some people don&#x27;t mind balancing a laptop in one hand while tapping on the keyboard when resolving issues in a comms cabinet - I prefer using my TeenySERV Duo.<p>My &quot;tools&quot; are also personally fine tuned to my other particular use cases. (Granted my professional workload is a little extreme)<p>Note that we also have other prototypes with less screens for individuals with different use cases.<p>Imagine my surprise using my prototypes and being told by multiple people that they want it &quot;yesterday&quot; for their professional and personal use cases.<p>Our company inbox is literally overflowing with people trying to acquire the 7 Screen prototype in stark contrast with your world view.<p>The demand and diversity of these individuals, digital nomads, CEOs&#x2F;Executives, lay people, finance specialists, content creators, developers, film studios did initially surprise me but it does make clear that they aren&#x27;t concerned with your envisaged &quot;social implications&quot;<p>With the greatest of respect I think that your envisioned &quot;social norms&quot; don&#x27;t quite resonate with the general direction or actual norms for laptops in 2020 or going forward in this particular instance.<p>I predict the trend will steer towards Multi screen laptops, laptops with rollable&#x2F;foldable displays and finally augmented reality headsets capable of projecting very high resolution content directly into the viewers eyes simulating a multi monitor setup. (Some of these are already available and being actively developed in 2020 already...)')
