I think there were some hints of it evolving in the early 2000s, but when facebook blew up it just sucked ALL the air out of the room and forums and blogs all got stuck in 2009.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but again I have to ask the question: Are those conveniences actually <i>worth</i> the harm we see from aggressive narrow ad targeting&#x2F;tracking, as well as the issues mentioned here around parasitic viral memes, that make things like facebook even viable as businesses?<p>This is an evaluation we are allowed to make, and it&#x27;s not a foregone conclusion that just because people can build these things they have a place in our society.')
