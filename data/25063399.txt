Let&#x27;s say storing the data compressed, but reading it back uncompressed. This could effectively be transparent to the host CPU, but handled by the FPGA.<p>The more that I think about it, this data flow sounds significantly more reasonable than asynchronously processing data. Then you could still read &#x2F; transform &#x2F; write the new data to the SSD, but you&#x27;d limit the main CPU to only sending the read&#x2F;write IO, instead of the transparent transformation.')
