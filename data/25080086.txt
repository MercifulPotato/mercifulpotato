This was conspicuously absent from all discussions I&#x27;ve read.)<p>It&#x27;s absent because RIAA&#x27;s intent is not stated. They did a blanket takedown, unprompted. As far as I can tell they never requested any particular modification. IIRC the only hint that it might be related is a mention that the rolling cipher algorithm that YouTube-dl &quot;circumvents&quot; was ruled to be DRM under German law.<p>However, the bulk of the DMCA seems to be leveled at the marketing of ytdl as a circumvention tool, citing unit tests containing metadata referencing RIAA-owned content (unit tests, apparently, are now part of &#x27;marketing,&#x27; I guess.)')
