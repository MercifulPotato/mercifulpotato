It&#x27;s very true, and has a lot of local rendering which at the time of X terminals was a bit of a pipe dream. They could just locally render some things like fonts.<p>Sun also tried to get into this game early with the JavaStations. But they were ridiculously slow, so painful to use. In fact they kind of ruined Java for me. I was learning it at the time, and we got a JavaStation on loan from somewhere. Working on it just established this &quot;Java = slow&quot; feeling in my head and really put me off so much I went to do other things.<p>Of course this wasn&#x27;t really deserved, and Java has gone on to become powerful (though I still consider its poor intra-version compatibility an issue). But I&#x27;ve never been able to quite shake that feeling.')
