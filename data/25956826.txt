But after reaching it&#x27;s endgame (around mid-tweenties) it&#x27;s not growing in size or complexity. Companies and cancer are different in that regard. Cancer is growing without aim and purpose for the host. Companies are similar, though not in all cases. Small companies need to grow to a point were they are safe to survive any little problem. Big companies sometimes reach a point of stability, and maintain their size for a long time. But in other times they grow and grow and grow without any real aim, just for the aim of growing and doing something.<p>The result is that you have companies playing on many fields, delivering low quality for the customer, but often still impacting the market because of their sheer size and market-power on other fields. It is indeed disputable whether this behaviour is really justified and good on for the customer, or more harmful.')
