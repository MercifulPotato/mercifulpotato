Most of the money in the markets are from the average Joe&#x27;s 401k, or pension. Wealthy people put their wealth to work in private equity, or venture capital.<p>I am just disgusted at how incompetent people are, and how they reiterate what they heard from CNN, Foxnews, or morons like Ron Paul.<p>Now, Banks, and Funds manage large amounts of cash, but again, Pensions and 401k&#x27;s make up the most of it.')
