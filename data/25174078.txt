Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606008343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173783, text='&gt; As the vote count currently stands he’s going to be the president<p>Actually the president is not chosen by the popular vote. You may not like how our democracy chooses presidents but that doesn&#x27;t change facts.<p>&gt; There’s no reason to think the vote totals are going to change. In 2016, Trump was also referred to as president elect at this point.<p>In 2016 the other contestant had conceded.<p>&gt; Or were you very careful to correct anyone that said Trump had won in 2016 and pointed out that it wasn’t actually decided until the election was certified?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I asked what makes him President-elect. Do you have an answer?<p>&gt; Trump has been claiming massive voter fraud with no evidence since 2016<p>What kind of evidence would you accept?<p>&gt; He started claiming it a day after the election and has yet to produce any evidence.<p>Videos of ballot fraud and sworn affidavits are evidence.<p>&gt; While every Secretary of State says there’s no evidence of massive voter fraud. And pointing this out and that trumps claims are baseless, which is all purely factual, has somehow become biased.<p>The bias is insisting that there is no evidence when there is evidence.')
