Sydney, Australia for reference - our data costs are relatively low at about 0.68 USD per GB (down from 1 USD or so last year if I were to guess). When I&#x27;ve looked around on packed trains in the past, about a third of the occupants were watching YouTube or Netflix (very rough estimate). Although obviously this strongly depends on where you are - for instance, when I was living in Japan, most people would be either playing games or reading news.<p>&gt;revealing that it&#x27;s pre-downloaded<p>Sure, but is because that&#x27;s the way the prefer it, or is it a workaround that they&#x27;ve resorted to due to high data costs? Behaviour is a symptom of circumstance just as much as it is of desire, if that makes sense.<p>The argument I&#x27;m trying to make is that it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s no demand, it&#x27;s that the low supply results in people pursuing lower cost&#x2F;higher effort alternatives.<p>Edit: But I&#x27;m not trying to say you&#x27;re wrong. It&#x27;s definitely interesting to hear what happens in the Netherlands and Germany. I appreciate your input.')
