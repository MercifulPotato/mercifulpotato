Point me to information which exists without being encoded in physical phenomena. All information we&#x27;ve ever encountered exists in the form of specific configurations of matter and energy, and is therefore tangible, just as a house or a car is. It is just <i>barely</i> tangible, since there are many more physical configurations which can reasonably encode information than there are physical configurations corresponding to a usable car.<p>The term scarcity as usually applied to information is also somewhat problematic because it is not applied consistently between &quot;physical&quot; goods and information. Yes, the fact is that information is easy to copy because it is easily encodeable in a wider range of physical configurations. But we cannot reasonably ignore the effort required to produce it if we want to make a fair comparison. The quality we are interested in is how hard it is to obtain, to <i>have</i> something in the first place, not just whether it is easy to copy. Code is easy to copy, but is hard to produce, and hence I would argue it is still a scarce resource in this sense.<p>&gt; My use of a physical good inherently inhibits your use.<p>Not if you first make your own copy of the physical good, the same way you do with information. You said it yourself: you can use your <i>copy</i> of the software without inhibiting someone&#x27;s simultaneous use. It&#x27;s just that information has the boon and burden of being easily copyable once you&#x27;ve initially obtained it.')
