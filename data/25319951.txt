It also makes handling the various setups completely independent. There can’t be some left-over state from the previous resolution setting that interferes With how the current setting works.<p>It also might be a left-over from CRT days, when the hardware couldn’t seamlessly switch to a different clock frequency, and doing the full restart on the software side didn’t make much of a difference (yes, lots of hardware could switch horizontal resolutions even on a line by line basis, but that, AFAIK, always was on the same number of vertical lines and frames&#x2F;second, and, using ratios between horizontal resolutions with small denominators such as ½ or ¼.<p>This is one of those things where it takes a company like Apple to not only notice that can be improved, but also decide it’s worth spending resource on.')
