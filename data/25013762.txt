These states had the same candidate winning by 130K+, 300K+ and 700K+ votes respectively. It&#x27;s remarkable that at about 4AM in Nov 4, WI and MI reported just enough votes to change the outcome of the election.<p>And there is evidence of people that was prevented from observing the vote count, and apparently some observers were kept so far away that they had to use binoculars to observe.')
