We all bring different baggage to every attempt to speak and listen. It&#x27;s probably ~impossible once you mix in uncharitable readers&#x2F;listeners.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for the campaigners, but I suspect &quot;reform the police&quot; won&#x27;t cut the mustard for them because it&#x27;s the sort of thing the establishment says before it fails to deliver meaningful change.  &quot;Today I&#x27;m calling for the establishment of a bipartisan commission on police reform&quot;, and its short imperative slogan--&quot;reform the police&quot;--<i>could</i> be an inspiring message if people had the impression that is how the gears sound when they&#x27;re spinning up to change something.<p>But it&#x27;s not very fair to insist people should be chanting a demand that seems to translate to &quot;promise to look busy for a few months so that we&#x27;ll go home and hope we don&#x27;t notice when you don&#x27;t solve the problem.&quot;')
