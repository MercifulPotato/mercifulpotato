Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604962933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25040398, text='I don’t think there would be a legal way to codify access to truth that wouldn’t also enable disastrous side effects. Such a law would potentially <i>endanger</i> rather than protect journalists, whose work could potentially be scrutinized for truthfulness in order to determine whether they qualify for protection; implicitly, should they fail that scrutiny, however biased... they would presumably be less protected than under broader laws that protect journalists (or just human life) generally.<p>That said, law isn’t the only framework to understand rights. I think it’s reasonable to say that we’re morally entitled to access to the truth. It doesn’t have the same force as law, but it doesn’t carry the same risks either.<p>All of that said, since you’re new to the realization that truth telling is a mortal risk... welcome. It’s not warm here, but it’s important to know. For what it’s worth, there’s a long ugly history of persecution of truth. It’s present in the history of major religion and major political strains.<p>I have many misgivings referencing this particular news outlet generally, but if you want to learn more about the dangers faced by journalists, Democracy Now is a great resource for that.')
