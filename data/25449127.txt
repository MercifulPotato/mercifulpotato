Item(by='matrixagent', descendants=None, kids=[25449237], score=None, time=1608154828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448546, text='&gt; If you&#x27;re not going to do the work to figure out what the corruption is â€¦<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but last time I checked neither Apple nor ABBYY pay my salary. I really don&#x27;t understand these takes. If Apple or ABBYY want my PDFs, they should be able to find my email address rather easily. Your tl;dr version of the post is completely unfair. I publicly criticize Apple because they are breaking something that potentially affects a lot of people who are unlikely to even know about it, and they are doing it for at least the second time now. If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s worthy of criticism, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>I also love how so many people assume I didn&#x27;t already talk to support and file radars. I guess you had better luck in the past than me, but I can assure you, these options aren&#x27;t always as useful as you might think they are.')
