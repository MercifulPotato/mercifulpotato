I watch Formula E, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine it becoming the pinnacle of motorsport anytime soon.<p>Formula E&#x27;s definitely made progress: e.g. they no longer have to run two separate cars just to finish the race, and they are decently quick. But they&#x27;re still pretty far away in other aspects: 45 minute race, on temporary circuits purposefully designed with many tight turns to allow for braking regen. Battery technology has to improve quite a bit if you want to see electric cars turning laps at Spa at standard race distances.')
