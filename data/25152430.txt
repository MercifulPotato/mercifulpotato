Thus, it wouldn&#x27;t really cover much ground even thought it might travel quite a bit vertically.<p>If we consider the reason one wants to travel at supersonic speeds, we might arrive at something involving the value of a human&#x27;s time.  Given that, slow but ultra efficient, luxurious (and internet-connected - &quot;workable&quot;) travel might be something.
