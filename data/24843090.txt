Dual Stack is still in alpha, and that didn&#x27;t appear until a really recent release (1.16).<p>I think routers and switches are probably the easier pieces of the puzzle, at least as far as managing them goes.  The vendors have worked out all the kinks (hopefully?) before the equipment gets to you.<p>That&#x27;s just to get the stuff to work. Then you have corporate&#x2F;government policies and validation.  Then you have to solve problems like &quot;My VM resolves things to IPv6 by default, but I have no IPv6 gateway so everything times out&quot;.  And then make sure that logic makes it up through your entire stack.  Multicast?  Not allowed on many networks.<p>Is it the end of the world?  No.  It&#x27;s just a lot of extra work for everyone.')
