It doesn&#x27;t idle that high; it only goes that high of you&#x27;re using it flat out, in which case the extra power usage is justified because it&#x27;s giving that much more performance over a 100 W TDP CPU. Now I totally get it if you don&#x27;t want to go Threadripper just for ECC because it&#x27;s more <i>expensive</i>, but max power draw, which you don&#x27;t even have to use? I&#x27;ve never seen anyone shop a desktop CPU by TDP, rather than by performance and price.')
