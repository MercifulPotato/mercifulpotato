That just seems disrespectful of the candidate&#x27;s time.<p>And there lies the problem: I would prefer a take home test way more than whiteboard interview. With the take-home test I would feel more comfortable.<p>As a VP of Engineering in a growing startup, I have to deal with interviewing 2 or 3 candidates <i>every week</i>. We have settled for a process which has given us good results. But for me the key has been to avoid taking tests &quot;literally&quot; but use them more as tools to get to know the candidate.<p>To give you an example: I have had jr people that did too little in our &quot;onsite&quot; (a 3 hour coding challenge of modifying some source-code) but at the end we took a chance and offered 3-month internship with possibility of becoming full time after that.  We have had success with that.<p>I&#x27;ve had people who just flunk the interviews but I see something in them and we take a chance. Similarly, I have seen people that pass the interview pretty well but it so happens that they are just not cut for a startup culture (I had a guy coming from a&quot;big corp&quot;  Tata&#x2F;HCL&#x2F;Cognizant&#x2F;AmDocs kind of culture who struggled to strive in the uncertain and dynamic environment of a startup, after several months, we decided to end it (the nice thing in Mexico is that, by law, we paid him for 3 months severance) because both sides were suffering.')
