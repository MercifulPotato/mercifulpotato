Item(by='heavyset_go', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610064630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676552, text='Apple deprecates support for old Macs in new macOS releases after about 6 to 7 years, and Linux support on Macs released before 2016 is really good.<p>There are features that are unique to Linux, like cgroups and KVM, that are nice to use on my main OS. The kernel itself is incredibly configurable and extensible, whereas on macOS the kernel is locked away and Apple has deprecated foreign kext support.<p>Another example is Linux&#x27;s native FUSE support. I can use an updated version of sshfs on Linux that isn&#x27;t available on macOS and solves problems I had with sshfs on macOS. I have to use closed source software to even use FUSE on macOS.<p>Using Linux on a VM or over SSH to do things I couldn&#x27;t do on macOS was frustrating, and it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air to run Linux natively.<p>Also, I prefer Plasma Desktop to the macOS desktop shell. KWin is scriptable, and KDE is really nice.<p>&gt; <i>Apple&#x27;s touch pad experience in MacOS is the best in the market and it is always very different in Windows and Linux.</i><p>I disagree with this. Libinput is configurable and its adaptive acceleration profile feels more natural to me.')
