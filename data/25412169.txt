It&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s a bubble or not, because value is always part perception.  I will say that the current period feels more disruptive than any I have lived through in the past (dot com 1.0, 2008-2009).  And it feels like the disruption can happen faster now; like nobody is safe, and any older Fortune 1000 company can be rendered obsolete within a decade by a new startup.')
