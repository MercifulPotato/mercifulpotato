Being ~5&#x27;9&quot; &amp; 135 lbs, my back-of-the-napkin BMI is ~20.<p>Fitness is pretty low these days given COVID, but I used to be quite fit (former Fitness company). That didn&#x27;t really move my BP much.<p>My biggest levers for BP are salt intake and work stress. Currently a co-founder so work stress is rather high handled with a bit of mitigation practices like meditation, but definitely not enough.<p>Overall I&#x27;m on borrowed time of sorts and do my best to be thankful for each day... doesn&#x27;t always come through.')
