Consider the alternative: humans are equalized in terms of income&#x2F;wealth. What happens? They start competing along other axes and their status will start being measured by other means. Would that actually be better? Think about it.<p>Financial inequality is actually a beautiful &quot;equalizer&quot;, because no matter who you are, no matter what genetics you are born with and what family you are born into, you are theoretically able to attain the same status (i.e. worth in the eyes of others) as any other human. Of course in practice this is mostly false but it is still better than the alternative.<p>Status&#x2F;power attained through money is much more fair than status&#x2F;power attained through good looks or family name. Both of the others are much more unequal and unfair.')
