Vertical farms and other indoor Ag works in places that already have a handicap. Like in deserts(Middle East), lack of arable land(Japan), harsh winters(New England&#x2F;Canada).<p>To maximize the efficiency for indoor farming, you have to install these systems in the most arid or hostile locations where nothing has been grown before. For example, California or pacific north west doesn’t need this.<p>We can do better with crop rotation and crop diversity in most parts of the world where we grow food and it can be done in an environmentally friendly way.')
