They have a compiler to bring it down to the metal so IDK what you&#x27;re saying.<p>--- EDIT ---<p>@saagarjha, as I&#x27;m being slowposted by HN, here&#x27;s my response via edit:<p>OK, sure! You need some agreed semantics for <i>that</i>, at the low level. But the hardware guys aren&#x27;t likely to add actors in the silicon. And they presumably don&#x27;t intend to support eg. hardware level malloc, nor hardware level general expression evaluation[0], nor hardware level function calling complete with full argument handling, nor fopen, nor much more.<p>BTW &quot;The metal which largely respects C&#x27;s semantics?&quot; C semantics were modelled after real machinery, which is why C has variables which can be assigned to, and arrays which follow very closely actual memory layout, and pointers which are for the hardware&#x27;s address handling. If the C designers could follow theory rather than hardware, well, look at lisp.<p>[0] IIRC the PDPs had polynomial evaluation in hardware.')
