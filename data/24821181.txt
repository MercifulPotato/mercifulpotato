I once saw a TV show that concluded that since there&#x27;s no evidence the Egyptians knew what pi was, space aliens must have been involved in their construction.<p>Later, some wag pointed out that if one uses a measuring wheel one cubit in diameter to lay out the base as a number of revolutions, then made the height as an integral number of cubits, you unwittingly wind up with pi in the ratio.')
