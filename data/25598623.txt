This data also traverses the SS7 network but does contain some authentication data specific to the wireless provider.  The landline telcos have no knowledge of what this data means beyond the ability to route it.  The mobile switches will route your MSISDN to the other SS7 networks.<p><i>accurate caller ID attached by the carrier</i><p>This goes back to the suggested shaken&#x2F;stir method of authentication.  There is really no other way to determine what is valid and what is not.   The carrier can attach nearly any number and that number can be entirely valid.')
