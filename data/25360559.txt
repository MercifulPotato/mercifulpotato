I can plot the number of miles I post on the bike against my weight. Of course I <i>absolutely do</i> more than 300 minutes a week on the bike.<p>Diet is super important, likely more important that fitness, but diet is vastly more difficult for me. Also, when I&#x27;m working out regularly, my diet naturally shifts. If I&#x27;m sitting at my desk or on the couch for weeks at a time, food intake increases.<p>I&#x27;m sure if I could ever properly reign in my eating I could change this, but I&#x27;ve tried so many times and it never works. Working out on the bike does, and as I mentioned above, the intake adjusts correctly when I do it.')
