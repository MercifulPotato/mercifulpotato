Every single FB employee knows this, and does their part to keep the rage machine working.<p>I don’t understand what you mean here. Why does Trump need to be reelected? There is always outrage to be generated for clicks. There was no shortage of outrage during Obama’s term. Even things that were objective non issues, like the tan suit, was whipped into a viral attention storm. “Obama&#x27;s tan suit shocks social media”. It seems like social media is just designed to promote outrage, since outrage produces virality, but not that it needs Trump specifically. Is there something I’m not getting relating specifically to Trump and Facebook?')
