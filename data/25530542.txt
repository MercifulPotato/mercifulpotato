I started to notice a lot of the Spotify recommendations sounded like half of an EDM track I might like, mixed with half of something that it should’ve never been mixed with.<p>Spotify also seems to think I’ll like literally anything with a house kick.<p>It’s an extremely difficult problem to solve though so they have my sympathy!<p>Nobody can really explain why they love one song and hate another, and the overlap of the Venn diagram between any two people is usually very small.<p>I can eat any dish at a restaurant and think it’s not very good, just ok, pretty good, great, or amazing. The same for any movie, TV show, painting, drink, book, article, ... but for a song, I either like it, love it, or hate it so much that I can’t stand it.<p>Music recommendation algorithms have such a narrow surface area to land on, and when they miss, they go right into a volcano.')
