They have three copies of a gene on chromosome 21, TMPRSS2, which codes for an enzyme that the virus hijacks to help it enter human cells. The TMPRSS2 enzyme cleaves the spike protein that studs the virusâ€™ surface, launching a series of steps that allows the virus to invade the host cell.<p>&gt; Cells from people with DS typically express 1.6 times more TMPRSS2 than those from people without the condition')
