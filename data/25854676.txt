The phone seems very limited in its current state, lacking basic features like working cameras or hardware-accelerated UI components (the choppy scrolling is being compared to Android Froyo, released in 2010). The launcher locks up the screen with no feedback until the app is loaded, you need to tap on some apps to bring them into focus as if you were clicking on a window in a desktop app, things like that. Full GTK desktop apps like Audacity look cramped on the tiny screen, even if it&#x27;s remarkable that they run at all.<p>I get that this isn&#x27;t meant to be a fancy flagship, what it means to only use Free Software and a traceable supply chain, all of that. They must be proud to work on such a project. Realistically, the market for it seems incredibly small, and the prices being quoted mean that only truly dedicated Free Software advocates would buy this phone. One thing the video mentions is the availability of 2 different models based on the origin of the hardware components: one fully built in the U.S. (with American-made components?) costing $2,000 – not a typo – and the other version costing $800 (presumably sourced from China).<p>It&#x27;s great that they are trying to do this but… this user experience, for this price, considering the competition? What they are trying to achieve comes with a ton of major challenges and it won&#x27;t be easy to ship a product that enough customers find valuable enough to buy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BH8DRyKUZDg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BH8DRyKUZDg</a>')
