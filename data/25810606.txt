If i have a successful local business, it&#x27;s not hurting me that others do as well. I don&#x27;t need to expand all over the globe to be successful. What&#x27;s wrong with google not operating in china? Why can&#x27;t google flourish as it is without dominating the market? I think you get my point here so i won&#x27;t give more examples. I never did understand why people and organizations want to accumulate extreme amounts of power and wealth either. Like the bad guys in many movies. Of course that would defeat the purpose of the movie, but i often found myself thinking that if they spent half of that energy to the betterment of them selves (and others), it would probably be a pretty sweet life.')
