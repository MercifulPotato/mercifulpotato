Item(by='marlowe221', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610635527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775744, text='I grew up a huge Sherlock Holmes fan. But as I have gotten older (39 in a couple of months), I much prefer Philip Marlowe and the writing of Raymond Chandler.<p>Sure, Marlowe is the quintessential hard-boiled private detective, but when you read the books you discover that he is largely an intuitive&#x2F;emotional detective. He applies logic&#x2F;reasoning and his knowledge of the world he lives in to his intuition&#x2F;emotions but he&#x27;s not all-knowing. Marlowe doesn&#x27;t have the mystery solved on page 23 when the reader still has 174 pages left to go.<p>While still a fantasy, I tend to think Marlowe is a more realistic detective than Holmes ever was - or at least, one with whom I can identify more readily.<p>I think there is always a temptation, a danger, for those of us in STEM careers to hold our own feelings and emotions (not to mention those of others) in contempt, as if they are somehow invalid by definition.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t do that! Instead, we should accept the emotional and intuitive aspects of ourselves and try to reason through them, understand where those feelings are coming from and make conscious decisions about how to move forward.<p>Sorry to preach! I just love fictional detectives and the applicability of the lessons they can teach us to the real world. :)')
