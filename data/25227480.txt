This is job and he does it well.<p>Almost all other internet communities have mods that just do it on a volunteer basis. If those communities are big enough to be vibrant, that also means that a couple volunteer mods can&#x27;t cut it. Luckily YC has the budget for keeping dang around. I would bet this place would be like most other poorly moderated communities without him.')
