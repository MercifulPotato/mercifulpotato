The wire protocol is a closely guarded trade secret from what I can tell.<p>The manufacturer sells a custom EcoBee to work with it, but their own custom EcoBee can only set a few fixed speeds instead of variable speed.<p>This market is ripe for disruption.  Sell me something with a 30 year warranty, and \nplans to wire it to a raspberry pi.  I’ll pay twice as much for that as I would for anything with a sub 20 year warranty.  Since California is close to banning new natural gas installations, focus on making a heat pump that’ll last forever.  Military grade limited access compressors exist and aren’t expensive compared to having someone in Silicon Valley perform a house call.  Also, old air conditioners regularly lasted 30+ years, so this is a solved problem, and the patents have probably expired.<p>I’ll probably buy your weird proprietary thermostat because I’m lazy, but if it sucks badly enough, I’ll know there are decent third party options.')
