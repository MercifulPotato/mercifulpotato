Consider the textbook example of sorting.  The problem itself was always quite easy to solve, yet considerable amount of research were put into finding efficient algorithms since naive approaches are quite inefficient.  We are lucky today since languages or libraries typically provide both the data structures and algorithms, but I cringe at the thought of how inept my code would be if I was relying on SO quality answers while learning how to program in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s (since there were many cases when you had to roll your own).')
