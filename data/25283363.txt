I assumed consecutive numbers, but not necessarily consecutive on each pull.  That is, 1,2,3,4,5 is no different than 2,3,4,5,1 in my calculations, which makes the possible ways got get consecutive numbers at the end quite a bit higher.  Still not positive I got it right, but at least I know it shouldn&#x27;t match your results, as they are for slightly different things. :)<p>Edit: What I did was take all the possible combinations of 5 balls (5!) by the number of different sets that could be drawn (50-5, based on lowest number), over the total possible draws (50!).  I think perhaps what that does it not account for overlap between sets (1-5 and 2-6), inflating the number somewhat, which is why it&#x27;s a bit more than twice the probability than you got for any possible sequence of 5.')
