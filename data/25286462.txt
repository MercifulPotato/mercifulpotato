Up to you!&quot;<p>&gt; The population never really had the freedom to run around and spread diseases harming people.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean exactly. People have generally enjoyed the freedom to roam without being subject to liability or investigation as to whether they might be spreading an illness.
