Item(by='robenkleene', descendants=None, kids=[25795656], score=None, time=1610721577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25790432, text='No, I wasn’t, thanks for pointing it out! I’d love to hear which of the issues I listed that it addresses. The tag line “welcome to your new favorite browser. Get the latest features, fast performance, and the development tools you need to build for the open web”, as well as the features listed on the homepage, don’t address any of the points I listed directly. (This doesn’t mean the app itself doesn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m not encouraged by the features as they’re listed on the homepage, which feels more like some new features for developers, rather than a re-imagining of how we think about how developer tools are integrated into the browser like I’m describing.)')
