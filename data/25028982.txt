That was a detail added by the guy I was replying to. idk why he decided it’s relevant there. If you want my yes or no answer, on is there an out-of-a-box solution for querying external services, then probably not. There can be, for some use cases, but I never researched them. And that’s actually not a bad idea to have some generic kick-in lib for that. So here, you have it.<p>I hope you understand that my issue is with the person who’s currently very busy with coming up with the infinitely recursive graphql query.')
