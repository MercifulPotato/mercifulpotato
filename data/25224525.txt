It was much less elegant and performant, though, than my initial solution with Common Lisp and C which basically allocated buffers in memory and mapped them with huge pages so that memory access don&#x27;t ever require switch to kernel for mapping.<p>We also had custom Intel CPUs that are auctioned individually. And cutthrough switches that stream the IP packet immediately when they receive the IP header, before they receive the payload. I have calculated that if the message from exchange was a beam of light it would be delayed by less than a meter.')
