If AirBnB&#x27;s role of the relationship isn&#x27;t worth the premium you pay to cover taxes, that&#x27;s a pretty strong argument that AirBnB isn&#x27;t really providing much value and we&#x27;d be better off without a middleman in this relationship (I think for what it&#x27;s worth that this probably isn&#x27;t true, and people will happily pay 5-15% to be able to deal directly with AirBnB)')
