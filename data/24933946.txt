Are those also fraud?<p>IIUC, Affiliate marketing is when an online retailer pays you a commission for traffic or sales generated from your referrals.<p>That&#x27;s not fraud or misrepresentation.<p>In the case of Grubhub, et. al, fake phone numbers, they aren&#x27;t recommending a restaurant.  They are claiming that the phone number <i>is</i> the restaurant.  Those who call that number aren&#x27;t clicking an ad because the &quot;affiliate&quot; promoted it.  They are calling that number because they&#x27;d <i>already</i> decided to contact that particular restaurant, but were redirected to another entity -- with a monetary interest that harms the restaurant -- that doesn&#x27;t disclose their third-party status.<p>And that&#x27;s certainly at least unethical, if not outright fraud.')
