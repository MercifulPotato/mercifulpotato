For example, if I remember correctly, Basic English doesn&#x27;t allow the word &quot;tolerate&quot; but does allow &quot;put up with&quot;. That&#x27;s a false economy. Also, the &quot;850&quot; is deceptive advertising because there are various categories of word that are allowed in addition to the 850 words listed.')
