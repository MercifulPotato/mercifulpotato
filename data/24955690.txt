Item(by='spekcular', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604182882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954607, text='On what basis do you say that probability has &quot;morphed into an algebra&quot;? Consider all of the popular research topics today: the KPZ equation, Schramm-Loewner evolution, spin glasses, percolation and critical phenomena, rigorous statistical mechanics in general [1], random matrix theory, large deviations, stochastic analysis and (P)SDEs.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m forgetting some, but none of these are primarily algebraic. Some algebraic methods are used (orthogonal polynomials in random matrix theory, and determinants and a whole host of other things to study integrable models in the KPZ universality class, etc.), but clearly groups&#x2F;rings&#x2F;fields are not playing a major role.<p>For a more systematic approach you could look at recent issues of Annals of Probability, Annals of Applied Probability, and similar journals. There&#x27;s not going to be a lot of &quot;modern algebra&quot; (of the flavor you see in algebraic geometry) there.<p>The same comments apply to PDE and analytic number theory. Both are obviously mature fields (worked on for a long time by many people, with a lot of great discoveries), but again algebra does not play a central role in either. In particular I am not aware of any PDE specialists whose research agenda consists of &quot;trying to turn it into algebra.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unige.ch&#x2F;math&#x2F;folks&#x2F;velenik&#x2F;smbook&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unige.ch&#x2F;math&#x2F;folks&#x2F;velenik&#x2F;smbook&#x2F;</a>')
