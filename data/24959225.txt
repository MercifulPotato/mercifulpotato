It&#x27;s not decided, and a lot of what we&#x27;ve started calling &quot;rights&quot; these days aren&#x27;t all that basic or universally agreed.<p>The way you&#x27;ve phrased it means that it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to be uncivil (violent) towards others. That&#x27;s a breakdown of communication and has effectively &quot;othered&quot; the individuals&#x2F;groups based on their disagreement with your framing of the topic.')
