Teachers, principals, and school counselors with zero training in medicine, psychology, or pharmacology, self-diagnosed children with ADD and was a driving force for pushing the dramatic increase in the usage of such medications.<p>From a personal perspective, when I was but a wee young girl in elementary school, a bit hyperactive, the school made it clear that as far as they were concerned I had ADD, and I must be put on medication before they would allow me to return to the classroom. Forgetting for a moment that a school cannot do this legally, my parents were summarily cowed enough to put me on medication to appease the education establishment.<p>The author of the aforementioned article makes a very good point but I don&#x27;t think they stated the conclusion in loud enough terms: People are self-diagnosing, then demanding medical care they don&#x27;t need, while claiming any resistance is discriminatory. Out of fear, I think doctors and therapists are getting intimidated and going along with it.')
