Wingsuits have a glide ratio of ~2.5:1 (horizontal:vertical) which is not that much better than just falling as a normal skydiver can hit 1:1.<p>To maintain level flight they need to generate a lot more lift, while carrying the extra weight of an engine.  By comparison a 747 has a glide ratio of 15:1 and depending on specific model and how much weight it has onboard it will stall in level flight around 180MPH.  While many aircraft can fly at much lower speeds, a wingsuit is a terrible aircraft.')
