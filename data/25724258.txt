It was a bunch of bozos who rioted. What they did was  just a massive embarrassment to the establishment that had written them off as buffoons.<p>Amusingly, we have decided NOT to use the word &quot;insurrection&quot; for the conversation Nancy Pelosi apparently had with the Joint Chiefs to subvert the nuclear chain of command based on nothing more than her personal whim. Stealing a podium? Sedition! Stealing nuclear launch codes? Meh.<p>Amazingly, this story is feeding on itself as it gets repeated. At first they were vandals, then insurrectionist...by next week they&#x27;ll be an existential threat to life on Earth and people will be calling for the death penalty for everyone in attendance.<p>Control yourself people! The Bonus Army occupied the Capitol too and you&#x27;ve probably never even heard of them.<p>Fear not, the MAGAtards will be behind bars and the world will be safe for you to curl up with the writings of Trotsky delivered to your doorstep by someone earning minimum wage.')
