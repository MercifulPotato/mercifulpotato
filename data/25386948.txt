For those in lower income nations this is an absolute game changer.</i><p>Except that decent RaspberyPI configs that could replace PCs cost around $60-70(In EU) and once you add a display, peripherals and a decent microSD card(which is still smaller, slower and less reliable than even a budget SSD) and you&#x27;re looking at over $100 and for that kind of cash, a second hand X86 notebook(old beaten up Dell&#x2F;Lenovo with an i5, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD) gives you way more power and flexibility with what you can boot, install and do with it, it&#x27;s not even a competition. Not to mention it comes with a built in battery so you can carry it to school unlike a PI, and before someone sniggers and shows me a link with a Raspberry PI based notebook just to contradict me, ask yourselves if you would actually use that as a productivity daily driver for work and play vs a X86 laptop.<p>Sorry, even in developing nations, second hand notebooks&#x2F;PCs are a way better deal in every way as a personal computer than a PI which is why PIs have never taken off as PCs and are still stuck in the hacker, tinkerer, learning, embedded, automation niches.<p><i>&gt;Phones need to sorta be closed, who wants a null pointer exception to lock the dialer UI in an emergency ?</i><p>Why do they need to be closed? Having closed source software is no guarantee of quality nor security.<p><i>&gt;Of course if you really want to, you can buy one of those open phones and program your own dialer from scratch, not a very good idea for the typical user though</i><p>By wanting more openness we don&#x27;t mean reinventing the wheel and coding open source dialers from scratch, we mean we need Apple and Google to not lock their hardware to their appstores so we(companies, users, banks, developers and even governments) don&#x27;t become prisoners to their walled gardens which is basically the current situation.')
