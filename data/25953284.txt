I&#x27;d expect every team member to use those. Further, github issues supports easy images and videos. Great for artists, and designers to track things. Assuming gitlab does the same I&#x27;d expect the same there.<p>Maybe there are better solutions and so you don&#x27;t want your artists do that there.<p>It goes the same the other way. As a programmer I&#x27;ve always needed a license to the same 3d software the artists are using even though I don&#x27;t use it daily I might need to write or debug an exporter or script.')
