These should all be part of one cluster, and behave as such.<p>YES! This is exactly what we should have had been able to do in K8S swiftly, but I would like to suggest one additional goal: to get a highly-distributed, fault tolerant computer cluster over different network without a hassle (as a mean to spread risk), while also having a as-low-as-best-as-possible TCO through the use of <i>heterogeneous architecture</i>.<p>So this means I can have used AWS for their Graviton instances for high performance, near-bare-metal microservices, and can also run typical x86 workload on various cheap VPS providers such as Vultr, DO and any other cheap hosts out in the wild to handle normal stuff that typically wouldn&#x27;t run well on ARM, such as GitLab, Prometheus, Keycloak, in a sense that we associate x86 to have an affinity with &quot;heavy stuff&quot; runner and this implies ARM to be the Mr. &quot;lightweight stuff&quot; guy. This is not really possible by today&#x27;s shape of the k8s ecosystem, given that the majority of the images in Docker Hub is predominately x86&#x2F;amd64, and my wild guess is around 90%. By the way I use ServerHunter[1] to scavenge such cheap x86 servers.<p>Also I&#x27;m a k3s[2] user and I have attempted to do this pretty well. Given your kernel support, you can even strap WireGuard on natively (albeit my VPS host internet bill tells me this can hit quite heavy)<p>While I can definitely control k8s by using kubeadm but I just liked k3s&#x27;s philosophy of being battery-packed: It will install Traefik (although my recent needs to run nginx-ingress ultimately let me turn it off), CoreDNS, Flannel, a simple local storage and extra goodies all out of the box in your cluster, and you can opt them out whenever you want if you think they are insufficient for your kind of workload (whilst they are adequate for most of 90% of the thing actually). To be honest, this is how k8s should have had been this simple in the very beginning to say the least.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serverhunter.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serverhunter.com&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k3s.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k3s.io</a>')
