I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s rather unfair to characterize legislators in general as being out of touch when 228 members of Congress voted in favor of the bill. If fact, if you include both chambers of Congress, more legislators likely support this bill than don&#x27;t.<p>If you want to blame more than one person, blame the Senators that elected the current Senate majority leader.')
