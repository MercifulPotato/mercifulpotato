The US imports virtually no live-action series or films from foreign language countries, and relatively little even from other English-speaking countries. So we extrapolate the tastes of the entire country from what is a relatively small market share.<p>Imagine trying to judge US culture solely on the basis of shows like The Simpsons, Futurama, and South Park. These aren&#x27;t low-quality shows, but they&#x27;re also nowhere near fully reflective of the entertainment that people consume in the US.')
