Item(by='penguin_booze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606328441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204837, text='I vaguely recall a presentation from Leslie Lamport on TLA+&#x2F;formal modelling. I might get some details wrong here, but a member of the audience asked &#x27;why not describe a system by examples&#x27; (implying it&#x27;s easier to see some example interactions to start with), and Leslie&#x27;s reply was it&#x27;s not rigorous precise enough (not to mention he was visibly angry at the question). I agree it&#x27;s not precise enough, but for someone starting, an example is good enough rather than choking on rigor. Sure, rigor does matter, but allow me some toehold first!<p>Just like &#x27;no taxation without representation&#x27;, there should be &#x27;no formalization without insight&#x27;.')
