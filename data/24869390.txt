The bar owner buries his head in the sand because business is good. The bar&#x27;s plumber doesn&#x27;t like it but keeps his mouth shut because he can charge the bar owner more.  The farmer, the mechanic, and everyone else not close enough to the money to get a good trickle down loses out big time because now they can&#x27;t afford the plumber and they can&#x27;t afford to go to the bar to drink their problems away.')
