Does this hurt the government&#x27;s own efforts? Any reasonable person will understand that they aren&#x27;t hurting anyone by walking outside near no one. Or two people from the same household walking their dog at night near no one. This may make people generally less likely to follow all the rules, because they see that half the rules are just made up nonsense.')
