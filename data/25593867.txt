In web land, it tends to mean &quot;if a user makes a change here, it auto updates on some other user&#x27;s screen there without either user clicking &#x27;save&#x27; or &#x27;refresh&#x27; or something like that&quot;. Both are clear definitions in widespread use, and it&#x27;s obvious that the Uber people mean the latter.<p>Your comment is like complaining that people writing a cryptocurrency blog use the word &quot;crypto&quot; wrong because <i>obviously</i> it means cryptography.')
