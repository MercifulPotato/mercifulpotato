I recently reshopped health plans in southern CA. For a family of four, different rates went from $700&#x2F;mo to $2900&#x2F;mo, but they all had different copays, different test, ER, hospitailization costs. Different deductibles, different allowances and disallowances for deductibles. Different out of network payments minimums and maximums. Different drug family costs. There is zero comparability.')
