As I said in the post, I had very little audience. Most of the success is due to me randomly messaging my Twitter contacts and asking for their support. I messaged ahead of time (maybe a few hours before?) just so it wasn&#x27;t out of the blue. Everyone agreed. Some were already customers (I made some sales before the launch) so they left honest reviews of the product.<p>I think the other part of this being successful was the giveaway tweet, plus all the friends who just wanted to support me. I am really thankful they did!')
