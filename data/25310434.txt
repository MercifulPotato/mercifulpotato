My actual vision is perfect; better than ever.  But apparently my eyes don&#x27;t converge so well anymore, giving me horrific headaches if I look at any kind of screen for more than a few minutes :(  Really sucks.  Doc gave me prism lens so I can use a computer again, but they&#x27;re exhausting to use.  Hoping I can find a specialist after the pandemic is over and figure out a better option; really don&#x27;t want this to get worse.<p>Kind of sick joke, considering I spent almost a decade of my career doing computational imaging and computer vision work.<p>2020 :&#x2F;')
