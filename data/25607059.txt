Item(by='webmobdev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609534866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25606123, text='&gt; My advice is to immediately rebrand as gracefully and effectively as possible and use all that activist energy to effect the transition.<p>Apple will definitely appreciate it if all of us would just shut up and let them screw us.<p>While I appreciate your well-meaning advise to the author - pick your battles in life carefully - I&#x27;d like to add that using your anger constructively at some injustice is a positive move too. You do have to accept some things in life are beyond your control. But it does not mean you should not be an advocate for necessary change. Speaking up is the beginning. (And in fact, more positive to your well-being). And you can even stop with that. But speak up.<p>The author has made some good arguments and I urge everyone to read it. Irrespective, of what the author ultimately decides to do, he should be glad for having the courage to speak up. And that many of us appreciate it and support him.<p>Apple shouldn&#x27;t forget that while it may have hoodwinked many developers to pay them for the &quot;privilege&quot; of creating and distributing apps on their platform, it is the developers who are the ones adding more VALUE to their platform. And that there&#x27;s a limit to how much you can abuse and gauge them (one would have that all the law suits on the app store would have made them realised that by now).')
