And you can set multiple per-app passwords for the same service with different ACLs - one can be R&#x2F;O to your IMAP while another has R&#x2F;W access for example.<p>I tested a lot of providers, many of them do not have per-app passwords at all, and the ones that do tend to only allow one per service endpoint.  (note: I didn&#x27;t get a chance to test Zoho, it has them listed as available but I decided against the service for other reasons)')
