The secret to both is reduced coupling, which lock-free methods do nothing to help with. Atomic operations invoke hardware mechanisms that, at base, are hardly different from locks. While they won&#x27;t deadlock by themselves, they are so hard to get right that failures equally as bad as deadlocking are hard to avoid.<p>So, replace threads with separate processes that communicate via ring buffers, and batch work to make interaction less frequent. With interaction infrequent enough, time spent synchronizing, when you actually do it, becomes negligible.')
