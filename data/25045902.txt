I get where they&#x27;re coming from, but don&#x27;t really agree with the standpoint.<p>CVS (or really any large retail chain that sells 3rd party products and produces their own) is in a similar situation. One could, and rightfully so I think, make the argument that CVS etc should not be allowed to produce their own products, because they have significantly more insight into what is sold. Amazon noticed that several products were selling quite well and decided to get a piece of the action. Beyond showing their own products as higher ranked you&#x27;ll also often see them listed under the &quot;cheaper alternative&quot; section on product pages.<p>In comparison, CVS might see that neck pillows are really popular and decides to sell their own neck pillows and put competitor ones on lower shelves. It&#x27;s quite similar behavior.<p>Part of the reason why the EU decides to go after Amazon and not other though, I think, is because of their market share. Amazon is huge in the EU. They hold about 29% of the market. Depending on the country, even more.<p>Amazon also does this on a scale that other &quot;marketplace&quot; type companies have not. If you ever go to the Amazon website and look under Amazon basic, you&#x27;ll be surprise by the amount of stuff they sell.')
