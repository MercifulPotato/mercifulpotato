It&#x27;s created from greed or fear of competition from a better managed app store.<p>I think what people are arguing for is a similar model to macOS. Have you ever heard anyone get mad that they were able to download apps outside of the App Store on macOS? No! You can use the App Store if you want, but you&#x27;re still able to trust a third-party developer to use the device you purchased to it&#x27;s full potential.')
