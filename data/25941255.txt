But you can also just object to any terms in the contract that you think are going too far and you can negotiate with your company to remove them before signing. Whether the terms are potentially legal or not if signed doesn&#x27;t always matter. It&#x27;s usually easier to just not to sign anything that says you have to do something that you don&#x27;t want to do.<p>For example, some jurisdictions say it is legal for an employer to write a contract that says they own anything you do in your spare time outside of work (US New York) but others set firmer limits on what the company can legally claim (US California). But in either case, you can just refuse to agree to it and negotiate better terms before signing.')
