I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s mainly to stay competitive or due to limited supply, but they offer public IPv4 addresses upon request, sometimes for free. It makes sense really; if you default to CGNAT, which is fine for 99% of users, there will be more public addresses for the people who need them which keeps costs down for both segments. It&#x27;s not the ISP&#x27;s fault the standard is outdated.')
