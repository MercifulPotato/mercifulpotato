I have receipts. The H1B was introduced in the Immigration Act of 1990.<p>The statute doesn’t say anything about “dual intent.” That’s an administrative fiction. Under the actual law, the H-1B is a “nonimmigrant” visa status for temporary workers.<p>The status is defined in Section 1101(a)(15), which describes various “classes of nonimmigrant aliens.” See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;8&#x2F;1101" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;8&#x2F;1101</a><p>In that same provision, subsection (H)(1)(b) defines the status as a worker “who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform services” in a “speciality occupation.”<p>The provision you quote doesn’t create some concept of “dual intent.” It simply says that someone shall not be presumed to have immigrant intent just because they file an adjustment of status petition. Why would that even matter? Because H-1B still requires nonimmigrant intent!<p>If Congress had designed H-1B to be a pathway to permanent residency, it would say that in the statute. Instead what happened is that for 40 years the executive branch abused the H-1 program to turn a temporary immigration visa into a de facto permanent immigration system. Congress didn’t want to blow up the status quo, but also couldn’t get the vote to create a real system for permanent immigration of skilled workers. The 1990 INA doesn’t even use the words “dual intent” or anything like it. Congress did the minimum it needed to address the situation where State Department was barring H-1 holders who has filed an immigration petition from re-entering, because that’s all they could get the votes for.')
