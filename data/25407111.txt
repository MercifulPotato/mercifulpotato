It&#x27;s their system, their vulnerability is their responsibility. They should be glad they were contacted by a relatively harmless person and pay them a fair value for doing work they didn&#x27;t even know they needed. If they refuse to fix it, the moral thing to do is to disclose it so that the company has no choice but to fix it.')
