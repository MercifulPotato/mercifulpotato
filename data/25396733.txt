I don&#x27;t think that grammar is the issue here. &quot;FDA&quot; and &quot;the FDA&quot; are apparently used interchangeably no matter the sentence. With NASA, the difference is that no one spells out N.A.S.A., you say it as one word. With FDA, you spell it out. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong :)')
