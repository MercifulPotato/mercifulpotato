In the meantime they honor the amount you decided to withdraw. It&#x27;s a bookie floating a new gambler.<p>I opened an account two days ago to buy one share of GME for fun, then they blocked my ability to, but I still can&#x27;t take my money out -- despite my bank notifying me that it&#x27;s been withdrawn. This is because they probably process all the ACH records in a nightly job on weekdays. It&#x27;ll be Monday before the money can begin its 3 day trip back to my bank.<p>So much of this process is unnecessary but what are you going to do? They (the entrenched financial system) have you by the throat.')
