It’s not like the ARM architecture changes anything in the thermodynamics of cooling cpus compared to an x86 chip, right?<p>I’d wager that under load an i9 with passive cooling wouldn’t even last 30 seconds without throttling below even its base clock, if it doesn’t just shut down to prevent frying itself')
