It&#x27;s strange since this concept was introduced in philosophy by Derrida in the 90s, and further studied by cultural theorists such as Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher - but Gibson seems to nail this phenomenon in his short story a decade earlier.<p>And this phenomenon is perhaps most exacerbated today, as we are experiencing a gradual but terminal decline of former capitalist empires, but nobody can imagine a new revolutionary path out (as Mark Fisher would say, &quot;the slow cancellation of the future&quot;) Ghostly ideologies from the past (communism, fascism) are quickly recycled on the Internet for their nostalgic sign value, but as it is quickly consumed and commoditized it fails to offer a solution for the problems of our current world. And more people are listening to music [3] that admittedly makes them feel &quot;nostalgic for a past that does not exist&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hauntology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hauntology</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hauntology_(music)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hauntology_(music)</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vaporwave" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vaporwave</a>')
