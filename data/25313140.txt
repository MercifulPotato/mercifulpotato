(I guess part of what was shocking was I realised it applied to me, as well as others I was close to).<p>So these days when I come across someone who makes a lot of noise about those kinds of topics, I pay close attention to how they treat people or why they say about people they know. It&#x27;s often very revealing.<p>Related to this, I often find it interesting to note what certain people on HN say about particular causes, and then observe how they behave towards DoreenMichele.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t in any way believe that anyone who cares for the needy is actually likely to be an asshole deep down; plenty of people care about these issues and are really sincere about it, and are great to other people.<p>But it&#x27;s often those who are the most vocal and self-aggrandising whose private actions are very different to what they seek to signal with their words.')
