Quickly.</i><p>I sincerely believe exactly the opposite. The best and brightest in the USA avoid research academia because the quality of life is terrible and the pay is below average. Like, &quot;all my students make more in their first year than I make with a PhD and 20 years of successful research&quot; is a common lament among CS profs everywhere outside of the top tier of R1.<p>Meanwhile, the &quot;graduate school as a ticket into the country&quot; incentive structure creates a lot of pathological behavior among the foot soldiers of academia.')
