Mining fees are what any cryptocurrency with an inflation rate that rapidly declines to zero&#x2F;close-to-zero depends on for security on any appreciable time scale.<p>That&#x27;s why I said that Ethereum&#x27;s long-term security prospects are better. Its mining fees have exceeded Bitcoin&#x27;s and with the multi-pronged efforts to further scale Ethereum - that are vastly more promising than Bitcoin&#x27;s - there is a high likelihood of these fees further increasing their gap with Bitcoin&#x27;s.')
