Even though they are violent, and people have died. You chose to interpret that as her saying that they <i>would</i> not stop (a warning) but not an endorsement. I see it clearly as a warning and an endorsement. Would not <i>and should not</i>.<p>But I recognize that Trump talks and suddenly maybe I’m in your shoes and you’re in mine.<p>Maybe I think the transcript irrefutably supports my position, but it’s Ok if you disagree. I don’t think either of us are fascists because of it.<p>The result isn’t words have no meaning, it’s whether you will respect people enough to let them answer you and clarify and believe them when they do.<p>So Trump says “there were fine people” and people say, wait did he just complement literal nazis, and you check the transcript and you realize, oh, “and I’m not talking about the nazis, they should be condemned totally”.<p>But the media doesn’t allow Trump to say “and I’m not talking about the nazis”. They cover their ears at that point and say, “la la la, Trump just said nazis are fine people!”<p>And that’s what’s wrong with this picture. They did it in Charlottesville, they did it to cover for horrible rioting by BLM&#x2F;Antifa, and they are doing it today.')
