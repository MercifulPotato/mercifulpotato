When writing C, I have to carefully make sure that each resource has been freed&#x2F;closed (but not too soon!), that I&#x27;m not mutating or holding onto anything I&#x27;m not meant to, that I&#x27;ve accounted for every exception that I can result from a given call, and so on. Can Zig handle some of that bookkeeping for me?')
