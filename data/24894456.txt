Sure someone eating cake for the first time after having only eaten non sugary stuff for a long time will find it a bit jarring, but anyone eating both will find cake so much tastier, which is why people overeat cake so much.<p>Yet many people will still adamantly say that they find salad tastier. And still go on and eat cake and get fat. They are just lying to themselves, I&#x27;m not sure why. Lispers are the same way, its just a reality distortion field.')
