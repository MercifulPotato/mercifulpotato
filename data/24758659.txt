Not Tic Tac Toe, but a more complex problem involving octrees. Essentially, given a scene(hard-coded), it would have to output all octree nodes (specifying white, black or gray if they were unnocupied, completely occupied, partially occupied, respectively). That was a full end of semester assignment. As in, you had the entire semester to do it.<p>We were &#x27;pairing&#x27;, he was &#x27;driving&#x27;. Well, he wrote the whole thing in one sitting, in ANSI C. Even added couple of extra shapes to the program (that we thought were required, but in fact weren&#x27;t). The bottleneck was his typing speed.<p>I was able to follow everything, although I remember thinking that a couple of spots along the way had more clever solutions, compared to what I would do, were I the one typing.<p>I did not notice <i>any</i> mistakes whatsoever. None. Turns out, neither did the compiler. He wrote the whole damn thing, one sitting, in a single afternoon, and <i>only hit compile once</i>. It worked. First try. Hundreds of lines of codes with pretty high complexity.<p>I later ran Valgrind on it. It didn&#x27;t even have memory leaks.<p>I had never seen anything like it, and haven&#x27;t seen since. I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ll have a new algorithm or data structure named after him at some point.<p>Would I hire him for a startup? Only if it was based on complex algorithms, otherwise he would probably get bored.<p>Even if you do find a genius (and you never even have the <i>chance</i> to interview guys like him, as they can essentially <i>pick</i> their job), you may still need to get a Carmack, not a Dijkstra')
