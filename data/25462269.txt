It sends a JWT token for application usage and can register multiple applications for support, not full OAuth etc.  The main application it&#x27;s used with also integrates into other third party apps, so needed a simple means in-app for auth.<p>I tried to get permission to develop&#x2F;publish this application as open-source, but was never able to do so.  It&#x27;s now got a few rough edges only because without the public need&#x2F;perception some bits aren&#x27;t as well flushed out beyond our internal use&#x2F;needs and or the needs of our deployed instances.  Not to mention a few requirements to satisfy a difficult architect&#x2F;lead on another team, and they wound up not using the app anyway.<p>It&#x27;s not too hard to meet some guidelines... I wound up using a simple KV pattern for data storage so I could target different adapters, add overlays for caching and encryption etc.  There&#x27;s some cool bits and some muddled bits.')
