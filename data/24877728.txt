It was poor: The teacher had a friend from a care dealership come in to teach us some things. I was 13.<p>But more importantly: What a wide swath of folks need is how to survive poverty. So many people never get to the point of even considering a CD or IRA. Most folks only really need the bank account for paying things. 401(k) simply because that&#x27;s what is offered by the employer, and you have to get paid enough to really use it. Sometimes $5 today really is more important than $10 when you retire since it means food to make it to retirement. MSA is similar: You need the extra money. No point in a MSA if you can&#x27;t afford insurance anyway.<p>If you can&#x27;t teach how to afford poverty, the rest is useless and completely tone deaf.<p>Likewise, most folks aren&#x27;t going to open a business and many won&#x27;t invest in markets.<p>Realistically, what we need are online resources in plain, simple english that explains these things and&#x2F;or classes that are mandatory for folks starting businesses. The younger the person, the more likely the person is to be pretty good at consuming information on the internet. Just make sure folks know where to go to get good information.')
