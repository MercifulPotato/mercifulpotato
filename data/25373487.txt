If memory serves me right even with a max score on the aptitude test, reserved to some 0.3-0.5% of the test-takers, you will still be put in a lottery pool for the best medschools).<p>Law degrees might be harder to transfer generally though (easy to transfer in the Nordics at least iirc) but even in the US you need to take the bar in different states, so maybe that part isn&#x27;t too different anyhow?<p>Actually, Might become easier in the EU in the future now that post-brexit there isn&#x27;t any common law countries within the union and with mostly civil law systems it should be easier to unify principles in some sections of the law.')
