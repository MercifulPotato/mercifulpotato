So it’s okay there is rape and murder in there because it makes people stay on the right side of the law on the outside of prisons? Is that what you’re saying or am i misunderstanding?<p>I think it’s best for a society to implement policies to reduce crime not to scare people into complying with the law. The alternative is quite negative. Also, let’s remind ourselves that people are imprisoned in the US for stupid things like smoking pot, not paying tickets, scared into guilty pleas. Some of those people harden and become career criminals in prison and in the end it results in more crime.')
