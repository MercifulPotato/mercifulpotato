Other than people making fun of me, I don’t see the point. Programming has so many symbols and it’s not like I’m limited by my typing speed as far as I can tell.  And for most non-programming text entry I’m on a phone nowadays, so touch typing skill is moot.<p>What would you say is the advantage to learning to touch type at this point? Has it been particularly helpful in some way?')
