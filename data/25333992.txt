It leads to CYA behavior, backstabbing and massive risk aversion. It can also lead to or be a result of a toxic work environment.<p>In multi causal bugs it can lead to people downplaying causes which they had something to do with and exaggerating the effect that co-worker thry don&#x27;t like had something to do with. This often leads to confused attribution and poor rectification of systemic issues - e.g. writing more unit tests even when more unit tests won&#x27;t really help.<p>&quot;Accountability culture&quot; sounds like it could be the same thing. Or not. I&#x27;m not really sure.')
