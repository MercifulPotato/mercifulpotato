This process is called &quot;chunking,&quot; and it relies on the fact that once you have a basic understanding of a unit of code, &quot;you don&#x27;t need to remember all the little underlying details&quot; (Oakley).<p>Isn&#x27;t this how a lot of non-math majors learn math at uni? You learn how to use it, but you don&#x27;t learn the proofs behind it? When I dove into a first codebase, I took the above said approach because that&#x27;s how I learned (most) math.<p>A younger me would&#x27;ve find the Tools section valuable.')
