Muslim world is not Arab world. In general, Muslim =&#x2F;= Arab, and Arab =&#x2F;= Muslim. However, Arabs do spend quite a lot of money in various quarters and apparently are deep into a cultural appropriation program of denuding all other Muslim nations of their substantial claims (more than actual Arab scientists) to “Islam’s Golden Age”.<p>&gt; Indeed, most of the greatest thinkers of the era were not ethnically Arab.<p>Yet the author perversely chooses to call it Arab science, and Arab Golden Age.<p>He then puts forward a completely unsupported theory that this is because “for several centuries throughout the Middle East, Muslims were a minority”.<p>Let’s follow Hillel’s tortured logic here:<p>- Most of Muslim thinkers of Muslim Golden Age were not Arabs.<p>- This is because Muslims were a minority in Middle East.<p>- Thus we need “caution” before we go ahead and call them Arab Scientists.<p>It is also necessary to correct Hillel’s implicit that most “Arab Scientists” were non-Muslim non-Arabs. The fact remains that most of these non-Arabs were Muslims.<p>Hillel is invited to offer a list of non-Muslim “great thinkers” of the era.<p>Arab money is making a mess in all sort of places. But it will not be permitted to mess with the history and heritage of the Muslim nations.')
