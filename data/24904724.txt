The value of having a highly-customizable editor that is extensible in a well-known language is great.<p>I really hope a true VSCode competitor will emerge in the future that is truly open source and not controlled by a company that does not have its users best interests in mind; all this Linux-friendly stuff Microsoft is doing lately is to basically get people into their ecosystem and then slowly push out Linux and other alternatives (e.g. who&#x27;s using sublime &#x2F; atom anymore?). There is some pithy name for this strategy that escapes me, but effectively it is the equivalent of dumping in commerce: use one&#x27;s cash reserves to sell a product at a loss in order to squeeze out competitors, then capitalize on the cornered market (i.e. &quot;All Hail Microsoft!&quot; after trying to squeeze out others).<p>I really wish the Xi [0] editor gained more traction, though as an Emacs user I&#x27;m hoping the speedup with v28 and the GccEmacs [1] go a long way there. I would certainly like more parallelism though, e.g. `dired` mode not pausing the entire editor when moving a large file, and I&#x27;ve never really become fluent in elisp.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xi-editor&#x2F;xi-editor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xi-editor&#x2F;xi-editor</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emacswiki.org&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;GccEmacs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emacswiki.org&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;GccEmacs</a>')
