They only talk about what it does poorly. If you don&#x27;t acknowledge what it does well, it&#x27;s trivially easy to come up with solutions that address the things it does poorly, but often at the expense of creating a new replacement that now does poorly at the thing that the previous system did well.<p>In the US, the system is remarkably effective at optimizing for financial incentives. The replacement system many people argue for will likely lay waste to optimizing for financial incentives. This doesn&#x27;t come without a cost however. Eliminate the financial incentives and you will at minimum get less of two very important things: (1) investment by companies and capital markets in R&amp;D, and (2) investment in a career in the field of drug R&amp;D by individuals deciding what career to pursue. The loss of one or both would be devastating to the development of novel treatments in perpetuity.<p>As a general heuristic, I&#x27;ve found it valuable to figure out what a system does well before I propose a solution to replace it. If I can&#x27;t articulate what a system does well, it&#x27;s typically a sign that I don&#x27;t yet understand the system well enough and don&#x27;t understand what that system&#x27;s designers were optimizing for when it was first implemented. This heuristic is applicable to all pretty much all systems, not just health care.')
