No one does this:<p><pre><code>  var STRAWBERRY_PI = 1 + Math.PI;\n</code></pre>\nFor example, no one doing math will use τ (2𝛑) and 𝛑 simultaneously. Choose one or the other, otherwise you are increasing the number of symbols someone has to learn to understand your math. Naming everything is overwhelming. Mathematics is about similarities, not differences.  If the transformation is trivial, then don&#x27;t bother creating a new symbol. It will just confuse you more.')
