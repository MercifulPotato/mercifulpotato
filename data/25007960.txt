In rabbit it&#x27;s much more configurable.<p>Also regular rabbit hosts support the kludge pattern of, &#x27;just run one host and accept if it goes poof you can lose messages,&#x27; which is useful if you don&#x27;t want to bother with the complexity of clustering or are on a shoe string budget.<p>Lastly you get a nice user interface with the management plugin and you can stand it up locally with docker compose (without depending on AWS for dev or any of the &#x27;aws but on your laptop&#x27; solutions).')
