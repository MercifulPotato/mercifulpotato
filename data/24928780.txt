I asked why they couldn&#x27;t patch or upgrade it, to which they responded:<p>&gt; &quot;Every time we change patch or change the software configuration we need to have it re-certified before we can use it on a patient, and that takes months and $10,000&#x27;s&quot;<p>I really hope we&#x27;ll see some movement in the health security space, maybe leveraging SDN&#x2F;Micro-segmentation or Identity-Aware-Proxy software like Hashicorp Boundary, but these aren&#x27;t (really) zero-cost and  add friction&#x2F;delays to accessing the information you need about your patient... Time will tell.')
