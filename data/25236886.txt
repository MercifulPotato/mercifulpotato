In a way, the difference between a 4k ebike with cheaper looking parts vs a 4.5k bike with &quot;premium&quot; parts comes down on the side of spending the money.<p>I&#x27;d estimate that bike would sell for ~2k without the electrics. It&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s not super speccd. High end carbon rims are expensive, but they&#x27;re not _that_ expensive compared to aftermarket aluminum rims. Niceish rims are basically 80-100 now. Carbon is probably 150 or so. (That&#x27;s retailish, but not MSRP, what I could get them for, not what a bike co could get them for wholesale)<p>OTOH, it&#x27;s lighter than my gravel&#x2F;commuter, which doesn&#x27;t even have electrics, so there&#x27;s that. But I&#x27;d need rack&#x2F;panniers for the commute, and I&#x27;d have range worries there.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see is a lightweight system that adds ~100W to my output for ~ 4hours. Something that&#x27;s not painfully heavy if it&#x27;s off, but makes the last hour of the commute better. (I do 2hrs each way when I do it.)')
