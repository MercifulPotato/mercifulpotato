It was basically originally designed for Elon to drive around the cess pool that is Los Angeles&#x27;s highway system so it is mostly flawless in stop and go highway traffic. On long (&gt; 5 hour) commutes, I find that I&#x27;m less tense &#x2F; weary when I drove much of the way on autopilot. Granted, it is still not 100% so I do stay attentive at all times, but it means that I can (for example) look around and behind me to keep good situational awareness while knowing I&#x27;m safe to do so.')
