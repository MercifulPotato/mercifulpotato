You&#x27;re also insinuating that all Europe enacted policies that forced Roma in Europe into crime since they behave likewise everywhere in Europe this specific group of gypsies goes which is a preposterous assertion.<p>There are other groups of gypsies, in France for instance which live there and do not have that criminal culture. So no, the problem isn&#x27;t Bulgaria, or Romania, or France. The problem is criminal gangs that exploit their illiterate brothers and sisters, you can&#x27;t put the onus on European states, not today.')
