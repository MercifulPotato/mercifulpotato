The narrator leads by saying that cities are ponzi schemes and supports this by showing a cash flow graph, but that graph doesn&#x27;t seem to be grounded with any examples. I find it surprising that long term maintenance costs more than the long term tax revenue growth. I would&#x27;ve liked to see more evidence that these cities really are unsustainable.')
