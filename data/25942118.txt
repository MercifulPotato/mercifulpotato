It&#x27;s not a matter of &quot;helping my hedge fund broker friends&quot;, it&#x27;s a matter of &quot;how do we keep the SEC off our backs&quot;. Remember: Robinhood is already being charged with securities law violation for giving their customers a raw deal on order execution.<p>We usually don&#x27;t see distributed market manipulation like this, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a shitton of people buying GameStop to squeeze a short-seller breaks securities law. Does it feel good to get one up on a hedge fund idiot that was trying to manipulate GameStop the other way? Yes - but this is, at best, financial vigilantism.')
