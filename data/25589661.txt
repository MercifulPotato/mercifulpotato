Amazon gets flack for employment, and Google gets none. Only one of those two has made room for any significant number of close-to-minimum-wage workers.<p>This is a massively perverse incentive that prioritises how rich people feel about themselves over how people without much actually live. IMHO, that&#x27;s about as close to a working definition of evil as I can muster.<p>Semi-related: this is also why basic income will never work. Basic income will be seen, inevitably, as subsidising rich companies, which will lead to it being killed off.')
