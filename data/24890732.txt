Honeybees aren&#x27;t native to north america.  Nor are the majority of crops that they pollinate.  &quot;Invasive&quot;, by government definition, means not just foreign but also economically dangerous.  Conversely, screwworm <i>is native</i> but we chose to wipe that species from north american because it was economically dangerous.  I haven&#x27;t heard anyone talk of allowing it back.')
