I&#x27;ve been in homes where the toilets abut the street and drain directly into an open sewer that runs along the street.  Those sewers pool into a &quot;pond&quot; at the end of the street or subdivision.<p>Then layer on the smells of farming, cooking, heating and animal processing and you get some really dominant odors.<p>On one trip, my local hosts picked me up at the airport.  I spent the ride wondering whether to ask them why the air smelled so incredibly bad.  The sharp smells were a mix of sewage and burning flesh.  But my hosts were happy, sharing treats with me and excited to have me visit.  I felt it would be rude to ask such a question.  (Location unnamed.)<p>Another location was downwind of a sugarcane processing plant.  You may think the sweet smell of sugarcane would be all that you would smell.  You would be wrong.<p>Olfactory adaptation set in pretty quickly though.  I didn&#x27;t notice the smells after the first couple of days.<p>Our &quot;smells&quot; in the modernized west are tame by comparison.')
