I had a Bicycle-&gt;Car accident when I was 8 and I&#x27;ve always been told that&#x27;s when a number of my behaviors started to change (and I became the black sheep of the family I am now.) I didn&#x27;t get diagonsed with ADD until I was almost 30, but oddly enough my current care doctor also specializes in head trauma.')
