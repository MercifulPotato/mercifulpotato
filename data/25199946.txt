One has to snap out of it and figure out the reasons of these. They want a button, you must ask why and figure out the job to be done.<p>Second, from all the &#x27;features&#x27; which you figured out the problems for, what is common between the two (users and decision makers)? Is there a core&#x2F;common set you can extract ?<p>Third: you can sort of layer specific features of one and the other on top of the core, if there is a core, and propose two products. Depending the budget.<p>Lastly, it may be frustrating, but ultimately: who is paying you? If you&#x27;re doing consulting, you may provide input but the one who pays you have the last word. Get your input and their explicit decision to go a certain route in writing, and do what they ask of you.<p>I wrote a tiny bit about this here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;jugurthahadjar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1310668293305499653" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;jugurthahadjar&#x2F;status&#x2F;13106682933...</a><p>Again, spend time on <i>problems</i> and unearthing the underlying problems that the features they propose are solutions&#x2F;implementations to. Don&#x27;t let the product driven by feature proposition.')
