I&#x27;m just not sure I understand the relevance of most of your points with regard to the transportation between the two cities.<p>The easiest way to get from Chicago O&#x27;Hare to Detroit is flying (ORD-DTW is a straight-shot with Delta). The second easiest way is driving.<p>If you want to take the train, you have to plan ahead just a little. Know that the Amtrak from Chicago to Detroit departs from Union Station. The CTA will get you from O&#x27;Hare to Clinton, and then you just have to walk north 2 blocks. That&#x27;s it.<p>(Mind you, I visited Chicago pre-Google Maps and as a poor student. It can be done. I&#x27;ve also done Greyhound and yes I stopped in Chicago -- this was in 2002. Bus service in America is certainly very different from in most European countries, where it is used by students.)')
