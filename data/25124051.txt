There are simply too many concepts to understand and remember. For example, why is rebase so much more complicated while merging two branches seems fairly straightforward. Even after using it for quite some time, I almost always mess it up. In my opinion, git should abstract a lot of details from a regular user to make it more friendly and easier to learn.')
