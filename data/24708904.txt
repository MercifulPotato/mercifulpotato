This is then signed with a Bitcoin wallet&#x27;s identity private key and included as another output script in the transaction. The resulting Bitcoin transaction is sent to a destination Vapor API endpoint over HTTP.<p>&gt; A Vapor endpoint only accepts HTTP POST requests with a raw bitcoin transaction as payload. The endpoint parses the transaction to extract out authentication information, validates the signature, and then forwards the extracted HTTP request to relevant API endpoints.<p>I actually think this is probably better suited as a library, then there is no need for any intermediary calls that will inevitably increase latency. Also, would the vapor server somehow send the information about the public key on to the destination server?')
