The problem is that most people don&#x27;t know how to write a proper Makefile, even for a simple project, so make ends up doing more work than it should. For small projects, I&#x27;ve tried ninja a while ago, and frankly the effort seemed unjustified, since (a) I already could do the same things with make, and (b) make is already available on most unix-likes.<p>Ninja seems to be better suited for <i>big</i> projects, where make&#x27;s slowness in dependency resolution shows. Ninja files also look easier to generate automatically.')
