Item(by='SideburnsOfDoom', descendants=None, kids=[24982585, 24980519], score=None, time=1604411878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979525, text='&gt; I don’t buy this argument. No one says “Coal-stuff” or “Stuff-change” in the Anglophonic world, so to the extent that those constructs form a lower register,<p>I think you&#x27;re missing the point entirely. Of course no-one says those. Did you miss the &quot;that is an unfamiliar way to say it in English&quot; part? We do say &quot;coal&quot; and &quot;stuff&quot;, but we just switch up when talking about carbon, the stuff of coal.<p>The point is not that there are different dialects (although there are to an extent, but that&#x27;s an entirely sperate discussion) It&#x27;s that English vocabulary can be sorted into these two registers, a common and an academic one, and that this distinction is largely absent in several other European languages.<p>This may be &quot;an altogether different phenomena&quot; to what the author is describing, though that should not stop you buying it. Equivalently, it should not impede your purchase of the concept that English does have some form of &quot;high&#x2F;low language pairs&quot;.')
