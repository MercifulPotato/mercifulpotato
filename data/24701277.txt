Something like this may have been solved a long time ago.<p>Glad to see movement about this. Was just considering converting my XPS 9560 into a full Linux machine next week (I will miss fingerprint sensor support, which brings up another point about just upgrading to a model that supports it). Going to use it as a testing ground for switching over my main rig to Linux and seeing progress like this  is really encouraging that I’m making the right decision.<p>I will gladly install these test packages and help out.')
