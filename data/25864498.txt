Intel was suggested by an adult family member who did not have a tech background. That made up a majority of my portfolio. The rest of my portfolio was allocated to a stock I chose, Apple.<p>Reason for Apple: At my elementary school, everyone loved using the Power Mac G5&#x27;s during computer lab. Every kid had&#x2F;wanted an iPod or iTouch (and eventually iPhone).')
