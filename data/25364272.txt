The Democrats alleged a Russian disinformation campaign to interfere in the 2016 election. The truth of this claim is beyond debate, and is different from alleging widespread voter fraud. Whether Trump was directly involved is the only part up for dispute, because he and so many witnesses refused to answer questions or lied to protect themselves and&#x2F;or the president.<p>On the other hand, Trump has been complaining of election fraud since before he even became a politician. He claimed election fraud in the republican primary [1]. He complained of election fraud when he won the 2016 election. And finally, he complained of election fraud when he lost in 2020. He even alleged election fraud in 2012 [2]. A key difference here is he has absolutely no evidence to back up his claims.<p>The claims and their respective credibility are not equatable in good faith.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;694879900256354304" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;69487990025635430...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;266035509162303492" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realDonaldTrump&#x2F;status&#x2F;26603550916230349...</a>')
