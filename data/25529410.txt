Aside from the lack of ownership and autonomy at an individual level you also end up with increadibly fragile teams as theres no depth of experience.<p>If you have 7 people and they all do different things you spend more time finding things for people to do than working on valuable problems - much better to find people with overlapping skillsets in the domain you want to solve a problem then let them get on with it. So if you want to build some software - hire people that can write code, if you want to provide information - hire some writers. Hire smart people and they can do the bits around the edges &#x27;enterprises&#x27; think they need specialsists for.<p>&quot;A jack of all trades is master of none, but often times better than a master of one&quot;')
