Item(by='randomsearch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604045777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928353, text='&gt; Out of curiosity, as a Java enthusiast, I was wondering if you could give examples of what you feel is wrong?<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of criticism for Java&#x27;s language design. It involves an awful lot of boiler plate, and is generally very verbose. It&#x27;s also a language that forces you to use OO, and OO has received a lot of pushback over recent years - so that approach has become very unpopular.<p>Personally, I also think the use of so many design patterns is an attempt to compensate for what the language lacks, its reflection capabilities are flawed etc.<p>I don&#x27;t hate on Java. For many years it was my main language. It has awesome tooling and the JVM is incredible. But I do agree with most of the criticism.<p>I&#x27;ve been learning Clojure recently and Rich Hickey&#x27;s talks often begin with some motivation including criticism of Java and OO more generally, here&#x27;s one such video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VSdnJDO-xdg</a>')
