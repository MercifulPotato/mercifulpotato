Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25696857], score=None, time=1610164159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25696417, text='&gt; That&#x27;s a mistatement of what many of us are saying.<p>Actually I described you to the tee.<p>&gt; I certainly am not advocating that social media companies should have even more control over our lives<p>So you are against censorship or for it?<p>&gt; Since (a) is unlikely in the near term, that probably means (b). I don&#x27;t how Twitter banning anyone (including POTUS) from their platform does anything but encourage that.<p>Except that if tech companies collude together to prevent that. Fine, you say go make your own twitter. They do and then it gets banned from google play&#x2F;apple store&#x2F;etc. And down the line it goes. That&#x27;s my point.<p>&gt; I also don&#x27;t see how &quot;large corporations that have used psychological manipulation and network effects to become really popular must be consider public utilities, despite no law to that effect&quot; really lines up with free speech.<p>Who or what are you quoting? You just plucked a quote out of the ether. That&#x27;s very dishonest and disingenuous. You almost write like a journalist.<p>&gt; Do you believe that the NY Times should be required to print my op-ed&#x27;s in their online version?<p>Of course not. But then again, they are not a platform, they are publishers. But you already knew that.')
