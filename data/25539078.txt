I noticed that for some queries (Like &quot;How to brush teeth&quot;), there are more ads on the first page than results! They&#x27;re marked, but not in an immediately-visible way; I&#x27;d be most people integrate them with search results mentally.<p>I started throwing together a search engine about a week ago to address these concerns, and put it online yesterday. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pageref.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pageref.org</a>). I&#x27;m deliberately penalizing SEO abusers, and promoting websites that have high-quality content. Running custom searches on these sites in some cases based on keyword.<p>In a lot of cases, I&#x27;m throwing in search queries, and going through each result one at a time, and categorizing them; eg penalizing sites that use clickbait or scammy ads, that are low-quality but show up high in results etc, or probably aren&#x27;t relevant, but are highly SEO optimized, like Pinterest.')
