One thing I would love to see you in a Jupiter notebook, which some of the various deep learning experimentation start ups (wandb, etc) have is a local visual sink for time series data. For instance it would be great to be able to dynamically plot (maybe in the left or right margin of the window) loss over time for multiple runs, maybe with some dynamic ability to group graph.<p>I could envision hooking up the outputs of multiple executions of the same (or different) notebooks to these visualizations.<p>You can kinda get something like this with matplotlib or plotly but it has always felt kinda missing something.')
