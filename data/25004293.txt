The argument that he &quot;called for violence&quot; is not only uncharitable, it&#x27;s also blatantly untrue. He was making a comparison to the &quot;good old days&quot; where monarchs could publicly execute officials that weren&#x27;t in lockstep with their policies. Bannon&#x27;s argument is moot (as we don&#x27;t live in a monarchy), and he was just being hyperbolic.<p>Twitter and YouTube went off the rails and decided to ban him, which I do think is unfair. His polarizing domestic policy notwithstanding, Bannon was doing a pretty good job of keeping pressure on China with regard to the Hong Kong situation. He was a fairly regular guest on &quot;dissident&quot; HK news channels.')
