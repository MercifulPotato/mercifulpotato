Agree that slavery is just hidden now and called by a different name.. it&#x27;s sad, America with it&#x27;s literally unlimited resources can do much better for it&#x27;s own citizens, but it&#x27;s too divided on class and uses race problems to divert attention from the real problem that the lower classes are screwed over in every possible way.. I think if the politicians there were a little less corrupt it would have been so much more nicer for regular folk..')
