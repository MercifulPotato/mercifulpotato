I live in Queens and it&#x27;s not hard to get to Penn Station, but it&#x27;s also not hard for me to get to LaGuardia, either.<p>I can get to LaGuardia in a little less time than it takes to get to Penn Station, especially if I don&#x27;t go during peak rush hour. I have TSA Pre-check, so I typically don&#x27;t have to deal with 1 hour+ security lines.<p>When I head to DC, I take the train simply because it&#x27;s more comfortable, the trip is typically more consistent, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bringing &quot;bad&quot; items like a normal sized tube of toothpaste.<p>When I visit the DC suburbs and exurbs, as I have family and friends there, flying and particularly driving tend to ultimately come out ahead in terms of convenience and time.<p>Worth noting that more people live in Queens than Manhattan or Fairfax County, Virginia than DC.<p>Manhattan is definitely the center of the NY metro area, and virtually all business is conducted there, but that is much less true for DC. The DC suburbs actually have a ton of jobs.<p>It&#x27;s an imperfect analogy, but the DC area is perhaps closer to the Bay Area in terms of having multiple employment centers. Maybe more extreme.')
