Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=[25720813], score=None, time=1610306981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717297, text='Sorry, you&#x27;re right I went on a bit of a tangent there.<p>I guess the point I was making was that this violent language wouldn&#x27;t be spreading on Parler if Trump hadn&#x27;t have abused his Twitter account to drum up this kind of violent extremism with self-serving lies about a free and fair election.<p>Those hundreds of thousands of users flocked to Parler as a result of Twitter cracking down on this same type of violent speech. So is it really a surprise that AWS cracked down on them too for the same reasons? And Google? And Apple? And Shopify? And others? If you&#x27;re repeatedly running into bans and suspensions, it could be a multi-company conspiracy to silence you, or it could just be you. I guess that&#x27;s the debate.<p>The 1st amendment has limits like yelling &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater or coordinating to murder the VP of the US.<p>This isn&#x27;t the same free speech debate as a professor refusing to use gender-neutral pronouns or someone publishing racist research or someone touting conspiracy theories or someone blowing off steam. This is about a small number of users using a platform to illegally threaten and coordinate violence on others in very explicit and direct terms and that platform standing by their right to do so. The only thing stopping them from following through is their low numbers.<p>What do we want 2 years from now? Parler letting thousands of people threaten to murder Biden, Pelosi, AOC, Romney or every elected official that doesn&#x27;t subscribe to their version of reality? No way. History tells us this doesn&#x27;t end well. &quot;Fall in line or we&#x27;ll shun you&quot; politics is abhorrent. &quot;Fall in line or we&#x27;ll harm you&quot; politics is the absolute bottom of group behavior. We have laws against violent speech and conspiracy to commit murder for very valid reasons.')
