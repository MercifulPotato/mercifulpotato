If they don&#x27;t get paid, it doesn&#x27;t get made.<p>- The &#x27;yacht&#x27; analogy  wrong - the entertainment industry is full of money losing projects, and zillions of people working really hard on stuff <i>because they care</i> and not earning a lot of money. There surely probably more arbitrarily rich people in tech than in entertainment.')
