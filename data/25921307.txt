Even the concept of &quot;God&quot; seems like it&#x27;s been &#x27;re-framed&#x27; by science lately (in a good way) with many scientists having to admit that a simulation theory is as good as any other theory for our origins, and if we&#x27;re being simulated then by definition the thing doing the simulating is a &quot;god&quot;, by most definitions despite whether it is concerned with human feelings or what we call morality.<p>HN is definitely a great place to find others who are intellectually curious about these topics. It&#x27;s a shame that most people (in society at large) would rather discuss sports or entertainment, than the actual interesting scientific or philosophical things that matter more.')
