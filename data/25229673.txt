What you&#x27;ve given here is more of an aloof dismissal which is implicitly judgmental. If you&#x27;re willing to bucket peoples&#x27; minds into greatness or smallness based on a single observation of their message board activity, how is your response substantively different from the thing it&#x27;s criticizing?<p>This is to say that I reject the premise; your comment would put a chilling effect on frankly discussing other people, as though the only way to do so is through irrationality and gossip. People can critically discuss other people in an intelligent way without having &quot;small minds&quot;, and you shouldn&#x27;t attempt to infer a person&#x27;s overall &quot;mental state&quot; from this kind of commentary, in my opinion.')
