The wealth of Bezos, Gates, Musk, and others has surged 50-200%+ this year alone, all of whom were already astronomically wealthy to begin with, but have now pulled ever further ahead. What is the point of trying if there is no hope even coming close to even being even a tiny bit as successful as any of those people. You go to work and maybe hope to make enough to live  off of and have a retirement, but it still feels like what is the point if what you have is so far from this idealization of success.')
