Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=[25762543], score=None, time=1610518742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25758693, text='Your comment misunderstands the point of some most software.<p>Yes, some open source software (like Red Hat Enterprise Linux) is run by a company and has an expectation of support.<p>The vast majority of free software, from the GNU tools like gcc to the linux kernel to clang, does not have that expectation.<p>All free software has a license that lets you fork it (by definition)... and that&#x27;s where your reasonable expectations should end.<p>If you think the maintainer isn&#x27;t doing a good job working on the right issues or maintaining the project, that&#x27;s not the maintainer&#x27;s problem. That&#x27;s your problem. If you have the abilities to fork it and implement those changes yourself (realizing the maintainer does not have to incorporate those changes of course), go for it. If you can&#x27;t, well, your expectations are totally wrong.<p>If a maintainer actively looks for &quot;fame&quot; or actively pushes more people to use their software, that does not mean they have to provide support. That does not mean they have to live up to some standard you&#x27;ve made up in your head.<p>They should make a reasonable attempt to uphold any specific promises they make, but that&#x27;s about all they owe people, and if they promise to build a feature, then burn out, that&#x27;s okay too really.')
