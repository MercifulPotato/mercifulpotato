C.S. Lewis seems to resonate particularly well with me and with how I reason (same holds for Chesterton).<p>I think Lewis is right in blaming Bulverism. So I asked myself: can I identify a way in which Bulverism originates? How can I avoid it and how can I suggest other people to avoid it? Sorry for the excursus, but I hope someone will find it useful :D<p>It&#x27;s very interesting, to me at least, to notice that getting &quot;completely&quot; rid of bulverism seems very difficult - perhaps impossible? Perhaps because it&#x27;s part of how humans start the process of knowledge.<p>Let me explain...<p>Reasoning can go, a priori, in several different directions. Which one to pick? From a practical point of view, you pick the one that stimulates you the most: and this way, someone becomes a mathematician, someone else an engineer, someone else a poet, a doctor, and so on.<p>This movement has both some bulverism and some anti-bulverism: you hear someone speak, and a-priori, you feel like he&#x27;s right (is there a name for this fallacy too?).<p>And I think that starting the process of knowledge with some pre-conception is unavoidable and also what makes diversity possible. So when does a safe practice become a threat?<p>I think it&#x27;s when we lose faith in the positiveness of reality, that is: in the possibility of knowing what&#x27;s true and that this knowledge is what really makes us more humans.<p>Bulverism is saying that I value more what I think than what&#x27;s true, or that I value more to blame you than to affirm the truth.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see in how many way reasoning can go wrong once you exclude that reasoning has its natural end in the knowledge of what&#x27;s true.')
