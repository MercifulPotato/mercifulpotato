I wouldn&#x27;t count it out just yet. x265 has been released for many, many years and yet it&#x27;s not fully adopted by a long shot. Transitioning to new technologies takes time and a step back doesn&#x27;t proclude a step forward again, in the case of Qcom.<p>Especially considering AV1 is free, more efficient than x265, and pushed forward by powerful actors.')
