Swift is in pretty much the same situation, but for MacOS and iOS.<p>There&#x27;s no right or wrong answer here.  Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t define myself solely by using a single language.  After working on projects using various domain-specific languages like 4GL and others, I would certainly bear in mind the risks that such a commitment would entail.<p>While other commenters have mentioned the large iOS market share and the size of Apple, I would also caution that neither guarantee the longevity of the language or the relevance of your skills if they ever decide to pivot to something new.  And there&#x27;s plenty of historical precedent for that--I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s a matter of when, and not if, it will eventually be replaced.<p>Swift might eventually see wider adoption on other platforms.  However, people are rightly cautious of vendor-specific and&#x2F;or vendor-controlled languages, and I suspect its traction, like that of Objective-C, will remain low.')
