Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606264208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204367, text='VSCode has a progress bar (well a throbber) that shows up when the language server has waited long enough that the UI should show some activity. But for my workflows it only shows up when something has gone wrong. So when I see it, itâ€™s a good indicator to either restart TS server or reload the whole window. Not a great experience or solution!')
