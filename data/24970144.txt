It would be very easy for Russia or China to alter local elections by making a grainy video of a candidate appearing to smoke crack a la Rob Ford, for example). I&#x27;m afraid of people internalizing the idea that you can&#x27;t trust video at all. I agree with your criticism of the media on this, but from a slightly different angle... They are spreading that exact idea. True or not, it&#x27;s a dangerous idea.')
