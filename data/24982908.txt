Windows 8 was a trash fire of a tablet OS (no matter what Microsoft might say otherwise, that&#x27;s what it was) that I was fortunate enough never to have to experience first-hand on any of my devices, but that I did have enough experience with secondhand to see how bad it is.  Windows 10 is better than 8, but that&#x27;s a very low bar, and it&#x27;s still worse than 7.<p>Windows 10 has an absolute garbage mess of different configuration windows, some that look several decades old but at least are usable and some that have clearly been redesigned recently but which you can&#x27;t find anything in.  USB peripherals can either mount as drivers <i>or</i> as something called a &quot;Device&quot; (even if all they&#x27;re really doing is mounting as a drive), and the latter is completely unintuitive and nearly impossible to figure out how to unmount safely.  File&#x2F;application finding is a still a dumpster fire that never works for me.  There&#x27;s garbage Cortana integrated into the start menu that always seems to want to search the web via Bing (???!?!!), but can&#x27;t reliably find files or locally installed applications, even by exact name match.  If I wanted to search the Web I&#x27;d be searching in a Web browser!  Hell, even searching files by exact name or name prefix in the Finder search window just flat out doesn&#x27;t work.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how Windows 10 managed to get such fundamentals so completely broken.  I find that desktop Linux is actually more usable than Windows 10 simply because basic features like file search actually just work.  Unfortunately Windows still wins on compatibility with applications (and especially games) so I&#x27;m stuck with it, but if I could run everything I wanted on my Linux computer I&#x27;d ditch my Windows computer in a heartbeat.')
