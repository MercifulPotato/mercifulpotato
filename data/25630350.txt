One key thing I overlooked is that the service is often used in academic presentation situations, where you&#x27;re trying to log into the service on a 10-year-old lectern computer where you aren&#x27;t logged into your email account. I reverted to the generic UN&#x2F;PW approach and the complaints disappeared; passwords aren&#x27;t perfect, but at least they&#x27;re compatible with sticky notes. Plus, users prefer the familiar.<p>I won&#x27;t try the one-time-link approach again unless the app&#x27;s specific use case makes passwords extra painful.')
