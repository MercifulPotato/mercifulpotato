A world exists outside of the borders of the USA.<p>There&quot;s always someone bigger than you so &quot;tiny little&quot; is usually not a good platform for an argument.<p>&gt; If for some reason you still succeed, now you have to recruit tens of thousands of people to move to your tiny little country<p>Further, the idea that all employees of one company must work in one country is clearly not the case.
