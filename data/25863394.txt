Similarly, I just wanted to let you know in good faith how it came off very combative, going after a view of women that wasn&#x27;t represented in the post (at least to me). I understand different people have different views, and discussions of mate selection often come off as an incel&#x2F;misogynist dog whistle. That said, there are real conversations about mate selection, gender dynamics, and loneliness to be had. The hard part is how to do it without digressing into a male&#x2F;female blame game.<p>Edit: IF there is a problem with how men view women (and vice versa) we need to talk about why that is: the mothers, fathers, and society that raised them to hold those views.')
