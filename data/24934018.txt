And isn&#x27;t it true that someone wishing to affect an election, and in possession of real information, would take the exact same action? You can&#x27;t judge truth solely based on motive. That motive and action is consistent with the carefully timed release of either fake or real information.<p>The same was probably true of the person who leaked Trump&#x27;s tax returns before the election. Of course they were initially treated with caution, but the media worked to confirm their veracity. Here they won&#x27;t even ask the question.<p>I don&#x27;t think the emails contain anything very damaging to Biden, as far as I can tell. I think the cover-up, lack of care about truth, and blind zealotry is way worse than anything in the emails. I do happen to think the emails are &gt; 50% likely real, but the absolute refusal to consider them impartially is the actual problem, not the emails. It just shows neither pro-Trump nor anti-Trump give a single shit about truth. They just care about winning. Ideology trumps epistemology.')
