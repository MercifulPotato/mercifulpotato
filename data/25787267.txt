Every time someone asks me for &quot;computer&quot; help with their windows machines, I tell them I can only solve their problem installing Debian (which is true, I haven&#x27;t used Windows in a long time).<p>So far my mom and dad have been using Debian for the last 4 years and I had to assist them almost never (we live in 2 different continents). Both of them work with the computer, and my dad is that person that is not good with computers.<p>I&#x27;ve also installed Debian to at least 6 friends, who never had a complaint again.<p>I also thought a friend how to code, she got a job as a developer after 9 months, she picked up Debian&#x2F;linux super fast.<p>I hope it keeps getting better and better and easier.')
