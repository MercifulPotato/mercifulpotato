So, we built it. And now we&#x27;re releasing it.<p>We just put an upgraded version of our app, Cabana Health, on TestFlight - and we would LOVE some early feedback! (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cabana.health)<p>If you use the code HNFORUM in the &quot;Referred by&quot; section of our sign up list, I&#x27;ll be happy to get you on our app right away to try it out! [no waitlist for you!!]<p>I&#x27;m also interested... has anyone here been dealing with the issue my cofounder and I are trying to solve? Any wearable &#x2F; health app users here!?')
