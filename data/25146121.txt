It’s a bad thing. Them taking a 15% cut for no reason other than they can is bad, and evil.<p>The reason people shouldn’t be praising them for loosening their iron grip ever so slightly is because they are currently in the midst of the most antitrust scrutiny they’ve ever had to worry about. With that context, this 15% reduction is clearly nothing more than an underhanded deflection tactic.<p>The legal system is the only thing that’s going to help “indie” developers.
