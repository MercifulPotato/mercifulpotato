You need someone to delete torrents that claim to be video games but are actually ransomeware.<p>FreeNet is the same as BitTorrent, except that it has built-in support for updatable &quot;freepsites,&quot; so the content directories are built into the protocol instead of being run as regular websites. Also, it&#x27;s anonymous, and kinda slow. It&#x27;s actually really cool, and horribly underrated, but it doesn&#x27;t actually solve the schelling point problem. Which freepsite do you trust to have factually correct information?')
