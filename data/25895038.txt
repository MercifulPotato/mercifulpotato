If you don&#x27;t count the climate externalities I doubt there&#x27;s one city on Earth where the payback period (before incentives) is less than 10 years.<p>So there&#x27;s no point in making a spreadsheet at this point, really. You&#x27;re either buying solar out of need, a desire to &quot;green&quot; your life further, or you&#x27;re being paid by the government to do it, or buying at a loss.')
