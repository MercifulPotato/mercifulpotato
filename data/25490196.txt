Because both are true (at least in the PIV scenario).<p>The anti-sex folks are following old, overly simplistic, and ineffective campaigns to &quot;protect people from themselves (via their genitals)&quot;. Most of it is well intended but oh so wrong.<p>Edit: the only problem is the boundaries of power -- wanting to apply religious beliefs to the whole population rather than their particular sect.
