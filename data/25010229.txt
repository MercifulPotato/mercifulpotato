By staying there, you&#x27;re contributing to whatever is bad there.<p>If the problems could be fixed by individuals, someone else with much better reach and opportunity would most likely already have done so. I&#x27;m sure the problems are much bigger than what individuals or even big groups can do to fix, mostly because of the size of the city.<p>By moving away, to a better one, you&#x27;re draining away resources that it feeds on. At some point, the city has to fix its problems... and with most people gone, it&#x27;s very much likely that the problem becomes much more manageable for individuals and small groups.')
