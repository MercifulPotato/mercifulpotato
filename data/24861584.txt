On the mailing list they are upset that MELPA was included as an option, for example (they consider it evil).<p>The purpose of this survey is to get an idea of the preferences of Emacs users. Not to get an idea of the ideal Emacs users that rms cares for. Given how many MELPA packages many (most?) power users use, excluding their opinions makes for a pointless survey.<p>Kind of like asking people their views on healthcare, and not listing any option other than the universal healthcare options.')
