If you have two 30 year old males, both capable of work and one works a full time job, pay 1&#x2F;3 in taxes and the other guy chooses not to work and is effectively supported (in part) by the guy working, is that fair?  I think most people would say no.<p>And I don’t think it’s unique to capitalism.  Even in the Soviet Union they had “social parasites” who refused to contribute to society.  Same with communal societies without a monetary system.  People who can contribute but choose not to are pretty quickly pushed out.<p>And I see a lot of comments on HN about paying taxes as the cost of enjoying the benefits of society.  Even if you ignore the unfairness of one laborer paying for another laborer to be idle (even though they can work), isn’t it unfair to society for someone to not contribute to the system they benefit so greatly from?<p>And I’m not even an American.')
