(Each charger can charge one car at full speed, but if both cables are plugged in, it will charge each at a reduced speed.) They currently have ~60 chargers on a 5-building campus. Given the square footage of the campus and the parking minimums set by the city, they&#x27;d need 25x that in order to convert every single parking spot with a charger.<p>We&#x27;d need some pretty serious upgrades to our electrical transmission infrastructure to get L2 charging speeds from &quot;every lamppost&quot; as some would propose.')
