It&#x27;s pretty much exactly the same as I gave e.g. Github and Steam.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly expect Facebook to continue locking accounts used to just for VR. Locking accounts is expensive, both in terms of customer support and PR. They don&#x27;t want to do any more of it than they absolutely have to. Their team for preventing bulk account creation just hadn&#x27;t considered this particular use case. But there&#x27;s a ludicrous amount of signals available for non-bulkiness here, I expect them to sort it out very quickly.')
