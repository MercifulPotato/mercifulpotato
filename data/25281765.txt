If so, her wages would be material damage. Even if made off the clock, it could still be considered material because Google needs to pay someone to fix it.<p>Your voting&#x2F;property analogy is completely off-base. It completely ignores right of ways and public property. And if you have people actually trespassing on private property on the way to a polling place then they are in violation of the law and can be cited. I see no legal way that you can &quot;weaponize&quot; property law to prevent access to a polling location. Also, there&#x27;s nothing stopping employees from exercising their right to concerted efforts off company time and property.')
