The results &quot;have to be confirmed with different antibody tests,&quot; that look for the prevalence of antibodies that target other parts of the coronavirus.<p>&gt; His previous experience has shown that such antibody tests for the coronavirus&#x27; RBD can create a lot of false positives, Rutherford told Live Science. And because this is &quot;such an unexpected finding,&quot; it should be confirmed with other antibody tests such as those that look for antibodies against another one of the coronavirus&#x27; proteins, an outer coat called a &quot;nucleocapsid,&quot; which is also unique to the novel coronavirus, he said.<p>&gt; Still, &quot;it&#x27;s not totally outside the realm of possibility,&quot; that the virus circulated in Italy earlier than thought. because there is a lot of travel back and forth between China and Italy, especially northern Italy, he said. But considering the earliest COVID-19 case in Wuhan was reported to be in November, &quot;it really gives me pause to say let&#x27;s really make sure we got this right before we try and explain it,&quot; Rutherford said.
