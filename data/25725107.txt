Someone becomes the &quot;maintainer&quot; of a project, often through no skill of their own (they just showed up at the right time), which effectively makes them BDFL with infinite veto power. Hard-forks of popular projects are politically unpopular (for good reason), so that isn&#x27;t an option. Instead, the whole world of software that relies on a package is broken or fixed at the whim of one dude.')
