Obviously you&#x27;re a fan of the C2, but isn&#x27;t the point of this rower to open up a fitness experience for both new and pro users alike that&#x27;s different from what&#x27;s already been tried and tested in the market? I get the whole &quot;don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&quot; mindset, but the whole point of innovation is to broaden horizons and our experience with fitness. Plus, I saw that they have instruction videos on how to row, and just like any product, they&#x27;ve recommended starting on the easy levels and working your way up. Anyone that tosses themselves into the most difficult setting on anything without warming up is asking for an injury, and this goes beyond rowing.')
