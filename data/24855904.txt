Obviously there are cases like this, but I believe very few.<p>On the other hand reproducing the tone requires practice, and mostly practice with your vocal instrument.<p>I would imagine that kids who grow up in families where e.g. mother sings while cooking, don&#x27;t even notice how they practice at the age of 2 or so. But what is important, they train their voice, not only hearing.<p>It is like with colors. A person can see colors perfectly, but if you asked to mix acrylic paint to get chartreuse? Most of the population would struggle I would believe. We wouldn&#x27;t call these people color-blind.<p>However with music I feel we somehow mix tone-deafness and ability to sing&#x2F;reproduce tone.')
