Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610164311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691709, text='&gt; We are slowly squeezing a significant segment of the population out of public debate<p>Or maybe just a loud segment of the population.<p>~22% of the US population voted for Trump (75M out of 330M).<p>How many voted because they love Trump and his dangerous brand of politics? How many voted for him as an FU to liberals? And how many voted for Trump because they want conservative judges, lower taxes, a ban on abortion, etc. and are willing to hold their nose and vote for him?<p>Trump rallies were dwarfed by Obama’s crowds. Trump marches were dwarfed by BLM, climate and women’s marches. But the media loved every non-traditional thing he did and America was happy to watch the train wreck.<p>It’s an emotional time right now, but my neighbors with Trump flags are still nice people and are a far cry from the few hundred (or thousand) lunatics that are drumming up trouble.<p>If we can give folks direct representation or at least something other than winner take all voting, we might start getting the politicians we deserve.<p>Don’t forget, Trump had the lowest % primary vote share of a presidential candidate. He simply won because so many other candidates were splitting the vote. Put him head to head against other politicians and he loses. Give republicans ranked voice voting and I doubt he ever gets nominated.<p>This too shall pass, but I doubt it gets as big as the civil war some fear. A Republican will step up to fill the political void and reprint the party in their own image and voters will fall in line.')
