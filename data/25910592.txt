I wonder how busy it is nowadays?<p>last time i had anything to do with TDRSS (circa 2013), it was extremely busy, expensive, and it was the military that got the high bandwidth links. we could only use it to communicate with our research spacecraft during early orbit activities, or emergencies. and we got something like 2400 to 9600bps.')
