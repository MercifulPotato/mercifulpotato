This is doomed to fail. Every single extra dollar printed is pure inflation rather than wealth creation. All of the things people really want inflate while marginal crappy goods decline in quality and remain affordable. Housing, quality education, childcare, high quality food (think Whole Foods), good clothing and shoes - all of this stuff gets more expensive. If a UBI is ever implemented we will have a vast underclass of people barely surviving despite their “free money” and the wealthy will continue to get ever wealthier.')
