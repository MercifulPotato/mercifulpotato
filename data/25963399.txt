It was rather a broad series of events, most of which were unfortunately legal, some of which were probably not.<p>In that case I would be in favour of charging the ratings agencies with fraud, and possibly the financial regulators with gross incompetence.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t see it as &quot;big guys vs small guys&quot;.  I see it as &quot;law abiding people vs not&quot;.<p>So my reaction is not &quot;its unfair to prosecute the little guy,&quot; but rather &quot;we didnt get those criminals but at least we can get these criminals.&quot;')
