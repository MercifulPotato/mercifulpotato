It had just shy of 100% coverage. It used a malloc. I could <i>not</i> figure out how to trigger a malloc failure inside of a imported library running on a MySQL instance.<p>Do I not check for malloc failure (in order to get 100%)?<p>Or do I develop some sort of instrumented version of MySQL which lets me test malloc failure? That seemed far more overkill than warranted for the small project I worked on, though I certainly know some projects which do that!<p>I decided to accept 99.5% or so coverage and manual inspection of the failure case.')
