The event never gets processed because pub already sent it and recorded this fact.<p>Or, the sub side doesn&#x27;t reboot, the pub side does.  The pub side accepts an event for publishing, send it to the sub side, and promptly loses power.<p>The pub side reboots and either it resends the event and the sub side receives the event twice (because the pub side didn&#x27;t record that it had already sent it before power was lost), or it doesn&#x27;t resend the event and the sub side never receives it (because the power loss killed the network link while the packet was on its way out).<p>If you think you can make these and other corner cases go away with a simple bit of acknowledging here and there, good luck!<p>The corner cases <i>can</i> be solved, but it&#x27;s not half as simple as &quot;wait in a queue and be consumed when ready&quot;.')
