When I was flying bi-weekly, I made sure most international flights were with Finnair because no Boeings there, for that reason. Mostly everything was worse on Boeings (most experience is with BA; 100s of flights). But the sound was the worst. Maybe this is how the planes are kitted out by the carrier and I had bad luck in that regard?')
