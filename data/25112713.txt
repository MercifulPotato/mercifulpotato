There are many technical reasons to choose Linux over Windows. On mobile so will keep it short.<p>My desktop lacks Hyper-V. I went <i>years</i> thinking I can&#x27;t run Docker because of this fact. Turns out the PC has no such limitation when running Linux.<p>Years ago, tried using Meteor. It was practically unusable as I kept getting error after error. Multiple roundtrips searching and a ton of Windows-specific GitHub issues later, I gave up on the framework.<p>There are plenty of frameworks and dev tools that are an afterthought for Windows. This, of course, is due to Windows requiring often heavy extras to be compatible whereas Unix systems simply just work. Plenty devs just don&#x27;t Care that much whether their software runs on Windows. Those that do only consider it months, years even, after releasing for Mac and Linux.<p>Also relevant: MS have released new software or updates to macOS first. That is a testament to how poor their OS is when a vendor fails to release software primarily targeting its OS.')
