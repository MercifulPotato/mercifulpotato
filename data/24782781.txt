I wouldn&#x27;t want my employees to have to suffer each other or to have to consider political compatibility on teams.  There would be reasons to have political opinions when those were relevant to the work being done or the company&#x27;s actions, but it&#x27;s not to much to ask people to keep their irrelevant-to-work politics out of the workplace.')
