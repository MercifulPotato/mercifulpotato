Apart from the minor detail that modern (e.g. younger than a decade or so) PCs can go to stand-by mode and wake up within seconds at most, I&#x27;ve yet to come across commodity hard- and software that doesn&#x27;t do the same.<p>The current up time of my machine is 4 days 13 hours, 20 minutes - because I ran some system updates last week. Without those, even my mediocre machine running all the software I use on a daily basis (IDEs, web browser, several terminals) just keeps running for weeks on end and never ever crashes.<p>Am I just lucky or is this &quot;crashes and blue screens&quot;-business just a persistent memory from the late 90s and early 2000s?')
