When they filter our spam for you in Gmail, their software reads your emails. When you look up in Maps where you are, their service tracks where you are. By the way, you can delete your data and stop tracking anytime while continuing to use the service (something you could not do with your milkman or your plumber). They could always continue doing it behind your backs, but the milkman could also poison you. You have to trust them and take legal action if you catch them doing something that they are they aren&#x27;t.<p>When advertisers want to use Google, they tell Google where they want their ads. For example, a dental clinic can tell Google something along the lines of &quot;Show my ads in search engines to people in my area who are searching for &#x27;affordable dentist&#x27;&quot; and pay Google when people click the ads. The dental clinic never gets any user data from Google.')
