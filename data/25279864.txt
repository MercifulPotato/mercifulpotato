People are trying to spin this as some sort of union busting move. I don&#x27;t see it, this behavior is unacceptable regardless of what message is being spread.<p>Would it have been fine if she added a message to say &quot;Affirmative Action is racist&quot; when people browsed information about Proposition 16 on the 2020 California ballot? Sure, she definitely has the right to spread that message on her own time. But adding this message is definitely breaching expectations of professionalism, and abusing her developer role to spread a personal political message. And given that Google&#x2F;Alphabet is widely suspected of political bias, I it&#x27;s fair to let go of employees who cannot refrain from modify software to advance their political views.')
