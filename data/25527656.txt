The ZFS team also has a version.<p>You can Bing versions of that by using quotes &quot;fstest.c&quot;.<p>- the Luster&#x2F;Gluster maintainers&#x2F;consulting team used to just untar emacs on their distributed fs buildouts and see how many nodes left the cluster. (They lived off DARPA funding basically, and were paid to configure and install distributed fs for US govt&#x2F;military supercomputer installations, and fix the underlying bugs as found.)<p>- Ironically, the Ceph team did not own any commercial storage devices, so just tested on regular linux machines.<p>- Reiserfs 3 was the first GA log fs on linux (default on SUSE), so I was one of the earliest US users in production.<p>SUSE&#x27;s rep called me a liar at trade show, saying &quot;nobody uses our distro in the US. :) It worked well on email server loads, and could delete 1 million files in a directory in under 1 second. I followed the development of v4, but the &quot;wandering logs&quot; and &quot;dancing trees&quot;, etc. kind of wigged me out.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dancing_tree" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dancing_tree</a><p>Source: DBA and storage engineer.')
