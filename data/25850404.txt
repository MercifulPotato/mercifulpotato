For years now I&#x27;ve refused to install any extensions that aren&#x27;t too-big-to-compromise (which in practice - for me - means AdBlock Plus and maybe React Dev Tools), and that should be everyone&#x27;s policy. Any extension whose compromise wouldn&#x27;t damage the reputation of a billion-dollar organization is simply too juicy of an attack vector.')
