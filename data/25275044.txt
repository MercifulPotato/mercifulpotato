I would focus on helping the 50% of mentally stable homeless first, since many of those just need a temporary bridge to normalcy (fixed mailing address, Internet, shower, methadone, etc.)<p>Just speaking in general of how the long-term rent subsidy works in SF, you can research further starting with:<p>1) STEM workers can reinvent their careers fairly easily, but for most other people, it&#x27;s very unlikely switching careers will work later in life.<p>So when plants or mines close, social workers generally try to get them on long-term disability status (see below.) So we would have to work on that as a society.<p>2) a lot would be single moms, who automatically qualify for various subsidies<p>3) a lot would be people who figured out how to get on long-term disability, whether physical or mental.

The only groups with a sustained agenda are the public unions, who spend $1 billion&#x2F;year to get their way.<p>I might do a website in 2021 because things in writing are more actionable than sound bites.')
