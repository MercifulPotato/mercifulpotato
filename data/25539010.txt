Item(by='forty', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608930170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25538122, text='Ah I had never heard &quot;heterosexism&quot;, I learned a new word. I just checked a bunch of definitions, and I would now use &quot;heterocentrism&quot; for presumption of heterosexuallity - it&#x27;s possible to presume that without thinking it&#x27;s the norm, but just because in practice in many places it&#x27;s more common. Just like when I hear someone named Daniel(le) I assume it&#x27;s a man because I know more man Daniel than woman, but I do not think there is anything wrong or abnormal with a woman named that way. So yes I would kind of reserve sexism (or heterosexism now) for cases when the remark carries some negativity related to a given gender (or sexual orientation). And I still stick with my original impression that OP did not carry any negativity towards women (at least we can fairly give them &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;), but that they were just making a joke about living with someone else in general.<p>Sorry for the long thread and I hope I have not offended you. I&#x27;m always interested in having other points of views so I like this kind of discussion. Also English is not my native language, so there might have been things lost in translation.')
