I regularly check my mail server against tools like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mxtoolbox.com&#x2F;diagnostic.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mxtoolbox.com&#x2F;diagnostic.aspx</a>. If you just do one thing wrong, you will end up on some black list from which it is very difficult to get off. So far, I did not have any major problems, but after the initial default installation of Postfix in 2014, all my test mails to Google Mail went straight to Junk.<p>My server is at Hetzner, and there are some blacklists which block Hetzner IPs <i>by default</i>. You have to contact them, explain that your server is not a spam server, and hope to get whitelisted. In my case, it worked. T-Online in Germany also blocked my IP as well, but they were amazingly quick to whitelist it after I send them an email. They apologized and explained that they also block mail from Hetzner IPs by default.')
