Now days the devices are personal, you don&#x27;t have to have accounts to be identified, they are only good to sync between devices(like multiple devices and account restoration). Especially with apps, the moment you install the app you have your details there for good and they don&#x27;t go away accidentally like with the browsers.<p>I assume it&#x27;s about tracking but now I&#x27;m beginning to suspect that it&#x27;s simply a cargo cult mentality where no body asks why are we doing this.<p>I don&#x27;t proceed with anything that requires a form to be filled without having a good reason. I&#x27;m actually positive that I have a bank account that doesn&#x27;t have a login info, when I need to sign in from another device I would simply scan a barcode from the app to let me in.<p>Yet, there are apps asking me more questions than an immigration officer to let me use it.')
