Informal specifications are simpler and enable massive code reuse. Inheritance in OOP was meant to SRN able code reuse in static languages, but has largely failed. In OOP, library interoperability can only be achieved if all developers know a common set of subtypes that satisfy all cases, which can never be true. The granularity of trait systems is better, but still suffers from the same issue.')
