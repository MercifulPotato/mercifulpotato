I look for most important details, but they are scattered and not always crisp. I have looked around for APIs and toolboxes. They aren&#x27;t at par with what ML stacks (NLP&#x2F;BERT&#x2F;Deep Learning) has to offer. Can anyone suggest what is the best package&#x2F;tool&#x2F;API to do summarize news articles, say in 5 bullet points.')
