You publish all your recipes under a permissive license.<p>A restaurant chain starts selling your dishes, using your name, but, because of their scale, cheaper than you can afford to.<p>If you still manage to make money, you may be fine with that, but that’s where the correspondence breaks.<p>In real life, that restaurant chain offers a better product, not because its dishes are better, but because its restaurants are in better locations (have faster network connections), are closer to cinemas and theaters (they offer a zillion other products), etc., and, unlike with restaurants, you can’t make money by branding yourself as “the original”.<p>I don’t see that smaller restaurant staying in business, unless it starts making new recipes it keeps for itself.')
