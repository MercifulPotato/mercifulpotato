Wires are cheaper and more convenient ways of moving energy around than refrigerated&#x2F;insulated pipes or tankers.  So anywhere you can use electricity directly you probably would.  Batteries are already good enough for cars.  Hydrogen might be good for energy storage, but pumped hydro is probably simpler and cheaper where geography allows.<p>Hydrogen might be very useful for some applications that require high energy density (electrified aircraft, perhaps?), though maybe those use cases will be served by conventional liquid fuels that might be increasingly made using renewable energy inputs rather than made from fossil fuels.')
