By this standard, every single line of any C program is unsafe. Depending on the guarantees of other languages, this is true to varying degrees. I’m not familiar enough with Java and C# to comment on them specifically, but I’m not sure the try to provide the same guarantees that rust does.<p>I think all python, ruby, is, etc. would be considered unsafe. The unsafe keyword in rust seems more like the equivalent of saying “my static analyzer couldn’t guarantee the safety of this bit; it may or may not be totally fine”.<p>That said, I do agree that unsafe blocks can be red flags. At least they can help guide you in where to start looking for potential issues.')
