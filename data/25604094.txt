The Volta do Mar gave the Portuguese a safety net to experiment with navigating Cape Bojador without the certain death aspect. Careful data collection (speed&#x2F;direction of the ship&#x2F;wind&#x2F;water-current) and vector math provided a set of sailing instructions that was akin to a set of dance steps. The Portuguese sailed around the Cape of Good Hope but they navigated Cape Bojador with an algorithm.<p>What I find fascinating is that such a monumental moment in history is not well known.')
