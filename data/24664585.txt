Item(by='pR0Ps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601657959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24663189, text='&gt; The closest I&#x27;m come to mimicking Mac style on Windows to create an installer that does not actual install but extracts the contents to user&#x27;s temp directory and executes the application. Needed a simple solution so the end-user just had to download and double click to run the application since they might not have admin rights to install the application.<p>I create these self-extracting packages all the time too. Getting the icons and such right on the package can be a bit of a pain so I made a quick script[0] to automate the process. You may find it useful too.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pR0Ps&#x2F;make-sfx-package" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pR0Ps&#x2F;make-sfx-package</a>')
