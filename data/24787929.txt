It was the last one ever, which you can force-reset so it does count how many times a color cassette been used. I can refill those cassettes from half liter buckets from ebay for â‚¬10. It is just incredibly reliable.<p>One and only problem is that only the XP-windows Samsung printer drivers work truly well. But I have 2008 laptop for that.')
