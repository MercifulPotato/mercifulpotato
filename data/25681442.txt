Caveat being that with the pandemic I&#x27;ve exclusively used them at home, they&#x27;re hosted on private infrastructure. It was a bit of a thing to set up, not being familiar with Matrix at all before, but now it&#x27;s a docker-compose file.<p>To be clear, I send messages from my Matrix client to my Matrix server, software running on that server bridges it to WhatsApp&#x2F;Signal as appropriate, same for incoming messages. Photos work as well.<p>I think WhatsApp relies on a data connection to your phone, and the bridge will disconnect whenever that drops. Having set this all up, I&#x27;m a pretty big convert to Matrix - just need to get the world on board. I&#x27;d love to have an SMS bridge as well, see how far I can go.')
