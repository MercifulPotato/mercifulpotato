Item(by='mikehearn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607658055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381242, text='For anyone new to Cypress, there are two things that I consider killer features:<p>1. It saves a snapshot of the DOM state before&#x2F;after each test step. If you have a long acceptance test where it&#x27;s deeply navigating through your app (i.e. visit &quot;&#x2F;admin&quot;, click on &quot;Login&quot;, type &quot;username&quot;, click &quot;Submit&quot;), using the GUI test runner will show each individual step in a side-panel. From there, you can hover over a step to see a snapshot of what the page looked like before that step was executed, and a snapshot of what it looked like after.<p>I had previously only used test runners where, when it would run the acceptance test, you would see a series of really quick flashes of the runner executing a bunch of steps faster than my eye could track, and then a big FAILED message. What failed? How did it fail? Cypress solves this problem by saving the DOM state and allowing me to traverse backwards through the state of the app until I find where things started to go wrong.<p>2. The cli test runner records a video of its test runs. Super useful in CI where you don&#x27;t have access to the frontend. Cypress will record its run to an MP4 and you can investigate failures after-the-fact. This has solved a lot of &quot;it works on my machine but not in CI&quot; problems that seem to come up pretty often.<p>The other positive thing I have to say about Cypress is that I&#x27;ve actually found it more helpful as a development sidekick tool than as a test runner. Particularly when developing features on the front-end that require a lot of user interaction, many times it&#x27;s easier for me to whip up a quick Cypress test that automates the user interaction (with assertions along the way to make sure the app is working) and then use the GUI Test Runner to do all my debugging.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect and I definitely have some frustrations with it, but on the whole it&#x27;s helped my productivity quite a bit.')
