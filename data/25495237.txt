Some people would prefer a larger screen size, for example.<p>&gt; &gt; Could there be some refinements to my 2015 MBA ?<p>&gt; I upgraded from a 2015 (I think) MBA to a 2018 model (both 13&quot; ones), and two actual improvements that I like are: larger trackpad size, and smaller overall dimensions (so there&#x27;s a smaller bezel around the screen, for example).<p>I&#x27;ll agree that 13&quot; rather than 11&quot;seems to be a sweet spot for size, and the air deserves credit for popularizing that size. 13&quot; is as small as you need to fit in a backpack, and still stupidly light. I suspect the air and it&#x27;s competitors (surface book, xps, spectre) are what killed off the sub 10&quot; netbook&#x2F;palmtop form factor.')
