I’m still undecided of if the notifications will be daily or when the channel puts out new content. This idea steams from me discovering that YouTube cancelled email notifications 3 months ago .<p>Also , I’m sure that the YouTube api has a limit of resource to be consumed by one API key . Any ideas of how to automatically enable a new user’s api key to make the call , instead of my api key ?<p>I&#x27;ll appreciate any feedback on this idea or suggestions for ideas I can add on to this current idea.<p>Thanks in advance.')
