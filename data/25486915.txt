To do that, they needed a computer, so an underdog British company came up with a good one. And when that little company needed to build a faster CPU, because Intel couldn&#x27;t be bothered to answer their calls, they made their own. This in-house CPU just so happened to not use much power or make much heat, which got the attention of Apple, who used it to power what most people consider to be its biggest failure. From there, of course, the company went on to take over the fucking world.\nIf I made that up, you&#x27;d say I was trying too hard to be quirky or that I&#x27;d seen too many Wes Anderson movies. But that&#x27;s reality.&quot;')
