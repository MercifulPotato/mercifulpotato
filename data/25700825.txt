I don&#x27;t think we could exist without section 230, because it would have been too expensive to start without immunity for what our users posted. So, it still does it&#x27;s initial purpose.<p>I would also like to start a social network for my local community, but I can&#x27;t afford the legal liability of what my neighbors might say on the platform I built. If 230 goes away, maybe I&#x27;ll never be able to build that community. And don&#x27;t forget, FB started at a single college.<p>I&#x27;m also sure that the initial individuals posting things are exactly the correct individuals to be liable for the things they post.')
