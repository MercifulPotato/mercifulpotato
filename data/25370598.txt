Having seen their dev process from the inside it is an absolute nightmare. They give zero shits about the wellfare of their devs nor about their contribution to open source.<p>The only reason they ever release things to open source is to try to get people to use their paid services. Eg: attention. They view open source only as an advertisement and nothing more.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that they use open source. It is that they spend a lot of dev times fixing all the bugs and then don&#x27;t contribute them back upstream. They have sooo many internal patches that should go back but they go &quot;if we contributed them back people wouldn&#x27;t use our more reliable paid service based on that&quot;.<p>They are the exact opposite of the healthy hacker mentality that has brought Linux to the state it is today. Fuck Amazon * 100.<p>The world isn&#x27;t a better place in any way with them. Their services aren&#x27;t cheap in any sense.<p>Also, behind the scenes all those services you think are &quot;ultra stable&quot; are actual unstable and flaky as hell. Ask anyone who has worked at Amazon for more than a year and they&#x27;ll tell you that it is constantly in pants on fire mode. All engineers are required to be on call because they have that many fires every single fucking day.')
