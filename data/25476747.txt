Item(by='yodsanklai', descendants=None, kids=[25476782, 25476857], score=None, time=1608377242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25472823, text='&gt; Long hours and a lack of job security, combined with workplace bullying and discrimination, are forcing many to consider leaving science<p>I&#x27;ve never encountered any form of bullying or discrimination in my 15 years academic career (in three different countries).<p>What I witnessed a few times though where post-docs that just got disinterested in their work and unproductive for months. It&#x27;s not uncommon for post-docs spending months looking for their next job, and usually, their advisors are fine with that. They understand well the difficulties of their students or post-docs.<p>Academia is hard because it&#x27;s extremely competitive, not because professors are some kind of bullies harassing their students. I&#x27;m certain it exists but it&#x27;s far from the norm.<p>It&#x27;s competitive because you&#x27;re competing with the whole world, and there are some people out there who are much smarter than you. And you are constantly reminded of this fact, when you go to a conference (or because you don&#x27;t get to go because your paper isn&#x27;t accepted), when you read your colleague&#x27;s paper and so on. I&#x27;ve worked with well-known people (including a Turing award recipient), and even them were insecure at times.<p>And of course, it&#x27;s hard because you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll find a job after your current post-doc. The more average you are, the more insecurity, the harder it gets.')
