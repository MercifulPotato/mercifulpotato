OKC is also the capital (of Oklahoma). I won&#x27;t touch culture because it&#x27;s pretty pompous to assign culture to a single location. I&#x27;m sure the Sami people disagree with your location of the center of culture,<p>I&#x27;m not comparing cities and I certainly am not implying OKC is the same as Helsinki. Merely pointing out that the OP&#x27;s comment about Helsinki being a large city with clean air sounded as silly to me as saying OKC is a large city with clean air.')
