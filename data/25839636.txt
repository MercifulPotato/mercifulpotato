Speedsubs are no longer a concern for fansubbing these days.<p>That&#x27;s exactly why the quality has gone down, due to these speed subs.  Back in the day speed subs were not a thing.  They popped up when legal subs started popping up, almost as a way to compete.<p>I think the first big name speed sub group was horriblesubs, and they still exist today.  Today fansubs are dominated by these groups.  They&#x27;re quality is okay to good.  Sometimes they&#x27;re the only option now, so I&#x27;d say the quality has gone down.<p>Back in the 4:3 days when anime was vbr and sources were interlaced fansub groups would go through frame by frame doing pulldown and denoising.  It was amazing.  They&#x27;d have high quality karaoke in the opening and ending scenes.  When&#x27;s the last time you&#x27;ve seen high quality karaoke on fansubs?<p>No, quality has gone down.  They don&#x27;t even do color correction today.  Maybe in the last 3 years or so fansub quality has gone up a bit, but it&#x27;s not a lot.. not enough for me to notice much.<p>&gt;speaking as an amateur translator myself I always think it&#x27;s good for the viewer to have alternative interpretations for more difficult-to-translate passages.<p>Yah.  You don&#x27;t often see translation notes any more either.')
