Typically you&#x27;d contract DEC or a third party to come out semi-annually to vacuum things out, apply field fixes (yes, run wires on boards and the backplane), and run hardware diagnostics.<p>There were a lot of wire-wrap connections on those things. If they had been done right you were good. Done wrong, and your system was haunted until someone found the loose wire. We had an 11&#x2F;45 with a flaky Unibus bay that could be &quot;fixed&quot; with a little percussive ablation. Finally got DEC to get serious about the problem, and they spent several days tracking down a bad socket.<p>I don&#x27;t miss wire wrap. At all.<p>We have it good these days. Rack a bunch of servers, run them hard for years with only DIMM replacements or maybe the odd SSD, and recycle them once the bathtub failures start edging up. I don&#x27;t want to think about the comparable compute power; my wristwatch runs rings around that 11&#x2F;45. We live in the future.')
