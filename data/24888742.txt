The difference between &quot;possible&quot; and &quot;impossible&quot; is \\eps &lt;&lt; 1 - there&#x27;s no real distinction to be made there in practical statistical terms.<p>Likewise asserting that California with a 3% chance of going Trump is absurd is an unreasonable degree of overconfidence. Assuming maximizing expected return, the author is implying that they would be willing to take a bet that Trump would lose California with odds &gt;&gt; 97::3, i.e. presumably they would take a bet where I bet $1 to every $99 they bet. To be critical of a model based on outcomes it predicts with tiny probability you need truly remarkably biased priors.')
