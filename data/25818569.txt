Otherwise known as QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter. Read that as many times as you need to break you of any preconceived notions about how light works.<p>As for sin waves etc. It&#x27;s better think of light oscillation between it&#x27;s energy as an electric field and a magnetic field at right angles to each other. Although I think that&#x27;s kinda gross and wrong.<p>As for an antenna producing visible light, in theory there isn&#x27;t any reason. Because radio waves are light. The problem is practicalities.')
