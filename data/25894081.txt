The original purchase price for ARM was something like 100 - 120 P&#x2F;E in 2016. And the current earnings are <i>still</i> 100 -120 P&#x2F;E with no immediate or short term profits growth. The prospect of the company&#x27;s fundamentals and future growth hasn&#x27;t changed since 2016.<p>Who in the right mind would want to buy a company for P&#x2F;E 100+ with no visible growth factor?<p>And since no one wants to buy it, Softbank had to find a buyer. Softbank is one of the largest shareholders in Nvidia. And with its current stock price that was a perfect fit.<p>Of course that is ignoring Nvidia could have said No. I guess Softbank could decide to liquidate its position on Nvidia instead.')
