In the middle scenario where most first-to-recursive DNS calls are DPRIVE but the authoritatives overwhelmingly aren&#x27;t you get free security by just checking the &quot;use DNSSEC&quot; box and so browsers may just begin doing that, maybe gradually or maybe as a result of a headline making incident. See also the curious case of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. (Basically if you don&#x27;t implement SCSV then unsafe fallbacks are too dangerous to attempt, but anybody implementing SCSV doesn&#x27;t need an unsafe fallback anyway, so, forget this new protocol feature just never do unsafe fallbacks, duh)<p>Once you&#x27;re checking that box, DANE is almost free. Egos involved may determine that it&#x27;s important to never technically do DANE, so as to save face, see also why TLS 1.3 isn&#x27;t just named SSL 3.4 or SSL 4.0 even though that&#x27;s what it &quot;is&quot; in some sense. But the effect, yes. If that scenario plays out it&#x27;s what will happen.<p>One blocker for DNSSEC and thus DANE was deployability difficulties facing middleboxes. But middleboxes have choked so much else since that today &quot;defeat middleboxes&quot; is just table stakes. It was needed for TLS 1.3 and it&#x27;s needed for QUIC and for HTTPS DNS records and... if you&#x27;re defeating middleboxes anyway you might as well have DNSSEC.')
