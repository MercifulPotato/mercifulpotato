If the grocery does well, it builds wealth for the neighborhood (since they&#x27;re all co-owners), and they fill a need that the community had to boot without some big corporate grocery coming in and refusing to stock fresh vegetables because it&#x27;s not a wealthy neighborhood and they think they&#x27;ll sell more packaged goods or whatever the case may be.<p>In another part of the city, we&#x27;re trying to start a co-operative ISP because the only options are AT&amp;T and Spectrum, both of which are garbage in my opinion and screw their customers over at every turn. Others are building community gardens, or greenspaces, etc. and when these things are built they do more than just fix the individual need, they help foster ownership which makes people less likely to litter, or smash mailboxes, or whatever problems the neighborhood has.')
