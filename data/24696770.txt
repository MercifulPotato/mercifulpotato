This makes an un-license seem desirable, as it&#x27;s freedom from restriction. This also matches our behavior: code on a blog post is assumed to be free to copy and use, unless it has a license attached that limits this freedom.<p>In reality of course the base state is reversed: having no license means you are allowed approximately nothing, and a license gives you (often limited) rights to do something with it. In reality an un-license would take away rights you previously have been granted.<p>It feels like we are on the threshold to license becoming a Janus word.')
