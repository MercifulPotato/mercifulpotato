How much &amp; for how long I have no idea.<p>If a couple minutes&#x2F; hours just running some more hydrogen through the shutdown reactor might be enough. Otherwise passive or active cooling loops and radiators could be needed.<p>Or maybe not enough fission byproducts form during the tens of minutes the reactor is active and cooling after a burn is not a major concern?')
