No one who has been around views this as some noble moral crusade. But WSB went from &lt;1M subs in 2019 to 2M by end of 2020, to 6M now. We didn’t magically orchestrate it, they flocked to WSB after every media outlet in the world mentioned it for a week+ straight since Gamestop happened. Its an open forum and we don’t decide who joins, or when, or what they post. When 4M new people show up in a sub of 2M in a week, its Theseus’ ship twice over at warp speed.')
