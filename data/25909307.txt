I mean, it&#x27;s really a lot of people.  It&#x27;s pretty unmistakable.<p>The tent cities do make them more noticeable, though.  Also, the police used to be able to roust people illegally camping, so if you had somewhere else to go, you&#x27;d have to go, or else go to the shelter.<p>Now people have the option to refuse the alternatives.
