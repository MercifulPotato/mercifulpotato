It returns 1920x1080x32, but my actual window resolution is something like 1880x1020x32 (I use swaywm and leave gaps around windows for a border).  If I resize the window to 300x700, the tool returns 1440x900x32. If I disable all my extensions and Firefox&#x27;s enhanced tracking protection, it always returns 1920x1080x32.<p>I&#x27;m using swaywm, so maybe this is an (unintentional?) feature of wayland.')
