Every comment thread here is encumbered with you pointing out that you wouldn&#x27;t like it if async were the default, fair enough. In fact, you don&#x27;t seem to like the idea in general.<p>ctrl-f &quot;sanxiyn&quot; yields 28 instances, most of them restating in every subtree the same point about how you think threads &gt; async.<p>Since I think most of us tend to read the comments section top to bottom, it seems ideal to limit your opinion to a couple comments and then put your effort into making those comments a good rundown of your position. It would certainly be more interesting to read and consider.')
