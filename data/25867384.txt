If demand for insta-cart is dropping I would wager that doesn&#x27;t bode well for its use in the future regardless of the level of talent&#x2F;exploitation of the employees.<p>In other words, if all of a sudden insta-cart was much more generous with their employees and managed to hire better talent, that wouldn&#x27;t likely translate into more demand for their product.  Yes places like Trader Joes treat their workers well (and build brand around that) - the lions share of demand revolves around on merits&#x2F;price.  I wish it was more along your factor but sense that it isn&#x27;t a factor with an order of magnitude change associated with it.')
