Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25585077], score=None, time=1609300025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578161, text='&gt;<i>The country that was founded on the principal of religious freedom, by people that fled religious persecution, and felt so strongly as to list religious freedom as item number one in their list of human rights, does not need to be &quot;much better&quot; to call out religious slave labor camps.</i><p>&quot;The country that founded on the principal of religious freedom&quot; is nationalistic trite, like &quot;land of the free&quot; (which ended slavery later than other western countries, gave poor, blacks, and women the vote later, has 25% of the world&#x27;s prison population, and so on), and &quot;home of the brave&quot; (where the Army is professional and the majority of the population had never had the chance to fight in any war or suffer any war domestically for over a century, so one wonders how&#x2F;what this &quot;braveness&quot; is measured with and against).<p>First, what the country was &quot;founded on&quot; means little. What the country has historically did and up to now does (warred, enslaved, invaded, occupied, strong-armed, intimidated, etc.) matters more.<p>Second, the fact that a country was founded by religious hardcores literally thrown out of Europe for being such, and that they wanted &quot;religious freedom&quot; in their new dwellings so as to they not kill each other, doesn&#x27;t give it any special moral high ground. Heck, if it was up to any of the religious sects that ended up there, the others would be illegal (the US still has the most fundamentalist religious people in the West, which when they had the upper hand were ok with forcing their will as law on anything from abortions to music releases). But they needed &quot;religious freedom&quot; because none of them had the power over all the other denominations (all Christian at the time, mostly variations of protestantism), and thus they made a virtue out of necessity.<p>Not to mention that they still managed all together to opress the blacks (nuff said), the native americans (&quot;trail of tears&quot;), the early Chinese, Irish, etc immigrants, and so on...')
