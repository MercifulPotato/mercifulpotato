At most there is “Jack of several trades”.<p>My background is game dev. The typical “Jack of all trades” webdev has minimal overlap with game dev skills. Unless it’s working on the backend of a mobile game, in which case the overlap is enormous. The skill sets of a “Jack of all trades” AAA console dev and “Jack of all trades” webdev are extremely different.<p>Point is you do have speciality skills. Identify them, embrace them, and don’t sell yourself short.')
