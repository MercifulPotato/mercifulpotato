Item(by='benhurmarcel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609330900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580192, text='I try to use Apple Maps when I can because the app is much simpler, smoother, and impacts the battery a lot less. I find the traffic data to be good. But it&#x27;s still lacking in quite a few areas (in western Europe at least). Basically for now it&#x27;s usable if you already know where you&#x27;re going, and it&#x27;s not a long road trip, and you&#x27;re not cycling.<p>- Their data isn&#x27;t as good. Easily half the businesses are missing, and most businesses don&#x27;t have details like hours. Even the road type and quality is unreliable in some areas, leading the routing to prefer bad roads that are technically shorter in length but worse in time in reality.<p>- No reviews, although it&#x27;s coming in the future it seems.<p>- Speed limits aren&#x27;t indicated.<p>- Speed traps aren&#x27;t indicated.<p>- No cycling directions even in major cities, although it&#x27;s coming slowly.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t display areas of interest, like Google Maps does in yellow. That is essential in a city you&#x27;re not familiar with, to know where to go to find active streets.<p>- No street view in most places, although it&#x27;s also coming slowly. I find it very useful quite often, like finding a street with free parking before navigating there.<p>- Transit directions use theoretical schedules, not real-time. Google Maps doesn&#x27;t either, but Citymapper&#x2F;Transit does.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t have data on &quot;busy times&quot;.<p>I wish there was a way to contribute more efficiently to the map. That app is improving slowly but it could be much faster with trusted local mappers (or local employed mappers).<p>In my opinion Apple Maps could &quot;easily&quot; get a significant lead on Google Maps if they added toll prices, especially if it optimized your route for time vs price. It&#x27;s a major feature missing from every service now.')
