Item(by='GirkovArpa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604478331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987234, text='Fascinated as I am by an up-and-coming Electron rival, I set out to prove (mostly to myself) how easy (or challenging!) it would be to try the 7 tasks brought to my attention in the recent post here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24958725" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24958725</a><p>The scripting language (TIScript) is very similar to JavaScript.  My opinion is more-or-less the same as this commment&#x27;s here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23509653" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23509653</a><p><i>&quot;the different script language may be annoying the first day but you&#x27;ll get used to it&quot;</i><p>A version using actual JavaScript is in development, and I actually tried doing the 7GUIs tasks with it here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GirkovArpa&#x2F;sciter-js-7guis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GirkovArpa&#x2F;sciter-js-7guis</a><p>But I hit some roadblocks based on not-yet-implemented JavaScript features.  It looks promising but it&#x27;s not quite there yet.<p>TIScript was probably better than JavaScript all-around back before ES6; I believe its syntax of $(selector) is copied from jQuery.  It has some neat syntax not yet implemented in JavaScript though, like:<p>element.style.set { &quot;background-color&quot;: &quot;red&quot; }<p>And JSX:<p>element.$append(&lt;button&gt;Click!&lt;&#x2F;button&gt;)<p>There&#x27;s a ton of other stuff I haven&#x27;t yet explored.  I know Sciter gets posted a lot here but I think it does truly deserve more recognition.')
