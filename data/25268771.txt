Dear god that sounds awful.<p>Just curious, why does that sound awful to you? Are you worried that it will take a long time to relink the binaries? The oasis build system is incremental, so updates to a library only involve relinking dependent binaries, which is quite fast. Even a full rebuild from scratch only takes a few minutes (assuming you have the sources downloaded already).<p>If it&#x27;s just the idea of relinking all the dependencies over and over again, note that with dynamic linking you do this at runtime every time you execute a binary.')
