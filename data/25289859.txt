Once the oil is there, all you really need is a storage system, and a way for consumers to buy it.<p>There&#x27;s no need to pump it around, at all.  You can transport it by truck.  Growing up, my family had a fuel oil heater.  We&#x27;d have the tank filled periodically, and that was all there was.  Likewise, gas pumps are just storage tanks hooked up to pumps.  There&#x27;s practically nothing to it; it&#x27;s all basically 19th century technology that&#x27;s easy to build, and doesn&#x27;t require any sophisticated engineering.')
