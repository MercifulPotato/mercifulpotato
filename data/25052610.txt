This also goes hand in hand with things like observed differences in answers of in-person surveys when the person doing the survey is&#x2F;isn&#x27;t from the same demographic as the person being surveyed.<p>A disproportional amount of people (after controlling for race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;income&#x2F;education&#x2F;etc) simply refusing to answer the survey has similar but conceptually different effect; one that (as the OP claims - perhaps they&#x27;re mistaken) is new and had not been a significant factor before.')
