Ahoy, industrial espionage!<p>It&#x27;s not actually that easy to tap into internet communications. Even without encryption it would be a huge challenge to spy on someone.<p>A government could obviously do it. A medium-sized corporation? Not likely.<p>&gt; because the legislation rarely moves that quickly<p>Just legislate &quot;encryption that takes no more than $80,000 to break, indexed for inflation&quot;, and it will auto adjust as computers get faster. (i.e. legislate the cost, not the key-strength.)<p>&gt; the journalists and human rights activists use encryption to keep their correspondence concealed chiefly from the government. And there are other governments on this planet, not just US.<p>Those other governments can just outlaw encryption then entirely. My idea is specifically for governments that are gentle enough to allow normal people privacy. Authoritarian governments are not going to be limited by a law.')
