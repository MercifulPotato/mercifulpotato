That&#x27;s not what I call audit. Audit is supposed to be multiple pair of eyes during counting. Plus you&#x27;d possibly lose the anonymity of the vote if the voter did both (timestamping transactions and so on).<p>If all counting machines are the same, how do you know they&#x27;re not all wrong? Or not all tampered with?<p>And even if they all give you the same results, how do you know it&#x27;s actually correct or how do you decide to recount? You have no real way to: you have to count. So at that point you might as well have counted in the first place.<p>Ideally you should have multiple vendors and make sure they all give the same results. But who&#x27;s going to do that?')
