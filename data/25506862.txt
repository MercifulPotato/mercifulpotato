I wonder if it was a precursor to Tufte&#x27;s work.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand the difference between an ontology&#x2F;taxonomy and a process, and then apply that to your diagram metaphors.<p>A process, you should be able to script using the dot graph notation on websequencediagrams(.com). If you can&#x27;t, you haven&#x27;t thought through what you&#x27;re doing and it&#x27;s going to cost you down the road. I&#x27;d go so far as to make the provocative assertion that you only understand anything insomuch as you can represent it in a sequence diagram.<p>If you are using nested boxes, you are really using a tree graph or a digraph for an ontology&#x2F;taxonomy or a sankey diagram, and the layouts of nested boxes almost never add meaningful information or make sense. They are just obfuscated graphs. Part of why I hate powerpoint is because it&#x27;s designed to be stupid, because by virtue of pure survivor bias stupid is necessarily powerful, and so it only provides stupid templates.<p>The point of a visual metaphor is that the implied symmetry represents equivalence and completeness, and where it is asymmetrical, it implies there are other combinations or variations of the things you&#x27;re talking about that may be options or counter cases. If it&#x27;s unbalanced without specific intent, it signifies incomplete thinking.<p>If you are using nested boxes with lines between them, you&#x27;re probably mixing categories and getting the conceptual equivalent to a type error. This can be a hard conversation because what the creator thinks is just an arbitrary aesthetic choice yields a gap in their logic, and that can cause them to take it very personally.')
