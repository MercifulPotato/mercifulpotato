My contention is with queues as a means to communicate between systems. Queues <i>within</i> systems are totally reasonable.<p>For instance - You have 2 services: Bank Core Integration and Teller. The Bank Core Integration service contains the queue of items that need to ultimately be pushed to the underlying legacy, rate-limited system. The teller service operates in RPC terms with the bank core integration service, so callers into the problem area are isolated from the semantics.<p>This might sound like a subtle difference, but it is huge in practice. If there is some problem with that queue, it is entirely contained to that one service and can be dealt with in isolation. Logs from that one service should comprehensively document the concern. If there was a message bus between these systems, you would have to go back and review message logs to see if things got missed between systems.')
