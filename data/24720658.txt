First you have to decide if you want to slowly amass karma by comments, or try to get lucky by submitting links. Submitting links is easier if you have a source to draw upon. There is a newest links page on a certain crustacean-named website which is a good source for this. If you&#x27;ve been reading HN, then you should have a good idea which articles will appeal to this audience and curating these links (mostly based on the headline) is a 5-10 minute exercise. Think of it as link arbitrage.<p>Posting comments might be easier if you don&#x27;t have a source for new links. Again, if you have a pulse on HN, it&#x27;s not too hard. You don&#x27;t even have to lie, just slant your take to appeal to the audience. HN loves clever hacks, cynicism, free speech, definite statements. Often times it&#x27;s better to be a little bit wrong because your comment will attract a lot of rebuttals trying to correct you.')
