I feel like you have not really engaged with my actual points and instead have focused on finding details to complain about in service of <i>appearing</i> to make a point, which effectively derails the true conversation. I find this incredibly frustrating, and I have no interest in continuing.<p>I would politely suggest you consider whether this is a common issue you have with people or whether it&#x27;s just me (certainly a possibility, I admit). If this happens to you often, you may want to try alternative approaches to broaching your points if you&#x27;d like better engagement. I think most people don&#x27;t enjoy when their main points are continually ignored in favor of bringing up other minutiae to prove that they&#x27;re wrong or something.<p>Regardless, cheers.')
