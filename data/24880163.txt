Other comments on this thread discuss whether all lowercase strings are valid and whether implementations differ.<p>But ... Isn&#x27;t the point of using base64 (rather than hex or something) to make a large share of easily typeable strings valid (which implies they can be shorter&#x2F;faster&#x2F;cheaper)? I.e. someone upstream of you _wanted_ &quot;changeme&quot; to be valid, and the misunderstanding is less about the technical details of base64, and more about a hidden conflict in desires between people making design choices separated by time, space, and perhaps organization.')
