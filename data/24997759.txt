Item(by='Fjolsvith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604580387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24982316, text='Years ago, I saw an auction website where bidders placed bids in penny amounts.  Supposedly, you could win an item at a fraction of the price of the product.  Bidding was real time, and you won the auction if you held the bid for 15 seconds. You &quot;spent&quot; your bid and never got it back if you lost the auction.<p>You never got to see how many people was bidding against you, and I always wondered how you could know it wasn&#x27;t the website jacking up the bid.<p>I am reminded of that scam every time I see a karma&#x2F;upvote system.')
