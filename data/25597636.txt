America does it to its own people. Other nations do it to and about American citizens. And this isn&#x27;t even remotely unique to America. Every major country plays the same game, just to different degrees (if anyone is aware of a major country that doesn&#x27;t play this I&#x27;m honestly interested). Why would &quot;trying to manipulate perception&quot; be surprising for a country to do? Is that not what propaganda is at the root of it? Why wouldn&#x27;t this idea also advance and get better? We&#x27;ve got native advertising, why not native propagandizing? (foreign and&#x2F;or domestic) And why would America or China (insert enemy) be unique in using this tactic?')
