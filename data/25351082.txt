I think that&#x27;s the key, the self awareness and ability to adapt. I don&#x27;t think having CEO&#x2F;CTO&#x2F;CMO for founders is a bad idea though. Even at Cloudflare, CEO and COO were co-founders. I am more curious about what it takes to grow from a founder CTO to a public company CTO, same way than other founder roles can. Or maybe it&#x27;s just too hard.<p>Anyway, I am flexible John! Totally onboard to give up my title if you are interested to come over and help us RevenueCat go public ;)')
