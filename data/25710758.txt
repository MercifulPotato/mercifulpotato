Add to that the subdomain-driven localization strategy and many other moves that were considered SEO best practices back in those years when the on-page factors used to matter.<p>But that was just the start. Wikipedia killed it in SEO when it was easy to do so, but it also did one other thing that most SEO-driven sites (eg: About) didn&#x27;t do correctly - it cared deeply about the content quality and also resisted to run ads (anyone remember Jason Calacanis&#x27; articles on how they are leaving $100m on the table? See [1]). So when Panda came around, Google correctly rewarded Wikipedia with #1 rankings for over 50% of its terms (!!), and Jason Calacanis had to shut down Mahalo which got destroyed by Panda.<p>Wikipedia&#x27;s dominance continues because it&#x27;s basically impossible to overcome its lead in inbound links and domain authority. Add to that a surprisingly under-the-radar company culture which has avoided any major blow ups despite its community wielding so much leverage over the world&#x27;s education and having to make a lot of difficult calls on a daily basis.<p>Well done.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calacanis.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;wikipedia-leaves-100m-on-the-table-or-please-jimbo-reconsider&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calacanis.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;wikipedia-leaves-100m-on-th...</a>')
