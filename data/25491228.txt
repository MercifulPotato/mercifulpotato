Item(by='schoen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608514165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491111, text='My friend who works on the MAME project told me that it&#x27;s a very friendly platform for adding new emulators (whether you want to add an emulation of a game, a device, a platform, or whatever) because it provides a good structure to work with and a lot of tools to describe recurring patterns in electronics and systems. That might be a good middle ground to start with -- trying to add support in MAME for some device that&#x27;s not presently emulated there. (Apparently the MAME project really appreciates such contributions, since they think of themselves as pursuing mainly a historical preservation and documentation mission, and would always like to see more devices covered.)<p>Although that&#x27;s not &quot;from scratch&quot; because it would still be using their libraries and plumbing, it could be &quot;from scratch&quot; in the sense that you might take an environment with 0% support for emulating a certain device or system and build it up to having 100% support. So it seems like a nice way to start.')
