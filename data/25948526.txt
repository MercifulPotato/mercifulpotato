There is no evidence for the counter claims that they&#x27;re lying, which themselves originate on reddit. In particular: all the widely cited short interest figures on reddit which purport to show this are out of date (usually by weeks), and even if they were true, they would not be proof the short positions weren&#x27;t closed.')
