Even with it on the horizon, it would be several years before we would fall into the thought and habits of what that &quot;means.&quot;<p>One other thing to note of the pre&#x2F;post-Soviet dissolution sci-fi media: the contrast of dominance over the enemy vs surviving within a status quo that is unlikely to change. That may be part of why you see protagonists &quot;befriending&quot; AI; it&#x27;s more a reflection of hope than expectation. Once you get to post-9&#x2F;11 media, relationships with AI become more complex and nuanced: I, Robot, Ex Machina, Her, Transcendence. (Perhaps a reflection of our decidedly mixed, toward the negative side, experiences in the Middle East; as well as the multiple crises that threatened the &quot;end of society&quot; and the subsequent recoveries, all within a generation.)')
