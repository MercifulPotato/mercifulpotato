It has human genetic code. It is one continuous line from the merge of two human sex cells to full-grown human. There is no jump, somewhere along the way, from not human to human.<p>It is alive. A plant is alive, so surely so is a fetus.<p>&gt; A fetus isn&#x27;t viable until week 20ish.<p>Whether it is viable doesn&#x27;t determine whether it is human or alive. A two-year-old outside the womb isn&#x27;t very viable either. In fact, some 20-year-olds aren&#x27;t very viable.<p>Viability is shaky ground upon which to base legal protection. Just think of the handicapped or those with other chronic maladies. Or any of us can become unviable temporarily through some accident or acute illness. Does our right to life disappear?<p>&gt; Why do you feel an unviable collection of cells is a human<p>A &quot;collection of cells&quot; does not describe a fetus any better than an adult.<p>- At about 18 days, there is a heartbeat<p>- At about 40 days, there is brain activity<p>- By the end of the first trimester, it has all its organs. It just needs to grow.<p>&quot;Photography of the human fetus developing in the womb&quot;:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OD1gW88Lm-Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OD1gW88Lm-Y</a><p>&gt; What does location have to do with it?<p>Inside the womb or outside the womb, its location seems to be the dimension used by those who say abortion is okay.')
