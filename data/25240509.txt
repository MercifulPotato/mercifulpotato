When I was in school, I studied MIPS from the perspective of a compiler writer who&#x27;s only casually interested in hardware design. Having learned a couple of CISC designs beforehand, I found MIPS to be absolutely genius in comparison. I wasn&#x27;t interested so much in implementing a MIPS processor, just coding for it.')
