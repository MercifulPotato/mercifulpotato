I think that it was a bad idea for Germany to shut working reactors prematurely. I also think that it was unavoidable for German leadership, given how unpopular nuclear power is with German voters. 81% of polled Germans agreed with the nuclear phase-out as of 2015 [2].<p>There&#x27;s a gas phase-out implicit in Germany&#x27;s 2050 net zero target, but that&#x27;s not very strong. Other EU members are also theoretically committed to net zero by 2050. I don&#x27;t know if any of them have committed to earlier dates for eliminating gas specifically.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cleanenergywire.org&#x2F;factsheets&#x2F;spelling-out-coal-phase-out-germanys-exit-law-draft" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cleanenergywire.org&#x2F;factsheets&#x2F;spelling-out-coal...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bild.de&#x2F;politik&#x2F;inland&#x2F;atomausstieg&#x2F;4-jahre-nach-fukushima-grosse-mehrheit-fuer-energiewende-40148648.bild.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;translate.google.com&#x2F;translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https...</a>')
