I appreciated this practice--no excessive waste, only spending on what felt like mattered. My salary was above average for the market, with best in class health care. Those matter way more to me than pool tables and beer kegs.<p>For example: 1) no free lunches or snacks (though there was always lots of free food around from leftover meetings with customers); 2) &quot;swag&quot; for employees once per year, one item, thoughtfully chosen and good quality. This resulted in everyone getting really EXCITED about it and rallying around it; 3) a Bevi machine (effectively a bubble water fountain) instead of coolers of free drinks.')
