E.g., the words like &quot;stir&quot;, &quot;encourage&quot;, and &quot;stimulate&quot; from the definition are not black-and-white terms.<p>However, the actual sequence of events are a pretty strong argument for incitement. There&#x27;s a simple and easy to follow implication of cause and effect here.<p>Also, remember, we&#x27;re talking about his video <i>after</i> the violence broke out. If he didn&#x27;t understand that his claims of election fraud before the riot would lead the riot, he must certainly have understood it during the riot.')
