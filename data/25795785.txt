I hope these unionization efforts are thwarted by Amazon. I did not escape a socialist hellhole to end up in another one. The moral equivalence for me personally would be a jewish person supporting a new neo nazi movement claiming it is different this time.<p>Having said that, right to form associations is a fundamental right and I support it for all workers everywhere, it is just that such unions should not get any privileges that an individual worker does not have. Amazon should be able to offer $1000 per year more for the workers who do not join any union.')
