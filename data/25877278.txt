With temperatures  that frequently get below 0F in the winter and the huge distance between cities, I will be very surprised if EVs have anywhere close to a majority within the next 10-20 years here. Some people own them as their &#x27;commuter&#x27; vehicle and own ICE vehicles for longer distances, but most people can&#x27;t afford or don&#x27;t have space to store 2 vehicles.')
