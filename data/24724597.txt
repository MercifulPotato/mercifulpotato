The currently dominant neoliberal faction of the Democratic Party supports a public <i>option</i> as a long-term component of healthcare policy to acheive universal access, but does not generally support single-payer as a goal, in either the near or long term.<p>&gt; In general, the U.S. has the most progressive tax code in the OECD<p>As your own source notes, net of transfers and taxes, the US has one of the <i>least</i> progressive systems in the OECD.<p>&gt; In the area of taxes, the Democratic Party is center-right in some ways but quite left win in others. Merkel has championed Germany following along with Trump&#x27;s corporate tax cuts.<p>You seem to be really obsessed with the CDU as your measure of center-right parties, but AFAICT the CDU is to the right of most parties labelled center-right, not just in Europe, but even <i>in Germany specifically</i> (which has a fairly wide range of center-right parties.)<p>But, yes, its really only the dominant faction of the Democratic Party that is center-right, the &quot;progressive&quot; faction is center to center-left by European terms, and the whole (today, with the gains the progressive wing has made over the recent years considered) is probably more center than center-right; the &quot;Democrats are a center-right&quot; party was most true at the height of the Clintonian neoliberalism of the Democratic Party which as faded over the last decade or so and particularly since Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign reenergized the progressive wing, though it has still not become dominant.')
