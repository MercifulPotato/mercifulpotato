Your content is what would push someone over the edge to buy. If you think about it, your site is much further down the funnel than other affil sites because you&#x27;ve vetted reviews, instead of just copy&#x2F;pasting&#x2F;spinning from other sites. You should also retarget the people who come to those pages with ads specific to the products they&#x27;re looking for urging them to &quot;not make a decision without all the facts&quot; which is what you&#x27;ve done by mining all of the review data.<p>I do very much like the approach and the original idea but sadly google likes what google likes. If deeper authoritative content is not what you want to be doing, that&#x27;s fine, but you shouldn&#x27;t have the expectation you are going to be able to compete with the big dogs who operate in that way.<p>Im happy to take this convo offline as you&#x27;re getting a lot of weird advice in this thread that are just random people&#x27;s opinions.
