The only argument they have is that the <i>other</i> 22 athletes had a mean T2 of 51, vs 59 for the four in question. The highest reported “abnormal” time is 63ms. The others are 55, 59 and 61ms.<p>Here is the first set of slides I found for topic from a presentation by a doctor at Columbia University. Slide 14 shows the distributions of T2 times for several control and disease groups. You’ll note that the <i>control</i> group runs from 50-61ms:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.ymaws.com&#x2F;scmr.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;resmgr&#x2F;2019&#x2F;new_york&#x2F;maehara,_akiko_-_consensus_c.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.ymaws.com&#x2F;scmr.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;resmgr&#x2F;2019&#x2F;new_york...</a>')
