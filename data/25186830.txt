They just choose not to.<p>It admittedly gets a bit more difficult when these hacks and quirks are part of what create the unique feel of your game engine. People have played CS at such high levels for so long that switching engine at all is likely going to introduce some difference in feeling, even if you think you&#x27;ve accounted for all the unique bugs and interactions. If you remade Quake 3 in a new engine, people are going to hate it. See Quake 4, for example.<p>Source 2 would still be a nice jump for CS:GO, but the team just doesn&#x27;t have the resources at present to get this all done. Dota 2, being the style of game that it is, isn&#x27;t as affected by a difference in feel as a first person twitch shooter.')
