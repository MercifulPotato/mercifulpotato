This is easy if there&#x27;s exactly one match, but much harder when there are no exact matches or multiple. I solved no matches with a fuzzy search although I haven&#x27;t yet generally solved dynamic variables inside strings like `${num} Upvotes`. With multiple results I&#x27;m currently allowing the user to choose themselves and I will use that data to try to learn how a url and DOM and a codebase file interact. My goal is eventually solve this problem for any codebase with a likelihood of being right.')
