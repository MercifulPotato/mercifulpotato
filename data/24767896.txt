E.g. take a look at this guy&#x27;s code snippet&#x27;s HTML source in the middle of the page - it&#x27;s just a wall of &lt;div&gt;s and &lt;span&gt;s, for every single visible character.<p>The search engines these days cannot even function without a JS interpreter, something that surely increases the complexity and cost of building one.<p>Long gone are the days when one cared about semantic elegance of HTML code, per-site optimized CSS stored in an external file for easy caching, only occassional use of JS for easier navigation...<p>Nowadays you don&#x27;t build websites, you have to build &quot;apps&quot;. It&#x27;s one of many signs of the &quot;appification&quot; of Internet.')
