If it was actually a cure, it&#x27;d have been well-proven by now, and we&#x27;d all be doing it.<p>Untrue and faulty reasoning. It may have been studied extensively on biased populations, or the research may not have been funded adequately.

Meanwhile, studies from Taiwan, Japan, and Korea show that myopia truly has an environmental component to it, e.g. childhood eyestrain and video games.<p>One may argue that could be because East Asian genetics are different from those of Europeans. I can&#x27;t say exactly why, but I will say that the mainstream &quot;myopia can&#x27;t be cured&#x2F;prevented&quot; rhetoric has been extremely harmful for approximately 2 billion people on this planet.')
