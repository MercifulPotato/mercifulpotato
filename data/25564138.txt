I’ve seen a couple friends who used to live alone move into shared housing during the pandemic because they craved more social contact than they could get living alone. I don’t know anyone who’s moved from shared housing to solo housing in this time. Movement away from single-person housing lines up with the price pressure you’re seeing, too: small apartments losing value; houses not losing as much.')
