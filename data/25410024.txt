For the last 5 or so years the Internet Archive has been cultivating a dweb&#x2F;dapp community and integrating with IIIF, Dat, IPFS, gun, bittorent, webtorrents, and others and hosting regular summits and meetups\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;21&#x2F;decentralized-web-faq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;21&#x2F;decentralized-web-faq&#x2F;</a><p>5. The wayback machine is an interesting case study: it turns out, incentive structures (even things like FIL&#x2F;filecoin) haven&#x27;t been able to perfectly crack the nut on getting folks interested <i>enough</i> to preserve the whole wayback machine. There&#x27;s petabytes of material and there&#x27;s a powerlaw about what people care about today. Internet Archive realized what we care about today may not be the same as tomorrow, and so there&#x27;s a cost eaten (the incentive comes from economies of scale generated by intrinsic desire rather than $). And in a way, this centralized solution (economies of scale) IS the solution a community came up with. It has flaws and advantages (tradeoffs), such as centralized points of failure, and I think the archive would be (and has been) ecstatic to explore improving these opportunities.')
