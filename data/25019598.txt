In one of the podcasts they discussed this assumption and it&#x27;s what they have found to be the most accurate historically.<p>We might be seeing a shift towards that no longer being true - maybe 75% break red and 25% break blue now.<p>Edit: Also, It looks like Jorgensen (Libertarian) significantly underperformed her polling (~3% &gt; ~1%) in the first few states I spot checked. If those voters broke for Trump, that makes up about 2% of the error. That&#x27;d take a lot more in depth checking though.')
