My order s at £1 gets filled.  Theyh wont sell me any more, because more people have arrived who bid £1.  Still  More buyers arrive, armed with orders from people prepared to bid £1.10.  Those buyers get their orders filled until yet people arrive and start bidding £1.20.  potatos are in demand.   those orders get filled and £1.20 is the new price.<p>Later, all the people offering £1.20 have gone home...there&#x27;s only me left.  THe farmers have some potatos left, but no buyers at £1.20 and no buyers at £1, so they lower the price further .  I get my 90p order filled.  noone else arrives, so farmers lower the price again, and they aceept my 80p offer..<p>i dont know if that makes any sense ?<p>its gets a litte more complicated, in that the owner of the market where the deals are done, must commit to filling everyone&#x27;s orders - so they have some juggling to do .  they take a small margin in between the bid price and the offer price, in return.')
