For me switching to Linux normally makes the battery go 2-5x slower. The laptop on which I&#x27;m typing (a T420) lasted half an hour on Windows 10 and two hours on Debian when it had the original battery, now that I&#x27;ve replaced it it gets 5hrs on Linux and maybe two max on Windows 10. About the same on Windows 7.<p>Of course it depends on how you configure it but if you&#x27;ve really de-bloated your system you can get much more out of the battery than Windows can. I&#x27;ve been able to get more battery out of a recent Inspiron, a less recent Toshiba Satellite, this Thinkpad, and an old Samsung netbook, so I could be biased by my hardware.<p>Nowadays it&#x27;s much easier to get higher-level Linux support, too.')
