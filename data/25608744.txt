Although there wasn&#x27;t any restriction on where you could return, either, but I think that&#x27;s more of a smaller vs. bigger city thing. I do remember that some kids got their privilege to leave campus rescinded because they got caught extremely, obviously high after going to do bong rips at someone&#x27;s house near the school.<p>In elementary and middle school, we weren&#x27;t technically supposed to leave the schoolyard but the monitoring was lax enough that older kids frequently got away with it.')
