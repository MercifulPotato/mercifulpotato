Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=[25237841], score=None, time=1606568937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236525, text='&gt; Rust is not ready to be specified as is required for ISO and similar standards. A few large chunks of its functionality currently donâ€™t have any good definition written down, but instead are defined by the rustc implementation: most significantly, the ownership and borrow checking system.<p>That assertion makes no sense at all. If an implementation exists and is already used in production then it&#x27;s behavior is already relied upon and thus it can already be described. Just write down how it behaves and specify how it is expected to behave. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s how the whole software world has been for almost half a century.<p>And no, it makes no difference if a reference implementation decides to implement something that breaks that behavior. That just means it doesn&#x27;t comply with the standard. That&#x27;s it.<p>Why have these basic lessons been forgotten?')
