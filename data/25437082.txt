The alternative was that much worse. I hope republicans find some moment of clarity and let their extreme wing be banished to a third party. It will cost them a huge amount of political power short term, but they need some time in the wilderness to rediscover the concept of principles. We need a sane opposition party that actually has ideas and isn&#x27;t a general-purpose personality cult.')
