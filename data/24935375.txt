But he wanted to focus his work elsewhere. Why are they speaking as if he&#x27;s a rank and file peon that won&#x27;t behave?<p>Forget about the Intercept for a second and try it like this: Imagine a tech startup cofounder wanted to remain in the trenches instead of managing others.  Then she&#x27;s accused of not respecting the management that formed around her.  Yeah, no shit, they have to earn it. And it takes a lot of fucking nerve to tell her &quot;you didn&#x27;t give yourself a management job before now, even though you were at one point free to.  Therefore you&#x27;re unqualified to make this specific managerial decision, even though you deliberately created a contractual route to retain that power over those certain choices even if it isn&#x27;t your day-to-day job.&quot;')
