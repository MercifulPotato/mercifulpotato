Under a deadline or at a hackathon, I could hit 8-10, but that would lead to burnout and the last few sessions would be unproductive.<p>At work, this is never the case. Between meetings, running into frustrating build errors, etc. I&#x27;ve found that most days I do one deep work session of two hours. On good days, I get in another one for a total of 3.5-4 hours.<p>PS I made a website (trywinston.com) to track deep work hours. Would love to get feedback from the HN community on it.')
