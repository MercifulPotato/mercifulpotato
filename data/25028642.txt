For other countries they moved access for the SPO2 feature further into the Samsung Health app. But for Canada SPO2 sensor access is gone not accessible.<p>No warning (probably buried in an email) just one day my SPO2 sensor stopped working. I suppose it was due to some legal thing but it certainly pissed me off. I&#x27;m never buying Samsung again why blow $1000 on a phone only to have physical hardware disabled?')
