You can advocate for your rights as provided by existing legal and regulatory policies. If an individual feels they have been harassed or discriminated against, that individual has a right to engage their company to rectify this situation, through mechanisms like filing a grievance with company HR department, or their union (if part of one), or through the legal system.<p>What I&#x27;m against is creating a corporate culture that openly biases for or against certain political parties, religious or secular beliefs, or contentious policy or culture issues (like abortion). Keep those things out of the workplace, because those topics elicit emotional responses, and you want to maintain a neutral professional environment.<p>&gt;The system as I&#x27;ve seen it works pretty great for youngish cishet white men like me.<p>I&#x27;m glad you had a comfortable life. Don&#x27;t throw your personal experience on the rest of us. You being &#x27;youngish cishet white man&quot; says nothing about the experience of others with those same immutable characteristics.')
