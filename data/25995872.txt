Most companies think this is good, but it&#x27;s actually a curse. When decisions don&#x27;t have consequences, people don&#x27;t care. Google doesn&#x27;t care if Stadia fails.<p>What surprises me more is why people trusted Google enough to invest in Stadia in the first place. Had they let you import Steam games (like Nvidia does), fine, you&#x27;re not risking anything. But actually paying Google for the license to a game that&#x27;s ONLY available on Stadia? No thanks.<p>This is exactly what HP looked like a couple of decades ago. Making billions from printers meant everything else suffered.')
