More people are becoming aware of the threats that surveillance has on our society thanks to books like these and even something like The Social Dilemma on Netflix.<p>I think unfortunately we&#x27;re going to see a lot of companies adopt a sort of &quot;privacy washing&quot; (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5gGb_vKbJLU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5gGb_vKbJLU</a>) before we see much real change in their privacy practices.<p>I&#x27;ll definitely add a few of these to my books to read for 2021.')
