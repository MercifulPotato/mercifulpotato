The solution is to build alternative wrappers&#x2F;frontends (command-line or GUI) on top of it, which present different takes on the best user interface. The author finds local&#x2F;remote branching confusing? One could build a small `git` command wrapper that will hide it and have more straightforward branching commands. You can think of current git as an assembly language of version control and develop wrappers&#x2F;compilers for high-level VC languages of various flavors.<p>Starting from scratch and building a dumbed-down version control system for simple users vs. kernel developers is not the right approach, IMHO. As they say: &quot;build a system any idiot can use, and only idiots will use it.&quot; Or you will end up incrementally adding more and more advanced features to it.')
