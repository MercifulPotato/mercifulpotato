While there may be a functional reason for <i>some</i> difference between opening-force and closing-force, you wouldn&#x27;t expect that functional reason to result in that correlation so strongly, and that the <i>majority</i> of the difference in force at high price points is a cynical marketing ploy.  (I&#x27;m not sure I buy that, it makes sense to me that a more expensive cooler has a thicker gasket to get a better seal.)<p>Yeti is a well-known expensive brand of coolers.')
