I tried every 16.x release as well. The source is fine and playback during the timeline is fine, it&#x27;s only after it&#x27;s been exported with Resolve.<p>I&#x27;d get all of these little black pixel&#x27;y boxes that would appear and audio would end up having little pops and squeaks. Neither of these things ever happened using Camtasia with the same hardware (even after 500+ videos) but it happens in every single video in Resolve with every export format and setting. This is only dealing with 1080p too.<p>These are just simple recordings of my desktop with a webcam on the bottom right. Recorded as an mkv with OBS (which I still do even when editing with Camtasia).<p>It&#x27;s a shame because Resolve is really good for editing, and video editing is the only reason I stick with Windows.')
