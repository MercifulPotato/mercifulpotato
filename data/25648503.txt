But sometimes, in the middle of one of these specialized operations, you might want to do something more general, like run a network stack, without returning to the CPU. A soft processor like this allows you to run an ordinary network stack (with ordinary code) inside the FPGA.<p>Is that right?<p>I thought one of the things people used FPGAs for was accelerating network stacks, so I don&#x27;t quite know why you&#x27;d want to use a soft processor for that. But it does make sense that you&#x27;d want to be able to run ordinary code in an FPGA (as part of a larger FPGA operation that is not ordinary code).<p>EDIT: Also, I don&#x27;t understand this statement: &quot;for example,  one main compute kernel, which is too complex to deploy on dedicated hardware, is run by specialized soft processors&quot;. What do the authors mean &quot;too complex to deploy on dedicated hardware&quot;?')
