Item(by='8bitsrule', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607322048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327533, text='It would take a <i>long time</i> for one person to make PGM-created music (melodies, variations, chord progressions, rhythms, ABACA-type forms, etc) decent enough to be <i>sort of</i> satisfying.<p>I&#x27;d bet that in that same time or less, you could learn to improvise equally decent stuff - probably far better - yourself on at least two instruments. If you&#x27;ve been listening to music for 5-10 years, you&#x27;ll probably never &#x27;train&#x27; a machine to <i>know what music is</i> as well as you&#x27;ve been trained.<p>Whichever way you go, if the product can&#x27;t compete with the <i>flood of stuff</i> that&#x27;s already out there? including production quality? I can guarantee you what people&#x27;s reaction will be. Not pretty.')
