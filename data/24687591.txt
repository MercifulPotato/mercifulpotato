How many machines could one person restock? A lot more than 13. Let&#x27;s say I have to visit each machine once a week on average (seems reasonable given it&#x27;s sold $75 worth of stuff), I could stock 100 machines spread out over a small city. A lot more if I have many machines located together in say a university or an office park.<p>The average operator has 13 machines and views it as a side hustle. But that&#x27;s true for a lot of entrepeneurial businesses. (The average SaaS owner, the average Youtube personality...). That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t scale the business to where it provides a very decent income stream.')
