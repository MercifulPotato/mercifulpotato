I&#x27;ve read a lot of the lit, too, thank you.<p>Then I hope you&#x27;ve noticed that there are instances in society where &quot;Saying thank you and giving credit to someone who did you a solid&quot; is not the norm.<p>&gt; So is refusing to acknowledge the existence of norms because some people refuse to acknowledge them.<p>We are in agreement here.<p>&gt; Whinging that someone broke norm A [e.g. seemed ungrateful] and thinking less of people&#x2F;entities that you&#x27;ve heard have done the same is pretty cheap and isn&#x27;t likely to earn you value judgments yourself.<p>I have no idea what you&#x27;re trying to say here. This sounds precisely what people are doing: Whining that Amazon seemed ungrateful and thinking less of people who do likewise. Which is orthogonal to what I&#x27;m saying.')
