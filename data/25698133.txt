Based on what I saw in my household-name tech workplace this week, big tech companies likely all have internal employee activism campaigns happening to pressure leadership to act (which I think is a good thing).<p>This week has really shown me what people mean when they say workers in tech have power. ~300 cosigners of the employee petition at Twitter helped remove Trump&#x27;s ability to spread propaganda to nearly 90M followers. That&#x27;s amazing and something I frankly thought would never happen. Without that internal pressure, Trump would still have his bully pulpit and zero Republicans would be coming forward to talk openly about a post-Trump future for the party like we saw Murkowski do today.')
