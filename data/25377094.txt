Fortunately that space of programs is enormous and the market is enormous. Clojure does not need to &quot;win&quot; against Java (or anything). It is unlikely (for many reasons that have nothing to do with its value as a language) to ever be more than a fraction as popular as Java, but that&#x27;s irrelevant.
