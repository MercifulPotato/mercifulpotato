Is some matter transparent to other matter in the same way that some matter is transparent to light?  This idea that matter and energy are equivalent and that the same wave physics underlies it all doesn&#x27;t seem to be true in reality.  Instead it seems that phenomena are divided into regimes and in each regime behavior is very different.  Sure it&#x27;s tough to build an oscillator at the frequency of matter, but is it really impossible to build a matter emitter?  I only have a BA in physics but I remember while learning (and in later reviews of physics) that it seems like theory doesn&#x27;t always scale and there are a lot of very weird assumptions and &quot;explanations&quot;.')
