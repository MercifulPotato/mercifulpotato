E.g. if Google wants you to be logged in on youtube.com and google.com simultaneously:<p>1) User logs in at google.com&#x2F;login and sets google.com cookies.\n2) Server generates a nonce and redirects to youtube.com&#x2F;login?auth=$NONCE\n3) youtube.com checks the $NONCE and sets youtube.com cookies\n4) youtube.com redirects back to google.com.<p>Firefox&#x27;s container tabs can maintain isolation despite this since even this redirect will stay within a container. However there is a usability penalty since the user has to open links for sites in the right container (and automatically opening certain sites in certain containers will enable cross-container stapling again).')
