Especially since I use named servers per project or language or whatever. Like, I have an <i>erc</i> emacs daemon that just handles IRC stuffs. I have one for (this month) <i>aoc</i> (Advent of Code). I have a <i>ledger</i> one for tracking my money. And then one for any other active projects. And if I want to kill the displayed instances (say I&#x27;m done with project X for this week), I can without &quot;losing my place&quot;, all the buffers stay open (which is fine for the way I interact with files, just make sure to save).<p>I made a couple shell functions&#x2F;aliases to help me out. <i>emacsd $servername</i> and <i>e</i> for <i>emacsclient -t</i>. So spinning them up is trivial, and accessing them is just <i>e -s $servername</i>. With no name, it&#x27;s just the default instance (used for random editing that&#x27;s not part of a  project or something I care to keep cleanly separated).')
