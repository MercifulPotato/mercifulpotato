The supposed evidence for it (that graph) is statistical mystery meat.<p>If the two metrics (confidence and ability) were independent in a simulation, you&#x27;d expect to see a more-or-less flat line on confidence if you sorted by ability. So the model clearly insists on some sort of association between them, no? If the association is weak, you get a cross-over. Big deal.<p>Also, the graphs don&#x27;t really look all that similar - especially when you consider the fact that the line on which the associated variable have been sorted by quantile is always going to be ascending (duh).<p>Tufte says &quot;to clarify, add data&quot; - one thing that neither the chart from the original study nor the simulated one respects. Surely we&#x27;d learn more from also being able to eyeball a scatterplot.')
