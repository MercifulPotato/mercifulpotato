You&#x27;ve stumbled upon a very important thing here. Look up IDT gBlocks. Solid-phase nucleotide synthesis is only 99.9% efficient. This means when you make a 500 nucleotide long synthetic DNA strand, every other one will have an error. How do you clean-out the wrong ones? Well, you make the complementary strand, anneal them together, and pass them through a column with immobilized MutS. Guess what happens? The dsDNA with errors get bound by the enzyme and the perfect duplexes just flow right through. So out the other end is cleaner DNA.<p>This is how biotechnology works.')
