In Ocaml you don&#x27;t say that &quot;type T1 is an Orderable&quot;.<p>However, it does serve a similar purpose. For example, if you want to create a datatype for an OrderedList then you&#x27;d create a higher-order-module (functor) that receives as an argument another module containing all the necessary comparison functions for the list elements. For example, if you apply the OrderedList functor to the IntOrdering module the result would be an OrderedListOfInt module that provides an abstract data type implementing an ordered list of integers.<p>In the Ocaml standard library the names would be different but that&#x27;s the basic idea.')
