I wrote a comment on Rust for web previously that covers similar ground: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23776855" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23776855</a><p>One problem that I noticed, which may become a serious issue in the future, is that a lot of libraries add abstractions via macros. Macros don&#x27;t always compose or debug well. I had some experiences getting errors in my macros that had extremely confusing debug messages, often pointing to files that didn&#x27;t exist. Hopefully there will be a trend of moving back to plain old functions. Nom for instance has converted its combinators into regular functions, which I like a lot.<p>I&#x27;d love love love for there to be a language that gets in between Rust and TypeScript. It&#x27;d have the strictness over mutability like Rust, but the GC of JS&#x2F;TS. It wouldn&#x27;t have 3+ string types. It&#x27;d have enum variants and pattern matching but maybe not macros. Gleam is pretty close!')
