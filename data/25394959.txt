There are a lot of pros and cons for it.  How each state choses electors has been explicitly given to the states. Each state tends to have slightly different criteria. How different can they be before there is an issue?  There appears to be a huge divide between the states and the parties.  There is a big different between given the entire electoral votes to the party that has a plurality, vs a state and its population passing a law to allow binky the clown to choose those electors.  Somewhere in that continuum of possibility, you would get a majority that would deem it improper for the clown case, but if a state and its voters decided that was the best way, how does another state get to say no to those people?  The supreme court has said over and over they shouldn&#x27;t adjucate political questions, unfortunately the makeup of it is extremely politicized now, could you imagine a SC justice getting 80-90 votes now? The question then becomes is where does it stop?  If you allow standing, every state will flood the SC with all manner of good bad or other.  The only solution I see to this current problem is to have a constitutional amendment to change how electors are chosen, or change the system outright.  That is a near impossibility.')
