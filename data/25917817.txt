Politicians know where the money is coming from - it&#x27;s too dangerous not too - and lobbyists will make sure they do. My husband is a former lobbyist and he often had to be the intermediary between group A with the money, group B with the good reputation that handled the movement of that money, and the Politician. What Google is saying sounds nice in the news, but it doesn&#x27;t actually change a thing IMO.')
