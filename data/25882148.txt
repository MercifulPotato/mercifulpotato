The first Rocket Lake record at 5.3 GHz is 1896, but it is expected that it will score better than that, above 1900.<p>In benchmarks that unlike GB5 focus more on computational performance in optimized programs, Intel&#x2F;AMD have an even greater advantage in ST performance than above. (For example, in gmpbench even the old Ryzen 7 3700X beats Apple M1, even when using on Apple a libgmp that was tuned specifically for M1.)<p>What is true is that Apple M1 is much faster (on average) in ST than any non-overclocked CPU launched before mid 2020.')
