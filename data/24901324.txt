But, only a fraction of that directly ends up in farmers pockets.  You can either take the full 3 billion as a government subsidy or exclude most of it.  Similarly, propaganda and what’s allowed in food lunch programs gets tricky.<p>So, I am not endorsing any specific estimate, just saying the total industry profits are approximately the same as the total subsidy.  Add up just direct federal subsidies gets you lower numbers especially if you try an exclude state, ethanol, R&amp;D, loans, Education, tax breaks, and other less obvious handouts.<p>PS: Silly me, I forgot about all the little exceptions in environmental, immigration, labor laws, use of federal lands, etc.')
