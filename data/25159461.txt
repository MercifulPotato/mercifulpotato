I spent many evenings making a nice router table, and I&#x27;ve used it maybe a dozen times. The Samurai jig, on the other hand, I use all the time. Mostly cutting half lap joints in two-by material, but also for notching and general routing. It is much easier to use a router when you can the bit cutting. With a router table you have to rely on the fence for making accurate cuts. (A good fence is a mandatory accessory for a functional router table)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DV9Cb_-Axos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DV9Cb_-Axos</a>')
