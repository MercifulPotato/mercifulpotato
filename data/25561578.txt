However:<p>&gt; Its value as a revenue source is secondary, and many proponents (of the geolibertarian sort) actually support lower tax receipts and smaller government.<p>Statements like this muddy tax discussions.<p>The primary reason for <i>any</i> tax at all, regardless of type or preference is to raise revenue for government. That fact shouldnâ€™t be lost when discussing which kinds of taxes and what percent to raise them at is discussed, even when optimizing for political outcomes.<p>If the government were raising more tax than it needs for example, tax revenue is too high. If the government is spending more than it is collecting, then tax revenue is too low. Effects on market behavior are always secondary considerations.')
