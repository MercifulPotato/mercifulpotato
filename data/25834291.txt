It’s never been easier, or cheaper. It’s as free market as it gets.<p>And where do you find it? Google? Also the witch-hunt doesn&#x27;t stop there. Next up is the hosting (looking at Parler). I can&#x27;t wait to see when registrars are next and you have to type in a dynamic IP given by the ISP. But everyone could reach you, they just have to know the IP. If that really would be viable ISP would be the next logical step in the witch-hunt.')
