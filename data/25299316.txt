You can&#x27;t use the argument that &quot;they said it would grow with me&quot; to store 1TB of emails and be surprised when they start charging you.<p>15GB is a lot. Even if you receive 5 emails with 1mb attachments every single day, that&#x27;s still almost 10 years. With normal text emailed, you will never run out until you die. Most cloud providers give 5GB. It&#x27;s fair to say that it has grown with you to a reasonable storage size. If you need more than 15GB, it&#x27;s fair to say you&#x27;re beyond that.')
