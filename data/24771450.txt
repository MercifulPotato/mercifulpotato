It most likely  was a bug or oversight, if it had been some malicious evil scheme, I would assume more care would have been taken so that people don&#x27;t find out.<p>Now, coming to the question of why do they even store it for opted in users?<p>Aside from potential ad relevance, I think it is simply because they power a lot of their features with context and they get better with data.<p>For example, if you search cheesecake on Google, the answer likely will be either a recipe or a restaurant. A restaurant search will likely be helped by data about previous visits and current location. A recipe search will be helped by past search result clicks and again location.<p>Do they really need to store this to serve search results? I don&#x27;t think so. DDG works without them, but then again DDG performs very poor for queries like this which can be helped with context.<p>Note: I don&#x27;t know how any of this exactly works, so these are just my assumptions.')
