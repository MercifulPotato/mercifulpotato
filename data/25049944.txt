I had previously just used Glassdoor to check salaries and did not realize it was not giving an accurate picture of the total, more recent compensation offered at these companies.  When I realized how much lower my income was compared to what was possible, it motivated me to start practicing and interviewing.  I would have never known if it weren&#x27;t for those posts.')
