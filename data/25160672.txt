So if your content is ridiculously on-topic but a little slower to load, you&#x27;ll still probably be in the special little box, but a slightly less specific site thats super fast to load might be before your site.<p>As has been mentioned: google has used page load times as a metric for a long time. The difference is they didn&#x27;t add a &quot;special little box&quot; to incentivise sites with otherwise shit decision making skills to do the right thing.<p>But sure. Tell me how forcing clients to download a bunch of javascript, and introducing forced 8 second blank pages for anyone who dares to not load said javascript is all about making pages faster.<p>Give me a fucking break. If you want to live in the fucking google sphere, that&#x27;s your choice, but don&#x27;t pretend that their motives are anything but hostile to the very concept of the open web.')
