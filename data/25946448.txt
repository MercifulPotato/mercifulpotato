It&#x27;s redundant to call it via &quot;f(a)&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s easier to edit &quot;f&quot; in the repl&#x2F;notebook vs. on the class where it&#x27;s defined, well that&#x27;s a sort of a convenience factor, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a huge benefit overall as this is mostly a very \nspecific use case.')
