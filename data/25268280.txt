Even if you have a server component to your mac app, the deployment infrastructure is completely unrelated to the client pipeline—it&#x27;s tough to see how you could integrate any AWS benefits into this pipeline. If you&#x27;re just writing a server, there&#x27;s no need to deploy to a mac, and indeed it would be extremely expensive. Where exactly would this shared infrastructure come into play?<p>The single use case that makes sense to me is an infrequently-used CI server for a cross-platform app—something already offered at better rates from CI providers.')
