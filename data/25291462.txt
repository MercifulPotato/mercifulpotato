As a new tech platform without volume production, they&#x27;ll be wildly more expensive until the vessel fabricators and ship operators hit that growth knee where experience and volume combine to deliver innovations and cost scaling of their sourcing where the savings stack up. Except in this case the savings have to come from automating the regulatory compliance and operational security of the power plants, both challenging problem spaces.<p>This is why I specifically pointed out subsidization of those areas to even out the playing field, like the tax subsidies for renewable power. It is a decades-long play for power if someone makes it a national priority. The US has possibly the most advanced ocean-going nuclear vessel tech base, has a best-in-world operational excellence in rail freight, and arguably one of the best freight logistics industries and infrastructure in the world. The US could have dominated the world through its own OBOR on a global scale in a similar way China is trying to dominate as a mercantilist superpower, through effectively owning commercial sector logistical network effects. But trying to convince the DoD and Congress the trillions that would take over decades means convincing them that is effectively what one part of soft power projection-oriented next generation war in the information age looks like. There are any number of other competing theories about next-gen war with much better-funded research and adherents out there, so it&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>The US let a significant fraction of its manufacturing and shipping infrastructure comparatively atrophy over the past few decades, so as long as it has to retool with more automation and physical infrastructure to catch up with the leaders, it might as well implement leaps of efficiency over the current state of the art like using gantry cranes to mass-lift entire multiple layers of containers [1] in a single lift cycle. The load&#x2F;unload&#x2F;downtime&#x2F;travel-time components all need lots more operational automation and innovation for nuclear commercial ships for automated regulatory compliance to be feasible, but many developed nations (especially US and China) have the tech base to combine in novel ways to deliver.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supplychaingamechanger.com&#x2F;is-there-a-faster-way-to-load-and-unload-container-ships&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supplychaingamechanger.com&#x2F;is-there-a-faster-way-to-...</a>')
