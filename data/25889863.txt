COBOL is having problems not because of the language, but because of the code created 50 years ago. For all its disadvantages, COBOL is in fact one of the most successful languages of all time because it has allowed businesses to run their software for the last 50 years. That&#x27;s why it won&#x27;t go away, even though no one in their sane mind would create even a new line of software in COBOL.<p>Python decided instead that their customers were of no value, and all the millions of lines of existing Python shouldn&#x27;t continue to run, even though it would be trivial for them to continue supporting 2.x syntax along with 3.x. I think it is one of the most insane decisions ever made by a mainstream programming language.')
