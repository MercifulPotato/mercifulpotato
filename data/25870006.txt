They&#x27;ve introduced or improved a lot of tech: better battery chemistry in new form factors, more efficient motors, over the air updates, nationwide fast charging network, increasingly sophisticated self driving features etc. Tesla is exiting because they paved the way for other car companies to electrify their products.')
