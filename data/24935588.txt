Glenn Greenwald isn&#x27;t one to produce a &quot;Garbage Story,&quot; he&#x27;s a credible journalist with a long history of dropping bombshells. He&#x27;s dropped bombshells about both the right AND the left. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Glenn_Greenwald#Awards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Glenn_Greenwald#Awards</a><p>2. It&#x27;s the job of the media to do exactly what you have alluded to within the last half of the statement above. All sides do just that every single election I&#x27;ve been alive, all the way up to election day. But this time, only one side is allowed to do it.<p>3.

This is censorship, nothing less.<p>*edit: removed hints of rudeness.')
