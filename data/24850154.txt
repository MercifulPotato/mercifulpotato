Item(by='randomfool', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603301802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849146, text='$8.3B is extremely misleading- the article says it won&#x27;t happen.<p>&quot;A forensic audit last year by Purdue found that the Sacklers directed at least $10.7 billion in the companyâ€™s proceeds to family-controlled trusts and holding companies&quot;<p>So the family extracts $10.7B from the company and pays a $225M fine. The company is fined $8.3B but most likely goes bankrupt because it&#x27;s already been drained by the family.')
