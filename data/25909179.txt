Just like we can&#x27;t say that all react developers are minimalists, we can&#x27;t say all WSBer&#x27;s are nihilists or anything else.<p>I think you have some very fundamental misunderstandings about 4chan, including who it was composed of and what both their stated and achieved goals were. As a hint, remember that 4chan is a chan made up of several sub-boards with different user niches across boards. Even if we narrow it down to &#x2F;b&#x2F; or &#x2F;pol&#x2F;, you still have competing internal factions and different movements across time.<p>Nor is your quote an example of nihilism, even in context. Nihilism is a rejection of perceived realities and the certainties tied to those realities - someone who believes truth doesn&#x27;t really exist is engaging in a form of nihilism. You seem to want to say something like &quot;they&#x27;re attacking social norms&quot; as best as I can understand.')
