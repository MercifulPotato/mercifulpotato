Worst Offender : Facebook Messenger --&gt; spyware for tracking all your activities even in background<p>2. WhatsApp : Lost trust in it since Facebook bought it, more so with the new terms and conditions. Data is not safe anymore.<p>3. Telegram : Trust it&#x27;s privacy but it&#x27;s proposed business model is also advertisement based so avoiding it.<p>4. Signal : Best option, there are some sacrifices to be made with lack of contacts and some features but slowly and surely we can turn the tide. Also it&#x27;s open source funded by a Non-Profit so that gets it bonus points.<p>Reference: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;app-privacy-labels-messaging-apps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;app-privacy-labels-messaging-...</a>')
