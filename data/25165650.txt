For some tasks, I agree, that can make a difference — but in the context of these devices with these specs, I just don’t see if. Like, if you need that much sustained CPU usage without throttling, I don’t think the M1 is the right chipset for you. The M1X or M3 or whatever they call the ones that they put in the actual high-end machines and not the entry level stuff seems more apt.<p>The biggest advantage I see between the Pro and the Air, based on everyone I’ve talked to with both, is battery life. That might be worth the $200 or $250 depending on your storage configuration.')
