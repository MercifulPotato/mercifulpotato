I&#x27;ve been eyeing it closely, but it hasn&#x27;t seen any significant movement in over two years, last I checked. I&#x27;m excited about template instantiate, though I worry the API is going to be tied to having template element instances, instead of being part of the HTMLTemplateElement <i>and</i> its own thing I could take advantage of with string templates. I also haven&#x27;t seen any place where I can give feedback formally on the proposal to the working group :(<p>HTML imports were supposed to be the holy grail to solve this, but nobody but Chrome supported it :(')
