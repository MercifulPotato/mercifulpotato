It is orders of magnitude easier to follow.<p>&gt; mind to expand that?<p>Imagine you don&#x27;t know how to use nginx.<p>Okay, now try to read ANYTHING in any of the numerous github .md files.<p>Then, just start with this page:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse</a><p>What&#x27;s Synapse? You know, I know now; but, where on that page does it say what Synapse is?<p>On basically every tutorial page, I think there&#x27;s value in asking &quot;okay, what do I need to know to understand this page?&quot; If the knowledge is important and takes more than a click or maybe two to get that answer, it&#x27;s too far away for most people, I think.<p>Again, the YouTube video walking through the steps with the guy talking is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve learned more listening to this than any number of web pages attempting to describe it.<p>Edit: I find the federation documentation to be very confusing, as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse&#x2F;blob&#x2F;develop&#x2F;docs&#x2F;federate.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse&#x2F;blob&#x2F;develop&#x2F;docs&#x2F;fede...</a>')
