The thing is that English isn&#x27;t actually that diverse. Certainly not considering how widely it is used and by how many people.<p>There is more variety in how my native Norwegian is spoken, and that is only spoken by 5 million people.<p>You also don&#x27;t seem to distinguish between dialects, written forms and a language. E.g. Norwegian is a language with dozens of dialects and four written form, two of which are official. The various dialects map to one written form more closely than another.<p>Nothing stops English from being a language of different dialects and different written forms. The point isn&#x27;t how many written forms there are but that those that exist are standardized. That is IMHO not a very hard thing. E.g. the largest area where English is natively spoken is the US. And the US has almost no variation in how the language is spoken.<p>Yes I know American loudly object to this but I have traveled all over the US and lived several placed. Honestly there is not much difference between  how somebody in Grand Forks, North Dakota speaks and somebody in Honolulu, Hawaii.<p>Yes, by American standards it may sound very different. But by say Swiss standards, Norwegian standards etc not very much. Even tiny Britain has more regional variation.<p>One would simply create American, British, Australian etc standardized written forms, while trying to harmonize each written form as well as possible.')
