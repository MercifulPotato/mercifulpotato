It&#x27;s a game which cannot be played safely.<p>So, VRBO it&#x27;s been for me.  And that said?  It&#x27;s overall been a reasonably good experience.  They do have this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.vrbo.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;What-is-the-Book-with-Confidence-Guarantee" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.vrbo.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;What-is-the-Book-with-Confide...</a><p>And, I&#x27;ve used it once to fight a minor issue.  A renter decided they wanted me to sign a &#x27;rental agreement&#x27; <i>after</i> I booked, paid, and was 24 hours out from arrival.<p>Nope.  VRBO quashed that.  Their statement was &quot;If you cannot get in when you arrive, and the renter cannot be reached&#x2F;won&#x27;t allow you in, call us.  We&#x27;ll relocate you &#x2F; fix it.&quot;<p>Problem went away.<p>I also have had no issue getting in touch with VRBO, with a human being, whenever required.  5 minute wait is typical.<p>Of course, I have absolutely no idea about how things are now, during&#x2F;post pandemic.  Lay offs?  Confusion?  Less revenue?  I really do not know.<p>So it could all be different now... sadly.')
