But since last Friday it has received over 35K visits hence the really expensive bill, which by the way is not so much for the storage, but for reading the Firestore database. I simply haven&#x27;t had the time to re-build the site in a more efficient way it since then, hopefully tomorrow I&#x27;ll get working on it and find a better alternative solution.')
