It&#x27;s idiotic to have to drag oneself to the office to do work which can be done just as well, if not better, without getting out of bed. It&#x27;s also bad to not be able to get teams together from time to time, to brainstorm, discuss things, and just plain get to know each other. I hope companies find a happy middle ground at some point, and I also hope managers can figure out how to manage people effectively in such circumstances. Currently nobody at the previously &quot;butts in chairs&quot; companies knows how to do that, and my manager friends at places like Google, FB and MS are unsure if they&#x27;re &quot;holding it right&quot;.')
