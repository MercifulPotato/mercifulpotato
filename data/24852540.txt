It even has a Wikipedia article[1]. Even if they provided the expansion of the acronym in their comment, one might feel that they should also explain a little about the concept before referring to it, since the general audience cannot be expected to know about it. However, that would distract from the point the comment is meant to make.<p>Since the comment is not about what BATNA is, it&#x27;s better to focus writing on the point it&#x27;s trying to get across, even if it ends up limiting the intended audience. Those that are not familiar with it are better served by looking it up, anyways.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Best_alternative_to_a_negotiat...</a>')
