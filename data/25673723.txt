Multiple handsets were handled by a base station which used some form of wireless transmission. If the handset hadn&#x27;t been used to pick up a call, it wouldn&#x27;t play back the signal (I&#x27;m sure given the time period, it was still being broadcast, and unsecured, but it was still a bit more involved to listen in than just picking up the other handset).')
