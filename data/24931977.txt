You are still getting the same service if you called Apple directly but its not legal because Apple did not give me permission to impersonate them.<p>You&#x27;re missing the part about how GrubHub, et. al don&#x27;t just pass you along, they <i>charge</i> 12-30% &quot;commission&quot; just for forwarding the call -- and they set up the fake number <i>just</i> so they could do so.')
