Turbo Pascal, in particular, let you put raw asm right in the middle of your code.<p>&quot;Safe&quot; languages have been invented many times, but programmers always seem to gravitate to powerful, if &quot;dangerous&quot;, languages like C and (now) JavaScript.<p>There&#x27;s probably a lesson for language designers here.')
