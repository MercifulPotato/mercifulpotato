This time breakdown goes into my monthly report. I do not call any meetings. It is always the PM or another manager setting up meetings and wanting me to be in it. The PM, and the CTO, and other higher ups get very upset, at me, when they see that I log between 40 and 90 hours per month in meetings. I am to blame for this apparently. And they also wonder why development is slow. But this is also a case of more managers than there are developers. It is also why I am looking to move on at the earliest opportunity.')
