My work is my hobby and even before Corona things were intermixed completely.<p>If someone pings me at 11pm from the US with a major issue and I have nothing better to do, Call of Duty can wait till tomorrow :P I like helping people and it helps relax my mind knowing that in the morning there hasn&#x27;t been a major escalation building up over the last 8 hours. And they know I&#x27;m in Europe so they won&#x27;t bother me if it&#x27;s not urgent.<p>On the other side, if I need to go to the bank or doctor during the day I&#x27;ll just schedule a meeting. No need to book time off. I love this flexibility. My boss is totally OK with this (and judging by his Yammer&#x2F;Email activity, he does the exact same). My role is global so I always have colleagues working somewhere around the globe.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not that easy for everyone. Some people have a life, kids etc. But it should remain a <i>choice</i>, that&#x27;s my point. I happen to like a 24-hour society. That also happens.<p>I heard that in some countries like France and Germany some companies force email to stop working during the weekend. I wouldn&#x27;t want this. Especially with Covid right now I have very little to go outside for, so the weekends are super boring.')
