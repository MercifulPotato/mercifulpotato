The book that helped me a lot with the JavaScript language (in 2010) was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;2998152-javascript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;2998152-javascript</a>. However, this was before the ECMAScript standard and the Web APIs developed as fast as they are doing today. Node.js I learned exclusively from reading the documentation and experimenting with it.<p>Similar to what zeroc8 said, I heard that people liked &quot;You don&#x27;t know JS&quot;. Also, I agree with joshxyz that you can learn a lot from the MDN and the Node.js API docs. Especially MDN is a great resource for learning specific concept. As example, look at their Promises tutorial: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;Global_Objects&#x2F;Promise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Refe...</a> Furthermore, I also think the publications from Axel Rauschmayer are worth checking out (exploringjs.com).<p>The section in the Preface of my book might sound a bit daunting. Even if you don&#x27;t know JavaScript, but have experience with at least one other programming language, that might be fine. I think the most challenging aspect is the asynchronous programming part, which is being used extensively due to Node.js.')
