There are no guarantees that any specific device or application needs to do that or how.<p>There is a cost to firewall rules like that as well. Who is going to maintain a list of all the IPs on the internet that are hosting DoH servers that could be used? What about the potentially more prolific proxies specified in this protocol enhancement? How does a network administrator keep all of those in sync with their edge networks? How does a home user?<p>Since DoH uses HTTPS there is no reason a service can&#x27;t be multihomed on the same IP just like SNI allows multiple HTTPS servers on one IP.
