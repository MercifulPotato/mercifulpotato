People have been running GNU&#x2F;Linux on aarch64-based laptops, SBCs, phones and servers for years now (and not just GNU&#x2F;Linux, there&#x27;s even Windows these days, as seen in this submission!). This is a well supported architecture across multiple distributions and OSes. Granted, M1 is a rather beefy chip to see in a aarch64-based laptop, but compatibility and performance issues of 64-bit ARM are areas that seem pretty well researched in 2020. It&#x27;s just macOS being late in the game.')
