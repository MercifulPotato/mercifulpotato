It&#x27;s supported theoretically, but practically there are issues, one have to carefully pick motherboard and even then it&#x27;s some kind of unsupported configuration. Intel sells cheap and fast Xeons with proper ECC support. I&#x27;m very interested in AMD CPUs and I hope that ECC story will improve, so I can buy some kind of workstation-branded motherboard and use fully supported ECC configuration.')
