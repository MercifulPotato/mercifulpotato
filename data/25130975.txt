I don&#x27;t think this is how AMD does thingsâ€”all their desktop and Threadripper processors are constructed out of 8-core chiplets. The higher-core count processors just use more chiplets per package, not necessarily larger dies. If Apple&#x27;s already putting multiple chiplets on one package (core + RAM), I wonder if they&#x27;ll use the same approach to scaling.')
