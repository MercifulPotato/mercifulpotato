So you end with double NAT and all the joys that entails (such as [1]). There are also a number of other issues that have been associated with operating in their faux-passthrough mode, including<p>- Issues with IPv6 prefix delegation<p>- Sporadic latency spikes (an issue in general, that you inherit since the gateway is still &quot;doing&quot; everything it normally would, since it won&#x27;t actually act as a ure passthrough&#x2F;bridge)<p>- A firmware update capped throughput at 50Mbps (later fixed in another firmware update)[2]<p>- Firmware updates tend to silently re-enable the built-in wifi radios<p>So while it&#x27;ll <i>generally</i> work, it ends up problematic. You  inherit all of the performance issues associated with just using the gateway as your all in one modem&#x2F;router&#x2F;firewall&#x2F;AP&#x2F;gateway, <i>plus</i> the addition of double NAT, <i>plus</i> the sharp edges of their poorly implemented faux-passthrough modes, <i>plus</i> the ever-present concern that you&#x27;re one firmware update away from a non-working network despite having used their official passthrough configuration.<p>Hence why gateway bypasses are so popular[3][4][5][6]. Even if they&#x27;re a bit involved to set up, once you get it working things just... work. With little if any upkeep (potentially a few minutes after a power outage, depending on the bypass method you implement).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.windowscentral.com&#x2F;fix-xbox-one-double-nat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.windowscentral.com&#x2F;fix-xbox-one-double-nat</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dslreports.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;r32172124-AT-T-Fiber-5268AC-DMZ-to-Router-Speeds-50-200" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dslreports.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;r32172124-AT-T-Fiber-5268AC...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MonkWho&#x2F;pfatt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MonkWho&#x2F;pfatt</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bypassrg&#x2F;att" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bypassrg&#x2F;att</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mrozentsvayg&#x2F;vyos.att" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mrozentsvayg&#x2F;vyos.att</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hou-dev&#x2F;simple-eap-proxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hou-dev&#x2F;simple-eap-proxy</a>')
