Sure, you can &#x27;just&#x27; stick to the negative fragment, but that &#x27;just&#x27; is sweeping a lot of questions of ergonomics under the rug.  One thing that attracted me to Lean was that I could formalize mathematics as I knew it, more or less, and there was a vibrant community with a fairly well developed library of basic classical mathematics.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these concerns about constructibility aren&#x27;t unimportant.  I do appreciate both POVs.  I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something you have to force mathematicians to worry about if all they&#x27;re interested in is formalizing their math on a computer.<p>Something that&#x27;s interesting about Lean is that double-negation elimination is used in Prop but not generally in Type and above.  You have to explicitly reach for the axiom of choice if you want to &quot;construct&quot; a term of a type that isn&#x27;t empty.')
