I know it&#x27;s early, but you can think of GPT-3 as the next generation of search engines. You consume the entire &quot;Internet knowledge&quot;, and you answer questions, by merging information from multiple sources. Not just returning one existing page. That&#x27;s sort of what GPT-3 does, you just don&#x27;t think of it as a search engine yet.<p>Google felt &quot;magic&quot; in 2000. A search-oriented GPT-3 will feel &quot;magic&quot; soon.')
