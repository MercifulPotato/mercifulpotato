Typing code into a shell prompt is excruciating by comparison.<p>I think this is a huge barrier of entry to languages like Clojure. The syntax and dynamic nature of the language really lend themselves to an extremely interactive and productive workflow, but that is a hard thing to communicate. It seems most people think that when Clojure programmers refer to the joy of the REPL they imagine writing code into Python or Ruby&#x27;s REPLs (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;languages&#x2F;python3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;languages&#x2F;python3</a>), but that is about as far from what is meant as is possible. I mean, who would enjoy programming in an environment that deleted your work every time you finished a line of code?')
