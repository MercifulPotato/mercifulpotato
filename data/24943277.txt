In regular math, we have axes, but we don&#x27;t think much about a point being at the &quot;intersection of the x=3 line and the y=5 line&quot;, it&#x27;s just &quot;horizontally 3 and vertically 5&quot;. But in GIS we visualize a full grid, with &quot;lines of latitude&quot; instead of &quot;lateral deviation&quot;.')
