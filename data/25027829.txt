First of all, this only applies if you subscribe for at leas a year (e.g. a 1 month subscription is not enough to get a perpetual license). Secondly, you only get a perpetual license for the product available at the time of purchase or 12 months prior.<p>So, e.g. if you buy a yearly subscription for CLion now, then you will get a perpetual license for 2020.2.z (the current version), but not for 2020.3.z. Of course, you can renew the license after a year and get perpetual licenses for newer releases as well.<p>(Maybe this is what you were saying, but it doesn&#x27;t read like that ;).)<p><i>Another is &quot;pay for the specific version once and be done with it, here&#x27;s your license key.&quot;</i><p>They don&#x27;t have that model for their IDEs anymore, right?<p>That said, I am also a happy user of JetBrains products, and especially their All Products Pack is really a good deal (if you frequently switch between languages).')
