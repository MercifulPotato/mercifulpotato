Even a quick skimming of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Identity_politics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Identity_politics</a> shows how complex even the term can be.<p>Here are only three examples of how <i>identity politics</i> might be used. It can be used to describe:<p>1. how minority groups fight oppression based on skin color<p>2. how a majority group, perceiving a threat, joins together  (often based on baser instincts)<p>3. a tendency for political parties to connect primarily on surface-level attributes of people, rather than substantive root causes<p>Which of these (if any) do you mean when you talk about <i>identity politics</i>?<p>Caveat: I am no expert on the term.')
