At the very least, they are limited by something like available total GDP.<p>Borrowing or taxing just lets the government control more of that GDP pile, it doesn&#x27;t create any extra goods out of thin air.<p>(Economists have a concept of &#x27;economic slack&#x27;, that is how much extra output there could be if there was more nominal spending happening before inflation kicks in.  But there are typically talking about something like 10% at most, not orders of magnitude.  And a reasonably competent central bank makes sure to print enough money so that this extra spending is happening.)<p>You are right however, that much government spending seems extremely inefficient.<p>In any case, government handed out stuff ain&#x27;t free.  At least you always have opportunity costs.')
