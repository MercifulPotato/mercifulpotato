I&#x27;ve been working on Algebraic for the past several months. Algebraic generates detailed text and video explanations of math problems for high-school students. I&#x27;m still in the early stages but it can solve simple equations and I&#x27;m looking for a rust developer as a co-founder to speed up development. I&#x27;m located in Wollongong, Australia. I intend on making the project AGPL once I have a full working version. Contact me @ Isaacbankier@protonmail.com')
