Resurrecting one of those old forks like xemacs isn&#x27;t really an option. Also replacing Elisp with CL isn&#x27;t a good idea. There&#x27;s very little actual reward on that investment.<p>See\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emacsconf.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;talks&#x2F;26&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emacsconf.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;talks&#x2F;26&#x2F;</a> \n(you can skim through the slides to save time)<p>People have different ideas but I&#x27;d like to emphasize the good work being done on GNU Emacs right now. Also lots of new efforts such as Remacs. But there&#x27;s no reason to try to rewrite emacs in Common Lisp or GNU Guile or whatever.')
