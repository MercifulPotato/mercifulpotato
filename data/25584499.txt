But you cannot go to a library without it. Like this week I saw a post of someone getting a 150â‚¬ late fee bill from the library while having no idea why, that would never happen with my app. That should have been well monetarizable, pay for my app, or you are going to pay ten times more to a late fee bill<p>After the Windows app failed,  I doubled down on the niche, by making it a Linux app.<p>I thought as plan B, if I do not find users, I could sell it to the library itself. I thought that was a sure sale, because the library had bought software from me before, but they did not want an app<p>Then I made it open-source, so I do not have to deal with it anymore, but no one understands Pascal code. It only lead to much more work.  Now I have been working on it almost every free hour for 14 year. And I really should not have written my own HTML parser for it')
