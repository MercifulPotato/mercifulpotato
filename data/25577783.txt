I&#x27;m so glad my parents took me camping on the US-Canadian border as a kid and forced me to navigate for the family (with them double-checking).  Teach your kids to navigate by map.  When you really need it, you really need it.<p>Hiking in Hong Kong, Google maps disagreed with the route I was attempting to take on Sir Cecil&#x27;s Ride back around the back side of the rock quarry.  Google maps took us across the front face of the quarry, past the police shooting range &#x2F; Explosive Ordinance Disposal Depot, and up a sheer rock face next to the quarry with the assistance of a cobbled-together rope some kind soul left for others, then through a bamboo thicket that cut my wife&#x27;s legs up.  My wife no longer insists on following Google maps if it disagrees with the hiking route I&#x27;m planning.')
