Downloading videos may violate Youtube&#x27;s TOS, but that&#x27;s civil&#x2F;contract law and not criminal and so the DMCA can&#x27;t be used to enforce such TOS violations.</i><p>Downloading a Youtube video is making a copy. Whether it is a copyright violation depends on whether Youtube&#x27;s license includes letting visitors make permanent copies, as this is considered a <i>separate</i> type of license. The TOS has nothing to do with it.<p><i>A person might share a video they don&#x27;t own the copyright to, after downloading it from youtube with youtube-dl, but youtube-dl has no functionality in it to do such illegal sharing. It only has the time-shift functionality.</i><p>This is false. Also, time-shifting is not a a valid fair-use defense for material available on-demand, because the justification for time-shifting (as in the Betamax case) generally no longer exists. There are other fair use arguments that could be made, but time-shifting isn&#x27;t one of them.<p><i>They had to cite a German legal ruling which found YouTube’s “rolling cipher” was an anti-circumvention device. But German court rulings have no bearing on US law, and Germany doesn&#x27;t have a DMCA statute, so it is a specious claim, and the RIAA is just hoping an open source project won&#x27;t be able to fund a legal defense.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re joking or not, but they cited a variety of US cases. Kazaa, Limewire, Napster, etc, are all <i>US</i> cases that all came down the same way: a tool intended primarily for copyright violations violates the DMCA, and in certain cases can even expose its developers to statutory damages under the copyright code.<p><i>It&#x27;s Betamax time-shifting plus macrovision&#x2F;video stabilizers all over again. </i><p>Nope, not even close for so many reasons already explained in this and other comments.')
