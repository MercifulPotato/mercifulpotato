Its easier to document and personally I find people are less like to cuss when typing. Also, if possible, move your seat as far away as possible so its harder to chat. \nAlso, cc your boss in emails. Use the excuse &quot;keeping Boss updated with my work status&quot;. This gives you more documentation that you told your boss of the problem (and the cost of the problem) and received no support from him.\nEven if you don&#x27;t plan on going to HR&#x2F;CEO, documentation is important to collect. It will protect you if the abuser suddenly blames you for the abuse.')
