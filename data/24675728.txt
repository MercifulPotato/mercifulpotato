This is def gonna be useful for a lot of people. \nCompanies can benefit from using something like this too. It helps when all your people use the same tool to build and run models and just need to share yaml&#x2F;json files. The alternative is each group has its own scripts and sharing is harder.<p>The simplicity of such tools has a tradeoff though. It takes away some of the flexibility. Also, actually writing code helps people learn about ML so there&#x27;s benefit of doing the hard code when building ML models. But that&#x27;s not the target audience of this project so that&#x27;s OK.<p>Good luck!')
