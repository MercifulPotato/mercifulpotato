I am striving for a calm gameplay similar to the truck simulator franchises in which the player can deliver cargo and take time to admire the universe around them.<p>The project is still young, and I do not have a lot to share at the moment, but if you are interested, you can follow along on the subreddit below!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SpaceFreighters&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SpaceFreighters&#x2F;</a>')
