They do occasionally kill initiatives <i>(Can you say “OpenDoc”? I knew you could!)</i>, but not at the 50% rate that Google does, so I knew it wasn’t a big risk.<p>Also, I really enjoy the language.<p>It’s a long-term investment, and I don’t expect it to really start paying any dividends for at least another couple of years. I would be fine, sticking with ObjC, which I know will still be around for at least another decade.<p>But I’m at the point in life, where I want to work with tech that I enjoy.')
