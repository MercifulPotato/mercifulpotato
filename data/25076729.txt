You realize that you literally have to turn off the network connection completely to prevent dozens of companies from getting this information every waking moment? Windows and even Ubuntu constantly send back basic telemetry, not to mention the many more less-trustworthy apps that are refreshing in the background, the websites you interact with (even with ads&#x2F;tracking blocked, the site itself still knows your IP address and time of access!), and so on.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not the exact point I was making originally, but my point now is that this is a <i>ridiculous</i> thing to focus on in the grand scheme of privacy concerns. It might be the single least-privacy-significant network request that any of your devices <i>ever</i> makes. Personally, if that&#x27;s the only cost, I&#x27;ll take the tradeoff for the security benefits. But even if I didn&#x27;t feel that way, it&#x27;s not what I would be spending my energy worrying about.')
