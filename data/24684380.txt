There&#x27;s no evidence of it, plenty pointing in other directions, it&#x27;s just a non-starter.<p>Which sucks, because if bipolar was caused by, I dunno, seed oils, great news! Just don&#x27;t eat seed oils!<p>And if someone goes to the doctor and says &quot;I&#x27;m bloated and gassy all the time and I feel terrible&quot; and the doctor says &quot;yeah you&#x27;re lactose intolerant, avoid dairy and take these pills when you eat it&quot;, that&#x27;s not blaming the person either.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are people in your life who blame you for being the way that you are. I don&#x27;t see this as a case of that. They probably read some woo-woo nutritional site with bad advice, and thought they were helping.')
