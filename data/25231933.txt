And the ETH graduates are probably top-quality. But the parent poster said that he didn&#x27;t experience cutting edge technology in switzerland and I wondered whether it&#x27;s the same in Zurich.<p>In germany, I&#x27;ve experience that you can excel at one technical property (usually your core product, manufacturing something, designing some material) while also being very conservative in virtually every other dimension. It&#x27;s different in startups, but I wonder about zurich in general. So I think that both is possible, moving very slow and being very conservative, while on the other hand excelling at one particular thing (where you would need the high-quality ETH graduates). It&#x27;s usually that IT is not the main focus here (in germany), so you can end up in slowly moving, very conservative, magnitudes behind cutting edge organisation. The swiss are not really known for a silicon-valley kind of attitude. I think it&#x27;s a mindset and a lot of companies only see IT as cost instead of investment, much less as a driver of innovation. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking.')
