They also unavoidably impact physical properties of the object, like weight and dimensions.<p>Whereas a programmer can spin out as much code as they want, basically without material consequence. There is no constant gravitational force keeping them in check, requiring them to justify each piece of complexity as they go. It&#x27;s ethereal, weightless, and its disadvantages usually only surface years down the line.')
