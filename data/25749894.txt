As an interesting counterexample to the trend, see video conferencing platforms over the past year: despite contact lists, calendar integration, cross platform whatever and decades of brand recognition, it wasn&#x27;t Meet and Skype that got all the initial mindshare around pandemic WFH video callingâ€” it was relative newcomer Zoom, whose killer feature was that you could just click a link and be in the meeting.<p>On the other hand, once Meet finally ripped off that feature, I basically switched to using it all the time. So maybe Zoom&#x27;s ease-of-entry was an initial winner, but ultimately there was nothing keeping me there when Google offered the same but without the freemium time limits. Perhaps there is a parallel here with a service like Mumble?')
