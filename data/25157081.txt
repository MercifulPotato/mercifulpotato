I tried, once: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;liolaarc&#x2F;monki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;liolaarc&#x2F;monki</a> (jeez, 5 years ago now.)<p>It&#x27;s basically a git clone + a literate programming file that describes what changes to make to the code. It worked pretty well, though I often wonder whether it was just some silly idea.<p>So essentially, if you wanted to apply a fix to an open source codebase <i>locally</i> for your business, you could do that. It would be a clone, followed by a patch. (In this context, a &quot;patch&quot; is simply &quot;here&#x27;s the existing code I expect; here&#x27;s the new code to replace it with.&quot; It works until that specific code changes at some point in the future.)')
