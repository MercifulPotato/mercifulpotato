Trust Domains (half completed, but littered throughout the code as nss3 prefix). This was being lead by Sun and stopped when Oracle acquired them.<p>3. libpkix: This was done by porting Java code to C using preprocessor macros to simulate exception handling. It implemented path discovery, and not just verification, and was used by Firefox for EV processing (AIUI), and was always used by Chrome on Linux&#x2F;ChromeOS (until recently replaced with the Chromium built-in verifier)<p>4. mozilla::pkix, which started off as Brian Smith’s insanity::pkix rewrite of a minimalist path builder&#x2F;verifier. I can’t remember if this launched while Brian was still at Mozilla or after he had left, but Brian would later take the approach he used for insanity::pkix when writing the Rust webpki project ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;briansmith&#x2F;webpki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;briansmith&#x2F;webpki</a> )<p>Each of the above APIs had significantly different interfaces for controlling verification. The trust domain stuff wasn’t as visible, because it was only half-completed.')
