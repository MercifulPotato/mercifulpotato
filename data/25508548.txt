It&#x27;s absurd that everyone is forced to evaluate and have a single opinion&#x2F;vote on all these completely separate issues as a unit. How much political BS is hiding in these massive bills, quid-pro-quo, back scratching, intentionally opaque text that nobody can understand the implications of until long after it&#x27;s been jammed through... its <i>disgusting</i><p>We should outlaw bills like these.')
