This feels like it’s just inviting errors unnecessarily, especially given that some parts of the world use comma (,) as their decimal separator and full stop (.) for grouping, rather than the other way round. I see no compelling reason for allowing grouping at all.<p>• “The &#x27;unit&#x27; value MUST be smaller than 2^53.  If present, the &#x27;fraction&#x27; MUST consist of no more than 8 decimal digits.” Both of these feel a mite surprising, and the combination of them far more surprising. The 2⁵³ limit is doubtless to allow it to be safely stored in a 64-bit floating point number, specifically for JavaScript’s sake; but (dealing with this part first) do you know how <i>small</i> 2⁵³ is? 9 quadrillion. That’s honestly not that large. I’ve handled a 100 trillion dollar note, and that’s hardly the highest any currency has ever gone. (Admittedly, the sorts of currencies where this is happening probably have limited use for a payto: URI scheme at the time.) But anyway, skipping onto the second part, a fraction of up to eight digits. Skipping over the apparent arbitrariness of the number (which happens to match Bitcoin’s division), if you’ve made concession to treat the <i>unit</i> as a Number, what about the <i>fraction</i>? If you wanted to retain eight decimal places of significance, you’d be limiting your unit to 2⁵³ ÷ 10⁸, about 90 million, which is obviously too low, so you clearly can’t be meant to be representing the <i>whole thing</i> as a Number, so why that restriction on the <i>unit</i>? So yeah, both of these limits simply feel weird to me.<p>But other than these quibbles, I say: <i>finally</i>! I’m really glad about this and hope it gets adopted by banking apps and the likes quickly, and added to the HTML spec’s safelisted schemes (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html.spec.whatwg.org&#x2F;#safelisted-scheme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;html.spec.whatwg.org&#x2F;#safelisted-scheme</a>) so that banks’ web apps can also navigator.registerProtocolHandler(&quot;payto&quot;, &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bank.example&#x2F;payto-handler&#x2F;%s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bank.example&#x2F;payto-handler&#x2F;%s</a>&quot;) soon. And also that Australian banks either register some way of addressing their accounts as a payto payment target type, or adopt IBAN.')
