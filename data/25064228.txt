A must run first, then its output is fed to B, which must run to completion, and its output is fed to C. Using a single thread for this is the only sane implementation.<p>If you have plugins A, B and C spread across 3 signal paths, then you can certainly run them on different cores, which Ableton (and Ardour and almost any other DAW at this point) will do, by virtue on running each signal path in its own thread. The signal path&#x2F;thread containing plugin A will execute on a thread&#x2F;core, independently of the one containing B or the one containing C.')
