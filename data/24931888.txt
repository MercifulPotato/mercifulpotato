These apps can do things, like talk to a database.<p>Cloud Firestore is a nosql database offering on Firebase. Cloud SQL Postgres is a database offering on GCP.<p>Firebase Cloud Functions (FCF) are &#x27;serverless functions&#x27;. You upload some code that looks like an Express app. I personally use the npm package &#x27;apollo-server-cloud-functions&#x27; to provide Apollo Server GraphQL endpoints using &#x27;type-graphql&#x27;. If you do it right, there is very little vendor lockin. I theoretically could use this same code on Nhost.<p>Since it is all Google, Firebase can &#x27;talk&#x27; to anything on GCP. Thus, my FCF can use &#x27;mikro-orm&#x27; to talk to my cloud sql postgres database.<p>I know, a lot of names... but once you wrap your head around it all, it starts to get a bit easier. The nice thing about all of this is that I get one small usage based bill every month and it just magically runs without any devops or thought on my part.')
