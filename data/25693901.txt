I never got into Twitter, and the more accessible tech has become, it seems to have become eternal summer.<p>Which, on one hand is good - tech is accessible, government &quot;can&quot; be more transparent then ever.<p>But is it, really? Go back to any presidency generation and you can see the same questions. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s the red scare, the pacifist of USA not jumping into WW2 until bommbed at pearl harbor (but had operations in Sino China.) and etc -<p>That&#x27;s another issue here, the moving and adaption of wrong think, and tribes forming based if you think one alike - there&#x27;s so many arguments from how you value money, what is money, what is a good president, if the color of your skin matter, what you do, how you spend your free time, if you allow people to peer onto your social presence, etc<p>It&#x27;s just alarming, the slippery slope of internet adaption&#x2F;culture the past decade really has ushered a dystopia.<p>But, it seems, according to you, that is &quot;utterly baffling and genuinely inconceivable&quot; where it goes to show, if you don&#x27;t follow tribe mentality, you are labelled pariah, and then what, excommunicated for questioning the status quo?')
