Item(by='lmilcin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608292181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25466045, text='Fortunately, I rarely risk anything if the board fails. And if it does I always try to understand what caused the failure.<p>I never considered flux compatibility between my solder rosin core and the flux paste and never considered measuring salt residues on the board.<p>I almost exclusively use the same Kester sn64pb37 rosin core solder and MG Chemicals #8342 RA rosin flux paste. Both must be cleaned promptly. Now, I don&#x27;t bother cleaning if I don&#x27;t intend to use the board after I test it (like when I do prototyping) but anything else gets a thorough wash. I use various PCB cleaners, typically ethanol (not IPA!) based and then rinse boards in electronic water. I never saw any oxidation on any of the traces unless there was some external contamination.')
