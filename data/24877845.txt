Once you are proactively &quot;defending&quot; not eating into your hard earned savings account, your mentality changes 180 degrees - in a single day vs when you are living in the red 365 day&#x2F;yr.<p>I know a guy from college, poorest guy I know, constantly begging off family &amp; getting late fees on his rent. He works a crap job though at least 250% minimum wage because he couldn&#x27;t finish school on the 6 years of full-ride scholarship he got for having the right skin color (school diversity scholarship) and then still wanted a degree so took out a $80,000 loan for a fraud school. He failed out.<p>I lived 2 years on his same income, it is low, but he doesn&#x27;t live in a HCOL area - so I can assure you it is plenty if carefully managed. He doesn&#x27;t buy anything impressive, he appears to live a basic life, BUT: He just has no idea how to manage his emotions and therefore to manage his occasional spending. There are probably 10 guys like him for every person who actually is so broke there is no way out. I know how he uses his windfalls - he openly admits it to me without even thinking for a second that it makes no sense - and he&#x27;s in his 40s now. I can&#x27;t lecture on it because the emotional wall that comes up won&#x27;t let him hear - it is &quot;capitalism&quot; that is to blame apparently and some politicians. This is what America&#x27;s &quot;poor&quot; looks like, it is far more a mental state than concrete reality.')
