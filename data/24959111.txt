Think &quot;make a library that can be used on iOS and Android&quot;. You still need to write the UI and platform-specific plumbing separately for each.<p>Flutter includes the UI and can give you apps running on both platforms (and web and desktop, too!) with 100% shared code†.<p>†In practice, though, you may need to get your hands dirty with platform-native code for functionality not already covered by the plugin ecosystem, though that need diminishes over time.')
