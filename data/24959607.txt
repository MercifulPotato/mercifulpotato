Item(by='cletus', descendants=None, kids=[24959976], score=None, time=1604240133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957733, text='Australian here and I recently came back from spending months in Perth (where there hasn’t been a case of community spread since April).<p>You mention weather here but, having followed the news, is clear that the primary factor in Melbourne’s outbreak was breaches in quarantine, so much so that there was a government investigation into it. Weather seemed to have very little to do with it.<p>There’s really no comparison with Melbourne winters and those in most of North America or Europe either. Melbourne climate is pretty mild all things considered.<p>You seem to be pinning this on poorly trained and paid security guards but there’s credible evidence that there were incidents on security having relationships with those in quarantine (and the responsibility for that falls on both parties). Plus the quarantine didn’t seem to be that strict. People leaving to go out shopping, that sort of thing. Again those in quarantine should also know better.')
