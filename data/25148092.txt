Using Linkedin<p>You register in SwanLove website. Then you submit your vanity name of your Linkedin profile. If your Linkedin profile URL is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;aragorn-son-of-arathorn, your vanity name is &quot;aragorn-son-of-arathorn&quot;. Then you must verify your Linkedin profile by creating a public Linkedin post containing a random string generated by SwanLove. Finally, you submit the URL of the public post so SwanLove can verify it.<p>Then you can send &quot;likes&quot; to someone, for example someone who has this URL of Linkedin profile: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;arwen-daughter-of-elrond. You just submit &quot;arwen-daughter-of-elrond&quot; as someone you like. Then if the owner of that Linkedin profile registers in SwanLove website, the owner can like your profile after verification. Both of you are matched!<p>2. Using movies preferences<p>You submit movies &#x2F; tv series you have watched or are watching in your dating profile. Then you can browse dating profiles in the movie page (for example Queen&#x27;s Gambit move page). The second way does not require Linkedin account.<p>In the future, you can link your Goodreads account to find people based on books preferences.<p>That&#x27;s all. I hope it will be useful for you in your romance life!<p>Arjuna Sky Kok')
