The first one I thought went well, I had a two-way conversation with the Engineering Manager, but sadly I didn&#x27;t hear back from the recruiter, so I assumed it was a rejection. The second time I cleared the initial screen question, then I had a coding question with two engineers. They gave me a problem, and I solved it but using a sub-optimal algorithm. I thought I&#x27;d done well, because it was a hard problem and the solution was not very far from the optimal one. Unfortunately, after two weeks and chasing the recruiter, I got the rejection that they went with someone else.')
