That&#x27;s not just due to the pricing model --- which we can change! --- but the entire debugging approach, where we do a lot of analysis up front, speeding the debugging experience but adding latency to the workflow.<p>Now, sometimes people are doing that because to track down a bug they have to go through many cycles of adding instrumentation or logging to their code. In many cases Pernosco can just make those cycles go away, e.g. using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pernos.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;expressions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pernos.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;expressions</a>.<p>However, if you develop new code using cycles of &quot;add new code, compile, debug&quot;, and each of those debugging sessions are short, Pernosco isn&#x27;t a great fit for that currently.')
