I would say this has been driven directly by a perception that companies leave money on the table in traditional IPOs, and indirectly by the rise of the &quot;disruptor&quot; mindset led by tech companies where CEOs are more willing to challenge the status quo.<p>From the investors&#x27; side, SPACs are popular because they&#x27;ve been really successful! I don&#x27;t have stats on this but just buying SPACs surely outperformed any index in the last 5 years. You&#x27;d expect this effect to disappear as they get more popular, but it&#x27;s worth noting that blindly buying IPOs has also been a really good investment strategy - enough first-day pops of 50% or 100% to outweigh the duds - though less accessible to small investors.')
