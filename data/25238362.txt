Got onto the plane pretty late because of this, and it was fairly quiet - this was about 10pm boarding time.  Had a seat on the outside of the middle 4, and there was no-one else in those 4 seats, but a guy on the next aisle seat to me on his own group of 3.  We both looked a bit sheepishly at each other and smiled when they shut the doors - had a complete row of seats each on that flight, the most comfortable return flight I&#x27;ve had from the US - stretched out across the seats and had a decent sleep for once!<p>Not sure I&#x27;d want to pay for it though - there&#x27;s hard metal between the seat bases...')
