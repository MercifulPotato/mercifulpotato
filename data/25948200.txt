It&#x27;s also murder for hire, presuming that they contracted with someone to have the user executed.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure why you would assume that this wasn&#x27;t a case of buying on margin since the forced liquidation is STANDARD for buying on margin and the user (however reliable they may or may not be as a source) didn&#x27;t even say that it wasn&#x27;t bought on margin.')
