In particular many EU countries (like Austria and others) were hoping for non mRNA vaccines to be approved faster because they would be significantly easier to handle.<p>We purposefully did not &quot;order more&quot; at the time it was offered since that was before approval.  EU countries have been extending their orders after the approval went through to bridge the time until other vaccines become an option.<p>The EU in total ordered four times as much vaccines as we need.')
