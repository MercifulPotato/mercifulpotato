I just downloaded that Turner book. It doesn&#x27;t say where the word came from at all. The <i>earliest</i> primary citation for the word &quot;vikingr&quot; is in reference to a saga written by Snorre&#x2F;Snorri (an Icelandic historian), who was born in the late 12th century. &quot;Wicing&quot; dates to the 11th century (see Sea Wolves, A History of the Vikings; you&#x27;re welcome to go down that primary cite rabbit hole yourself).')
