I spent the last six to seven years using Scala, learning FP concepts, getting familiar with Haskell and it&#x27;s concepts as well as other functional languages. This is after 7+ years prior doing lots of typical Java, Javascript, PHP which I was quite happy to use.<p>Now I&#x27;m in the situation after learning languages which provide far more useful day to day principals, abstractions and safety I struggle or rather get frustrated very quickly when I go back to C style languages i.e Java, Javascript, PHP, Python.<p>My huge problem now is I&#x27;m in Sydney, Australia. 4-5 years ago there was a reasonable strong enthusiasm for Scala and functional programmers in general. No, I&#x27;ve been looking to change jobs for the past year and absolutely nothing has popped up.<p>It seems the only roles available are traditional Java with Spring Boot, Javscript, Python and C#.<p>Even with DevOps stuff which I have a bunch of experience for everyone want Ansible when after discovering NixOS&#x2F;Nix it completely removes the need for Ansible giving declarative deterministic infrastructure&#x2F;deployments without fragile line upon line of YAML files.<p>Of course all the functional programming work I&#x27;ve learnt is usable and can be applied everyday in other languages. Functional programming isn&#x27;t new predating all the new shiny popular languages. The problem is having used better languages which treat these principals as first class it isn&#x27;t the same as trying to hack together something in a language never designed to support it.<p>It seems I&#x27;ve now learnt myself out of a job. If I want a job I need to take a step backwards and use tools that now frustrate me and seem clunky &#x2F; broken. It&#x27;s at the point where I&#x27;m starting to look at a career change outside of software to start enjoying work again.')
