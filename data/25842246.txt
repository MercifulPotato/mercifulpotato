This let them keep going at 5-30ish cases a day without things getting out of control and hope it eventually fizzles out, as it has multiple times. It&#x27;s somewhat of a double edged sword though, some restrictions are kept for longer, state borders are closed and there is always the threat of a large outbreak. Lockdowns are harsh but can be short and sharp if their early, as we&#x27;ve seen in other states and across the world.<p>It&#x27;s kind of a moot point now though because the last Christmas outbreak in NSW was controlled with a lockdown of a huge chunk of Sydney along with the contract tracing. Meanwhile the cases that leaked over the border into Victoria were stamped out with effective contract tracing and (probably) our mask mandate.<p>It&#x27;s very situational, but lockdowns have been used as both a first and last line of defense. In the early stages they help the contract tracing and testing get on top of things and in later stages they&#x27;re the only thing that can bring numbers down (before vaccines).<p>The main factors that made a difference in Australia are lockdowns, contact tracing, testing, masks and limiting travel, both internally and externally.')
