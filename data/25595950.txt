First time submitter here, would love to get any thoughts on my first published sideproject. Pixelist is an iOS habit tracker inspired by the simplicity and aesthetics of bullet journaling. It&#x27;ll always be 100% free and login&#x2F;tracking&#x2F;ad-free, but I plan to add a tip jar someday.<p>I released this app a while back and at the time hesitated to Show HN yet another habits app, but with 2020 and New Years on everyone&#x27;s minds I think it&#x27;s relevant. I&#x27;ve had some really positive reception via reviews and emails so far (pixelistapp@gmail.com), so I hope some HN&#x27;ers might enjoy it as well.<p>A couple of things that make Pixelist different than other trackers are:<p>1) It recommends a 3-color system to track habits. It&#x27;s designed to be flexible to your own meanings, like &quot;Walked 10k steps &#x2F; Went to the gym &#x2F; Hiked Yosemite&quot; or &quot;Read 30m, Read 60m, Finished a book&quot;. I like to think of this as &quot;are you just staying busy or are you accomplishing things?&quot;<p>2) Over time, it builds some unique visualizations, like a collection of vertical stripes to show months over time, or nested squares ala Josef Albers. So far I&#x27;ve tried to avoid the common &quot;Longest streak&quot; and line-charts of most apps, because personally I find those boring.<p>Would really appreciate any feedback! Wishing a happy and healthy 2021<p>Screenshots: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;bseBPSz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;bseBPSz</a> Here are some images of my personal data, including years of Activity, Meditation, Guitar (1 hour), and Sideproject (1 hour)')
