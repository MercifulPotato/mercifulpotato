Both BJJ and judo are impossible without constant touch. The only time you&#x27;re not touching someone during practice&#x2F;competition is when you&#x27;re bowing to one another or are doing some solo warmup exercises. I&#x27;ve been doing this since I was 6, so I can safely say that this greatly increases tolerance&#x2F;comfort for being touched by complete strangers.<p>When teaching children or adolescents you sometimes get strange looks from parents, because things can look a bit weird in ground holds.')
