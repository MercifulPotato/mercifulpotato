Item(by='csnover', descendants=None, kids=[24986537], score=None, time=1604451286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24985366, text='I did something similar to this but was turned away from using random bulbs off of Amazon since most of them lied about their product performance (advertising peak wattage of all the LEDs and then not driving them at max power), safety certifications (fake UL and ETL markings), and in several cases I could not even find valid business licenses where the companies claimed to be incorporated. I need light for the darkness of winter but not at the expense of burning down the house.<p>Instead, I ended up buying a string light[0] and a box of 1600lm daylight LED bulbs[1]. Installation sucks, but once the whole thing is up, it’s nice that the light is distributed throughout the room instead of coming from a single point source. It was (at least at the time) cheaper than buying corn lights—and as a bonus, you can swap back the bulbs that come with the string light for party lighting.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.costco.com&#x2F;feit-electric-48&#x27;-led-filament-string-light-set.product.100405061.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.costco.com&#x2F;feit-electric-48&#x27;-led-filament-string...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.costco.com&#x2F;feit-electric-led-100w-replacement-bright-white%2c-12-pack.product.100405758.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.costco.com&#x2F;feit-electric-led-100w-replacement-br...</a>')
