Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=[25837466, 25833857], score=None, time=1611063799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833243, text='While Halmos&#x27; book is lovely, I still prefer the geometric definition of determinant to the algebraic one:  The determinant of a matrix is the signed volume (or area) of the parallellepiped spanned by its columns.  Equivalently, the determinant of a linear map is the volume of the image of a unit cube by that map (or any arbitrary shape of volume one, not necessarily a cube).  All the algebraic properties of the determinant follow easily from the geometric definition (multi-linearity, anti-symmetry, etc).<p>Really, I don&#x27;t see what you like about Halmos definition of the determinant... I have just read it (page 99 of my copy) and he admits that it is a &quot;somewhat roundabout procedure&quot;, just after giving the definition!  There&#x27;s other references that seem much cleaner (e.g. Spivak&#x27;s calculus on manifolds, using exterior algebra).')
