We are simply not capable of making long term commitment and keeping them. Sure theoretically nuclear power is safe, especially in developed countries like the US and Europe.<p>But let&#x27;s pretend we build a super safe nuclear facility somewhere in Europe. In the beginning we will be very vigilant. The depleted ore will be properly stored (or whatever the toxic nuclear byproduct is). Maintenance will be kept to highest standard but what happens in 20 years? During that time frame a lot can change, a country can be bankrupted, and has to cut a budget. What is a fairly rich country today might not be one in 20 years.<p>But let&#x27;s say that doesn&#x27;t happen. We also always try to optimize. Say we fill our storage for depleted ore, and we look for a new one. We figure out that we can outsource it to another country because it is cheaper. This country has the same standards we do, so we happily give it to them. But after a while they can&#x27;t accept anymore so we start looking for other countries to sell our waste product to, and because we have already outsourced it once, we will probably do it again but this time at lower standards.<p>What I am saying is, it is really difficult to predict how we handle a nuclear plant built today, 40-100 years from now, because this is how long the lifetime of a plant and its byproducts are at minimum.<p>Meanwhile wind&#x2F;solar&#x2F;batteries has a much better defined lifetime. After only 10 years we will most likely recycle them. Yes sometimes recycling them creates unnecessary waste because some countries&#x2F;companies&#x2F;people will cut corners but the damage caused by improperly recycled solar and even batteries is so much lower then the damage of what a nuclear power plant can do.<p>So the question is, do we trust all countries that &#x27;can safely operate a nuclear plant today&#x27; to do so in 20-50 years? What about the waste products? Can we be sure that they will always be properly stored? That every country checks their stores for leaks regularly over 100 years? And this doesn&#x27;t even account for developing countries that want -- and possible need nuclear power -- to catch up to developed countries. Can we just deny it to them while we are doing it ourselves?<p>If humanity has proven anything, it&#x27;s that we are not capable of making such decisions of a long period of time reliably.')
