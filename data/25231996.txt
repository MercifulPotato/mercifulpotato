Born in India so standing at the end of never moving line. Basically dont see when I can get 485 or green card.<p>Is there a way for people on H1B to start a company? I don&#x27;t know anyone from India or China who has done this. Reason I am picking India and China because they have the longest wait time. I have been waiting for 12 years and would guess I need to wait another couple of years before I can get anywhere with EAD or citizenship.<p>How do I go about starting a company on H1B?')
