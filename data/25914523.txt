Does it consider that you (or your community) will build a computer from scratch? In that case OK, I don&#x27;t know enough but I guess an 8 bit simple computer makes sense, as long as it&#x27;s something you can build using cables, LEDs and a breadboard.<p>If the idea is that you gather already manufactured parts, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to just use some cheap SOC computers like the Raspberry Pi? They&#x27;re low on power consumption, so powering them wouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue, and it has greater, easier to use, software. \nIt would also allow you to have things like a copy of useful Wikipedia articles, videos, photos, etc.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding the project goal though.')
