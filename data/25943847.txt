Just at random:<p>* The New York Times and other media outlets should stop running ads for obvious scams.  I see Taboolah as hate speech because it will make young people hate old people,  it will make you believe the media is dishonest (they run scam ads),  the government is dishonest (they allow it),  etc.<p>* You shouldn&#x27;t be able to be both the CEO and Chairman of the Board of a company<p>* In China you&#x27;d risk being executed if your company was losing money and paid a dividend.  That&#x27;s a little extreme,  but it&#x27;s in the right direction -- airlines and many companies were hit hard by the 2020 crisis because they were already in debt for dividends they paid.<p>* Right-wing media has normalized hate speech such as:  &quot;Democrats are Athiests&quot;,  &quot;Kamala Harris refused to touch the bible when she are sworn in.&quot;  Often they lie about politicians who actually go to church for the benefit of politicians who are as profane and ungodly as you can imagine.  This hate speech hurts the targeted individuals but spreads mistrust in the media and ultimately undermines religion.  Pastors flacking for Donald Trump causes people to tell pollsters that they are &quot;not religious&quot; -- I know a Christian who used to run a soup kitchen and is about to go to Federal Prison because she protested nuclear weapons -- most people see them as a mindless zombie right-wing horde.  (e.g. people who say they are Christians or say they are Marxist have a hard time telling which lines came from the Communist Manifesto and the Sermon on the Mount.)<p>The answer to &quot;having a bad reputation&quot; is &quot;behave in a way completely inconsistent with the bad reputation all of the time&quot;.  It works wonders if you stick with it.')
