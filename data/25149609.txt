At the time I&#x27;ve watched it for the first time, it has a in-video ad at the tail of the video even though he explicitly said that the video is not monetised (and therefore it might be Google getting the money). Notably, he prepares his videos days or weeks in advance so I&#x27;m confident he indeed turn off monetisation on this.<p>- From time-to-time, I have accessed channels for work purposes. One of them is Fisher Scientific [2], which does have ads occasionally despite the fact that it shouldn&#x27;t have (and obviously they wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to submit YPP).<p>- Similarly, YouTube channels using Google Workspace accounts do serve an ad from time-to-time. Again, it is occasional, but from what my child has experienced, it does happen even with educational accounts (they have since moved to using Google Drive, although it is cumbersome since there are no features such as playlists).<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bjl9CpAirtE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bjl9CpAirtE</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;FisherScientificUK&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;FisherScientificUK&#x2F;</a>')
