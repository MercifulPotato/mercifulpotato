The farm should be upfront about what exactly it does with the cattle once they&#x27;re weaned. If they are butchered on the grounds, they should show how they do that. If they hand them off to someone else, they should probably say a few words about how they are sure the animals are treated no worse than needed on the way to, and during, slaughter.<p>I think that, counter-intuitively, the squeamishness about this part of eating animals (i.e. their killing) is responsible for a large part of people being at least uncomfortable with, if not completely opposed to the very idea (of eating other animals).<p>In any case, we kill animals to eat them and there is nothing good that can come out of trying to obscure this simple fact.<p>Btw, I think that &quot;ethical dairy&quot; is a silly name. I was just curious about the idea of leaving the calves with their mothers and milking the mothers only once a day etc.')
