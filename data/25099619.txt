SQL is useful but it&#x27;s far from the most important tool. It&#x27;s certainly unlikely to land you a job. It definitely won&#x27;t solve 97% of problems. You either have a very skewed perspective of what data science is or you spend a lot of time on linkedin&#x2F;medium where bad advice like this is parroted a lot.<p>Think about this - there are a bunch of other software developers who know SQL very well. If your advice was true, then every backend developer would be able to immediately land a data science job and do great at it without having to learn a bunch of math, ML-specific stuff and a whole other tech stack.')
