Is the Pod encrypted while it is stored on a provider’s system?<p>&gt; It depends on the Pod Provider. Pod providers can be Solid compliant without encrypting the data stored on the Pod providers’ system. If this encryption is important to you, use a Pod provider that does encrypt you data. The Solid standard describes rules for controlling access to the data, but encryption is dependant on the storage system, which is controlled by the Pod Provider.<p>&gt; Is my data safe when I use a Solid application?<p>&gt; It depends on the app. Your data is always encrypted in transit from Pod to app and vice versa. You should always be conscious about which apps you are using the terms of those apps. Solid allows you to selectively share data with specific applications.<p>Solid is just a new standard for data reuse. Who knows, maybe solid v2 will be E2EE.<p>In the mean time, you can choose a pod provider that fits <i>your</i> crypto needs.')
