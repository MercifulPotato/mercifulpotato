That&#x27;s why their predictions are fairly conservative. They gave Florida a 1&#x2F;3 chance for Trump and 1&#x2F;10 for the presidency. Both those numbers make sense.<p>Now you can argue that there&#x27;s little utility if the error bars are so big, and you may have a point. The bigger issue here is that modern elections have been extremely close, and unfortunately we cannot get polling accurate enough.')
