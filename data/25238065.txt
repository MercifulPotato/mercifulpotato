For example the paint in colored plastics. Which is why all those colorful &quot;upcycled&quot; food bowls from plastic fantastic kind of worry me.<p>To be clear: I don&#x27;t <i>know</i> if the paint in plastic is dangerous, the problem is that I also <i>don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re not</i>. It feels like the kind of area where even without bad intentions&#x2F;incentives, the people who made the plastics or who set up the regulations for them might have assumed there is no real risk, because nobody planned for this type of plastic recycling.')
