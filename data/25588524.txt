(Witness the two year lull when Kenton went sandstorming), an awkward API and limited language support.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think there is a perfect protocol because different people want different things whether self describing, easy&#x2F;optimised memory management, zero copy, partial decode. The list goes on....<p>At a pinch, flatbuffers with flexbuffer evolution would be close to <i>my</i> goals but I&#x27;d much prefer having a meta description of messages and perhaps access ,authentication, transport security and use that (e.g. an OpenAPI v3.1 spec) to generate an implementation whether in protobuf, msgpack, JSON, ASN1 etc. whichever is suitable for a use case and using an appropriate transport whether quic, TCP, UDP.<p>Some of the high performance work I&#x27;ve seen uses ASN.1 on a very large virtual server at 100Gb line rates because the messages lend themselves to parallel decode.<p>I think Mike Acton had it right by suggesting things are tailored to the data needs and not overgeneralised.')
