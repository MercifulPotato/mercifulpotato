I&#x27;m just gonna interpret that as a 64 address padded left with zeroes.&quot; Now router firmware, network stacks, kernel modules -- It&#x27;s not a full rewrite, just an extension. Now all the bugfixes and workarounds we&#x27;ve written over 50 years still apply. If it were made truly backwards compatible, you&#x27;d <i>instantly</i> have tons of adoption because anyone that runs IPv4 is supported and works without any changes. That&#x27;s way more adoption than IPv6. You <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> instantly have to fix all the software again. It would work with old software. This is why hacks like UTF-8 exists. Old systems that understand only ASCII still work fine and communicate well with the systems that deal in UTF-8.')
