Hadn&#x27;t played chess for decades. After watching this show, my gf wanted to learn and it renewed my interest in the game. Not sure I want to go down this rabbit hole though...<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a shame that the advent of the internet has simultaneously increased your chances of finding someone to play with remotely<p>It works very well. I played a few games on lichess (recommended in the comments of another HN thread). I could find opponents who played at my level in a matter of a seconds.<p>There are also tons of youtubers who do a good job explaining strategies and such. It seems Chess never goes out of fashion, still a cool game!<p>It&#x27;s amazing the amount of resource you can find nowadays. Back in the day, it was extremely limited. I remember I had a couple of books from my grandfather, plus a few friends I was playing with, and &quot;chess master&quot; on Amiga and that was it.')
