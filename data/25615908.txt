UV mapping is the task of unwrapping a 3D model to a flat surface in order to put textures on it. Ive been at it for about 3 years, and last year I made 7 figures. I do sell directly to 3D artists. You probably know some VFX companies and game companies that have licensed my tool.<p>I make a good amount from people coming to the web site, but the majority is made licensing the technology to various companies. The online sales are mostly there to spread the word, and gather user feedback.<p>UV mapping is a very difficult problem mostly because artist have very specific ideas of what constitutes good UV mapping and it doesn&#x27;t conform to any simple heuristics. Its about a megabyte of C code without any dependencies, and that makes very attractive to licensees.')
