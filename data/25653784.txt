That&#x27;s how I got started. It&#x27;s good that the goal is so unreachable at the start. There&#x27;s an awful lot to learn and you need to boostrap yourself, somehow, into doing something remotely productive.<p>I never finished my mod, but I spent 2 years learning C++, Photoshop, 3DS Max, Worldcraft, and all manner of other tools on the way. It was great exposure and it never felt tedious because my goal wasn&#x27;t learning how to program, it was learning how to make a homing missile, or a texture for my fort. :)<p>I wasn&#x27;t really interested, at the time, in learning how to write a simple bank that could process transactions, or a task list.')
