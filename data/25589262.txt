Eg. being near a virus lab makes it more likely it&#x27;s a lab escape, being 1000km away from the main zoonotic reservoirs (bat populations) in China make it less likely it&#x27;s of zoonotic origin. This is not to say it&#x27;s impossible as researchers do travel 1000km from Wuhan to get samples from bats. I&#x27;ll not comment on the probabilities they assigned to each hypothesis (they may very well be discounting the likelihood of zoonotic origins too heavily) but that is the approach they took.')
