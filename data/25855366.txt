The pilot&#x27;s sign said &quot;WHERE AM I?&quot; in large letters.<p>People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft, drew a large sign and held it in a building window.<p>Their sign read: &quot;YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.&quot;<p>The pilot smiled, waved, looked at her map, determined the course to steer to SEATAC airport, and landed safely.<p>After they were on the ground, one of the passengers asked the pilot how the &quot;YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER&quot; sign helped determine their position.<p>The pilot responded &quot;I knew that had to be the Microsoft building because, the response they gave me was technically correct, but completely useless.&quot;')
