The ads on the local evening newscast on your network affiliate<p>2. The ads from Taboola that appear on the bottom of every page<p>---<p>(1) is hate speech that causes TV viewers to hate their fellow viewers,  politicians,  institutions,  etc.<p>A long time ago there was the story that the media invites people to fantasize that they are in a higher class than themselves and you still see that in magazines like Vouge and the Economist (e.g. all those ads for $15,000 first-class seats)<p>TV is not like that today.  You&#x27;d imagine that the viewer doesn&#x27;t have any money of their own,  as all of the ads are about how to spend either a government benefit or health insurance,  or how you can get a big payday if you get hit by a car and call William Matar.  (You do see ads for car dealers,  but if nobody bought a car than nobody would git hit by a car and the ambulance chasers would be out of business.)<p>In the lead-up to November the air is full of political ads that are entirely hate speech.<p>I remember seeing an ad in 2010 that I thought was a scam and it turned out in 2018 it really was a scam.  But for 8 years everyone was asleep at the switch and let it happen -- a conspicuous display of incompetence that undermines people&#x27;s trust in the media, government,  themselves,  human nature,  etc.<p>As for (2) I still see articles to the effect that &quot;Isrealis working for Taboola learned to kill Palestinians with NVIDIA GPUs and now they have a supercomputer cluster that serves personalized ads.&quot;<p>Look at Taboola ads,  those crap ads on the bottom of most news web sites and you see the old people with bad skin,  scam supplements,  car insurance in some town you&#x27;re not from (a running gag for years),  and lately ads for burial vs cremation.<p>If you are harassed with this for years you are going to think that 80% of your fellow Americans are stupid old people who have no ability to think critically,  vote for Trump,  etc.<p>Thus it promotes hate and is &quot;hate speech&quot;.<p>So long as people are in pervasive environment of this kind of communication they&#x27;re going to naturally hate,  fear and mistrust anybody different from them.')
