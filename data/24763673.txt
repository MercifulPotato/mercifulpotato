According to most experts, we&#x27;re looking at the end of 2021 for the whole thing to play itself out. Take a look at the steep incline the curves have taken on in the countries which previously were &quot;better&quot; than the US and Sweden. In the US deaths are declining (in spite of slight rise in cases), in Sweden hardly anyone is dying at all. Take a look at countries that were &quot;worse&quot; too - Italy for example. Exponential growth in cases. Deaths will lag, as they usually do.<p>My prediction is that unless a miracle happens and an amazing vaccine (or a therapeutic) is developed, Swedish strategy will &quot;win&quot; this one. The curves aren&#x27;t looking good at all for other European countries heading into winter, and their economies are decimated, so they can&#x27;t tolerate full shutdown anymore.<p>It&#x27;s a virus. It&#x27;s endemic. _Everyone_ will get it eventually, if not now, then a month or two from now. There&#x27;s really no way around this simple fact.')
