Liberal media? Didn&#x27;t they publish that embarrassingly fake accusation against Brett Kavanaugh that he gang-raped Julie Swetnick? Didn&#x27;t they claim mutliple times to find &quot;decisive proof&quot; that Trump (himself) colluded with Russians, only to be humiliated again by Mueller report?<p>It seems that the media&#x27;s standard for &quot;verification of authenticity&quot; depends a lot on who, or what party is getting accused.')
