It may be a pain, but the tinkering capability is still there.\nIf it wasn&#x27;t possible to tinker with it, less people would buy that laptop.<p>Having closed hardware is a problem and it definitely doesn&#x27;t make me feel safe. We may all be full of NSA backdoors, but to be honest I don&#x27;t care much about it and I assume a large part of the tech knowledgeable feel the same way.\nI suspect this is why Open Hardware is not more prevalent in the market: not enough interest.<p>I don&#x27;t care about computer companies making more user friendly devices; we can find a way to hack whatever or just start buying laptop parts from China and make our own laptops.\nWhat worries me is if the government will decide to ban cryptography or introduce regulations that force me to change how I tinker with my computer.')
