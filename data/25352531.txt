Item(by='wittyreference', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607467470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352293, text='1) For a PCP that does ear cleanings, you could have done that for peanuts. I used to know an FM guy who would do it regularly for patients (maybe a touch too regularly).<p>2) Heh, it&#x27;s actually a standard board exam question about &quot;homeless guy comes in with scratching in one ear.&quot; The official answer is that you &#x2F;don&#x27;t&#x2F; scope first, because if it&#x27;s a roach, the sudden light can make them scrabble deeper. Which is actually funny, since different bugs respond differently - there have been case reports where people have reported repeated success with taking the patient to a darkened room, opening the ear as much as possible, and having a light pointed near the outside of the ear - luring the bug to crawl out on its own.<p>Actually, on second thought, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a &quot;standard&quot; board question. Rather, it was something I studied for boards once upon a time. I&#x27;m not in EM&#x2F;FM, so it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve ever had come up again.')
