Reading the Twitter threat, it reads like she made demands in a way visible to a large number of employees (something about authorship on a paper, to skim the Twitter thread) and perhaps attacked Google while being a manager there (the emphasis on talking to non-management employees sounds like this). I assume the email will leak, this being Google we are talking about.')
