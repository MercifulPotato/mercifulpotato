People who have so little understanding of the mechanics behind it all that they think it&#x27;s impossible we&#x27;ve put anything in Earth orbit - how could ANYONE understand that?<p>In one case though I had someone say that I wasn&#x27;t hitting satellites, I was hitting a solar-powered high altitude plane. When I pointed out that it would have to be going at 23 times the speed of sound at sea level and flying at 120,000 km, they said of course: technology is amazing. While in the same conversation claiming that satellites were impossible. At that point I stopped believing they even had basic common sense.')
