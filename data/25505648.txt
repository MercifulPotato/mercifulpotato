I have a 25&quot; UltraSharp from them and it has a &quot;fun&quot; bug where it advertises to the system that it refreshes at 59.95hz but in fact refreshes at exactly 60hz, which leads to the monitor(!!!) Freezing for a frame every 20 seconds or so, it&#x27;s absolutely infuriating in games and movies, and I only found out how to fix it by modifying windows drivers and forcing it to refresh at solid 60hz despite what the monitor advertises. But of course you can&#x27;t do that with something like a PS4 connected to it. Would never buy another dell, thanks.')
