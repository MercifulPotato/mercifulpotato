I don&#x27;t think if Google provided an alternative for 1 function it would be in this lawsuit. Your analogy is just a tiny portion of the alternative I already portrayed: they copied the entire structure of the framework. Copy 1 door handle, 1 steering wheel, 1 precise dashboard design, 1 glove compartment, etc. and I feel your analogy would result in a lawsuit just the same?<p>(For reference none of this is meant to reflect my position on what the law actually is, or should be. I&#x27;m just considering analogies here.)')
