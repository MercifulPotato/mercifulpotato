In general I understand that Google would prevent review bombing, since it can very easily be abused by social media mobs or competitors. The point of reviews is to give a genuine idea of how people on average like a given app. Reviem bombing completely distorts that, whether it be 1-star or 5-star reviews.<p>But here it&#x27;s a pretty huge app, and the bombing is motivated by a real issue the users are having, so I think I agree with you that it was not necessarily the right decision.<p>As always the real problem is that tech giants are opaque in their behaviour. If we had clear guidelines for what constitutes &quot;review bombing&quot; there wouldn&#x27;t really be an issue I think.')
