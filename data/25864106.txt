The lawsuit exists as they claim.  That wouldn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re lying, it would only mean they have a different idea of what constitutes news worthiness than you.  That wouldn&#x27;t make it disinformation.  Virtually every sentence in the article contains some variation of <i>&quot;the suit alleges.&quot;</i>  That the suit alleges these things <i>does</i> seem to be hard fact.  I see no disinformation here.')
