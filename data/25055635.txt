Item(by='visarga', descendants=None, kids=[25055848], score=None, time=1605070890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048729, text='&gt; The whole system looks reasonable except for how easy it can be for poll workers to know what you voted for.<p>I was struck when the article said they were asking party affiliation before voting.<p>&gt;&gt; The voter approaches their table, and gives their name and party affiliation. The party affiliation is used as a signal that something fishy might be going on if the ratio of R to D is very different from the votes recorded.<p>Wtf? You can vote in secret but you gotta tell us who you voted with?')
