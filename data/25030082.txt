To be effective for disease particle controls, it needs to come from outside, otherwise you&#x27;d just be sucking dirty air from the rest of the building into the classroom - or even worse: backdrafting CO2 and CO from any combustion appliances within the building envelope.<p>You can achieve a clean air supply by opening another window in the classroom, but then you also let hot or cold air into the classroom (depending on the season), making the heating&#x2F;cooling systems work even harder.<p>The answer to this is to run the exhaust&#x2F;intake air channels through a heat recovery ventilator (HRV), which transfers energy from the hotter to colder airstream, while also introducing fresh air back to the space.')
