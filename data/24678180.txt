EU communication within country members is almost non-existent. People in France have often zero idea what is being done in Brussels, don&#x27;t know that their neighborhood new bike lanes and kindergarten have been financed by European funds.<p>You regularly see people complaining in national media about EU lack of support for their own country, even when they just received a major financial support.
