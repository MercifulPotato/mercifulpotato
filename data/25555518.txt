Increases in money supply don&#x27;t increase prices if output rises, only if more money chases the same amounts of goods.<p>But that&#x27;s the problem: housing isn&#x27;t like most goods (eg. TVs) that can be produced in a factory in quantities so massive that everyone can have one. The same can&#x27;t be said of housing, or more specifically land eg. there&#x27;s only so many space for a semi-detached house within 30 minutes driving distance of the bay area.<p>&gt; Which again, is not happening as born out by data.<p>Source?')
