While it hasn&#x27;t been completely issue free for me, it&#x27;s a great project making a ton of progress and the community is very helpful and responsive.<p>I found myself butting heads with the limitations of the API quite a bit, but since it has a wonderful RPC feature, you can always drop a custom endpoint to do what you need to do without completely ejecting.<p>You can also surface other systems with PostgREST, using foreign data wrappers.  This is great because you can use Postgres&#x27;s rock solid role system to manage access to them.  FDWs are surprisingly easy to write using Multicorn, and you can get pretty crazy with them if you&#x27;re fronting a read replica (which you should be doing anyway once past the proof of concept stage).')
