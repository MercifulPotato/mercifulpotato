I learned Logo and Basic. I coded, but very casually and just for fun.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until many years later in college that I randomly stumbled upon a Visual Basic book my Dad had. I thought it was so cool you could drag a button onto a form, then double click the button to add an event handler. Been coding ever since, that was about 25 years ago.<p>As for Linux: I bought an internal dial up modem for my PC. The manual that came with it had a section on how to install it on Linux. It was pages of bash commands, compiling the driver, etc. I was fascinated. How could installing a modem be this difficult? Rather than being repulsed, it got me curious what this crazy Linux thing was.')
