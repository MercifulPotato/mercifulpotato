They also made a major change to their authentication mechanism for these free developer accounts last year, which (to avoid a lot of reverse engineering of highly obfuscated--and notably &quot;well&quot; obfuscated--Apple code) required a pretty obtuse workaround from AltStore on macOS where it injects into Mail.app as a plug-in... I am shocked Apple hasn&#x27;t figured out some way to restrict this yet (it could be that it didn&#x27;t occur to them there is still work to be done upping the ante here?).')
