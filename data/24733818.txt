This is coming from different culture and priorities. Lack of unions isn&#x27;t why you don&#x27;t have universal healthcare in the US. It&#x27;s because the country&#x27;s general culture and ideology works against both unions and social welfare. You don&#x27;t need unions to organize and demand things of the government. If people don&#x27;t want to vote for social policies, unions won&#x27;t make them want different things.')
