Canada&#x27;s labour laws are very similar to US, only slightly better. It&#x27;s not better than or even close to being as good as Europe.<p>This difference is coming from different culture and priorities. Lack of unions isn&#x27;t why you don&#x27;t have universal healthcare in the US and other such things. It&#x27;s because the country&#x27;s general culture and ideology works against both unions and social welfare.<p>You don&#x27;t need unions to organize and demand things of the government. If people don&#x27;t want to vote for social policies, unions won&#x27;t make them want different things.')
