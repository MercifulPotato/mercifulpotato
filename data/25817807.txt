Item(by='derekp7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610940944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817698, text='Believe it or not, the &quot;boring titles&quot; often times get better attention.  I found that out a couple weeks ago, when I posted my open source project using just the title of the website and it not only made it to the front page, but stayed there for several hours.  Whereas I tried for the last several years with more descriptive titles, and it would get at most 1 - 3 upvotes before disappearing from the new submissions queue.')
