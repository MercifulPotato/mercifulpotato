Far more people are updated to the latest iOS version, which makes a huge difference. Apple invests tons of money into secure biometrics, privacy initiatives, and lots more.<p>At the same time, Android might still have fewer vulnerabilities in the latest versions. It&#x27;s possible that Android&#x27;s security technology or coding practices result in fewer security bugs. I don&#x27;t think that Android has any attack surface equivalent to iMessage (which is written in Objective-C and uses some fairly low-level techniques, if I remember correctly).<p>A lot fewer people use the latest version of Android, though, so most of that effort goes to waste.')
