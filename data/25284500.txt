That would make the mental equation much less abstract and immediate, further push people towards the behaviors you mention. But on those specifics:<p>1) Unfortunately most workplaces don&#x27;t have a place to charge your car. That should change<p>2) Laundry is problematic for households with 2 adults &amp; a few kids. Multiple loads can&#x27;t be automated that way, so not running laundry after 5:00 pm isn&#x27;t an option many days.<p>3) You can can have a high-efficiency on-demand hot water heater with an external tank to hold X amount of hot water for use throughout the day. Heating your home is more problematic: the hot water loses about 5-10 degrees per cycle through the house &amp; back to the boiler, so you&#x27;d still need to run the unit on cold nights.<p>4) Fridge&#x2F;Freezer: I like the idea, but it could be a food safety risk... I&#x27;d rather see units designed with that particular use case &amp; required insulation in mind to ensure food was always kept at safe temperatures, even if it meant paying the .30 for short spurts over night.<p>5) AC: I wish everyone would do this sort of thing already with thermostat timers. If you have a small apartment with window units, timers at outlets should automatically shutoff living&#x2F;dining units. Bedroom should have a high temp (though comfortable enough to sleep through) set for the cutoff since you&#x27;re sleeping anyway. If your home needs more than 3 window units, it&#x27;s generally more energy efficient to get central air (though upfront costs are high) and you can get multi-zones to only cool the areas needed, further improving efficiency.<p>Basically, I think a lot of the things we&#x27;d do to deal with variable pricing could already be done to reduce usage.')
