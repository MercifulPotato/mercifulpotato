Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=[25111466, 25107829], score=None, time=1605495527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106837, text='Koch is an honest libertarian, so his Deregulate All The Things efforts are accompanied by things like this.<p>But.<p>If you look at where he&#x27;s been putting his money into supporting candidates, they are overwhelmingly Republicans that align with the former to the exclusion of nearly everything else.<p>It would have been very VERY easy for Koch to have got bipartisan support for serious criminal justice reform if he had wanted to, but that would have used up political capital (Republicans generally prefer to be the &#x27;tough on crime&#x27; candidate) he otherwise used to support his economic interests instead.<p>That&#x27;s the main problem I have with libertarians: They lend their wholehearted and deep pocketed support to Republicans on business issues and opposing &#x27;big government&#x27;, but fail to call them out on social issues (you know, the whole &#x27;equality before the law&#x27; thing), and practically never lend equivalent support to Democrats where they would be aligned, just lip-service. It&#x27;s hypocritical.<p>Having to date focused largely on feathering his nest, he now wants to put a bit of &#x27;compassionate conservatism&#x27; shine on his image and legacy. I&#x27;m not inclined to let him gloss over the awful things he&#x27;s accomplished.')
