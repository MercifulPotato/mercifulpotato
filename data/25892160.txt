As I understand it, one of the ways the EU helped Eastern European truckers outcompete local ones is that they could use their own countries&#x27; HGV licenses to do deliveries that were entirely within the UK and didn&#x27;t have to go to the hassle and expense of getting a UK one. (Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there was something of a race to the bottom in licensing too.)')
