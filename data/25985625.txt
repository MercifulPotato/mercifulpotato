What do you want to work on, with who, and why? Don&#x27;t give up the pay and benefits until you can answer that, and make sure that you budget for N months&#x2F;years out of work. Idealism doesn&#x27;t always pay well.<p>IMHO, don&#x27;t sweat the IP stuff to much, until you start spending a lot of off-hours time on a serious project (website, incorporation, etc). If you don&#x27;t have a specific business plan, don&#x27;t sweat it.<p>That might be an unpopular opinion, because it probably would leave you vulnerable in most at-will employment contracts, but as long as you don&#x27;t take anything with you when you leave, big companies are unlikely to aggressively enforce anything.<p>And this should go without saying, but leave on good terms. Do right by the people who you work with and don&#x27;t leave them holding any bags. It&#x27;s the right thing to do, and you might want their recommendations if things go belly-up. Plus, part of the reason why the company is unlikely to go after you on technicalities is that they want to hire creative people like you in the future.')
