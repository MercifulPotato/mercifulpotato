Some specific things. For instance, I don&#x27;t fear a union of Appalachian postal workers. If you go help them unionize, you won&#x27;t find me standing in the way. If you want to unionize Colorado glass workers, I will cheer you on from here. If the proletariat in the steel mills of Pittsburgh wish to unite, I wish them well.<p>But tech is dominated by rampant xenophobia from the have-nots. They fear the Chinese, the Indians, the god-knows-who-else. This much is clear. While they are weak and disunited, their force is dissipated in online froth. If they are united, they can probably move mountains.<p>So, while the status quo is undesirable to me, I&#x27;m not all that keen on your providing a platform for xenophobes to unite. Preventing this egg from hatching is the optimal play.<p>Alternatively, you could adopt a measure of good faith: A founding immutable tenet of all these organizations can be that they will always act to increase the number of legal immigrants that can arrive in America.
