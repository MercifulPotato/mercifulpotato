Demand for energy is fluctuating hugely, and nuclear power cannot be freely switched on and off. This is also the case for large coal plants. So, with using renewable energy, grids need to become more agile, and a somewhat larger amount of freely controllable power sources is needed. Another strategy is to average out fluctuations over large areas.')
