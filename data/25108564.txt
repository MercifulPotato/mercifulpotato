I looked for it again but the current situation is muddying the search results. But I can try to remember. What I remember is that it was a pretty messy process and they were marking ballots (I think with stickers to keep the ballots immutable). But yeah, generally it is chaotic. But clearly it was done because Australia didn&#x27;t have computers in the early 1900&#x27;s. At least to the best of my knowledge.<p>As for part more information Clay (who might be in this thread somewhere?) put out a pretty good video on voting methods and towards the end he shows a sample of an Oakland Mayoral result that used IRV[0] (around 15:20). It isn&#x27;t too useful in isolation but I do encourage watching the whole thing because it is from someone who is a HN member and an expert on voting.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HyBm_Hcu4DI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HyBm_Hcu4DI</a>')
