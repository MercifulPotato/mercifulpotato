Define it.</i><p>You don&#x27;t need to know the definition of a &quot;good&quot; joint to make a strong table. You just need to know how to make one.<p><i>&gt; Not knowing how every algorithm works doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t discuss its impacts, effects, if it&#x27;s ethical or not. </i><p>Do you work with professional philosophers regularly?<p>I recently had a half-hour conversation with a respected tenured philosopher who had strong opinions about ML but literally did not understand what a computer is.<p>He consistently confused the words &quot;logarithm&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot;.<p>He regularly humanized machines as if they are sentient AIs. This had practical effects; he drew all sorts of wild conclusions about how you might &quot;fix&quot; a &quot;biased AI&quot; that would be impossible to implement.<p>He did not understand what the word &quot;data&quot; means. E.g., we got into a discussion about whether a picture of a human face is &quot;data&quot;. And not in some profound way. In the way that made it clear he doesn&#x27;t understand how modern facial recognition algorithms are built&#x2F;designed. In a way that was  simply not a useful point for conversation.<p>In short, <i>he was doing bad philosophy because he didn&#x27;t have enough technical background to understand which philosophical questions were amusingly nonsensical and which were actually interesting&#x2F;difficult. Or even the basic vocabulary to not sound like a fool.</i><p>We eventually had a good conversation, because he was smart and willing to learn. But without a STEM expert in the loop, his opinions were worse than useless because they implied solutions that any would elicit bemusement from anyone trying to actually implement a better system -- or even anyone trying to decide what is&#x2F;isn&#x27;t ethical to build!<p><i>&gt; In your post it seems more that you are arguing against philosophy - not for &quot;philosophers needing stem professionals.</i><p>Hm. I stated: <i>&quot;philosophers need scientists&#x2F;engineers&#x2F;practitioners more than the other way around. Asking and attempting to answer big questions about the world requires, first, understanding the world. And today, understanding the world requires immense technical expertise&quot;</i><p>If I were &quot;arguing against philosophy&quot; [1], then why would I invest time in working with philosophers?!  Good philosophy is needed now more than ever.<p>What is useless -- and not just useless, but even harmful -- is the sort of terrible philosophy that&#x27;s often done by people who don&#x27;t take the time to understand the thing they are opining about.<p>[1] &quot;Arguing against philosophy&quot;, I think, is a bit of an oxy moron anyways. Wouldn&#x27;t any argument against philosophy be a work of philosophy?')
