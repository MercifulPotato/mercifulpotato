Consider also that some of the training soldiers receive today is meant to overcome the natural tendency of soldiers to deliberately miss when shooting at the enemy.  Consider also that the mindset of a veteran who seeks out a job with the police is not necessarily representative of the typical veteran mindset.  It&#x27;s a subset of veterans, those who wish to work with guns and have authority over others.')
