If you don’t let a market of buyers and sellers determine the price of something you can’t discover the supply and demand curves nor the price floor, etc.<p>If the government comes out and just dictates that the price for gas is capped at $2&#x2F;gal, you just end up with a bunch of shortages, rations, and lost potential oil industries because a ton of market information has bene destroyed. That is entirely independent of censorship.')
