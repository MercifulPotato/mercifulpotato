These mini-laptops are a little too big to pocket comfortably, and a little too small to operate comfortably.<p>... The Gibsonian cyberdeck of the Sprawl books had HMDs and gloves or straight up neural interfaces because it was obvious by the mid 90s that the problem was the human interface.<p>I want to see some innovation on that front.  HMDs (both immersive and non-intrusive) that are comfortable for text.  Software that works with e-ink displays (or even just wide-spread support for pgup&#x2F;pgdn events to paginate and scroll without a bunch of unnecessary refreshes - lookin&#x27; at you Android).  Key-gloves or Chorders you can use clipped to a pants pocket or wrapped around the back&#x2F;edges of a handheld device.  Hell, just going back to decent thumb-able keyboards integrated so you can hold and use them.  These aren&#x27;t new ideas, just once that need to be refined into something serviceable.<p>Get away from the fondleslab appliance that uses half of its expensive, power-hungry touchscreen to present an awkward gimped keyboard that only works as well as its prediction estimates and re-flows your content as it pops in and out paradigm, and improve on the &quot;srs bsns computer&quot; for the era of miniaturization.')
