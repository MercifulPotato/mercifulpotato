My very mother, my uncles, and more. Whether or not it is &quot;widely held&quot; has little-to-no bearing on the seriousness I take it.<p>Since my mother believes in it, I will take the alternative fact seriously.<p>&gt; What disinformation? The information you don&#x27;t like, or the information I don&#x27;t like?<p>Disinformation like: Obama is a Muslim (or Obama was born in Kenya). Surely you can agree with me that such a fact running across political discussions is unhelpful.<p>&gt; but can&#x27;t seem to see that big-tech&#x27;s censorship is pursuant to their own political aspirations is alarming<p>I&#x27;m prioritizing issues. I see misinformation &#x2F; alternative facts to be a bigger problem than big-tech&#x27;s censorship. As such, I&#x27;ll stand in support of big-tech&#x27;s moves here, if it helps the misinformation problem.')
