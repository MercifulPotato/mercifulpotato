But one thing most reviews omit to mention is that it has a fab process advantage compared to the competitors, especially against Intel. And going from TSMC 7nm (which is the latest line of AMD CPUs are using) to 5nm can bring a few tens of percentage points in power consumption and&#x2F;or performance improvement.<p>This of course doesn&#x27;t take anything away from the design, as clearly Apple has had a hefty lead against other smartphone SoC designers in the smartphone space for years.')
