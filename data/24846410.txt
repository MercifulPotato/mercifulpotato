That&#x27;s the OS package manager&#x27;s job. The fact that the OS is written in C&#x2F;C++ is an implementation detail, it shouldn&#x27;t leak out. The package manager is also not portable, the commands are not the same, the available libraries are limited and frequently incompatible with each other.<p>Your 3, 4, 5 are all manual steps, if you notice. I don&#x27;t see any mention of a package manager in there :-)')
