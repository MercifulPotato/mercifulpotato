This app works like a charm.<p>I remember attempting to move over from Spotify to Apple Music in 2017. Used some other apps at that time. Didn’t work so well. So I gave up and used Spotify for a few years. And then switched afresh to Apple Music in 2019.<p>Today, though, I found freeyourmusic and I was super impressed by their pricing.<p>Figured I’d give it a shot and I am convinced this is the best $10 I have ever spent!')
