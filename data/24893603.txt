I have this thing were I will &quot;fiddle&quot; a pencil between my fingers and sometimes use said pencil to scratch my ankles. Once I saw the video I was HORRIFIED. Every now and again I go for an &quot;ankle scratch&quot; my shoulder would dip down and there will be a verifiable &quot;up and down motion&quot; of my arm ! Basically it looked like I was &quot;jerking&quot; off ! :S<p>Now why the &quot;Ukraine&#x2F;Odessa&quot; supplier part was import was because the &quot;sales rep&quot; was no mere &quot;boring-pocket-pencil-procter-looking-dev&quot; - it was a beautiful East-European woman !<p>TL;DR: Sit still in meetings even virtual ones !')
