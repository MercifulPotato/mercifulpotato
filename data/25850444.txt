Go see what people on conservative YouTube channels or &#x2F;r&#x2F;conservative or 4chan’s &#x2F;pol&#x2F; have to say about us. How am I supposed to engage with people (including some members of my own family) who refuse to treat me with basic respect? How am I supposed to have a civil conversation with people who call me a disgusting, mentally ill tranny faggot to my face?<p>This “both sides” talking point is naive, intellectually lazy bullshit peddled by people who have no interest in hearing the struggles of people who have to suffer this abuse. I’ve been emotionally and physically bullied my whole life by these people. I’m sick of it. Leave me the fuck alone.')
