The report was written in 2015, but the data was already out of date. I mention that because from 2007 to 2019 (figures from 2020 aren&#x27;t available yet), China&#x27;s per capita emissions increased by 55% while those of the West have declined. China&#x27;s per capita emissions have risen from 5.25 tCO2&#x2F;capita in 2007 to 8.12t in 2019 while the UK&#x27;s have dropped to now just 5.45tCO2.<p>On the other hand, your point about solar vs coal is wrong. It takes less time now to build a solar power plant than a coal power plant. Especially for developing countries that don&#x27;t already have substantial port and&#x2F;or rail infrastructure. And this applies somewhat to natural gas, too. It&#x27;s diesel that they tend to run for this reason. Solar, and now solar + storage, can compete just fine with diesel (and solar + storage + diesel is a pretty resilient combination that also can be built out super fast, is very cheap to build and operate, and also happens to get you to like 80-90% carbonfree... so there&#x27;s decent hope out there).')
