It&#x27;s meant to run on Xenons which is going too far for a home server. You have the slow Go GC then you add on top of it a bunch of PHP and Ruby apps like Nextcloud, sprinkle a bit of unnecessary virtualization, and you&#x27;ve got a really slow machine that burns through more money on your electric bill than an equivalent EC2 would cost.<p>Since everything I use at home is Linux, they&#x27;re all &quot;servers&quot; already. They&#x27;re all on a Wireguard network and share NFS mounts that I can access anywhere. No PHP, No Letsencrypt certificates, No Docker, No Kubernetes, No wasting electricity, No fiddling, No &quot;git commiting every edit&quot;. My setup works just as well in a house with a static IP from an ISP as it could in a van with an antenna receiving 4G data.')
