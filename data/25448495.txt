How is that benefitting game developers and gaming culture? Just compare a screenshot of VR Chat here (1) to Facebook Horizon here (2), it tells you everything you need to know about why the kind of people who work at giant companies are awful at making games. It&#x27;s so fucking sterile dude, and it&#x27;s sterile on purpose.<p>People have said this for eons about Disney, but it&#x27;s not comparable. By the way, Disney also totally blundered Disney Interactive, shutting down under the CEO Bob Iger who was known as the &quot;tech&quot; CEO of Disney.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miro.medium.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;3840&#x2F;1*I5c-QMDHVPeyC35pM1V4Ng.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miro.medium.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;3840&#x2F;1*I5c-QMDHVPeyC35pM1V4Ng.pn...</a><p>(2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cnet1.cbsistatic.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;9kGJANvUNFtxp5mGEgMIDI95DnA=&#x2F;1200x675&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;27&#x2F;4bce2f4b-8d1f-4335-859c-5bd0a649728a&#x2F;friends.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cnet1.cbsistatic.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;9kGJANvUNFtxp5mGEgMIDI95DnA...</a>')
