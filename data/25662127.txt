For example, a typical architecture for American public schools creates many entirely windowless classrooms.<p>- A significant majority of American restaurants, in my experience, only have indoor seating, except for maybe a small number of tables outside. This is because sidewalks are narrow, and many restaurants are located in strip malls with shared parking lots. The strip mall is probably the most common form of American retail development. While burger chains like McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King will typically occupy free-standing buildings in the middle of a parking lot, they also rarely have any outdoor seating, probably because of the hazard presented by cars at the drive-thru line.<p>- In my experience, public transit in many American cities is insignificant. In the cities where public transit is a lifeline (such as the New York City subway, the DC metro, and the California Caltrain), ridership is high year-round and you also don&#x27;t have much freedom to open windows. (And in a subway tunnel, why would you?)')
