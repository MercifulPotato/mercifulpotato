But if Austalian mail providers joined the fray, the same excuse would apply to them as well. At what point does it become &quot;genuine&quot; censorship on your scale? Even in China, there are ways to get past the firewall, so if the ability to pass information <i>somehow</i> is sufficient to have freedom of speech, then China has that.<p>The Russian example doesn&#x27;t work out the way you think it does, though. Yes, it&#x27;s by definition democratic, and it&#x27;s also oppressive - but saying that the propaganda that led to its popularity should be censored to prevent such laws amounts to saying that democracy is a sham, because people should only be allowed (by whom?) to hold &quot;safe&quot; opinions. If that argument were made <i>openly</i> - that we should abandon democracy in favor of rule by the enlightened elite, because people just can&#x27;t be trusted to make the right choices unconstrained - I&#x27;d still disagree, but that would be a different conversation. But advocating censorship of political propaganda for the purpose of maintaining the <i>illusion</i> of democracy is just hypocritical.<p>My actual takeaway from that story is simply that <i>nobody</i> should have the power to do such things on a large scale. In a more decentralized political system, there can still be localized hotspots of oppression - but they don&#x27;t suddenly apply to tens of millions of people at once, and with no easy way to escape.')
