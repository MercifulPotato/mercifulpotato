Especially in America, I suppose.<p>Dated&#x2F;hooked up with a lot of women over time, but not out of choice. Am <i>far</i> happier now I have a found a woman worth devoting my life to through marriage. Unfortunately a significant fraction of otherwise attractive girls were very bought into a story of angry victimhood, despite overwhelming evidence in their own lives that they were incredibly privileged. Their expectations of men were invariably sky high even as they presented a negative mood and a clear attitude of, &quot;ask not what women can do for you, only what you can do for women&quot;. 100% of the women with this attitude never figured out how deeply unattractive it was.<p>My girl now is totally different. She enjoys cooking, so she cooks. She doesn&#x27;t enjoy doing the dishes or the ironing, so I do those. Not because we&#x27;re some right-on modern household but because that&#x27;s just how what we wanted to do worked out. She thinks feminism is dumb, femininity is great, and is generally the kind of women you&#x27;d normally only find in WW2 movies otherwise. I can&#x27;t get over how lucky I am, and only wish other men could have the same luck.')
