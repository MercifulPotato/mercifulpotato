Doesn&#x27;t it make sense that to make a living they will have to either produce something far better than the amateur, or do the parts that amateurs don&#x27;t want to do, or differentiate themselves in some other way?<p>It seems to me that it would be an odd society which didn&#x27;t even allow people to <i>ask questions</i> about the relative merits of person A and person B&#x27;s work, in case they found out something which would be disruptive to person A&#x27;s business model.')
