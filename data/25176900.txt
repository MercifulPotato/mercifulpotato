Seems like an absolute win to me.</i><p>I&#x27;m finding it difficult to see this as an absolute win given that Apple&#x27;s absolute control over these devices facilitates human rights abuses and a general trend towards censorship and authoritarianism all over the world.<p>As a developer I don&#x27;t see it as an absolute win if my distribution channels are dominated by an oligopoly of two all powerful gatekeepers. But I completely understand that consumers don&#x27;t care about that or even like it.<p>I also understand that consumers don&#x27;t care much about Apple&#x27;s cultural anti-porn bias. It&#x27;s all on the web anyway.<p>But what about human and civil rights? Can we really celebrate something as an absolute win if it hands absolute control over our access to encryption to anyone who happens to control Apple?')
