Why do people call for a discriminary approach (targeting Tiktok solely based on its origin, not giving them a chance to prove innocence), when that&#x27;s totally unnecessary?<p>Yes, the US is allowed to have national security concerns. Yes, the US is allowed to distrust China for whatever reason. But you could draw up a law that says &quot;ANY foreign app must go through a security audit to certify no data reaches any foreign governments&quot;. That way you don&#x27;t just target China, but also targets hypothetical Russian, European, African or whatever apps that could be problematic. And Tiktok would then be able to prove innocence or fix leaks.')
