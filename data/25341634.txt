Warrants occur relatively early in the investigative process and are often the first indication a target has that they&#x27;re under investigation. An adversarial warrant process would simply result in the destruction of most evidence.<p>A good way to prosecute your side of this argument would be to point out any country in the world that has an adversarial warrant system and how well it works. I&#x27;m unfamiliar with any. Much of Europe doesn&#x27;t even have the exclusionary rule, meaning that evidence of crimes obtained under false or broken warrants remain admissible.<p>If your argument is simply that most police shouldn&#x27;t be armed, you&#x27;ll get no argument from me.')
