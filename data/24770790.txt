Except louder and more expensive to replace.<p>This was actually shown in the “snap” video they showed where a phone was pulled away.<p>I couldn’t understand, are we expected to adhesive this to our bedside stand? Velcro adhesive? Use some other accessory that holds it down?<p>It just feels incomplete to me.<p>The cases and wallet thing seem great but I don’t get this charger.')
