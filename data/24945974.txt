Why? Because it lets me show an image of a complex field (perhaps sea-surface temperature) and point to a spot of some value, and ask students to visually trace nearby spots of the same hue.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter if some students perceive the same hue for two different actual hues.  So long as the neighbouring hues differ, the students can trace a local contour.  I need that to explain certain topics.<p>Using a colour scheme with just a couple of hues makes it very, very, difficult to trace contours.  It&#x27;s even worse when an image is projected onto a screen, in a classroom or at a meeting.  Speaker: &quot;See this slightly yellowish green on the colourbar, at 10C? Where is it in the map?&quot; Audience: &quot;I dunno, when&#x27;s the next coffee break?&quot;<p>Essentially, colour maps with a lot of hues can make images into something like a contour diagram. This can help, because some fields are so ragged that contours are difficult to understand.<p>Sometimes, a linear mapping between data values and the perceived colour is the end goal.  Other times, not.')
