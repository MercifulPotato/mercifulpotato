In Switzerland for instance I have to print out a multi page form, fill it in, send it back by physical mail (yup) then my bank follows up after a few weeks a a few more phone calls. And I have to pay a fee to get the card replaced. So yeah the transactions arenâ€™t on me but the hassle and fees are... This was much more straightforward in North America though.')
