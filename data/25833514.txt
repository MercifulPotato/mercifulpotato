Those who are barely literate, live in Asherates (villages which are run by often corrupt patriarchs and are told how to vote), and who go to school at imam-hatips? Probably not.  The Turks who are educated in the conservative universities in Konya? You&#x27;d be surprised. AKP is basically the post-Bush GOP, but Muslim instead of Christian.<p>I&#x27;m not defending the AKP, but painting all of them as rednecks is a huge mistake.')
