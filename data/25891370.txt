The lack of such functionality can make copying a scratched CD quite challenging with tools like cat or cp. You also have the choice to ignore the data that could not be read (dangerous) or to write a padded block of the correct size in its place and continue.<p>I agree that the use cases for all tools are different so comparing them fairly is impossible. dd is still my go-to for making disk images, but it&#x27;s unnecessary and has high overhead without a lot of tweaking for simple tasks like file operations. cat is often a good tool for things like piped commands where you need a flag cat supports (so you can&#x27;t use shell redirection) and cp&#x2F;rsync are obviously superior for copying files rather than just data. Sure, uu could hack my commandsin such a way that one tool can do another&#x27;s job, but why would I?')
