The idea was an attacker could be led astray and then drop various behavioral clues to disclose their identity past a legally arguable threshold based on  challenges and confusions selectively presented.<p>The guy I was working on it with dropped out of academics for a career of spirituality. He went off to a monastery so I also abandoned the project as well. We never even got a publication out of it :-&#x2F;. These days you could probably make a very expensive product out of it.*<p>Someone else may have picked it up, I don&#x27;t follow the literature anymore<p>---<p>* - I just realized maybe he went off to become a spook - I don&#x27;t know how I never thought of that - even to this day many of my colleagues from the era work for these nebulous companies with names like &quot;The Adirondack Group&quot; who just have a basic website with a single email address. I never understood why they even try, just say &quot;we are spies&quot; - everyone knows it. Maybe it allows them to live otherwise normal social lives where they don&#x27;t have to lie about the superficialities of their job? I dunno. It can&#x27;t be actually project based - that&#x27;d be super retarded - instead of knowing &quot;he works for the CIA&quot; everyone would also know what project they work on - super dumb - that can&#x27;t be it. I&#x27;ll probably hit up one of my old friends to see if that monastery was real. He can probably say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.')
