Most site admins are fearful of HPKP.  The mitm proxy I am using to post this message only has to exclude a small handful of domains from mitm decrypting.  A bunch of google domains, eff.org, paypal, a few mozilla domain names, dropbox and android.  To my surprise, no traditional banks, no money management or stock trading sites, no &quot;secure&quot; portals used by law firms to share sensitive files.  The sites I would expect to use pinning are the ones that do not.<p>On a side note, I would love to see a system that adds out-of-band validation of an entity.  e.g.  My bank should have a QR code behind glass on the wall that I can scan, import a key and further validate their site at the application layer, above and beyond HTTPS and CA certs.')
