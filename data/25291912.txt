This will be the first time that ETH holders receive any kind of &quot;earnings per share&quot;. But, it&#x27;s not enough:<p>- EIP-1559 alone is not enough for ETH to be a profitable investment from a cashflow perspective. The problem is that Ethereum&#x27;s proof of work mining is extremely expensive, like Bitcoin&#x27;s. Ethereum will run at a &quot;net loss&quot; until proof of work is discontinued.<p>- two days ago, the Ethereum v2 &quot;beacon chain&quot; launched after years of research and effort. This &quot;beacon chain&quot; is currently not used for any ethereum transactions and won&#x27;t be for two years. Here is a 3rd party UI for exploring the beacon chain <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beaconcha.in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beaconcha.in&#x2F;</a><p>- in 2022, the main ethereum blockchain will merge with the new ethereum v2 beacon chain and proof of work mining will go away forever. The new system, proof of stake, is dramatically less expensive. It&#x27;s so cheap that it&#x27;s effectively free.<p>- in 2022, with proof of stake fully live, ethereum&#x27;s transaction fees will effectively accrue to ETH holders and there will be no material expenses to offset this income. The result is that ETH will become a real investment vehicle from a cashflow perspective.<p>Learn more <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethereum.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;eth2&#x2F;#roadmap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethereum.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;eth2&#x2F;#roadmap</a>')
