But that doesn&#x27;t prove anything. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.<p>But here&#x27;s where the desperation comes in: false equivalence. Like we have limited observations so you can&#x27;t prove it ISN&#x27;T an artifact of alien life. Like the outcomes of it being artificial and natural in origin are treated as equal.<p>It just seems like the worst application and misunderstanding of the anthropic principle ever.<p>No evidence that it&#x27;s artificial doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s natural. It just means there&#x27;s no evidence of it being artificial. But absent any evidence, natural origin is the most likely explanation.')
