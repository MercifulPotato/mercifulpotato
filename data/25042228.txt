I&#x27;m not even going to read your link.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t care is because I remain dirt poor and I&#x27;ve spent years trying to figure out how to earn an adequate income legitimately while being called a &quot;whiner&quot; and told to shut up about my financial problems and all this crap and it has a long history of making me feel suicidal.<p>So if you have someone &quot;doing good works&quot; -- like contributing for free to open source -- who cannot figure out how to make ends meet and the entire world is happy to use their stuff for free while not giving a rat&#x27;s ass about their lack of an income, that alone can drive you crazy.<p>So I just don&#x27;t care. At all. Who set the fire is of zero importance to me and has no bearing whatsoever on the fact that &quot;We have systemic issues that we need to address.&quot;')
