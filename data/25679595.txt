Plus a couple annually-withdrawn accounts for subscriptions (staggered for things that renew on different months, so I don&#x27;t withdraw too many times in a single month), e.g. spotify, xbox live, notebook.ai, etc.<p>For the more fluid day-to-day stuff that I might make &quot;withdrawals&quot; from multiple times a month (like groceries and random spending), I usually stick to using checking accounts (which you only get 3 of on CO, unfortunately), but yeah, I have $X put in each month and look at how much is left to get a gauge on how much to spend or not (which does make me spend more&#x2F;less on food&#x2F;whatever at some points).<p>I rebalance every few months and look at whether I&#x27;m averaging more&#x2F;less than I expect on each account and adjust the automatic deposits into each account accordingly, so it&#x27;s mostly just a way to visualize a budget day-to-day while also making it easy to go back and see actual spending numbers month-to-month (which I also track with spreadsheets, but that&#x27;s another conversation!).')
