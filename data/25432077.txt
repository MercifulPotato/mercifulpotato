How is it? Can it compete with the current phones from Apple and Google? Does it do all the standard things like include filters, portrait mode, night mode, etc...? Can I search for &quot;dog&quot; and get all my dog photos or search for a city and get all the photos taken there?<p>And how&#x27;s the app store? When some random game goes viral and I want to play with my friends, am I going to be able to? Are the apps vetted for security and safety?<p>Does it integrate with my car? One of the primary uses of my phone is for navigation. Being able to plug it into my car and say &quot;navigate to 123 main street&quot; as I drive is pretty key.<p>Is their store only online? If they don&#x27;t have their own retailers can I at least see them at a carrier store or BestBuy? Will Verizon activate the phone on their network? A decade ago they wouldn&#x27;t approve the Nexus 7 tablet, so this is something I think about.')
