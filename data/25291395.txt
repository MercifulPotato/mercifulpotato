The hoops you&#x27;ll jump through as the application grows will often bring you more headache than you can imagine now.<p>Before coming to work at Timescale a few months ago, I spent 18 years managing products at two companies, both of which were time-based applications (utility billing&#x2F;energy data &amp; IIoT). In both cases, the app started small and everything seemed fine. We could usually get around performance issues with other hacks. But in both cases there was a tipping point because the original database (one relational, no NoSQL) just wasn&#x27;t designed for the challenge as the app scaled.<p>So whether you manage it yourself in a smaller environment for now or try something like Timescale Cloud, I can (almost) guarantee that you&#x27;ll thank yourself in a year or two. ;-)')
