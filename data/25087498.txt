If you want to get really gritty, you also configure and build U-Boot as a primary loader.<p>Once you get passed that point, you pull docker into your Alpine build and start running containers.<p>Stepping through that full process will teach you research (because you are going to be reading a lot about how to pull that off), it will teach you about Linux kernel configuration. It will teach you to be at least comfortable with git.<p>There is a lot you can learn on a Raspberry Pi, cheaply, that only involves plugging in an ethernet port and power supply, and never seeing anything on a terminal.')
