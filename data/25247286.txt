I know I can automate turning off the night light and turning on the day bulb, but if I don&#x27;t automate then I know she&#x27;s depending on me when my alarm goes off so I have to physically get up, walk to the other room, and flip a couple switches. On my way back, it&#x27;s very easy for me to sit down at the counter and eat the sandwich I made the night before for breakfast.')
