The cited console log messages only show a revocation check for Apple&#x27;s own Developer ID Certification Authority intermediate code signing certificate. This is signed by Apple&#x27;s root cert, and it&#x27;s checking Apple&#x27;s root cert CRL. No information about third-party developers or apps is sent there. Whereas third-party Developer ID leaf certificates do not have a CRL, and their status is only available via OCSP. Indeed, the cited log messages (from December 2018) were investigating the phenomenon of macOS <i>allowing</i> an app with a revoked cert to run.<p>Nonetheless, the article raises an intriguing question: did the macOS implementation of signing certificate revocation change sometime in 2019? This question deserves more investigation.<p>(See my comment at the end of the article for further technical details.)')
