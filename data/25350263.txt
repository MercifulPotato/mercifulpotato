Most GNU projects were roughly &quot;We&#x27;ll post a tarball once in a while and not have public CVS&quot; when I first started getting involved in OSS; projects with public CVS it was a lot easier to tell if someone was already was working on something, particularly for people as shy as I was back then; I got the impression that the &quot;proper&quot; thing to do would be to introduce yourself on the mailing list, propose the idea, &amp;c. and then start working on a patch.<p>My particular combination of low-confidence and misanthropy steered me away from such projects.')
