Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611802526, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25931465, text='&gt; Nothing about mobile devices is suited for p2p. Mobile devices are the exact opposite of what you want for p2p to function smoothly.<p>That&#x27;s true for their (usually) CGNATed cellular data connections and NATed home wifi connections. But if you were happy to consider a solution where &quot;p2p&quot; meant &quot;peers within bluetooth and wifi range of each other can store&#x2F;forward messages in a mesh&quot; then mobile devices are _exactly_ the piece of hardware you&#x27;d want. Add in some IPFS store&#x2F;forward from opportunistically internet connected devices to allow message passing between disconnected local meshes, and you should build a really interesting (low bandwidth very high potential latency) messaging system.<p>(Note: this &quot;disconnected meshes with opportunistic internet connection&quot; is pretty much what things like LoRaWAN and Meshtastic can do, but using specialised LoRa radio hardware instead of the built in capabilities of every smartphone on the planet.)')
