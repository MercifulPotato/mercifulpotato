Fuel excise, or electricity surcharge tax or whatever, is a tiny fraction of the subsidy that road users get from regular tax payers.<p>I&#x27;m a blind Aussie taxpayer.<p>Consider my tax situation. If I take an Uber to my local pub, that&#x27;s about A$10. Of that $10:<p>$0.90 in Goods and Services Tax\n$1 to the taxi compensation scheme<p>That&#x27;s 19% tax - or $1.90&#x2F;$10.<p>In Australia, public transport and P2P services get to a tiny fraction of all available road destinations. It easier (and sometimes cheaper) for someone like me to get from Sydney to Singapore than to Sydney to Kangaroo Valley (about 350km from Sydney).<p>So, for my 19% tax rate to get to the pub, the equivalent journey someone who can drive a car on their own may pay $0.25 in fuel excise duty.<p>They can pay the road users tax. They already get enough of a subsidy from me.')
