I run Better Programming, which is the second biggest programming publication on Medium after Towards Data Science. And it&#x27;s definitely the case that authors are opting in to the deal that Medium offers: a usually small amount of money and a fairly large boost in readers.<p>The average article we publish does 10k views, which for most authors is way more than they&#x27;d get self-hosting and posting out to Twitter&#x2F;FB.<p>I think also that Medium is still overly dominated by user generated content, i.e. what people here are calling low quality articles. You&#x27;d think of that content differently if it were better curated and better edited.<p>But all of Medium&#x27;s subscriber revenue gets reinvested in their content. Most of that is author payments, but also they pay copy editors and curation editors. What they haven&#x27;t done in programming yet is pay for any articles that have had a proper high quality edit. In programming that&#x27;s a story editor, tech reviewers and a bug&#x2F;errata updating process. But I suspect that will change because the subscription numbers are starting to be big enough that they can afford to invest in these things.')
