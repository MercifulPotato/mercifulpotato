Also the program is certified by green-e and apparently endorsed by NREL.gov.<p>And FWIW, it&#x27;s not a &quot;offset your whole footprint&quot; program; I just used a national kwh-co2 calculator to calculate how much green power I would need to put into the market to offset my entire footprint (instead of only paying to offset the power I use). So very napkin math-y.')
