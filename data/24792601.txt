I went car-less for a year and experienced the downsides pretty frequently. Carrying that damn stand mixer a few miles home sucked, going to events in nice clothes on warm nights wasn&#x27;t great on a bike, getting groceries from far away or visiting ocean beach took way longer than it should, etc...
