For the next 18 months I literally thought I didn&#x27;t have a manager. Nobody ever came to check on me or assign me work (I had tickets to work on and fires to extinguish). When HR asked who my manager was and I had to tell them I didn&#x27;t have one.<p>They were shocked and explained that by default the manager of my previous manager became mine, and I had to tell them we&#x27;d never met.<p>In 18 months he had never once come by my desk, called or sent me a single email. It was company policy to have monthly one on ones with all employees.<p>Of course, after that he got promoted!')
