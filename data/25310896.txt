Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=[25311536], score=None, time=1607133439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25309581, text='It does make you wonder though... huge ethical and health issues aside, is there even the tiniest chance that eating certain parts of another human could be advantageous or even partly grant you some of the positive traits that other human possesses?<p>There&#x27;s growing interest in infusion of young people&#x27;s plasma to counter aging, for example. Fecal transplants (more like gut biome transplants) also come to mind.<p>And Cerebrolysin is a slurry of peptides from pig brain matter which, when injected or taken intranasally, is used to treat brain damage but has also (riskily, of course) been used &quot;off-label&quot; as a cognitive enhancer in healthy people. It&#x27;s reported by some to significantly improve cognitive function, with unique effects. (And reported by some others to have caused long-term or permanent brain damage. No risk, no reward, I guess.)<p>It wouldn&#x27;t horribly shock me if - ignoring the ethics and the risks of prions and possibly harmful &quot;mismatches&quot; for a moment - eating part of someone&#x27;s brain could provide some cognitive benefits, and if maybe the brains of more intelligent people could in some cases provide stronger benefits.<p>Per the tapeworm experiments, maybe you could even get some cognitive benefit from eating other organs besides the brain. And per Cerebrolysin, maybe if you grind up parts of a smart person&#x27;s brain into a smoothie, aerosolize it, and take it intranasally, you could get especially powerful benefits (...and&#x2F;or terrible side effects or brain damage).<p>(Obviously this is still unlikely and complete, uninformed speculation on my part, though. And even if it were theoretically plausible obviously I don&#x27;t think it should ever be tried for any reason because it would harm or kill at least one party, and it probably would be bad to do with a dead brain that died of natural causes.)')
