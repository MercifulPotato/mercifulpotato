Item(by='arendtio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611696659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916574, text='+1 for the missing PWA mode.<p>As a user I create separate Firefox profiles for every site I want to use as a PWA, add a desktop short-cut and some custom userChrome.css, but while the result is okay, it sucks to set it up.<p>The only positive seems to be, that I can disable the buggy Spotify service-workers while keeping them enabled for other pages.<p>It would be awesome, if the PWA implementation would even support the system tray (similar to kdocker), but just the basic functionality would be better than the status quo.')
