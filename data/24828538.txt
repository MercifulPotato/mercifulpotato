PHP also beats out JS for warts (and outright bad implementation like left-to-right association of ternaries). Ruby has more than it&#x27;s fair share of weirdness too (try explaining eigenclass interactions to a new ruby dev). Even python has weirdness like loops having an `else` clause that is actually closer to a `finally` clause.<p>`typeof null === &quot;object&quot;` is a mistake (like with most of the big ones, blame MS for refusing to ratify any spec that actually fixed them).<p>If you&#x27;re having issues accidentally replacing `+` with `-` then you have bigger issues (eg, not unit testing). I&#x27;d also note that almost all the other languages you list allow you to overload operators which means they could also silently fail as well. In any case, garbage in, garbage out.<p>Foo being an instance of function is MUCH more honest than it being an instance of a class because the constructor in all languages is actually a function. This is even more true because you are looking at the <i>primitive</i> rather than the <i>function object</i> which contains the primitive.')
