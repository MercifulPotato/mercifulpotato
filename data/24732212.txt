Item(by='bladegash', descendants=None, kids=[24732569], score=None, time=1602264277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731266, text='EO 12333 says the FBI can conduct foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities; then it states if those activities take place regardless of authorities it must be done by the FBI; FISA then lays out statutory requirements in order to carry out the authorities specifically as they relate to US persons. So no, the author is not correct. Or maybe a more generous way to put it is their point was incomplete in a substantive way. Iâ€™m not sure where the miscommunication is taking place.')
