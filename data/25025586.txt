That artist would only get that fractional cent. The remaining of your monthly fee will go to other artists you have never played and may have no interest financing.<p>Most will be the popular artists du jour pushed by the records labels. They like the current system because -by definition- popular songs will be played a lot, probably in large part by free users (they are the majority anyway at around 55%)[1].<p>So popular streams always get the lion share of Spotify&#x27;s revenues, mostly financed by those who don&#x27;t listen to them.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;spotify-statistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessofapps.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;spotify-statistics&#x2F;</a>')
