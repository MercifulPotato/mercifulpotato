The U.S. military main job overseas consists in defending north-american economic interests by military means.  If this implies overthrowing democratic governments or supporting dictatorships, or the inverse, so be it.  It is more a like a mafia (that protects the economic interests of the people who support them) than a police force (that is supposed to protect everybody).')
