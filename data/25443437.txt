They let me remove a lot of incidental complexity and deal mostly with the problem domain (which is complex enough).<p>You can do anything with any language&#x2F;technology, it&#x27;s just a question of how many resources you are willing to dedicate to the task. In my case, as a solo bootstrapper, the resources are very limited.<p>Main advantages:<p>* a single language for both client-side (browser) code and server-side code<p>* a single data representation (maps with namespace-qualified keys), so no conversions necessary<p>* spec which helps validate data in multiple places (such as :pre&#x2F;:post conditions)<p>* core.async which lets me write asynchronous code both in the JVM and in the browser, same primitives<p>* a library of excellent sequence manipulation functions<p>* transducers, which let me build composable data pipelines<p>* the Rum library which lets me use React as a rendering engine, basically a function of my data<p>* most of my domain code is shared between the browser and the server<p>There is more, but these were what I could come up with immediately.<p>I mostly spend time thinking and working on the problem domain, not writing boilerplate (there is none in Clojure, really).')
