And in fact, I don&#x27;t write that much C for that reason, the cognitive load of tracking every bit of memory is high and not always justified.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t put C and &quot;modern&quot; C++ in the same class though. They are actually very different from a memory management perspective.<p>You can write C++ like you write C, there are plenty of valid use cases for that. However, the &quot;standard&quot; way of doing C++ now implies things like containers, RAII and smart pointers. It means objects get allocated and de-allocated automatically, dangling pointers and buffer overflows are less likely, but it has a cost in terms of performance and control. Another tool for another job.')
