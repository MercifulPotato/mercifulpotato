Have the right\n2. Have the right\n3. Don&#x27;t have the right\n4. Don&#x27;t have the right\n5. Have the right<p>But what&#x27;s so different between 2 and 3 or between 4 and 5? I could understand it if you see them as grey areas but it sounds like you&#x27;re adamant they have no moral requirement to serve ginger people but that it&#x27;s immoral to refuse short-sighted people. And why are religious and political ideologies distinct?<p>I don&#x27;t have much of an answer myself, but I don&#x27;t think religion should be protected. People are free to change their religion or lie about it to avoid discrimination if they want. Do you agree that excluding Muslims is wrong but excluding (nonviolent) Islamists is a right? How can you even tell the difference?<p>I wondered if you opinion was based on some philosophy. It seems it&#x27;s just a copy of what you&#x27;ve absorbed from your culture and suffers from all the same problems.')
