Mozilla license is similar to GPL in the sense that it also commands you to publish your code in some situations, so I would expect Google to outlaw this license as well, but so far I haven&#x27; received any complaints and I don&#x27;t think the contributors would go out of their way to get permission from higher-ups at Google. Perhaps they didn&#x27;t notice what terms the Mozilla license implies.')
