I wanted to share with you a little project of mine and a technical write up I did explaining how it was achieved. If you&#x27;re into VR you might find it interesting.<p>I know that Medium has a reputation but given that it&#x27;s my first public article and that I don&#x27;t really plan to maintain a blog in the long run, I just wanted to give it a shot and see how it goes.<p>Please feel free to give feedback!
