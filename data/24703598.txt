I&#x27;ve only done it when we really couldn&#x27;t find someone local.<p>The degree issue is short sighted though.<p>The salary issue will be a legitimate problem for some people though: I was on a school board for a private foreign-language school and we needed teachers fluent in their native language and familiar with the curriculum.  It was already a nightmare for us when the H-1s would run out in October or December as teachers look for new jobs during the summer.  Trying to meet 45% of the median for local senior, unionized teachers might be quite difficult.  Still, it&#x27;s a cost of doing business.')
