Windows and macOS users can build Zig and C code, and link against libc, for any of the targets listed above. Similarly code can be cross compiled for other architectures&quot;<p>&quot;In some ways, Zig is a better C compiler than C compilers!&quot;<p>And it&#x27;s all immediately available after the download. I am not aware of anything comparable that offers that functionality.<p>And currently &quot;self hosting&quot; is in development, which should longer-term allow language&#x27;s independence of LLVM. The way I understand it, it will make the product even more usable on additional platforms. The &quot;self hosting&quot; aspects and goals are known to the Zig developers but I hope a nice explanation of what will be achieved will be written.')
