Notice that it is &quot;mine&quot; work not theirs.<p>Whole discussion here is about toxic behavior of people whose PR&#x27;s are closed. It is not about closing yourself to contributions, idea is that everyone can still make a feature requests. One can still propose changes but there should be less pressure on integrating piece of code on maintainer, option to remove PR&#x27;s on repo would do that.<p>I see why GH would not consider option to disable PR&#x27;s because it is a killer feature of GH and it would be bad for their marketing when a lot of repositories would become &#x27;read-only&#x27;.')
