I use a Toshiba for work also running Pop OS, and it has some minor issues, but I expect that because it wasn&#x27;t designed for Linux like my personal laptop. Everyone wants their cake and eat it too, they complain about lock-in, complain about Apple&#x27;s phone-home features (last week!), and then they just say &quot;well Linux is hard to setup once, so I don&#x27;t want to try&quot; and punt the issue.<p><i></i>If you want a good and easy Linux PC, then buy a PC designed for Linux, like you would a Macbook<i></i>.')
