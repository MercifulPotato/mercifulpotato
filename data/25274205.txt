Meanwhile, these &quot;safe&quot; languages will give you nothing but shadows you&#x27;ll mistake for your own limitations.<p>My suggestion is just learn how to write secure code in C. It&#x27;s an unknown-unknown for you at the moment, so you&#x27;re going to have to learn how to tackle that sort of thing, but the good news is that (with the right strategy) many unknown-unknowns can be attacked using the same tricks. That means if you <i>do</i> learn how to write secure code in C, then the skills you develop will be transferable to other languages and other domains, and if you still like management, those skills will even be useful there.')
