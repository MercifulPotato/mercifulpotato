Candle lighting is not specific to this initiative, or this day -- it&#x27;s common theme for all remembrance days to set a candle in the window for those who didn&#x27;t make it through history. There is a day in May, dedicated to victims of political repression and other two dedicated to Crimean Tatars and Holocaust, all of those are marked with candles.')
