When using FAT32, you cannot do that without splitting the file and concatenating the parts at destination. That wastes time and it is annoying and sometimes it may be even impossible, when the destination lacks a concatenation program or an archiver that can deal with split archives.<p>After Microsoft released it, now exFAT is supported in the Linux kernel. Because exFAT is also supported by all commercial operating systems, it is now the best way for file transfer.<p>It does not matter any more if there are still valid patents for exFAT.')
