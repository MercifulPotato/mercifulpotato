There are a lot of issues with GDELT data, but the things that come to mind recently are:<p>- Missing keywords. Huge topics like &quot;brexit&quot; won&#x27;t be found, so you need to extract those yourself.<p>- Dirty titles. You need to extract the article titles from the website metadata, and more often than not they&#x27;ll pre&#x2F;append their site name like &quot;[title] - DailyStormer&quot; and links like &quot;[title]: Business, Stocks, News&quot; etc. That requires NLP to fix.<p>- Non-standardized locations. Location tags are all over the place, so &quot;united_states&quot; might have many tags like &quot;us&quot;, &quot;usa&quot;, &quot;america&quot;, &quot;the_states&quot;, etc. I&#x27;m still working on combining these tags in the API.')
