If they&#x27;re not efficient enough for certain high performance areas, just don&#x27;t use them there. I don&#x27;t see why, for instance, they can&#x27;t be used along with more efficient implementations, for instance in areas where parallelism and memory locality are not that important (for instance, for a menu or to hold settings).<p>I feel that banning them altogether may lead people to implement stuff from scratch even when they don&#x27;t need it, creating another possible source of bugs and vulnerabilities.')
