Last weekend something must&#x27;ve happend to that domain because the TV told me it wasn&#x27;t connected to the Internet and refused to start any app. The Internet connection (as well as the local Wifi connection), however, was perfectly fine.<p>So I expect the device (at least the &quot;smart&quot; functionality) to be bricked as soon as Samsung takes that domain down for good. In fact Samsung already removed 80 % of the gimmicks and remote features the TV came with, some of them didn&#x27;t even last two years.')
