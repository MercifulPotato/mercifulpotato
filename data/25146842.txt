What they are supposed to say is that element with m-1 class and element with m-2 class should have different margin, with the m-2 element probably have a slightly bigger one, and every element that uses m-2 class should have the same margin. It doesn’t specify styling at all. The concerns of styling are completely separated into the theming system.<p>All that the utility class define is the relation between elements. Eg. which elements should have the same margin&#x2F;color&#x2F;typography etc... This would also provides consistency in your designs, unlike pure css which allows you to do whatever you want without defining structure and relationships between elements.<p>I would say tailwind forces you to separate styling concerns out of your content and into your theme. You could probably replicate css zen garden using tailwind theming system.')
