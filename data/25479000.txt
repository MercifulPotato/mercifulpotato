If you&#x27;re kind and not demanding, people won&#x27;t mind you and will probably find you fairly likeable.<p>But that&#x27;s not enough for people to actually want to spend time with you; you have to bring more to the table, e.g. insightful cultural commentary, to make people laugh, or some sort of common ground.\nNavigating conversations to find common ground is much easier said than done. Doubly so for telling engaging and relatable stories to convey a sense of shared experience.<p>So I don&#x27;t mean a preference for professional competence, but a preference for &quot;social competence&quot;, acknowledging of course that it&#x27;s also highly dependent on the culture.<p>To get more personal, I&#x27;ve been called &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;transparent&quot;, &quot;predictable&quot;, &quot;two dimensional&quot;. I think I&#x27;m probably more engaging than a script programmed to regurgitate platitudes, but some of my critics have suggested not by much!')
