Other than that it is really nice. The desktop client is arguably better than WA&#x27;s web solution, although I have run into non-syncing messages, but, you can use the desktop client with your phone off, which is a major + imho.<p>Honestly, Signal is just super high quality when you take into account how privacy focused it is, I could easily replace WA with Signal, apart from &quot;the network effect&quot;.')
