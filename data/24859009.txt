Which is fair, but what irks me is that in India which has pretty high taxation in all departments (see Petrol&#x2F;Gasoline) the tax you pay gives you ZERO benefit. No healthcare, education or unemployment benefits etc. Also on top of this, due to the corrupt system, if you need anything from any govt. agency you will need to pay a bribe anyways (e.g. registering an apartment, even getting a passport).<p>TBH, I am a big fan of taxes, I am happy to pay even 50-60% in taxes if that means my fellow human is not left hungry or without healthcare or without a roof on their head. In India this is not the case, high taxes, with no benefits to anyone (except the government and their friends).')
