How many are over 100ms?<p>Good question, the core of the execution engine of the application is a synchronous dataflow graph driven by your audio thread most of the time, so if you set a buffer size of 64 that&#x27;s going to give you the usual 2ms of latency for instance for the actual computations, and for all the audio processing.<p>Separate threads feed that in external OSC, MIDI, etc... messages through lock-free queues which <i>should</i> be fast, but I haven&#x27;t done entire round-trip measurements, will do that !')
