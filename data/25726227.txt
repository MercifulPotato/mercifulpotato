It’s been an ongoing issue for us for a very long time. We had extreme issues with getting our youth vote out, getting our minority votes out. It literally took a black President to get that demo to show up, and for some reason they stopped showing up right after he was gone (for Hilary). The kids don’t turn out at all for decades now. Many could argue if we didn’t literally send out mail in ballots, the turn out would have been lower. Republicans don’t have this problem, so no, I don’t think a warcry works on the Democrats because we have been very weak on physical presence for decades now.<p>But in terms of madness, of course, all mobs are susceptible to this. Virtual turn out on the left is disproportionately high. The #metoo and BLM movements are clear examples of this. But again, the physical presence is lacking. The riots last summer were a blip and not coordinated, and led to <i>zero</i> legislation. I’ll concede #metoo inevitably entered into madness territory.<p>The Republican tea-party people have been practicing for years protesting in DC, and they have their physical turnout covered in almost every election.<p>If anything, I envy the right-wing’s ability to rally, and do not fear rally-calls on the left because we can barely show up for an election.')
