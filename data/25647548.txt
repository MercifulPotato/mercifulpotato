The github repo named &quot;fontpreview&quot; allows you to &quot;create preview images from one or more selected fonts.&quot;<p>Mind you, this is far more usefull to me than the original title. Though I wonder how it interacts with configuration files you might have on system. Previewing things implies that that&#x27;s what the font will look like once used on your system.')
