Perhaps she should.<p>My point is that the decision should be solely the employer and not under pressure from the lynch mob. In this case, the mob absolutely did put pressure on them to fire her. Without that pressure, they may still have done so, or they may have reprimanded her in another way, we&#x27;ll never know. In the end, as long as she changes her behavior, I don&#x27;t think her livelihood needed to be attacked and she certainly should not have been harassed to the point of severe depression and anxiety (which she talked about in interviews later).<p>Again, call out, reprimand, whatever is deemed correct. Don&#x27;t incite a mob to harass them or try to ruin their lives.')
