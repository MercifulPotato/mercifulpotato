I can’t seem to make the “hello world” of latte art (the heart). With a few tweaks I’m sure it can be possible.<p>I think the main issue is that it’s inherently a 2D-only simulation where latte art is all about the 3D fluid properties. Pouring milk somewhere doesn’t just add and displace, it “drags” on the existing art and pulls it in as the milk goes under the surface.')
