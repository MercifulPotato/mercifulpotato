The context of this particular article, however, is that John Gruber is obliquely attempting to use Spotify’s bad behavior to excuse Apple doing the same or worse on a much larger, much more significant scale.<p>This is one in a long series of recent posts dedicated to pointing out the hypocrisy of companies (Epic, Spotify, Microsoft, etc) that have been agitating for Apple to loosen its stranglehold on the iOS ecosystem.<p>The gist seems to be: “See? Everyone else is doing the same thing with their own platforms, too!” As if the self-interested actions of a bunch of huge companies is what sets the moral baseline we expect them all to adhere to.<p>I wish Gruber would spend a little more time thinking and writing about how these companies _should_ manage their platforms and a little less time trying to undercut the entirely legitimate criticisms that developers large and small have with how Apple, the world’s most valuable company, deals with them.')
