The whole point is to miss things.<p>&gt; That may be an <i>effect</i> of vacations, but that is not their driving <i>purpose</i><p>That all depends. A confucian official was apparently required to take a <i>two year</i> mourning period following the death of his father. I have read the theory that one purpose this practice may have served (intentionally or not) was ensuring that no one could usurp too much power.<p>More recently, I have read that some bank employees are legally required to take a certain amount of vacation, with an explicit justification being the idea that if you are using your position in the bank to engage in a lot of financial fraud, you may find it more difficult to keep the fraud going while on your legally-mandated vacation.')
