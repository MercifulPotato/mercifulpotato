That is-- do your thing, modern web. Once you finish I click a button to destroy your Rube Goldberg machine and retain only the tiny marble I wanted in the first place.<p>I only wish it could detect when asshole newspapers do that last minute mutation of the DOM to put bullshit divs in front of the article. It makes me play a button-click race to beat the rendering of the bullshit div to reader mode.<p>Btw-- why do asshole newspapers actually send the article content before adding the bullshit divs? If you&#x27;re gonna be evil, just send the first paragraph over the wire and make it <i>appear</i> as if the rest of the article is just one email sign-up away.')
