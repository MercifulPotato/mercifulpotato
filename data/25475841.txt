Item(by='mybrid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608363686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459506, text='DRY is just a another way of saying the best practice of don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel. The difference being reinventing the wheel is applied to third party packages and DRY to you own code. The friction from blindly applying both is the same, dependency. This is especially apparent in JavaScript where literally thousands of dependent libraries can be pulled in and any two version incompatiblies can break the build. Pulling in any dependency usually means pulling in orders of magnitude more lines of code then will be used. The inert code relative to one&#x27;s use can be subject to version incompatiblies and security patches no different than any other code. It can also be subject to build differences such as numpy and pandas being non-native Python and native Python libraries exist for many limited use cases. Of course none of this is an endorsement of cut&#x2F;copy&#x2F;paste development. However, it is an indictment of cut&#x2F;copy&#x2F;paste enforcement of DRY and the more general don&#x27;t reinvent the wheel.')
