That said, in my personal experience, there is a pressure among engineers to stand out, else they won&#x27;t get a good job. Also there&#x27;s a rat race mentality inculcated by our parents to excel and always one-up others, rather than to co-operate and collaborate. It was okay when we were school-students and had to contest for entrance into a renowned college. But, the &quot;I was the topper in high school, I gotta excel in adult life, be it through hook or by crook&quot; mentality still runs in college and (hearing from seniors and relatives) in jobs. People are eager to do the 4 hour course on Tensorflow and mention &quot;Tensorflow expert&quot; in their resume to get an edge, people will and do write &quot;Hacktoberfest 2018 and 2019&quot; in their resume, a guy who can fire up an EC2 instance will call himself &quot;moderately proficient in AWS&quot;. I&#x27;m not joking about these, job-hunting season is starting and I&#x27;ve seen resume of other students mention all this. People see videos of conferences where engineers wear swag t-shirts, and associate swag with good developers, that was further intensified by this guy&#x27;s video and people wanted this swag for all these reasons.<p>I guess I&#x27;ve gone slightly OT here, so I&#x27;ll summarise: Herd mentality due to poor guidance, peer pressure among engineers and the societal pressure to stand out (for securing jobs) is a big culprit here')
