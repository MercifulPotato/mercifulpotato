Let&#x27;s say that without a vaccine that number could be expected to grow to 10M or 20M. To prevent that outcome, we&#x27;re talking about giving vaccines to <i>billions</i> of people, most of whom are at very little risk from the virus, which use previously-unknown mechanisms to induce immunity, and whose long-term effects are completely unknown. It seems <i>to me</i> like there&#x27;s not really serious calculation being applied to the risks of the latter course. It&#x27;s just &quot;stop COVID at all costs.&quot;')
