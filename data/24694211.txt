I should have included that disclaimer in my original comment.  However defective is an important qualifier.  Autopilot is not designed to be the primary driver of the car.  A Tesla on Autopilot rear-ending another driver is no more defective than any other car on cruise control rear-ending someone.  Autopilot would likely need to overrule human action to be considered defective.  I was assuming that is an unlikely enough case to avoid mentioning it.  Even if that did occur, that would be evident in other logs the car keeps so this attention monitor wouldn&#x27;t be relevant.')
