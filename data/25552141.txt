Not only to buy shiny stuff you don&#x27;t want, but also, for example, politically.<p>In the hands of incompetent advertisers or MACHINE LEARNING! (tm), you get the annoying features like being bombarded with TV ads when you just bought a new TV last week and won&#x27;t need another earlier than in 5 years. Or being offered stuff you really don&#x27;t care about but some algorithm thinks it&#x27;s related.<p>And one little privacy issue: what targeted ads display can give out information about you that you don&#x27;t want made public to people who may see your screen. The example of the pregnant girl who began getting coupons for stuff for new mothers while hiding from her family that she&#x27;s pregnant has been mentioned on this page.<p>And last but not least:<p>Do you want to live in a world where you&#x27;ll only be presented with content you&#x27;re sure to like? Because they can only be sure you&#x27;ll like it if you&#x27;ve seen it before and reacted positively to it, which means that after a while you&#x27;ll stop seeing anything new.')
