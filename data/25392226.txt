A syscall needs to be hung on a network request.<p>I regularly hit this issue. Most recent one was last year on 4.19 kernel when using NFS mount. I found the bug report for that one and they said it was fixed in 5.1 or similar.<p>Beware they were talking about that particular bug. Because as the parent comment says it is architectural issue that can&#x27;t just be &quot;fixed&quot;. It&#x27;s a whack-a-mole. Developers need to be careful on <i>all</i> the call sites to avoid it. FUSE, NFS, CIFS code is all susceptible to it (and to my horror I&#x27;ve bitten by every single one of them several times in the past).')
