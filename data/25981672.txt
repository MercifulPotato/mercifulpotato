Yeah technically because the volatility was what caused their deposit requirements to go up.<p>* Were they having liquidity issues? No, because they shut down trading before it became an issue.<p>&gt;Either the market flows with honest information or it is being rigged.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble imaginging how him lying cause the game to be &quot;rigged&quot;. Specifically, how him lying caused material harm to the robinhood users. People saw trading was restricted, so they jumped ship to other brokerages. They&#x27;d have done that regardless of whether it was caused by gremlins in the server room or liquidity issues.')
