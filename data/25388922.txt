This is a printf that only happens in debug mode; dbg is something that takes an expression, returns that expression, and will print out its filename, line number, and a pretty-printed version of the value.<p>For an example of how this plays out, I had some code:<p><pre><code>    let x = y + z;\n</code></pre>\nI wasn&#x27;t sure what y was, so I was able to<p><pre><code>    let x = dbg!(y) + z;\n</code></pre>\nthis is <i>much</i> easier to insert into (and remove from) existing code. Plus, you don&#x27;t need to write the formatting code.<p>Basically, what you posted is in the same <i>genre</i> of thing, but is very different in a lot of meaningful ways.')
