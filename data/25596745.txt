It&#x27;s fine to hate Trump I guess and if you think the ends justify the means, that&#x27;s your right, but it&#x27;s demonstrably true that people who in normal years would be highly skeptical of anything coming out of the intelligence agencies are eager to promote anything that makes the Trump administration look bad.<p>Edit: Another aspect of this story is that it was pushed after bipartisan support for exiting Afghanistan was emerging. So basically this &quot;information&quot; was put out there to keep us in a war no one likes and the putatively anti-war party eagerly promoted it because Trump is bad.<p>Edit 2: I fully expected this comment to be downvoted, but I hope some of you downvoters will engage with my argument in the replies, since most of you have no argument against my claims, which are factually true.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;top-pentagon-officials-russian-bounty-program-corroborated&#x2F;story?id=71694167" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;top-pentagon-officials-russi...</a>')
