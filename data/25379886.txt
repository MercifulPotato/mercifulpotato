But once a close friend started having problems with his neighbours, I experienced first hand the negative externalities that were involved in making Airbnb rich. Renting out a spare room now and then is entirely different from dedicated &quot;holiday rentals&quot; in the centre of residential buildings. It is hellish for the other residents.<p>If PG lived in a standard apartment block and was surrounded by Airbnb rentals, I guarantee he would have a very different opinion of Airbnb.')
