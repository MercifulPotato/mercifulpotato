Some teams I took over complained to me I was micro managing them, because I was reviewing code and asking on a regular basis them when things would be done. The regular basis was once, max 2 a week, and I was not reviewing more than 1 PR &#x2F; dev per month. They were used to no accountability, and ofc compared to that, everything feels like micro management.<p>Also, micromanagement gets a bad rep, but actually, figuring out when micro management is needed is also a skill. It depends on your own skills and availability, your team seniority, etc. Outside of very junior programmers, the need to micro manage is often a sign that you did not hire well, but managers don&#x27;t always have a say in firing people.')
