But I haven&#x27;t heard of reliability concerns that USB3 has. Well, they are designed to work up to 100 meters so they should be reliable. Maybe it&#x27;s all because of the transformers you mentioned?<p>Therefore it&#x27;s very common to use alternatives like optics and simple DAC copper cables for 10Gbe. I also think home networking industry will eventually give up 10GBASE-T.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mikrotik.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;S%2BRJ10_general_guidance#General_Guidance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mikrotik.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;S%2BRJ10_general_guidance#Gen...</a>')
