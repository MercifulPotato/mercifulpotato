My experience has almost always been that the extension I want isn’t available for safari (just chrome and Firefox), or is a shitty&#x2F;old version of the chrome one.<p>So even if the $100 keeps some more junk out than on chrome, I still don’t get to use the extensions I want and the ones that are available aren’t great (albeit better than junk).')
