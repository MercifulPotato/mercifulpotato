You have to loosen regulations<p>That’s not what Germany has done but there’s little doubt that Germany’s manufacturing ability is held in a higher regard globally.<p>So i challenge the “have to”. It’s the unproven talk of a particular tribe but i stress unproven since economics is a social science. That means there’s lots of science but is fundamentally stories we tell each other and not akin to, for example, the unassailable truth of gravitational pull.')
