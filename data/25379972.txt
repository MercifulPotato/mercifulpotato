The &quot;gigabit&quot; cable internet available in my area is 960&#x2F;30, and as a big self-hoster, that&#x27;s not close to enough upload. I run nextcloud, media streaming, backups, etc for about 10 people, and my connection is always maxed out. I&#x27;m starting to move backups to local RPi&#x27;s at my parent&#x27;s&#x2F;in-law&#x27;s to save some bandwidth, but it makes management a bigger pain. I would love to have gigabit fiber, or even 100Mbps upload...')
