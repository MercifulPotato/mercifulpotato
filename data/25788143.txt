I often see Indian political flamewars here and I know what they are, but I didn&#x27;t realize that online political discussions from Sweden exist on HN, and they&#x27;re even more toxic than their U.S. counterparts (e.g. immigration, gender, etc). I just enabled &quot;Show Dead&quot; and went to your link and it instantly ruined my day, reminds me of 4chan &#x2F;pol&#x2F; threads. Thanks again for keeping them under control, time to disable &quot;Show Dead&quot; and forgot what I just saw...<p>&gt; The problem is the statelessness of the internet.<p>I fully understand your frustration. I always thought forums are much better since Twitter is a worse offender - you have to repeat what you&#x27;ve just said 10 minutes ago after a new person has joined the conversation - but for someone who moderates forums daily,  I guess it&#x27;s basically the same experience.')
