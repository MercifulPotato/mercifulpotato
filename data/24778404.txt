Each season ends with them tying off the main arc, and an expose that sets up for the next season. Season 2&#x27;s conclusion felt satisfactory, while still keeping me excited for what&#x27;s to come. The 1st season of Witcher does this really well too.<p>Netflix&#x27;s problem is the same one as network TV. It is just far more evident with Netflix because the binge format is central to it. When the entire show is enjoyed in a very small time span, the ending affects your perception of the show more strongly than if the show was enjoyed over years on broadcast TV. A similar phenomenon is visible with movies too, where a bad ending can often come to define the entire movie.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that TV contracts haven&#x27;t become more sophisticated and diverse with time. How about sign a 3 season contract with no extensions or mandate arc conclusions for shows whose fate is up in the air? Maybe create a final season as a low-budget short, allowing show runners to provide a conclusion when axed.<p>I&#x27;m no expert on the matter, but the complete lack of new ideas in the domain is surprising, given the degree to which Netflix has revolutionized the rest of the distribution business.')
