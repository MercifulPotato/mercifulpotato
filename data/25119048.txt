I feel that&#x27;s the domain of a governmental agency with far less access to information and is or far more regulated than the existing bureaus.<p>&gt; Should everyone get the same mediocre credit limits&#x2F;interest rates&#x2F;etc instead of responsible borrowers being rewarded<p>No, but non-borrowers or low borrowers shouldn&#x27;t be penalized when they do need credit. I&#x27;m not against credit reporting, I&#x27;m against the usage of my data against me by people that don&#x27;t have an incentive to make sure its accurate and keep it secure.')
