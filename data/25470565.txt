I am not trying to excuse companies from not doing this, but its not as easy as just saying you will. \nOptions are typically ISOs, but by law, you have a max of 90 days to exercise an ISO after you leave. The only way around this is to instead offer NSOs, which have higher tax implications. \nThird, you could offer ISO&#x27;s, then convert them into NSOs when you leave, but its a lot of extra effort and paperwork.')
