When the sitting President claims that voting fraud happened they should investigate it, not instantly claim it’s not true because they don’t like him. It lead to these protesters feeling like nobody was taking the claims seriously, and felt that they must do something.<p>I don’t know if there was or wasn’t significant fraud, but the way the media handled it was disgusting. The past 4 years has given half of the country no reason to trust them, and this last hurrah cemented that fact.')
