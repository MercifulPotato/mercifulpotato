Feeling a bit shell shocked, it was a tough year and then just tonight heard my parents were exposed despite many precautions. But through it all this place has been a delight and a resource as always. Whatever the tradeoffs, I&#x27;m deeply grateful to live in a time when such groups of people spanning experiences and the globe can come together. Thanks to the mods and everyone who puts their contributions, time and thoughts into HN and the amazing projects that come up here.')
