The most salient part of this article:<p>&gt; Under its provisions, social media services will not be allowed to remove content or block accounts if the content on them does not break Polish law. In the event of removal or blockage, a complaint can be sent to the platform, which will have 24 hours to consider it. Within 48 hours of the decision, the user will be able to file a petition to the court for the return of access. The court will consider complaints within seven days of receipt and the entire process is to be electronic.<p>As an aside: the excuse that private companies are not the government and &quot;can do whatever they want&quot; is the flimsiest of excuses. If businesses can do whatever they want, then surely all of them can ignore pandemic restrictions and open up if they so choose. And all the regulations already imposed on other privately-held utilities must not matter. And so on.<p>Clearly big tech companies are the new digital public town square and speech that is not permitted on their platforms might as well not exist. For people to have a <i>useful</i> right to the freedom of speech, these massive platforms do need to be regulated. Perhaps niche networks can go their own route but Twitter and Facebook are bigger than most nations and cannot be allowed to operate without due process.')
