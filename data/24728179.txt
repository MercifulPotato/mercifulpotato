Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602235356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722016, text='Well, I don&#x27;t know who &quot;these people&quot; are and what exactly they thought, but I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t still be skeptical. The announcement promises that &quot;in the near term&quot; all Waymo&#x27;s rides will be &quot;fully driverless&quot; but in the <i>immediate</i> term they are modifying their cars to go back to rides with a safety driver. So the &quot;near term&quot; will be fully driverless, but right now it&#x27;s even less drivereless then before.<p>For myself, I would trust this announcement a lot more if it claimed some new technological breakthrough that enables Waymo to do now something that wasn&#x27;t possible half a year, or 5 or 10 years ago (specifically, this &quot;something&quot; is level-3 self-driving, as poorly as this is unfortunately defined). I don&#x27;t see any such claims. The announcement instead reads as so much marketing copy to me, and it is not saying anything that has any practical implications for the technological capabilities of Waymo&#x27;s cars.')
