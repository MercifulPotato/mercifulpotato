I am the author of IOS support for DeviceFarmer ( previously OpenSTF ). Part of that support involves getting video of the screen over the USB connection which uses the same undocumented pathways that libimobiledevice uses. I&#x27;ve been attempting to find someone at Apple to support the open source efforts for nearly a year to no avail.<p>What I would like Apple to support is fetching the raw h264 stream in a documented fashion, rather than forcing one to use AVFoundation and get pre-processed frames&#x2F;data. Only allowing decoded video makes it impossible to scale. ( having many devices connected to a single mac all streaming video )<p>It would also be awesome if they would open up and document all the protocols and operations that the lockdown protocol supports. I doubt that will ever happen though.')
