I see a notable difference between &quot;less disease of a very specific sort&quot; and &quot;reversed aging&quot; although the end result is remarkably similar (without the age digression, of course). The article treats them as the same. Unless your sole definition of aging is in re how far down the chain your telomerase shows up.<p>To me, reversing aging would be more like the Benjamin Button story. But that&#x27;s not the story being told here.<p>Depending on how you are looking at it, they&#x27;re either very similar things, or completely different things. I see them as being very different.')
