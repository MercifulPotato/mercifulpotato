Adding a carnivore (cat) changes the game and brings quick gains eating other animals but when the climate shifts and carnivores have nothing to eat they die first.<p>Large chunks of the game are often played with no carnivores (cats) as other strategies outperform.<p>Great game to better understand evolutionary dynamics.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamegeek.com&#x2F;boardgame&#x2F;182134&#x2F;evolution-climate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamegeek.com&#x2F;boardgame&#x2F;182134&#x2F;evolution-climate</a>')
