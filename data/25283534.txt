It costs $1, can be operated by a 2 year old, is perfectly intuitive, and the only downside I can think of is that occasionally it necessitates I be very slightly less lazy than I might otherwise be able to aspire to, i.e. when I need to go downstairs and turn off a forgotten light.<p>Considering my house is all using LED lights on hydro power, it&#x27;s probably better for me to just leave a 5w light on all night than it is to install a Google Home setup here, in terms of my carbon footprint.')
