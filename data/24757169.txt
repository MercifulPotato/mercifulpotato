You don&#x27;t just get sick for a day and gain herd immunity. You are sick and contagious for weeks, you then infect other people whom go out and infect other people. Do these doctors seriously believe people at risk can just isolate themselves from the world? Most don&#x27;t even realize they&#x27;re at risk.<p>If you want to put that risk of infection and death onto people then say it, but don&#x27;t try to sugar coat it like this is a good idea that will protect everyone. If anything it&#x27;s necessary to keep markets afloat and various economies from failing.')
