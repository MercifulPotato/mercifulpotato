Nor do I think a luxury consumer gadget can see much success by sacrificing on aesthetics.<p>Building the case into the phone is exactly what my girlfriend&#x27;s $120 Android does, and it certainly looks like it cost no more than $120 with its rubber bumpers that already look like they&#x27;ve been used as pencil erasers.<p>If you&#x27;re arguing that people shouldn&#x27;t care so much about the shiny marketing, it&#x27;s not clear how much people do care nor what the appropriate amount of care should be. A good looking product does help you spend $1000 though.')
