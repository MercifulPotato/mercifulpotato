Is the point of having an ethics researcher to expand our understanding of ethical issues, or merely to aid in PR?<p>If a university administrator were to attempt to tell a PI not to submit a paper critical of work from another lab at the same institution, I think that would be judged as a shocking overreach. But for Google, we&#x27;re not even in agreement that this behavior is a problem. It&#x27;s unfortunate that we expect so little from corporations, even if those corporations are some of the main drivers of research in a field.')
