Python destructors run down the road, during the next GC cycle.<p>As an example of why this matters, I’ve got a class called TimeCapture in a project. If I want to instrument how long a block takes (full function, inside of an if, etc) I can add `TimeCapture tc(“my-metric-name”);` to the block and know that the destructor on that object will be called precisely at the end of that block (capturing the end time of the block)<p>I don’t know the rules for Swift or Ada or OP, but I’m guessing they’ll vary.')
