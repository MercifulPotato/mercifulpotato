Which can be burned to produce carbon dioxide and more heat.<p>I&#x27;m glad to know that according to this article&#x27;s author they have invented a perpetual motion machine that generates free energy.<p>I would however, prefer to read an article by someone who understands basic thermodynamics and feels like explaining this to an audience who is assumed to also understand basic thermodynamics. Presumably there is an input of energy (other than heat) which is the most significant part of generating jet fuel -- but unless I overlooked something, the article doesn&#x27;t mention it.')
