It bothers me that I end up on probably 10+ doorbell cameras, possibly showing up as an alert on someones phone.<p>I live in a suburb where basically nothing ever happens. Sure, there&#x27;s the occasional clip posted on nextdoor of a rude driver or some kids stealing a lawn ornament. But I highly doubt that the grainy unfocused video of a doorbell camera was ever pivotal in solving these crimes.<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why so many people want to record the front of their house, and pay someone like Amazon a monthly fee to do so.')
