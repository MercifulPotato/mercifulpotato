However, the conditions for it are documented; I was wrong. This is where code could help, in order to clarify obtuse language in the requirements. Obviously, the government runs code which checks the conditions that determine whether a nonzero amount can be claimed in some field, so it&#x27;s just another calculation. Still, it would be better for that to be crystal clear pseudo-code and not the fragment of some actual implementation.')
