They&#x27;re also not universally &quot;registers&quot; in any meaningful way.  Basically, instead of adding new <i>instructions</i> for everything, CPU designers just add a new MSR.  Its kinda like how the kernel assigns a new major&#x2F;minor for every new device driver instead of a new syscall.<p>MSRs can also be added by microcode update as we saw with MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL, which was used to mitigate Spectre (among other things).<p>Disclaimer: I work on Linux at Intel, and I was one of the ones posting in that LKML thread quoted in the article.')
