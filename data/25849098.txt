The percent of libertarians voting for an independent candidate was larger than the gap between Trump and Biden, even though Trump was probably the most libertarian president in the past 30 years. For instance, Trump refused to expand federal government&#x27;s power during Covid, and he deregulated a lot to defer policies to states. Not that I like or dislike Trump&#x27;s policy, mind you -- just my assessment. So, Trump may simply ignored the requests to pardon Assange and Snowden.')
