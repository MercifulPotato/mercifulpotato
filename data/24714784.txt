They call it &quot;Virtual 3D&quot; which uses the AMD&#x2F;nVIDIA GPU encoding capabilities to &quot;stream&quot; the video to the client - pretty much the same what Win10 with H.264AVC444 is capable of, only that you don&#x27;t need one GPU per VM.<p>Each VM uses the h264 decode capabilities of the Host GPU and i must say, it just works perfect. It even does support Direct X 12 and Vulkan in the VM.<p>The only downside is that it is only available for Windows 10 or Windows server. Is there something similar for Linux &#x2F; unRAID &#x2F; KVM?')
