I met so many individuals from these career choices when I was playing RTSs that it was uncanny. Given this, it&#x27;s no surprise to me that RTSs aren&#x27;t wildly popular, the complexity and depth is just too much, it takes a systematizing nerd (of which there aren&#x27;t many) to fully appreciate it.<p>I believe another reason is that these games are mostly  1-on-1, so they don&#x27;t benefit from the same team play benefits and network effects as other games.')
