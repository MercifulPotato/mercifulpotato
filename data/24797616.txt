My understanding is that the laptop was given to a mac repair place and then they didn&#x27;t pay for it. I have no idea why someone would do not pay for their repair though. \n- A lot of people are focusing on the Donald Trump tax returns which were hacked in a way but accepted on Twitter. They have personally identifiable information too as in when you go to the IRS website it asks you for a return&#x27;s amount as a means of verification etc.')
