If the goal of both people in that discussion is to convert the other to their point of view, then yes, often times these discussions are not worth having. But we&#x27;re not having private conversations here. The views of both sides can educate others who are participating in the discussion or even merely observing it. Sometimes it is good to watch a discussion on a topic you feel passionate about play out without participating. While you still might get irritated by those with opposing views, it&#x27;s easier to digest what they are writing&#x2F;saying when it&#x27;s not directed to you individually. This helps with understanding why they have a differing view and in some cases, might even help you see a weakness in your own position that you never realized was there.')
