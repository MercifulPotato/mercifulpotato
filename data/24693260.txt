How can we ever verify that our intervention produces this or that sort of qualia?<p>(For the record, I&#x27;m a fan of theories like IIT [0] that aim to answer questions in the neighborhood of these -- but we should be sober about what is even, in principle, knowable to us. We can verify that intervention X gives behavior Y, but I don&#x27;t see how we could ever verify that intervention X gives qualitative experience Z (intervening on ourselves aside, which in any case will only tell us about <i>our</i> sort of conscious experience).)<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Integrated_information_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Integrated_information_theory</a>')
