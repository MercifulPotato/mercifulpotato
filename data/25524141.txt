In my world 100ms are centuries<p>Yup that&#x27;s crappy. The ease of it happening, the Work At A Startup page used to have this issue (may still, haven&#x27;t looked lately) shows that it isn&#x27;t hard to make accidentally happen.<p>As I said, it is a weakness of the system.<p>&gt; sx is a retarded idea because it adds an abstraction over something brutally simple(html)<p>Have you seen how minimal of an abstraction jsx is? It is a simple rewrite to a JS function that spits out HTML, but JSX is super nice to write and more grep-able than the majority of other templating systems.<p>I have a predisposition to not liking templating systems, but JSX is the best part of React.<p>Notably it doesn&#x27;t invent it&#x27;s own control flow language, unlike most competitors in this space.<p>&gt; My immediate thought was &quot;this is retarded&quot;.<p>Well the most famous SPA is gmail and it&#x27;s rather popular, you may have heard of it. It is bloated now, but when it first debuted it was <i>really</i> good. Webmail sucked, then suddenly it didn&#x27;t.<p>Google maps. Outlook web client. Pandora. Online chat rooms, In browser video chat, (now with cool positional sound!)<p>SPA just means you are just fetching the minimum needed data from the server to fulfill the user&#x27;s request, instead of refetching the entire DOM.<p>They are inherently an optimization.<p>Non-SPAs can be slow bloated messes as well, e.g. the Expedia site.')
