Vaccines have done amazing things for the world and anti-vaxxers especially those with resources to influence hundreds if not thousands of others are horrible people.<p>However, a vaccine that&#x27;s been rushed through gives me pause.  To be honest, I&#x27;m mostly worried about cognitive and cardiovascular side effects.  I&#x27;ve distanced thus far and remain covid free even though I&#x27;ve been in NYC the whole time.  It&#x27;d be stupid to throw all that away because I got side effects from the vaccine.<p>Unfortunately, I think the pledge of past presidents to be &quot;vaccinated on tv&quot; is poorly thought out, largely because it will basically just sow conspiracies that they &quot;just had saline injections to influence the masses&quot;.')
