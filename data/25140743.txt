Robert DuPont, the &quot;Drug czar&quot; in the Nixon Administration, stated it would be more accurate to say that Nixon ended, rather than launched, the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. DuPont also argued that it was the proponents of drug legalization that popularized the term &quot;war on drugs&quot;.[17][unreliable source?]<p>&gt;The presidency of Ronald Reagan saw an expansion in the federal focus of preventing drug abuse and for prosecuting offenders. In the first term of the presidency Ronald Reagan signed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which expanded penalties towards possession of cannabis, established a federal system of mandatory minimum sentences, and established procedures for civil asset forfeiture.[50] From 1980 to 1984 the federal annual budget of the FBI&#x27;s drug enforcement units went from 8 million to 95 million.<p>tl;dr: Nixon <i>removed</i> mandatory minimums for drug sentences, Reagan <i>reinstated</i> them.')
