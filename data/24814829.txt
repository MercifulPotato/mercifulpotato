Item(by='r--man', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602983500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813948, text='&gt; I clocked in 106 hours for $1,703 in my first month on Upwork.<p>So $16 an hour. There is a lot of flexibility of course, but this person does also sound elite for that pay scale. They are even making sure the opening of their proposal has a punch to it.<p>Are there low time commitment opportunities out there that pay way better?<p>My company has one, just a few hours a week, higher pay, and it eventually is even more economical, not needing proposals etc. Just wondering how common those low-hour part time jobs are.')
