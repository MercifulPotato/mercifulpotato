Big (enough for what they need) lathe, mill, welders a multitude of presses and typical power tools.  What they don&#x27;t have is ubiquitous power tools for each and every job.  Those are characteristic of high labor cost environments.  All the &quot;crude&quot; stuff is just job specific tooling that you amass over they years.<p>Someone needs to teach them how to properly install rivets (they would be substantially stronger with no additional work if they heated the whole body) and the one guy who actually welds properly needs to teach the rest of them to do so too.')
