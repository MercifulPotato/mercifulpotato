Such as the food, farming, and ranching industries. Such as rural or sub-rural areas, forestry management, national parks, mining, etc. Entire industries exist that are better served by local politics than national politics, and for which a popular vote would under-represent.<p>That&#x27;s why the system was designed with an electoral college. So that rural farmers could be represented as equally and strongly as city business people. Should they be? Probably, if we want to eat.<p>Even in the current system, the election is largely chosen by people living in large cities that are completely disconnected from the rest of the 95% of the country. There is almost a city limits split between red and blue. Maintaining balance in the complex system is more important than making each voice heard.')
