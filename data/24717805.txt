Vapoware is a product that has been announced and didn&#x27;t arrive after its release date.<p>There literally has never been a product announcement around hyperloop. It was a technical paper laying out the idea, that&#x27;s all.<p>Second, you don&#x27;t actually need a &#x27;hyperloop&#x27;, a &#x27;loop&#x27; is perfectly fine. A &#x27;loop&#x27; already exists in Nevada, and its just a tunnel with an electric car&#x2F;bus&#x2F;platfom inside. That isn&#x27;t hyperloop fast, but you can still get up to 100+ MPH pretty easily.<p>And the &#x27;loop&#x27; system is Las Vegas is perfectly within its schedule plan so far. The question is just if somebody pays for these tunnels.')
