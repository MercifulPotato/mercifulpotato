Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611100139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840142, text='&quot;What does MS Word offer over Markdown&quot; isn&#x27;t a good question, because they&#x27;re not the same thing -- Word is a program and Markdown is a file type. There&#x27;s nothing that stops a Markdown-based editor from having a full set of features. I&#x27;ve very rarely felt that I was missing out on features when using iA Writer or Ulysses compared to a word processor, although occasionally I wished for either the kind of document juggling that Scrivener is so good at or actual full-blown text editor features like BBEdit. But I haven&#x27;t reached for an old school word processor as my first choice as a composition tool in... probably 15 years. And I definitely do write a lot.<p>The most obvious WYSIWYG competitor for novelWriter is Scrivener, which is similar to Ulysses -- and also shares the limitation that it can only export to Word rather than import. Nevertheless, its testimonials page is <i>filled</i> with praise from people who arguably write more than I do. :)')
