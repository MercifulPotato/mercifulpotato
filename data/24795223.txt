Item(by='JoshTriplett', descendants=None, kids=[24795966, 24795513], score=None, time=1602802263, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24795119, text='&gt; An alternative approach would be exemptions for non-profit sites.<p>Another alternative would be &quot;leave this problem alone, it&#x27;s working just fine&quot;. Site operators can and should have the ability to ban anyone or remove any content, for any reason or no reason, and doing so does <i>not</i> mean they should be liable for everything they might have missed. (In practice, &quot;liable for everything they might have missed&quot; is equivalent to &quot;unable to operate&quot; for anything but the most massive sites that could <i>theoretically</i> afford an army of moderators, and it&#x27;d have a chilling effect even there.)<p>Destroying the concept of moderation does not make the world better. The liability shield is the whole reason Section 230 exists: to make it possible to have enjoyable communities online, without incurring so much liability that you have to shut them all down for fear of getting prosecuted.<p>If you want unmoderated communities, they exist. Go use them. Stop trying to destroy the concept of moderated communities.(Removing the liability shield would be tantamount to destroying such communities.)<p>Some people want the audience of moderated communities, but they don&#x27;t want the standards of those communities. There&#x27;s a reason unmoderated communities have fewer (and different) users.')
