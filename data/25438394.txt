Would you say the following?<p>- If FB is to operate under US law with US data centers you prefer to be geo-blocked by them based on IP and feel you need to be protected against your own will and you can&#x27;t trust yourself to just not use the service<p>- You are concerned about shadow profiles and the like, i.e. the unavoidability of FB even if you want to avoid it. But otherwise you&#x27;d be okay with FB offering its services to those who accept it on the foreign terms.<p>- You are concerned for your fellow citizens who may be less informed and may accept conditions they don&#x27;t understand and are harmful for them. Therefore rather geo-block foreign FB from them for their own good.')
