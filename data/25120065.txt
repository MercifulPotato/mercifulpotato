The simple note on&#x2F;off + note velocity of MIDI models this well, and it&#x27;s basically the use case MIDI was designed for.<p>By contrast, the technique involved in playing the violin family is very varied:<p>* Which string are you playing the note on? You get different sympathetic vibrations depending on which one you choose.<p>* Are you moving the bow up or down? Direction matters!<p>* How are you changing bow movement between notes? Keeping the same direction, or changing? Resting your bow on the string the entire time, or bouncing the bow?<p>* Where you are playing the bow? Down by the bridge, or up by the fingerboard?<p>* Are you even using the bow to the play notes? You can pluck it instead!<p>* Fingering too, you can make many small motions with your finger to give it a vibrating quality.<p>* On a related note, the pitch you play is a continuous quality: you can slide from one note to the other and hit all the notes in between. Unlike a piano (and MIDI), where notes are discrete pitches.<p>* You can also adjust tuning of the strings (though not on the fly), or damper them with a mute (which can be done during a long rest in a piece).<p>There&#x27;s probably a few more expressive techniques I&#x27;ve forgotten, and I&#x27;ve definitely forgotten all of the fancy Italian names for these techniques.<p>You can look at the violin sections of Saint-SaÃ«ns&#x27; Danse Macabre (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=71fZhMXlGT4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=71fZhMXlGT4</a>) to see how different bowing techniques can produce rather stark effects.')
