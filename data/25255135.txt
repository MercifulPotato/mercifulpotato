Crappy organizations buy crappy software and crappy professors take the results seriously.  The fact that there exists a crappy tool that flags all the black people as cheaters (or whatever, point is that the false positives are unacceptable common and unacceptably distributed).<p>Blaming the gun (the software in this case) is tacitly condoning the unbroken chain of half a dozen people&#x2F;entities that are failing to do the job they are being paid to do.  The software developers shouldn&#x27;t be building crap software.  The companies shouldn&#x27;t be selling crap software.  The universities shouldn&#x27;t be buying crap software.  The professors shouldn&#x27;t be using the results of crap software.   To look at that situation and say &quot;yeah the problem here is that this crap software exists&quot; is beyond naive.  The problem is that nobody is being accountable for the bad outcome.  I&#x27;m not asking for a whipping boy or a scapegoat here, the problem is that when nobody can be held fully responsible it seems like nobody even gets held partly responsible.')
