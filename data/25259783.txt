Notice that &quot;unlimited data&quot; is once again, however inaccurate as it is, nearly the only way to buy wireless service in 2020.<p>I feel a very small group of companies are pushing an incredibly <i>wasteful</i> business model, because they aren&#x27;t the ones paying for all of the waste. Google, Netflix, Spotify, etc. would rather you wirelessly stream content that makes... a lot more sense to store locally. And they&#x27;re pushing things like streaming 4K... even when the cost&#x2F;benefit of streaming 4K to a phone is questionable at best.<p>We&#x27;re all paying for the extreme network contention of 90% of available bandwidth going to these very wasteful business models. It&#x27;s pretty unsurprising ISPs would like to charge extra for them, either towards consumers or the streaming providers themselves.')
