I think the killer feature that the BSDs have, which Linux can&#x27;t match, is how well designed, integrated, predictable, and simple they are. That is why I run more BSD servers than Linux servers. I do run Linux servers for some cases, and they work well for those cases, but I much prefer working with BSD.')
