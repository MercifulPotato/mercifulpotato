The cards would be in the order of newest to oldest. Follow 100 people, have 100 cards on a single dashboard.<p>Cards will not be lost in the ocean of unordered timelines&#x2F;feeds.<p>Clicking a username will show that account&#x27;s timeline of all posts (paginated if needed) with the ability to sort by ascending or decending, and keyword search a timeline (simple full-text-search).<p>The workflow: as a user I check the main homepage dashboard with pintrest style cards, the newest posts front and center at top.<p>Cards could be clicked to view responses and usernames could be clicked to view an individual&#x27;s ordered timeline.<p>At a glance the reader could quickly determine if anything new is posted.<p>If you want to hear more about my idea let me contact me (details in my profile).')
