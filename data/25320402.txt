The finance bros came from traditional finance based on fiat. That&#x27;s where the majority of bilking still goes on.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a substantiated claim, but even if it were true, the lack of regulation in the *coin sphere made a fertile breeding ground for scammers from wherever they originated.<p>&gt; but what matters to me is being able to send and receive money myself.<p>Yourself and billions of computing hours that could be doing stuff like protein folding or climate modelling.<p>&gt; And unlike other currencies this one doesn&#x27;t require the energy expenditures of a full standing army or the diplomatic trades to enter into protection with someone who has one. Seen through that lens bitcoin is absolutely green.<p>Are you suggesting that if not for fiat money then there would be no need for standing armies? Like we&#x27;d all just join hands: Russia would hand back Crimea, Pakistan and India would grant Kashmir independence, Iran and Saudi Arabia would realise they practice essentially the same religion, and the former states of Yugoslavia would hold the world&#x27;s largest pancake breakfast? If not, then you can not attribute the environmental impact of maintaining militaries to fiat.')
