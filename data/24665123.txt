Like you said, they&#x27;re people too.<p>But the value in this data is in helping us understand what the root causes are, and what the solutions should be.<p>&gt; Arbitrarily excluding certain metro areas because &quot;you&#x27;re a techie and can live anywhere&quot; is just counter to reality, and just seems like a way to skew the numbers.<p>The goal behind &quot;arbitrarily&quot; analyzing the data per-metro is not to skew the numbers, but to help us understand that the root cause is largely local, rather than a global systemic one.
