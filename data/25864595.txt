It MAY NOT have arisen; it&#x27;s all probabilities. Every time the virus is passed to another person, there&#x27;s another opportunity for a mutation. If we could have driven the infection rate down sooner via vaccine, then there&#x27;s some chance that it wouldn&#x27;t have happened.<p>Assuming ad arguendo that the new S. African strain is able to skirt the vaccines that are being distributed in America, what do we do? Wait another 11 months for a new formulation to be approved, and potentially for yet another slippery variant to arise? How do we get off that treadmill?')
