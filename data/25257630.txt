This is strictly a social problem.<p>What do you think money is? Money is how societies choose to interact with each other; in a sense, money IS society, at the very least money is the first brick on which to build one. The government printing money and using it to pay for political favors (via military or natural resources contracts, monopoly markets, etc.) is at the core of the wealth gap.<p>&gt; Replacing one inflationary currency with a worse distribution than a banana republic, with a different deflationary currency with a worse distribution than a banana republic changes nothing.<p>You don&#x27;t understand what bitcoin is. Bitcoin&#x27;s advantage is that the inflation rate is not controlled by the government, ie. they can&#x27;t print money to buy stuff they can&#x27;t afford, With bitcoin, governments can&#x27;t print the wealth gap.')
