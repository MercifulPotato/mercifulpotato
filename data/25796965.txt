And your other sources clearly state that chlorine dioxide and chlorites suppress thyrioid function and haematopoesis in primates and humans. Is that supposed to be a good thing?<p>&gt;Also, CDS is not MMS.<p>Out of curiosity, do you acidify the ClO2 solution before quaffing it? It&#x27;s a ritual very well associated with MMS proponents but probably does more harm than good if the goal is to deliver chlorine to the body.')
