While the Covid deaths have been incredibly tragic, the 330 of 333 million Americans that survive, and that&#x27;s assuming the virus and it&#x27;s variants take 2.5 million more lives  before its done with us, will be eager for a return to normalcy, if not outright partying like it&#x27;s 1999. The play I tried to make last night and wasn&#x27;t able to get filled today, Bloomin Brands, owner of Outback Steakhouse and other mainstream restaurants that can survive this down turn no matter how long it lasts, is up 1400% since I under bid on that strike and expiry date at 2am this morning. I&#x27;m not saying your prediction is guaranteed wrong, but I&#x27;m willing to bet against it, and 86% of my call picks are green at the moment, whatever the probability of that might be. The only one that isn&#x27;t, China Unicom (CHU), essentially got delisted by executive order because the last administration didn&#x27;t want Americans being able to invest in firms with ties to China&#x27;s military, such as the largest provider of cell phone service for 1.4 billion people. The pandemic has been an incredible tragedy for so many human beings. I&#x27;m trying to position myself to be able to do something about it when the next one comes, which it inevitably will, as the universe trends towards entropy. But I won&#x27;t be able to do it without capital, so it&#x27;s worth the risk. Worst case scenario, I&#x27;m still a one man consulting shop serving the firms that keep the water running. Barring that, I guess we&#x27;re hunting and gathering again, and I&#x27;m pretty good with a bow. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t come to that, and we can all look back at these present days like one of many possible filters we managed to survive on our way to colonizing the stars. That&#x27;s the future I&#x27;d rather plan for, anyway. Albeit while hedging my bets.')
