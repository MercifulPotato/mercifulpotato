So you must filter some of them. For example pick only the one that produce exactly two photons and two &quot;jets&quot; of mixed particles that are difficult to identify. Now you calculate the energy of the photons and make a nice graph, of number of collisions versus energy of the photons. Using the standard theory you expect a smooth curve, but if there is a new particle you will see a peak somewhere.<p>If you see something, you only see the peak. So good luck imagining what the particle can be and how it interact with the other particles.<p>Another team peek another filter, like the experiment that produce two photons and electron and a positron. They make a nice graphic and hope to see an unexpected peak.<p>Another team ...<p>If the current theory predicts a peak somewhere you should find it, but if you find an unexpected peak yuo may have founded a new particle.<p>The theoretical frameworks are useful to guess which filters may be interesting and give a chance to find a new particle. The problem is that there are just too many possible filters and you can&#x27;t try all of them.')
