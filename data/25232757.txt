The poisoner survives because he induces vomiting soon after drinking and has medical resources prepared to treat him afterward. That wasn&#x27;t what I expected.<p>I <i>actually</i> expected the poisoner to have taken prophylactic naloxone and served liquor poisoned with a potent, short-half-life opioid like sufentanil. It could kill his enemies directly via respiratory depression or just render them unconscious so he could drag them all into the swimming pool to drown. This would be the modern version of the old murder mystery trick &quot;poisoner gradually builds up his tolerance to arsenic from small doses, then consumes arsenic-poisoned food&#x2F;drink along with the victim.&quot; It would have the advantage of not being as hazardous or laborious as building up a tolerance for arsenic. It would also have been a clever chemistry based approach to murder in a series that often showed off some bit of chemistry.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this naloxone&#x2F;opioid poisoning trick has been used in other shows or published works. A quick search for &quot;murder&quot; &quot;mystery&quot; &quot;naloxone&quot; didn&#x27;t turn up anything likely.')
