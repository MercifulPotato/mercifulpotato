Item(by='labcomputer', descendants=None, kids=[25125712], score=None, time=1605627904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121100, text='I don&#x27;t know how driver pay compares pre- and post-appshare, but on the consumer side, my experience differs from yours.<p>To me, it seems that DoorDash et. al. are delivering negative value to the consumer.<p>My recollection is that most restaurants with takeout also had a delivery option, usually at a smaller percentage cost than DoorDash takes.  But, more than that, delivery <i>worked better</i>.<p>Restaurants typically only offered delivery within a few miles of the store.  So there was a &quot;critical mass&quot; effect that drivers could learn the territory, and usually had fewer problems finding an address (especially after you ordered more than once).  That is especially true if Google maps has the location or entrance pin wrong for your address.<p>Practically, that few mile radius isn&#x27;t a big limitation for most take-out food because the food will get cold if driven a longer distance than that. Kitchens were also better able to prevent cold food by batching orders to have all of a driver&#x27;s orders ready at one time.<p>I think these are solvable issues, but, to date, for me as a consumer, DoorDash&#x2F;Grub Hub&#x2F;Uber Eats do not deliver positive value compared to restaurants with captive drivers.')
