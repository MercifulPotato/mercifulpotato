A while ago if he was at the top of the garden he would be ok with me being in the bottom half of the garden, but once I crossed into the top half he would dart off. Its only been in the past couple of months he has got brave enough to run over to me when I bring food out.<p>I find it a bit funny because he still doesn&#x27;t fully trust me, so while he will come running over to me while I&#x27;m putting his food out he will hiss at me while running over to me. It was only a couple months ago I would have to put the food out and return indoors before he would walk over to it and have something to eat.<p>Little steps I guess.')
