Item(by='mekoka', descendants=None, kids=[24812465], score=None, time=1602960047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810715, text='&gt; Some times your customers don&#x27;t realize they need what you&#x27;re building until they see it and use it.<p>This.<p>That&#x27;s one big part of testing the hypothesis that I feel a lot of people (including mentoring organizations) really don&#x27;t get.<p>In an ideal scenario you&#x27;ve clearly identified a problem and can accurately gauge the validity of your solution by just talking about it with prospects, as they can easily relate. I&#x27;ll label this approach the &quot;Let&#x27;s-imagine&quot; validation.<p>In other situations though, target customers aren&#x27;t even aware that they have a problem (maybe the problem is not immediately apparent) and it can be difficult for them to understand your value proposition, since they&#x27;ve &quot;very successfully been using Excel for that for the past 20 years&quot;. You still need to somehow relay that there&#x27;s a reality where things are significantly better than in the status quo. In some such circles, relying on simple conversations or mock-ups can at best prove very difficult (people won&#x27;t give you time to wander in fuzzy hypotheticals), or at worst be plain misleading (they will dismiss your idea as irrelevant). In situations where you can&#x27;t rely on your prospects&#x27; imagination, you need to bring proof and the mvp plays a more important role. I&#x27;ll label this the &quot;Show-me&quot; validation.<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s-imagine&quot; and &quot;show-me&quot; are not absolutes. They&#x27;re on a spectrum, but it seems that the advice to validate by talking to customers is being taken to some dogmatic extremes sometimes. It&#x27;s something for founders to be aware of when they receive canned advice. Regarding your own solution, you need to be smart to identify where on the above range you fall.')
