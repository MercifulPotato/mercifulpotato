Item(by='flukus', descendants=None, kids=[25293114], score=None, time=1606966305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284578, text='&gt; No, there&#x27;s a very noticeable drop in social mobility as well in mid-July according to: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19.apple.com&#x2F;mobility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19.apple.com&#x2F;mobility</a><p>That is when stage 3 of the lockdown started and everyone had to work from home, the next big decline was when stage 4 started and more people had to work from home or not at all. This did have a larger effect as the source I posted indicated. This reduced the reproduction rate to about 1.1 and plateaued at that level, weeks later masks were introduced bringing it under 1.<p>&gt; Yet you are arguing that masks - in isolation - are so good that it&#x27;s a no-brainer to mandate them?<p>I&#x27;m arguing no such thing, the source I posted indicated that masks would at best slow down the spread of the virus without other measures. That doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t work.<p>&gt; Also, if you introduce a mask mandate, people will obviously change their behaviour, they won&#x27;t just go on and live their lives exactly as before, but with a mask on. Therefore, mask mandates might reduce the spread not because of the masks themselves, but because they cause people to behave differently.<p>This is irrelevant. It doesn&#x27;t matter how they work, as long as they work. The only question that needs to be answered is &quot;do masks reduce the spread of this virus?&quot; Directly or indirectly doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Factors like this are a great indication of why real world data trumps controlled studies though, you wouldn&#x27;t see these effects in controlled studies.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to leave the conversation here because the anti-masker and anti-data crowd on HN have down voted enough to rate limit me.')
