It always has been and it always will be. It will always have lies and misinformation, some people will even believe the lies. But this is also the beauty of free expression - it prevents anyone from using it to enact total control. Speech that is free will always seed doubt against ideas, regardless whether those ideas are true or false. It&#x27;s an avenue that allows <i>anything</i> to be questioned.<p>Propaganda and misinformation have been around for a long time. Mark Antony and Octavius engaged in a war of misinformation.[0] People in those times had far fewer avenues of information. If somebody sold them a false story, then people were probably more likely to believe them. We&#x27;re still here though.<p>I think what&#x27;s been happening over the recent years is that people have finally started waking up from the End of History. The world is as chaotic as always.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;aaf2bb08-dca2-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;aaf2bb08-dca2-11e6-86ac-f253db779...</a>')
