Find one case where:<p>(1) Trump or his campaign alleges electoral fraud, <i>and</i> \n(2) The case (or specifically the fraud claim, if these are separate) was dismissed other than voluntarily by the plaintiff, and the grounds for that dismissal do not include any that require an evaluation of the merits of the case based on the allegations and proferred evidence. Notably, this means that you can’t include any case&#x2F;claim dismissed for failure to state a claim, or that was dismissed voluntarily by Trump or his campaign.')
