Back when I bought I didn&#x27;t invest everything I had but now I burned almost all my savings with no income so what I have in crypto is worth more than what I have in my bank.<p>Sadly I didn&#x27;t sell when I could make x12 profit as I didn&#x27;t expect it to drop as much as it did. Now I&#x27;d lose money selling so I&#x27;ll leave it there and forget about it.')
