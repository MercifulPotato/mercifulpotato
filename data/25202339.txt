Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606247593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200863, text='&gt; What type of living hell doesn&#x27;t have version control?<p>I&#x27;ve worked (thankfully not as an employee) for a well known <i>BANK</i> which did not have any kind of version control whatsoever. None. Not even folders with dates.<p>&quot;Where&#x27;s the latest release?&quot;<p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s in John Doe&#x27;s flash drive over there&quot;<p>I am not kidding.<p>After a lot of pestering by my company (which was working on a consulting role), they spent big bucks on some unknown version control system used by hardly anyone else. It followed the old Source Safe&#x27;s &quot;lock&quot; mechanism. Except you had to use their own software and navigate to each file in question (no searching). Imagine how amazing it was to work on a java project and sloooowly open each folder in the reverse DNS package convention until you got to the file you wanted. Very slowly, because all actions happened on the server.<p>Later on they were bragging on how they were able to create a branch in less than a week. Merging was a day long affair with all code contributors present.<p>EDIT: still, that was over a decade ago. I didn&#x27;t know there were companies involved with software in any capacity that still don&#x27;t have version control in 2020.')
