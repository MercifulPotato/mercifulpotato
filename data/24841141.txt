A lot of networks need a few addresses, so &#x2F;24 - &#x2F;22 is probably pretty active, and you have to justify the addresses, so someone who really only needs a &#x2F;24 isn&#x27;t able to buy a &#x2F;21 and make it work; very few people need huge swaths, but those will be able to really use them and may value having them contiguous. In the middle, it doesn&#x27;t make much difference having a &#x2F;16 or two &#x2F;17s or four &#x2F;18s, so there&#x27;s a lot more flexibility, and you take the lowest price per IP if there&#x27;s a block you can use.')
