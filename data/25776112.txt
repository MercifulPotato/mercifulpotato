Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[25780871], score=None, time=1610631531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775138, text='&gt; What I&#x27;m saying is &quot;why this took 6 months&quot; doesn&#x27;t make much sense as a question. Why wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>For the 2nd or 3rd time in this thread, I have to remind that I was replying to a comment saying this: &quot;That&#x27;s why Apple has the Developer and Public Beta releases for iOS&#x2F;OSX so that external users can provide feedback. And on this occasion just like on many other they will take action if necessary.&quot; So, maybe you should argue with that comment instead of with me?<p>My point was that developers filed feedback about this issue during the betas, yet Apple did not address that feedback, and thus &quot;That&#x27;s why Apple has the Developer and Public Beta releases for iOS&#x2F;OSX&quot; is not a valid point in this context.')
