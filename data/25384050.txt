It argues that these neurological identities&#x2F;configurations are not inherent problems but just differences which are only made to have negative effects on the person&#x27;s life by societal preconception and bigotry. Those things do make it much worse and need to change, but I would argue that doesn&#x27;t stop these brain-states from being independently troublesome. The author mentions problems with speech processing, speaking, sensory overload, sleeping, getting out of bed, eating, smells, textures, and navigation. None of those problems were created by society and none of them can be fixed by the neurodiversity paradigm.')
