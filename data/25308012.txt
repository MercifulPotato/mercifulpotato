Even a manager who has worked as a researcher, in my experience, significantly lacks the expertise to be making such judgments. A research managerâ€™s job is to be familiar with work across an entire portfolio, so they will be necessarily less knowledgeable than individual senior researchers. Presumably Google generally also feels this way seeing as this appears to be the first case where prepublication approval was denied for content. I would never work somewhere where management had such a lack of respect for my own judgment as a researcher.')
