Once you realize your DB is all about resource constraints and connections aren&#x27;t free then the optimization becomes pretty simple.  Use as few connections as possible to get whatever work you need done done.<p>Once you view connections as a net cost to the system the math becomes simple.  The network isn&#x27;t infinite, DB hardware isn&#x27;t infinite.  At the end of the day, more connections == more load on the system as a whole due to management.<p>This will also lead you towards good DB management.  If you want to be able to scale and respond to things, then the right thing to do is keep you Datasets as small as possible and stop multiple apps from using the same DB hardware.  Use a fleet of dbs rather than one big db and you&#x27;ll have a lot better time of scaling.<p>I say this as someone that currently works at a company where we have everything on a small set of big DB hardware.  We are currently running into all the problems of hardware and network constraints that are causing us major issues.')
