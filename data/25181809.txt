It&#x27;s certainly not in exactly the same bucket as Windows. I think the thing I had in my head was the lack of deeper accessibility in Apple products. On Linux, there&#x27;s a really neat transition that can happen, where (imho, often by accident) you switch from just being a user of your computing environment to being its <i>owner</i>, which I think is a gateway to higher levels of technical engagement. Apple&#x27;s approach seems sort of like a high-pass filter; you can only go so far in that environment before you start running into barriers. For the general population, I agree that it&#x27;s probably not a high priority, but I think the trade-off in terms of gateway potential is worth acknowledging.')
