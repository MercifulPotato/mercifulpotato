I&#x27;ve been on the Android camp for a decade, but I&#x27;m getting fed up with these enormous phones. It&#x27;s ironic that there&#x27;s a million Android manufacturers and zero good small Android phones, while there is one iPhone manufacturer and they may actually take the small phone market.')
