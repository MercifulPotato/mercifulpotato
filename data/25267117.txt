Then they see Go which is fairly accessible but with significantly better performance than python. Why not use Go instead?<p>What people don’t realize when they make that comparison is that the python version of many popular libraries is a light wrapper over a bunch of C++ (or some other really fast language).<p>At least that’s what I figure is going on. I see a lot of people wanting to port stuff to Go.<p>Having said that, Go is awesome for bespoke solutions where you don’t have some python bindings on a C library to do what you need. It’s certainly not a slow language, and its tooling is exceptionally nice to get started with.<p>But what I want to know is when are they going to port PyQT to Go?')
