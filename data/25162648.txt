The longer construction takes, the more out-of-date the finished product. And then there are the decades of operation.<p>Consider, for example, that one year into construction of a new power plant a completely unrelated investigation into fires concludes with the finding that a certain kind of electrical wire, when installed incorrectly, can short and cause a fire. The power plant has already installed miles of the exact same wire. The wire manufacturer has a new product that prevents incorrect installation, but the plant designs call for the old wire. What to do?<p>* Pause construction while they adjust the plant designs with the new wiring?\n* Continue construction, but inspect the existing wiring, and reinstall if necessary?\n* Leave the wiring in place, but install a fire-remediation  solution for the already-installed wiring?<p>All large systems have to deal with these kinds of changes. (It’s interesting to look at the changes in a “class” of ships over them as they build each one, for example.)')
