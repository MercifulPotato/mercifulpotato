Item(by='Zenst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604318814, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24966852, text='&gt;Unless a vaccine comes along there&#x27;ll come a point where The West will have resigned itself to be living with the virus.<p>That will be the case, unsure there will be a vaccine that will give you a lifetime immunity (hopeful but I have serious doubts upon that myself the more I learn about this area).  More likely to be like the flu vaccine, changes each year or requires a yearly booster perhaps.<p>More case of managing the sick numbers that need treatment in hospitals and capacity planning, over time - natural immunity, vaccines will provide that level of throttling as we get with the flu.<p>Though supply&#x2F;demand does play out in many forms and gradually gets to a balance that is manageable, we are just at the stage of the initial rush and year or two on, things will start to become more settled.  Though that pattern plays out in many forms in life and is a supply&#x2F;demand with the supply being hospital&#x2F;care capacity and demand being the virus nobody wants.<p>Hopefully more focus upon health armies over the conventional armies will arise.  Certainly I&#x27;d not rule out countries doing health work conscription of some form in years to come - even just to educate people about basics and more so - better prepared for such events&#x2F;disasters - which happen more than war.')
