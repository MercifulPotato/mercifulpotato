At the very least the CEO has the ear of the board of directors, and quite a lot of leeway as to how to run the business.  They might not be able to change it all, but they can change a lot.  Still, there&#x27;s no denying that especially in a large organization no one person knows everything that&#x27;s going on and can be accountable for absolutely everything, but leadership still exists and still is ultimately responsible.')
