What is your workflow? What tools do you use and why? What tools don&#x27;t you use and why not?<p>How is your team organized if you have a team? How do you collaborate and hand-off each piece of the puzzle? How do you handle data, develop your models, track experiments, deploy and manage your models, etc.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts.<p>Disclosure: we&#x27;re building a platform[0] for our own needs for now, but I&#x27;m interested in how other people do it. Right now, we have real time collaborative notebooks, no-setup huge images with the most popular libraries, long-running notebook scheduling with output that survives closed tabs and network disruptions, automatic experiment tracking [we automatically detect parameters, models, and metrics and save them], AppBook publishing (one click parametrized notebooks), model deployment, and packaging models in Docker containers you can push to a registry.<p>Thank you,<p>- [0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai')
