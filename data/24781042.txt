Death is not a fundamental part of evolution.<p>Natural selection does not imply that the only type of selective pressure is survival. Death is merely one factor that affects reproduction. Further, only premature death matters directly for reproduction. Most people die long after they reproduce (or have had a chance to reproduce).<p>That&#x27;s not to say that curing aging won&#x27;t change the trajectory of the human species&#x27; evolution, but to be frank I don&#x27;t really care about the human species. I care about humans. If someone said: &quot;we should continually kill off the weakest 50% of humans to make the species stronger&quot;, I&#x27;d say that person is a monster.')
