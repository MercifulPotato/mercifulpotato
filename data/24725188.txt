It’s a real bummer, not the least of why is because of how startlingly inaccurate it is.<p>These narratives that fuel the culture war “decide” that certain groups are in or out.  It’s entirely inaccurate but that’s what the popular narrative dictates.<p>BLM is, under this system, on the “left” side, along with other made-up narrative entities in this fictional drama such as “antifa”.  To the culture war brawlers, entirely disconnected from the actual happenings, they alias to the same thing, the same people, the same group.<p>Coinbase has leveraged that system to cover for the fact that their silence on the matter of justice and human rights is extremely loud.')
