I don&#x27;t really understand how that&#x27;s possible.<p>Yes, healthcare is byzantine in the US, but it&#x27;s not <i>less</i> complex in any other first world country, yet America is a dramatic outlier -- in a bad way -- in terms of price to performance. Countries that do markedly better on such measures are also countries which tend to have some kind of price controls built into their healthcare system.<p>While I understand the temptation to bristle at the more needling comment, it&#x27;s hard not to see debating over whether someone whose username is &quot;Asshat&quot; is being unfairly sarcastic as a bit beside the point. (Also, the good admiral did not, as far as I can tell, attack <i>you,</i> he attacked what he perceived to be your argument.)')
