That&#x27;s OK.<p>LinkedIn is the professional network, the alternative to swapping business cards (remember those?). It&#x27;s where you can add that one person you met at a conference so you remember their name and company if needed, or your colleagues. Would you rather add them to your real social network? Personally, I add everyone on LinkedIn and nobody except close friends and family to my real social network. Working as intended.<p>LinkedIn is also approximately the only place in the world that I know of that you can go to and actually contact someone, when you only know their name. You can&#x27;t find people&#x27;s numbers (and nobody wants to call or be called anyway), there&#x27;s no way to find their email, so unless you&#x27;re already in their social circle there&#x27;s nothing else except LinkedIn to reach out with.')
