In terms of games that have been decade defining I can draw two examples: Skyrim and Age of Empires 2 - the first game came out after a real avalanche of negative PR around Oblivion being unfun at a basic level (the leveling system in that game was so horrible) and having the first exploitative DLC (see horse armor)... and the second game was mostly a dark horse that has somehow grown over the past two decades to have an incredibly strong e-sports community.<p>Don&#x27;t let yourself have lofty expectations for games - realize that a game costs about six or seven movie tickets and make sure you&#x27;re not dropping 70$ on a game that you shelve after thirty minutes.')
