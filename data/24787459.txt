AWS really put all their ducks behind SAM.<p>The place that suffers is ElasticBeanstalk. I used to be on EB but couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I kept having to run mini-templates from inside the beanstalk machines to get access to specific items that weren&#x27;t exposed to CF directly.<p>Once I moved to ECS&#x2F;Fargate, it&#x27;s worlds better support. ECS still has some parts that are laggy in the CDK (and you can still do it via JSON obj) but not in CF. It&#x27;s been pretty good here in Fargate land.')
