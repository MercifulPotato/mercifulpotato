I also try to leave out any subjective statements without supporting evidence. At least to me, it can be discouraging when reading about a subject and the author talks about how &quot;simple&quot; something is, or allows you to &quot;quickly and easily do X&quot;, but I don&#x27;t find it simple, and struggle to use it to do X. Let the reader decide if it&#x27;s simple, don&#x27;t tell them it&#x27;s simple because it could make them feel stupid if they don&#x27;t find it simple.')
