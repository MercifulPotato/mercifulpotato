Individualism in american culture is, IMO, the root.  In many other cultures, family is huge -- folks are connected to their parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins... grandparents help out with the kids until they can&#x27;t, and the skills of parenting are naturally passed from generation to generation.  Funny to see a comment on another that &quot;no one&quot; is prepared to raise a kid... that&#x27;s because individualism is bad at retaining wisdom.<p>The problem with your mixed old folks&#x27; home &#x2F; orphanage is that individualistic old people don&#x27;t wanna live there until they&#x27;re too old to help out.')
