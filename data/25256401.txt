I don&#x27;t think the advocates will be thrilled with the results.<p>Given SF has been extremely heavy handed with the lockdowns, and a huge number of people leaving, alot of them well paid. Restaurants and businesses are closing(and moving out of the area) at a rapid pace. Expect a historic drop in revenue for the city, this means less services, less funding for education, more filth, more homeless, more drugs everywhere.<p>The residents who have the means will get fed up with the downward spiral, leading to a negative feedback in life quality and revenue. Politicians in SF always money hungry will then try to hit the &#x27;billionaires&#x27; where it hurts, &#x27;their wallets&#x27;, and try to raise taxes leading to more people leaving. Not everyone who is leaving is because of the cost of living, its also people who are fed up.<p>The quality of life thing is huge, half of my Wife&#x27;s good friends left the bay area the past year or two, a bunch of my co-workers in tech left and alot of it was people are sick of how poorly the place is run and is turning into a dump. I left in the summer and will never return, I grew up in the area so its been bittersweet, but I don&#x27;t regret moving one bit.')
