Item(by='usrusr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606302781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207880, text='Probably just simply the desire to illustrate importance with no actual market in mind.<p>But perhaps still grounded a bit on knowledge of transactions in an actual manuscript collector&#x27;s scene market. That, from my point of view, may or may not exist. If it does exist it&#x27;s unlikely to have transactions of that size, but it would also only transact comparatively minor manuscripts. And multiplying up minor transaction volumes to enormous valuations isn&#x27;t exactly unheard of. The only difference is that the factor derived from &quot;importance&quot; is a bit subjective, but that&#x27;s the nature of a collector&#x27;s market and the claim isn&#x27;t really stating anything like precision. It&#x27;s not like the library could have taken up a mortgage with the manuscripts as security.')
