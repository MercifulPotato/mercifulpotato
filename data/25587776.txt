If it guessed right the game continues as usual.<p>It&#x27;s a good fit for emulation since &quot;rolling back&quot; in an emulator is usually easier than rolling back the state in a game that wasn&#x27;t built with this type of netcode in mind, but it has also become a popular type of netcode for modern fighting games.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in reading more about it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GGPO" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GGPO</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Netcode#Rollback" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Netcode#Rollback</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pond3r&#x2F;ggpo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pond3r&#x2F;ggpo</a>')
