Item(by='content_sesh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606527229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232243, text='&gt; As for “Gust”, my sympathies are severely limited. He remained in a job where he knew his employers were taking the absolute piss out him long enough that he turned toxic himself. I get that changing jobs has its own set of costs and challenges, but thinking that your employer owes you for all your “loyalty” is a fool’s delusion. I’ve been in jobs where management’s been taking the piss while I’ve been burning out, and realizing that environment’s turning me toxic too I’ve walked.[1][2]<p>Why the lack of sympathy? We don&#x27;t know from the article how long Gust&#x27;s been in the industry; this could have been his first experience with a company so dysfunctional. I think you may have missed this bit as well:<p>&gt; Gust waited until annual bonuses and stock payouts cleared, and served his notice.<p>Sounds like he remained precisely as long as he needed to once the scales fell from his eyes.')
