I&#x27;d be more interested to see that the numbers (performance and cost would be) if you ran the comparison with Timescale Cloud managed, on AWS, with EBS set up (and note IOPS settings) at a comparable provisioned size with multi-AZ failover. Doing that and checking costs would be much fairer from a cost-per-metric point of view.')
