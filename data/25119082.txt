They have far more employees and use typical Chinese aggressive marketing. The most notable one, Tijia cooperates with the main travel providers - CTrip, Expedia, Qunar. \nFor me as a foreigner Airbnb works well, although in some rural areas it&#x27;s better to go with Tijia.<p>Airbnb entered the Chinese market in 2015 – the same year in which Tujia became a unicorn. The global giant has been slow to expand in China, with 80,000 listings compared to Tujia’s 400,000.\nIndeed in 2017, Airbnb Inc&#x27;s founders were moments away from merging their China business with Tujia. Chesky decided to block the deal out of concern that it would harm the Airbnb brand.<p>Afaik, Airbnb focuses on the quality of its listings. The company has visited thousands of houses and removed those that do not meet quality standards. The company launched Airbnb Plus, a premium service. The company works with opinion leaders and adapts its products to the market. Thus, apartments can be ordered through mini-programs in WeChat, and checkout using WeChat Pay and Alipay.<p>Link to article in Bangkok Post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bangkokpost.com&#x2F;thailand&#x2F;special-reports&#x2F;1475857&#x2F;airbnb-refuse-china-buyout-offer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bangkokpost.com&#x2F;thailand&#x2F;special-reports&#x2F;1475857...</a> (2017)')
