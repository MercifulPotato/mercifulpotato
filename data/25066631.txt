Something went wrong. Please, try again later.&quot; error. Reset my password, still no good. Called the support desk and wasted some time there, and they were clueless..<p>Turns out if resistFingerprinting is turned on in Firefox, the sign-in action will respond with a Error 429 - Too Many Requests on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sso.godaddy.com&#x2F;v1&#x2F;api&#x2F;idp&#x2F;login . Doesn&#x27;t matter if your u&#x2F;p is correct or not. No fingerprint, no sign-in.<p>So apart from moving to another provider, what short-term solution is there to access my account and close it?')
