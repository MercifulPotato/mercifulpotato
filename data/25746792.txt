I&#x27;ve been told in the past. I know.<p>But still.<p>I don&#x27;t have an ad blocker. I&#x27;m using a run-of-the-mill browser here. Won&#x27;t tell which one, you would probably laugh.<p>And the website is blocking me on grounds of having an ad blocker. And there&#x27;s no way around it. I can click &quot;learn more&quot;, only to be redirected to another page which is equally blocked by this &quot;we need your money&quot; shit.<p>Look, I understand you need money to survive. But at least give us a way to contact you, or something?<p>EDIT: Well, I have a PiHole which I forgot about, actually. So they&#x27;re probably right on the ad blocker. lol<p>EDIT2: Oh no, that&#x27;s hilarious. It actually happens because I&#x27;ve rejected permissions on their cookie popup.')
