Eventually, you’ll be scrambling to keep this popsicle sticks and duct tape environment up and running so you can test changes in it, lying to yourself, pretending it bears any resemblance to production.<p>Error budgets are good solution to this problem. If your change qualification process (be that a QA team, staging, pre-prod, whatever) plus your release process is very good, then you probably aren&#x27;t burning through your error budget.<p>But if it turns out your process isn&#x27;t good enough, you&#x27;ll get feedback on this in the form of running out of error budget. So you can spend the rest of your quarter working on your non-production environments, so that in the future you can move fast and break an acceptable amount of things next Q.')
