If you use 40dbi phased arrays at 100W you get -40dbm at the receiver and hit the noise floor at about 100gbps, which is 40km2 of raw photos per second of downlink. So i guess it’s not whole earth observation, but definitely a lot of capability for pre-tasked observation. But then we have to ask, why satellites rather than aerial drones? A satellite is on a relatively fixed trajectory that hits any given target for 11 minutes of every 90, and the same with the ground station if you’re lucky enough to have both on the same trajectory. What is the use case where this is cheaper or superior (aside from no-fly zones)?')
