In that case we could simulate the evolution of their communication and ignore what is causing the communication.<p>There should be an upper bound to the complexity of their communication because of game theory. Tit-for-tat only supports an error rate of up to 9 percent, so at the upper bound cells will need to differentiate.<p>This is a lot of domain knowledge to accelerate the computation by, provided the theory is correct.')
