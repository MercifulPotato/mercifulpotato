I took over a team of quite junior engineers who had been let loose without much guidance under their previous manager. I introduced a lot of new ideas, and imposed much higher standards on their work. At first this meant code reviewing everything myself and going through everything in so much detail that it would have been much quicker to do it myself. But that allowed the team to grow, and while I still give some input, they&#x27;re now they&#x27;re mostly working independently and reviewing each others work.')
