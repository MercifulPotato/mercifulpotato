People here are constantly repaving, repairing, and resurfacing their driveways and sidewalks.  While you need an initialization crack, that can come from a host of issues other than heavy vehicles including thermal cycling and initial defects.  I will note that the asphalt and concrete construction may be different in the south vs. the north, but there is much much more driveway repair up here than there was in Florida.<p>As a pedantic side note, this is why your batteries die, the copper leads begins to fatigue and fracture due to stresses from thermal cycling.')
