We are probably closer than I thought we were one RTT ago.<p>I think pejorative anti-whiteness is problematic as a communication strategy; it&#x27;s counterproductive and you have to be steeped in a national conversation that only a couple hundred thousand people are having to understand how to take it (and I <i>do not</i> think that&#x27;s true of anti-Black racism).<p>I also think that a lot of people selling anti-whiteness as an important doctrine are grifters.<p>But I also think it would be better for everyone if the term died out. I know it won&#x27;t; Irish&#x2F;Czech&#x2F;Spanish people intermarry with German&#x2F;Scottish people and their kids have no better term, I guess? But there&#x27;s a notion that &quot;if Black pride is positive, it should be positive to have White pride as well&quot; which I think is deeply wrong. Maybe it was growing up along the South Side Irish parade route in Chicago that programmed me this way, but I see no evidence of European ethnic heritage being suppressed in the US.<p>I do not trust Twitter, Facebook, or Amazon to censor appropriately in the least. But that doesn&#x27;t make it hard for me to evaluate these most recent decisions to cut off violent extremists! I&#x27;m fine with them booting Parler and DJT even though I&#x27;m less than fine with the idea of them evaluating <i>all</i> speech --- of course, that&#x27;s one of the reasons 1A advocates so strongly support CDA S230.')
