The BT keyboard mapping is not completely perfect for a few corner cases (I think alt-space was one?).  Hackers keyboard is OK for small tasks.  You might try a small USB keyboard and USB OTG cable if your phone supports USB peripherals.  I used the setup more when I was going someplace and didn&#x27;t want to drag a laptop.  Since I&#x27;m not going much of anywhere these days it&#x27;s of much less use, in fact last time my check termux busted on some update but I haven&#x27;t needed it so I haven&#x27;t fixed it.')
