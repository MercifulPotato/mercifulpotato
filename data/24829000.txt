Item(by='teorema', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603130624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825910, text='This is partly an aside, but I often feel like homogeneity in plant (and animal, I suppose) consumption and production is a part of this that is rarely discussed. That is, I think there&#x27;s a lot of unused potential in domestication of native plants for agricultural use.<p>I bring this up mainly because one of my first thoughts in discussing, e.g., US corn agriculture versus Subsaharan agriculture is whether or not you&#x27;d even be able to compare them well because the crops optimally suited to each would often be entirely different. I think often probably so, but at the same time I wonder if things would look different if the same volume of money and resources were put into things that assume different consumption preferences.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to conventional agriculture, and don&#x27;t believe in pointing fingers when it comes to food sustainability (in an ecological as well as humanistic sense). I do sometimes wonder, though, if conventional practices are often driven by assumptions or factors that are unwarranted or problematic in themselves.')
