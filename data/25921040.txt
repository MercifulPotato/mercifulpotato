The post war amendments were intended not just to ensure equal treatment under the law, but also allow equal political participation.<p>What good is allowing a black man to participate in the political process if, for example, desegregation is a disallowed political view?<p>Long version:<p>I&#x27;m saying the combination of the following elements of the constitution:<p>A guaranteed republican form of government clause, (democratically elected officials represent the political views of their citizens)<p>The 1st amendment, (government may not restrict&#x2F;compel&#x2F;suppress speech, freedom of association)<p>the 14th amendment (as interpreted),  including:<p>1- equal protection clause,<p>2- federal constitutional restrictions applied to states, and<p>3- protections extended to privately held, public facing entities, (as is required to interpret the civil rights act as constitutional)<p>...Leaves no room to interpret political affiliation&#x2F;views as being less protected than any protected class.<p>Freedom of political view and affiliation is required as a cornerstone for the rest of the system to be built upon. Equal protection, as a means of allowing minorities or protected classes equal participation in the political process itself, as well as civil life, requires an underlying political process in which to participate. If that process is fundamentally restricted (via taboo political beliefs) then the protected classes aren&#x27;t really protected, if they are allowed in the process, but their political views are not.')
