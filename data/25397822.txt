Most of our time was in his office.  I would look over his shoulder as he typed.  He had recently adopted a new IDE and spent considerable time configuring it and learning its features. He was very proud of how productive it made him.<p>Then one day we collaborated in my office instead. I use plain Unix tools, all independent.  He watched as I did everything he did but with point-tools instead of a huge IDE.  Rather than switching between files, I started a new terminal window and ran Vim.  Other windows were for the build-run-crash loop, analyzers, note-taking, etc.  Often I would do Vim tricks like doing a calculation by writing a formula on a line in Vim and piping the line to &quot;bc&quot; (`!!bc RETURN`).  In fact, many of his IDE features I would access by calling out to external programs.<p>I had to hold back a laugh when he said:<p>&quot;Oh my God!  Linux IS your IDE!&quot;<p>Well, duh.  Isn&#x27;t that&#x27;s what Ken and Dennis created in the 1970s?  Unix started out as the ultimate development environment!  It just also happens to run everything else now.')
