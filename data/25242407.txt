I&#x27;ve read about random number algorithms that mix the results of many randomness sources so that one compromised source cannot compromise the result.<p>&gt; and the next-best targets would be &quot;enclaves&quot;<p>Yeah, we should watch out for this. Secure cryptoprocessors are a great thing but we need to be able to trust them. We already have hardware that runs free software but the chip itself can of course be compromised...<p>&gt; then back-dooring the algorithms themselves<p>I trust that the worldwide cryptography community will never let that happen. From what I&#x27;ve read they no longer trust the NSA implicitly.')
