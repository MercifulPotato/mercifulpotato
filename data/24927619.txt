Typically either low effort &quot;me too&quot; type confirmations or sarcastic quips that happened to be in favor of whoever was browsing the thread. [What I beleive to be] my more productive, thoughtful, on topic comments tend to mostly get ignored. This has been the case everytime I&#x27;ve tried to use this site. I beleive the the best way to get karma is a mix of proper timing &#x2F; estimating what the popular opinion &#x2F; point &#x2F; etc. will be in a given thread. There are also certain topics and subjects that no matter how well you approach them will typically get you trashed.')
