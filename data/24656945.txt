You&#x27;re right that tracing in the kernel doesn&#x27;t work for encrypted traffic (that means anything over TLS, including HTTPS). For encrypted connections, we still want to give the no-manual-instrumentation-required experience to our users, so what we do is trace the SSL&#x2F;TLS library to capture the traffic. Right now, for example, we trace traffic going through OpenSSL. This has the benefit of covering a wide array of programs in different languages, including any dynamic languages that use OpenSSL. And we plan on adding more TLS libraries soon (e.g. GoTLS) to fill in the gaps.<p>We&#x27;ll be publishing a blog post on this soon, so please stay tuned. In the meanwhile, this other post (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pixielabs.ai&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;simple-go-tracing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pixielabs.ai&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;simple-go-tracing&#x2F;</a>) gives an idea of how one can use EBPF user-space probes to trace applications and system libraries.')
