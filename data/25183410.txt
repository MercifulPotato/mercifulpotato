Item(by='bpodgursky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606103508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183258, text='&gt; Yep, you read that right, $14,000<p>There&#x27;s a lot wrong with US healthcare, but IMO a sticker price of $14,000 is actually a signal of a different problem, which is... that the prices are fake.<p>Nobody is actually expecting individuals to pay $14,000&#x2F;mo.  In the circumstance that an uninsured individual is on the drug, they&#x27;ll be put on a payment plan which works out to an income-based-repayment: they know they won&#x27;t get half a million from the patient, they&#x27;ll get what (they think) the patient can afford.<p>For insured patients (realistically, almost everyone who could have afforded such a high sticker, because of employer-based healthcare) the sticker price is meaningless, because there&#x27;s a negotiated rate between the insurance company and the provider.  Likely negotiated inefficiently with each individual insurer, but the end money transfer a small fraction of $14,000.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue that there&#x27;s not a ton of waste here.  It&#x27;s dumb and the lack of price visibility means nobody at any level makes informed choices.  But the $14,000 price shouldn&#x27;t be viewed as a real price in any meaningful sense.')
