Item(by='virgilp', descendants=None, kids=[25140668], score=None, time=1605604653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118556, text='&gt; itâ€™s such a good booking platform<p>Is it? I always hated it. I&#x27;d be very curious to learn what makes it feel like a good booking platform. It doesn&#x27;t even show you where the room is located! (only approximate location). Seems way worse than e.g. booking.com, the only reason really to use them might be lower prices... if they still have an advantage here, which I&#x27;m genuinely not sure anymore (a while ago I decided I don&#x27;t want to deal with their crap regardless of how much money I might save).<p>[edit] &quot;Is it?&quot; was not a rhetorical question. I&#x27;m not upset or anything if you downvote, but can you also add what do you feel makes it a good platform? Or what did I say that was wrong?')
