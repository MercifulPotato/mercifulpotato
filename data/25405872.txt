At least it&#x27;s only soft totalitarianism, or inverted. See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_totalitarianism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_totalitarianism</a><p>I think it&#x27;s encouraging that there&#x27;s a way to categorize what&#x27;s happening, because it suggests an alternative route, or at least a way to engage with it without feeling crazy.<p>These are strange times, and a lot of smart people seem to be voting in favor of their own defeat. A tough question would be to ask why, and I think it&#x27;s a combination of factors: an atmosphere of insecurity and wanting a strong figure to end it, naive idealism, wish fulfillment, cultural alignment, etc.<p>Smart people can find ways to rationalize bad things. There&#x27;s no sense in getting caught in the quagmire of trying to convince someone on the internet that we&#x27;re headed down the wrong path. Instead, we can actually create an alternative that&#x27;s just plain better.<p>So, maybe it&#x27;s not all so bad - but more of a call to action.')
