Mostly they don&#x27;t do anything, very rarely they&#x27;re positive, but some are bad.  It used to be that only half of children survived to adulthood which produced enough selective pressure to remove new deleterious mutations, but that thankfully doesn&#x27;t happen anymore.  This isn&#x27;t a problem in the short term but if we don&#x27;t introduce something like pre-natal selection we&#x27;ll eventually wind up back in a situation where half of children don&#x27;t survive to adulthood despite modern medicine.')
