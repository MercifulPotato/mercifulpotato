Item(by='unholiness', descendants=None, kids=[25116379], score=None, time=1605547766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110388, text='Glicko is just ELO with an uncertainty factor that speeds up down how quickly your rating changes if you&#x27;ve played fewer games. Actually, FIDE&#x27;s implementation of ELO also has an approximate version of this, increasing its &quot;k&quot; value for new players and decreasing it for some thresholds of games played, ratings, and player age. Both these adjustments just affect how quickly your rating would change if your win rate changes. They do not your equilibrium rating at a particular skill level.<p>Lichess ratings are inflated not because of Glicko but because of the player pool. New players start at 1500 ELO in both Lichess and FIDE, but Lichess&#x27;s pool of &quot;new players&quot; is a lot wider and has a lot more amateurs than FIDE&#x27;s new players. The amateurs&#x27; points ultimately get spread around the player pool while they descend from 1500 to a more realistic rating, inflating the ratings of other players on the way.')
