That sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If the only thing they do is provide book ordering services, but amazon does it better, should amazon really feel bad about that? When you successfully pass an interview and get a job offer, do you feel bad enough for those who didn’t do as well that you turn down the job offer?<p>EDIT: forgot to add, I suspect there are <i>many</i> things small bookstores could do in terms of building a local community (in-person and online) of people who love books, improving discovery options for new books from that community, that kind of thing. So maybe they should be doing <i>that</i> i.e. “do things that don’t scale” to try and delight their users more than amazon does, in a way where their lack of scale is an advantage?')
