Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607521766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352286, text='Many sources use &quot;recreational&quot; to describe diving with ordinary air (or maybe nitrox), and &quot;technical&quot; any diving with more complicated requirements. Both are distinguished from &quot;professional&quot; diving, so you can be doing &quot;technical&quot; diving recreationally without doing &quot;recreational diving&quot;.<p>Wikipedia says that the exact definition of &quot;technical&quot; varies between certifying agencies, but 50 meters is definitely well below it. You can certainly do it without being certified, but the training classes make it clear that you&#x27;re taking a massive risk (oxygen toxicity, nitrogen narcosis, decompression sickness).<p>I&#x27;ve got only the most basic certification myself, and only a short list of dives, so I can&#x27;t speak to how realistic that is.')
