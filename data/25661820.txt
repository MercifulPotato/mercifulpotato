I posted about this in 2019 but it didn&#x27;t get much traction. I&#x27;ve been using the tool myself for about 18 months and although it&#x27;s simple it really is working for me.<p>I designed this as a &quot;text editor&quot; inspired by the AlphaSmart word processor I used to own. It gives you ten files to work on and runs in a tab in your browser. It&#x27;s offline and does not require a central server.<p>Because there are no files to think about it really does make writing easy for me. I hope you&#x27;ll find it useful too.')
