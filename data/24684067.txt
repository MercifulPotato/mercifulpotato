For electiric&#x27;s it&#x27;s not as much about speed but battery. Maybe having hyper-miler distance races that aren&#x27;t speed oriented is the sort of pivot F1 should be doing? I know it&#x27;s not sexy like a fast car moving nimbly among the pack but if car companies can get their tech focused on getting the most distance from a battery then there&#x27;s the cross over development that can flow to the mainstream. But I know, watching a slow race is a big ask.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone wants to watch a slow race. Hyper-miler distance races sounds like an oxymoron as hypermiling usually involves ridiculous theatrics of going 30-40mph on the freeway to maximize efficiency. It wouldn&#x27;t even be racing in the traditional sense - it would be akin to a time trial but distance based. There&#x27;d be almost no need to overtake, would there?<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of F1 as it stands (it&#x27;s rather uneventful at times) but using EVs in this way would kill it completely as far as I can tell.')
