And is there any investigation and research on the tradeoff of compiler speed&#x2F;complexity vs. execution performance? Many minimalist purists claim that modern compilers are evil and it&#x27;s possible to write a small and fast compiler. Yes, but at what cost? And is the cost too large to be justified, or is it that computers are acutally fast enough?')
