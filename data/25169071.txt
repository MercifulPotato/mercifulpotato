Item(by='Jugurtha', descendants=None, kids=[25169888], score=None, time=1605957672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169012, text='There is no judgement in my comment for it to be fair or unfair. I guess the word you&#x27;re looking for is &quot;incomplete&quot;, in which case, it absolutely is incomplete for brevity.<p>My point was on this particular shortcut in many articles including large publications:<p>A: I work at the office<p>B: I&#x27;m not lonely<p>Not A =&gt; Not B (I don&#x27;t work at the office therefore I&#x27;m lonely), and then coming up with a solution that it&#x27;s time to get back to the office, failing to respect the contraposition, and implying that there&#x27;s equivalence with a hidden B ==&gt; A implication that is not necessary true.<p>Your point does not contradict my comment, actually, because all these are outside of &quot;work&#x2F;office&quot;. Again, my point was about the equivalence between remote work and loneliness not being automatic. One way to go through that is having a social life outside of the office. Granted, many things have closed, but that&#x27;s why I said it was a sign of what the person could try and improve (finding things that haven&#x27;t closed, finding joy somewhere else). Not saying it&#x27;s easy.')
