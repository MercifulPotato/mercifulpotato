The majority of them is smart enough to not deny its very existence outright. Being more subtle, they decrease numbers, sometimes a lot, deny certain atrocities. Quite often they end with comparing these new, and totally false, numbers with Stalin&#x27;s atrocities. All to come to the conclusion, that the holocaust wasn&#x27;t even half as bad as everyone believes. Ah yeah, and that the Wehrmacht was totally not involved in this non-existent and despicable crime against humanity.')
