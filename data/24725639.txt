The compilation improvement of 9%, for me it means that most important thing didn&#x27;t get significantly faster. Unless the Phoronix tests on compiling Apache show better results than AMD:s GCC compilation.  (Apache scales badly with threads so, I use that as rough approximation of making change in a file or two and then recompiling only what&#x27;s affected by the change.)<p>Using 4k 60hz tv as monitor means CPU gaming performance improvement doesn&#x27;t matter for 99% of titles as it is limited by either the Screen or GPU.<p>On the other hand people who have older CPU:s this is really nice increment in addition to previous improvements. A single generation improvement doesn&#x27;t feel large enough to really matter. Except for professional Gamers with ultra fast GPU:s and monitors, trying to compete for prizes.')
