However, I really think people are only looking at things from their perspective. I think a lot of people here are skeptical in a healthy way and can use inference to figure out if something written on the internet is truthful and correctly framed. A lot of people do not have those skills. I think these platforms need some form of censorship because clearly people are taking things they read randomly as fact and it&#x27;s clearly having a damaging effect on society (see qanon). This specific instance definitely straddles the line between necessary&#x2F;unnecessary removal (I think the content should be published) but let&#x27;s please not act like this is the norm. It&#x27;s an outlier. People are abusing these platforms to spread hateful and dangerous ideas and it&#x27;s working because most people aren&#x27;t internet literate.<p>It is scary to see this (my parents lived through communist Romania), but I think to act like a lot censorship&#x2F;removal of content on these platforms is unjustified is clearly disingenuous.')
