The OP misses one hugely important factor: cost and hence availability of computing resources.<p>During the recent history of computing, the technology improvement opened new possibilities at each step:<p>- Punching cards: allowed more people share mainframe,<p>- Video terminals: allowed faster turnaround of mainframe jobs,<p>- Mini-computers: gave more people access to computing,<p>- PCs: got even more people into computing,<p>- Commodity hardware in datacenters: more people could develop services and more people from general public could get access to applications and data,<p>- Cloud: more people could afford to build applications,<p>- Microservices: bigger teams could collaborate on increasingly sophisticated services,<p>- Serverless: reduced the burden of capacity planning and service distribution and further lowered the barrier of entry into backend application development.<p>Each statement above comes from personal experience and I am looking forward to what new possibilities the future brings.')
