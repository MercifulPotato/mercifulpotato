What&#x27;s the over-under on number of months&#x2F;years that Nomad will be able to compete?<p>I can&#x27;t tell if consolidation in this space is a good thing (we finally get a single, extensible platform with widespread support, consistent APIs&#x2F;models from vendors), or a bad thing (see: any other market lacking competition), but outside of Nomad and Swarm are there any other large container orchestrators that people put stock in these days?<p>Are we seeing the evolution of the VC model (subsidize-then-dominate) and&#x2F;or it&#x27;s application to F&#x2F;OSS software? If I make a container orchestration platform (I&#x27;ve been sketching one out lately), do I have any hope in ever competing with Kubernetes for attention from developers, no matter how good what I make is (assuming ideological agility could offer benefits greater than millions of dollars is already a stretch).')
