Subtlety in meaning or intent can change while still using the same words. Slack isn&#x27;t formal writing, it&#x27;s more casual communication between humans, and emojis just make it all a little less ambiguous. I certainly agree that you should try to be as clear as possible, and that overuse of emojis can be tiresome, but there are definitely situations where a simple emoji or two can make all the difference in how your words are perceived.')
