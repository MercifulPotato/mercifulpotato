I do think they have the technical chops + content moderators to at least try to curb some of the more inflammatory posts.<p>But, it’s not illegal. So they won’t do it, in fact, they’ll profit like Facebook matching body armor ads to groups of people plotting to hang the Vice President. The solution might be to lax the definition of imminent threat, or consider that someone with millions of followers is basically planning acts of violence with a retweet. The fact that people think “it’s just a retweet” means you have zero responsibility and accountability for influencing millions of people shows how we are not prepared technological changes.<p>I can’t talk you out of it because I am very confused and conflicted. I think I know what needs change, and even how, but not change to what.')
