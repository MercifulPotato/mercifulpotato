I actually spent a decent bit of my teen&#x2F;young-adult years in nursing homes partially because I really enjoy talking to older people. I noticed though that while some were very chatty many were just as happy by themselves. Not that they wouldn&#x27;t talk if I engaged but they were so comfortable in their own skin that external stimuli had a much lower influence on inner peace. This was in Europe though. I imagine if someone is generally uncomfortable in their later years or has a lot of ailments or diseases that might be different.')
