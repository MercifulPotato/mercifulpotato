Reported it again to the same detective with location of the office and info from newly scammed people I contacted.<p>They dismissed the case.\nI lost only 2k, but other victims (landlords being scammed by a fake agent) lost tens of thousands.\nTried going to court but there is not a physical person with asset in the UK to persecute so I will likely won&#x27;t get anything. Wasted 500Â£ more with this.<p>The government doesn&#x27;t have any incentive stopping crime, it just relies on the good will of policemen and their limited resources.\nIf people complain because there is too much crime, they just have one more reason to increase taxes and do nothing.')
