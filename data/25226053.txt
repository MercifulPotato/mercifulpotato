My understanding was that while (assuming purity and correct dosage) MDMA is relatively safe, repetitive use over a long period of time can lead to issues with a person&#x27;s seratonin system?<p>My experience is far below that of the author, however in general I figured that it was safest to stick to a general list of rules. This goes for everything including alcohol. For me at least these were:<p>1. Don&#x27;t consume anything by yourself, especially at home.<p>2. If you are in a sad mood or similar, think twice before taking anything. Are you doing this to avoid a problem in your life?<p>3. If you are to take something, make sure you understand what it is, what the dose is, and what the side effects and risks are.<p>4. Avoid anything with a high possibility of addiction or damage to health.<p>For me this has pretty much resulted in only ever trying: Alcohol, Weed (edible form preferably) and once or twice Psychadelics. Alcohol is a strange one, since it is objectively quite dangerous but very socially acceptable. In this case keeping an eye on how frequently you drink is important.<p>Though I&#x27;ve been offered coke, or MDMA or similar, I have always refused for the above reasons. Maybe it&#x27;s possible these things can be safely taken &#x2F; moderated, but having seen people take these and long term go off the rails, it does not seem like a worthwhile risk.')
