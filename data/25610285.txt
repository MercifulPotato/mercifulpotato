I still stick with the drunk driving analogy. Going to a basement rave with 100 others during a deadly pandemic is as unambiguously wrong as drunk driving. If a bunch of friends are going to shame me back for &quot;being a pussy and not drunk driving with them&quot; then they&#x27;re <i>not my friends</i>. I guess if I were back in my 20s I&#x27;d care more about being the pariah and try to find some way of being polite and keeping the relationships. But I&#x27;m blessed to be a 45+ old geezer now who has largely stopped worrying about what others think of me.<p>If one of my gambling buddies tried to convince me to head to a casino with him right now, I&#x27;d have no problem saying, &quot;Dude, we&#x27;ve been pals for a while but WTF are you talking about? Use your head, buddy.&quot; and I don&#x27;t think either of us would take it the wrong way.')
