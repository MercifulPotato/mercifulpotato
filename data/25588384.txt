If you think of management as a sort of permanent, exclusive role like in a traditional large company then yes it&#x27;s hard to justify.<p>But in this case a young employee got the chance to lead a small team of three people, and as long as the company keeps an eye on it, management can be learned just like everything else, and if it doesn&#x27;t work out then that&#x27;s okay as well.<p>I think it&#x27;s much healthier to see management roles as horizontal and as a process that everyone should try out, even early, rather than this status role that you have to climb into. Managers are part of a team and the best way to learn to manage is by doing it. You can have a great impact on the life of a young person if you give them responsibility even if they themselves don&#x27;t think they can do it.')
