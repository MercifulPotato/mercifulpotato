Each person can take any of the work, in theory.  In practice, this never happens.  You&#x27;d rather wait for the expert to do the work, because it will take them less time and probably produce better quality.  Good people become the bottlenecks and you aren&#x27;t sure what to give the people that aren&#x27;t so good.  Estimates given by the subject matter expert (the only one who could give an estimate) are way too small because it implies they will be doing the work.  And there&#x27;s this feeling that by spreading out the work over a whole team, that the bus factor is increased and it is worth it to have everyone understand everything about everything.  But there is a definite tax in terms of productivity, speed, and quality.')
