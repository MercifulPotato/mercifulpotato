If he  implemented using restructured text specification it will be future proof and maintainable along with using multiple tools like pandoc, sphinx, pelican, nikola and obviously python docutils itself for generating different format outputs.<p>Eventhough markdown is popular, its not a standard speicification. If author wanted to work with something which works for generating output for a website, pdf file or an ebook, he should have looked into a proper standard like RestructuredText (RST).<p>I think rst is much cleaner and better specification than markdown. Given its a specification there are multiple implementations available. So may be community should adopt it with more open arms. Still wonder like xsd vs relaxng in this case also markdown being inferior implementation without specification is winning over rst (restructuredText) format and specification.')
