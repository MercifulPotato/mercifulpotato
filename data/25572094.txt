Unfortunately, it&#x27;s essentially impossible to buy any consumer electronics not made there.<p>The set of things you can buy these days that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> made in China is essentially restricted to luxury goods and safety-critical equipment (cars, guns, scuba gear, etc.); despite what they tend to say out loud, companies know that it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive to get safety-critical reliability out of Chinese manufacturing. But if it&#x27;s just your camera or power drill or whatever, they know you&#x27;re not going to sue them when it breaks. Apple actually does a really good job on QC for Chinese manufacturing, but then you have all these accusations of forced labor to contend with.')
