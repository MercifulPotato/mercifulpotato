Not only will I inevitably need to remember months later what happened, but I&#x27;ll also want to reuse certain bits later.<p>That &quot;.archive&quot; folder itself is then a personal git repo. Sometimes you just have to put that fire out or get that question answered and its not worth a &quot;proper&quot; solution, but keeping a history is worth it.<p>Resist the urge to keep it as part of the main project&#x27;s repo at all costs. It&#x27;s far too easy for it to be come standardized (e.g. by other devs, perhaps) and breath life into them they should never have.')
