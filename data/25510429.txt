Why does a functioning democracy require them to also control the Senate, when the American system of government was expressly designed with this sort of legislative tension in mind?<p>You&#x27;ll notice I didn&#x27;t complain about that.  What I <i>did</i> complain about was that Republican hardball tactics seem to headed towards the conscious goal of not needing to seek majority support in order to control the government.  That&#x27;s frankly unacceptable (and I&#x27;m not even talking about the recent nonsense about trying to literally throw out votes on a massive scale until they win a race they lost).<p>I&#x27;m no Democrat, and I think they need to mellow on cultural issues to appeal in rural states like they used to, but the Republicans seem to be playing a far more dangerous game to maintain power that risks the legitimacy of the whole system.')
