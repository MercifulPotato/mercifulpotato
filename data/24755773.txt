Item(by='hn_throwaway_99', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602518309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755176, text='Perhaps, but I&#x27;ll at least admit that my views on the limits of free speech have changed in the past decade or so as the toxicity and irrationality of social media has become apparent.<p>I think there is an often unspoken assumption by free speech advocates that if enough daylight is shined on something that the truth will win out. Thus, better to limit speech as little as possible because (a) those limitations have so easily and frequently been abused by those clinging to power and (b) at the end of the day the truth will win out anyway, so better to just let crazy stuff be said.<p>Over the past decade though, as people have seen the real, critical danger of unlimited free speech, and especially how the internet and social media has allowed free speech with few consequences to the original speaker (which did NOT exist when the ideals of free speech were first envisioned), I&#x27;m not sure these original hypotheses hold out anymore. I highly recommend The Social Dilemma - instead of showing truth to power, powerful entities have used powerful tools to &quot;hack&quot; human psychology to get people to believe things that are factually false.<p>Remember Reddit back in the late 00s? It had such a strong free speech ethos it allowed things like jailbait. I don&#x27;t even hear many free speech defenders supporting stuff like that anymore. And look at the mobs in Myanmar that were enabled to commit violence against the Rohingya by false Facebook posts.<p>I still believe in the ideas of free speech, by I also now more strongly believe that unlimited free speech <i>will</i> lead us to a world where autocrats win and plain, 100% verifiable facts are dismissed (I mean, from the article, <i>nearly a quarter</i> of 18-39 year olds believe the Holocaust is a myth, exaggerated or aren&#x27;t sure??!! I&#x27;m in my 40s and I have friends whose parents showed me their serial tattoos from being in concentration camps), and stuff is, for lack of a better term, &quot;not good&quot;. So yes, I&#x27;ve changed my position, and I&#x27;m firmly on the side of being intolerant against speech that is demonstrably false.')
