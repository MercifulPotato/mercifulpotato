Robinhood&#x27;s entire product is so predatory that they shouldn&#x27;t have had their users trust in the first place. But that&#x27;s not really the question here?<p>The things you mention are things that people should probably understand. The fact that customers en-masse did not understand these things is *definitely Robinhood&#x27;s fault*.<p>&gt; the account they funded with cold hard cash was termed a margin account<p>Until it was actually funded and settled though, it <i>is</i> on margin (after which it&#x27;s still a margin account, it&#x27;s just covered, and you can not use margin). This is again something that customers <i>should be educated on</i>. Robinhood could have made the user wait 2-3 days (while waiting for the funds to settle) before they could buy any stock. Robinhood prioritized user engagement. Robinhood could make users wait 2-3 days between selling a stock and buying a new one. Again, Robinhood chose to prioritize user engagement instead.<p>&gt; due to the broker&#x27;s lack of financial prudence<p>Robinhood was not even close to the only broker who was impacted by this, so can we stop pretending that they were?<p>&gt; may need to manipulate the market to their individual disadvantage<p>Again, I disagree that Robinhood following the actual policy of the accounts the users were using, in order to be compliant with financial regulations, is &quot;manipulating the market&quot;.')
