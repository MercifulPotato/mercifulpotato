I don&#x27;t think earning a degree represents deep literacy anymore if it ever really did--certainly not undergrad, and mostly not graduate level either. I think the incentives are wrong and the results are not &quot;deep literacy&quot; in any meaningful sense.<p>Your point about mindless entertainment replacing other mindless entertainment is pretty interesting. I guess my misgiving about that is the relative addictiveness or follow on effects of your chosen entertainment? Like if your mindless entertainment is heroin, that has effects on your mind that go beyond the time spent.<p>If our new mindless entertainment also saturates not only our time but our attention--not just at the moment, but our ability to attend to things in general, given the feedback cycle our brain is habituated to--that is potentially worth worrying about.')
