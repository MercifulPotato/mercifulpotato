Instead I think they should have rolled with NAT.<p>NAT is great because it acts as an abstraction layer for the external network, in that the nodes on the local network can talk to each other and be blissfully ignorant of the details of the external network.<p>And for the majority of local networks there&#x27;s a fundamental asymmetry between the local and external network. The majority of nodes on local networks only ever need to connect _out_ to the external network, they don&#x27;t need incoming connections.<p>Going to 128bit addresses essentially makes DNS required. And when using DNS nobody really cares about the address of the host. They just want to be able to talk to the host on the other end, whatever it is.<p>Being fully peer-to-peer is a pipe dream. Nobody wants their entire local network exposed to the entire internet without a firewall. And with a firewall comes the exact same hole-punching problem that NAT has.<p>So that&#x27;s the problem they should have tried to solve better, I think. They should have embraced NAT and the inherent network asymmetry, and found ways to make it better rather than trying to abolish it. Embraced that DNS needs to play a more central role than it does today, because nobody really cares about addresses.')
