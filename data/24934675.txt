Tech people talk about edge cases, about past stories where Facebook shut down a group or posts, theoretical guarantees about &quot;real&quot; privacy, and decentralized control being more idealistic.<p>Real people don&#x27;t need stuff to work perfectly, because they&#x27;ll come up with a workaround by moving platforms or changing how they do things. Nothing works perfectly for them anyways. The platforms they use just need to work 95% of the time, and be good enough. Real people are aware that what they write can be read by others, and don&#x27;t care about the difference between whether it&#x27;s encrypted in transit, or on the server, or to their recipient.<p>For real use, it&#x27;s all about the content, not the platform.')
