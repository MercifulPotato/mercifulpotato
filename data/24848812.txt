You are a buffoon.&quot;</i><p>et2o:  yes—a buffoon—that&#x27;s very likely true, but at least I admit it!<p>However, you medicos have a damn lot to answer for.  Where would you like me to start?  Perhaps with the thalidomide fiasco, or more recently the abysmal lack of preparation for COVID-19 even though we knew it was coming decades ago, or the current opioid epidemic, the policies of which were sorted out nearly a century ago with both government regulation and tightly controlled international treaties, all of which have recently been [conveniently] forgotten by the pharmaceutical industry, the FDA, along with a disreputable mob of doctors who disbanded their Hippocratic Oaths for a few shekels from mafia-like Purdue.  Right, the law should bring them all to account.<p>Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the opioid crisis is that the thousands of &#x27;good&#x27; doctors stood knowingly by and effectively did nothing, seemingly ethics flew out the window.  In words loosely attributed to Edmund Burke:  <i>&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing&quot;.</i><p><i>&quot;(not very interesting medically)&quot;</i><p>Whilst many areas of medical science have done wonders, in others research has been almost non-existent.  You&#x27;re right, certain diseases&#x2F;subjects are not interesting or boring and concomitantly that they fail to attract funding is a problem, and it&#x27;s always been that way.  In <i>this</i> regard, the trouble is (and has always been) that the self-governing medical profession has never been able to prioritize patients above their own interests, not to mention money.  In essence, medical researchers do not exercise granularity evenly over the field of medical knowledge (as you implied yourself); and that&#x27;s aided and abetted by large pharma, <i>et al</i> whose principal interest is money, not medicine.<p>___<p><i>Lear:  My wits begin to turn.<p>Fool:  He that has and a little tiny wit,—<p>(Lear III&#x2F;I)</i>')
