Crucial components:<p>ZERO cheating. Not a single beer. Not a single extra bite. Managed this for 3 months, losing 15 kg. Then occasional cheating for 6 months, losing 0 kg... Then managed once more for 3 months, lost another 15 kg. This is the hard part, I managed by introducing the following habits:<p>Same &quot;default&quot; meal every day. Chicken with broccoli, day in day out. It&#x27;s not the best nutrition advice, but not having to think what to buy and what to cook is a huge factor.<p>Drinking a lot of water. 3 litres a day. I&#x27;d basically put two 1.5 liter bottles of water on my desk and made sure to drink all of it. Simple, effective.<p>Mindset shift. Told myself &quot;I don&#x27;t eat sweets&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t drink alcohol&quot; - sounds stupid, but very efficient to have preprogrammed reaction when facing a temptation.')
