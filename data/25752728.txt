Item(by='garden_hermit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610482092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752125, text='&gt; People will praise the Arab Spring organizing on Twitter without considering the implications for the events at the Capital on Jan 6th.<p>The reason why someone might hold these competing beliefs is simple: they strongly value democratic institutions. Violence, in the name of promoting democratic institutions, and ideally expanding human rights, is justifiable. Violence in the name of authoritarian insurrection is not.<p>Now, of course this gets really tricky, because many people on Parler, and in the capitol riots, fully believed that they were protecting democracy from massive voter-fraud. No clear answer to address that issue, but it is something that democratic societies will need to reckon with. How does one preserve democratic ideals (including promoting free speech, to whatever extent possible), while still maintaining a healthy society that doesn&#x27;t tear itself apart?')
