However there is no safe-harbour provision for such violations.</i><p><i>Microsoft is listed on the RIAA&#x27;s members page. Neither Google LLC, its Youtube subsidiary, nor parent Alphabet Inc. are. The RIAA are threatening a member for a ยง1201 violation against a nonmember. That&#x27;s ... weird.</i><p>From TFA.')
