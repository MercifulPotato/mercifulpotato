Back the day, so, I was part of an active group photographers, mostl ynature and outdoor. Like back when we still used film.<p>Can&#x27;t agree more on the weather-proof part. I was ather funny to be out taking pictures all day, only to find the camera was sitting in 5 cm of water in its protective bag. Nikon did work better druing that, than. Just an anecdote so, some Nikon&#x27;s didn&#x27;t like it that good neither.<p>Some Sigma lenses were really good back than, some on par with Nikkor. Canon lenses were, if I remember well, mostly on par with Nikkor. Been used to Nikon so, I always to break the lighter Canon camera bodies.')
