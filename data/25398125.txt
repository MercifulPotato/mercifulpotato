The card game itself is truly random, short of any unknown bugs that escaped testing by both the manufacturer and the regulators. The only thing that affects the payouts in a video poker game is the paytable, which is visible to the player up front and can&#x27;t be changed while they&#x27;re playing it, again by law. You can look up the expected value of each game online before putting any money in by the advertised paytable.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve been a casino game mathematician for 20 years.')
