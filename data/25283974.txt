By lowering the cost of utilities for their rental property they can increase the share of rent they keep as profit (in the case that utilities are included in rent) or charge more rent,  based on the fact that the property is more desirable with the cheaper utilities &#x2F; better environmental footprint.<p>Renewables are nothing new here. The same incentives encourage landlords to make properties generally energy efficient and desirable.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know the realities of rental housing. Many landlords do not give a shit, especially in markets without much housing. But as a general rule, the incentives are there, and eventually will have a large impact on the rental market. If most properties are solar powered, a rental that is not will have come with a discount.')
