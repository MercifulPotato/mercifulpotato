But you can get up to 0.5% more buying a government bond than the (equivalent, risk wise) bank deposit - except that due to SEC rules, the local bond purchase is unavailable to US taxpayers (even if they are also local citizens). In that sense, is taxpayers (even if they hold a local citizenship) are discriminated against.<p>And no, at least in Israel, there isn’t any more to the story. Each of the big three Israeli banks have paid between $400m and $900m in fines for noncompliance with US law, and as a result they offer the minimal services they can without getting sued. I’ve heard similar stories about places in Europe where I am less familiar with the details, so I won’t say it’s necessarily the same in Europe - but in Israel, that’s most definitely the case - and I heard it from both customers and bank officers.')
