The New one is mostly pleasant (mostly) but the Old one... oh boy. Casual genocide, god-assisted, even, what&#x27;s not to love? And even better, the stories of literally defrauding the god (Moses was told by the god he has to keep his arms up for Israelis to keep winning the battle, but he gets tired, so his sons(?) keep them up with their hands for him, yeah, that&#x27;s totally not against the spirit of the god&#x27;s challenge).<p>Honestly, the Greek myths are better in that they weren&#x27;t at least claiming those gods were omnibenevolent and stuff.')
