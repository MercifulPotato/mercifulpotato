Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[24795795], score=None, time=1602781540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787814, text='&gt; Censorship and other forms of regulating free speech is simply never a good solution. Perpetrators of lies will even hide behind this, and create a false image of rebellious heroism, instead of facing public discourse and the consequences thereof.<p>&gt; YouTube is a private entity but they correctly assess that they have a significant responsibility here. But curating social media content is not unheard of, Wikipedia manages it surprisingly well. Instead they could for example certify and emphasize content that is grounded in science and verify content creators of such. This is from the top of my head but there are certainly other people who have smarter ideas that don&#x27;t involve straight up censorship.<p>I&#x27;m 100% certain that some crank and their followers are complaining about censorship on Wikipedia right now, because that community decided to not present their tendentious opinions or lies as the truth or to not present them at all.<p>The word &quot;censorship&quot; has been ruined: it&#x27;s devolved into an epithet to describe <i>any</i> barrier, not matter how justified, between a speaker and his desired audience.  It&#x27;s not censorship for YouTube to ban this content, just like it&#x27;s not censorship for me to ban anti-vaxxers and white suprecemists from putting signs up on my lawn.  The mass dissemination of truth (or our best approximation) has always depended on decisions to <i>not disseminate</i>.  You can&#x27;t expect the common man to sort through a bag of 99 compelling lies and one truth to find the truth.  That&#x27;s too much work for an amateur, and too many will settle for a lie.  Everyone relies on others to improve the truth-to-lie ratio to some manageable ratio that an individual can handle.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting is that one of the main reasons Wikipedia does better than YouTube is that it&#x27;s process is <i>100% manual</i>.  Google&#x27;s bias towards totally automated processes driven by some quantity of shallow data points greatly reduces how effective they can actually be.')
