The scope of the change. My understanding is that Elasticsearch may use Lucene under the hood, but extends it in ways and for use cases that <i>Lucene was not designed for</i>. The same can not be said about AWS taking Elasticsearch and running it as a drop-in replacement.<p>2. Perhaps most importantly, Elasticsearch didn&#x27;t build on top of Lucene, and then <i>decide to call itself Lucene</i>. If you think there is so little differentiation between the product you built and the product you built <i>off of</i>, that you are better off highjacking the name, then I question if you made any meaningful differences.')
