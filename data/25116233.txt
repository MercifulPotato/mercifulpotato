Unless you develop exclusively for Android, you&#x27;re FORCED to own an iOS device.<p>I&#x27;m seriously considering changing my daily driver to a Linux machine, and getting a mac mini strictly for running iOS builds.<p>Would need to do some work to kick off a build from the Linux machine which deploys the app to the iOS device, but it should totally be possible with xcodebuild command line tool...<p>I think the general workflow would be:<p>1)  Develop on the Linux machine in Flutter or React Native.\n2)  Primary day-to-day &#x2F; hour-to-hour testing device = Pixel.\n3)  When ready to build on iOS device, network request is made to the Mac Mini, which then kicks of xcodebuild to deploy the build to the device.<p>Would need some sort of fast file replication tool.  And debugging would be a chore.<p>Uhg.')
