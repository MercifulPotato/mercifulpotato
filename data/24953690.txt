I used to be like this (dislike it), then I found Rust.<p>Now I prefer imperative, eager computation with (safe) mutability and even some lightweight OOP (the way Rust does it with Traits&#x2F;Type-classes). It seems that it much better reflects the real world. Rust makes the mutability concerns obsolete, as you can have safety in the imperative&#x2F;mutable world.<p>Otherwise Rust is very much functional in all the great ways explained in the article.')
