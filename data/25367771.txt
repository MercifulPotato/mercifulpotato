They are much more secretive and seem to do a lot less testing. New Glenn is somewhat comparable to a Falcon 9 scaled up to the size of Starship and is supposed to happen in 2021, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any good indication how far they are along and whether they will be able to deliver.<p>My gut says that if they don&#x27;t test they can&#x27;t deliver, and that Elon&#x27;s rapid prototyping will keep SpaceX far in the lead for the foreseeable future. But only time will tell.')
