Then, also, there is no exported way to make one of that struct, or to set its fields. Now you cannot write a library that wraps the original library and exposes the same API (unless you use unsafe and reflection).<p>In the OO languages I have encountered there seems to be a stronger convention toward using interfaces instead of struct or class types in this sort of situation, but people are certainly free in Java to use a final class type as the type of their parameters and return values if they want to make their library less composable.')
