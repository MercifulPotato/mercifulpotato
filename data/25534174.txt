Corbyn (who, depending on who you ask, is possibly a bigger Euroskeptic than David Cameron ever was) pointedly did <i>not</i> position Labour&#x27;s election stance as being anti-Brexit.  That was up to the LibDems who, in a FPTP system, were not going to win anyway largely because everyone still hates them over the college fees reversal.<p>Corbyn&#x27;s Labour party always insisted that it would negotiate the &quot;best possible Brexit,&quot; one that was more or less a &quot;soft Brexit&quot; but, just like the Tories, still a Brexit with all that entails.  People were pleading with Corbyn to do exactly as you described and make the GE a mini-referendum on Brexit by Labour campaigning to reject Brexit...but Corbyn didn&#x27;t.')
