The Lean folks also have a lot of good critiques. A book that sticks in my mind is &quot;Simple Excellence: Organizing and Aligning the Management Team in a Lean Transformation&quot;, but there are a bunch. And for software specifically, Mary Poppendieck&#x27;s work is great, as well as Reinertsen&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Product Development Flow&quot;.')
