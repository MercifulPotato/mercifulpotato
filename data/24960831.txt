Much more than I do from a &quot;proper&quot; weekend.<p>I believe that&#x27;s because as time rolls we assign minor duties to ourselves for the weekend, and that weekend becomes just another time of work filled with worry and a sense of obligation. An unplanned day off, by contrast, has no duties.<p>Now if only I could replicate the same sense of freedom on the regular weekend I would be the happiest man alive.')
