Imagine that someone is physically holding your device, with the screen unlocked, in their hands. If they wanted to create a record of what&#x27;s on your device right then, they could simply open each app on your device and take screenshots of what&#x27;s there.&quot;<p>Under the laws of many countries, that &quot;record&quot; alone would likely be inadmissible.
