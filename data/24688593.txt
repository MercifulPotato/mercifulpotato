Is it NPD or another cluster of personality disorders, or is it a much more pervasive set of examples of poor character and undeveloped virtue?<p>From the article: &quot;Narcissistic leaders have personalities that are profoundly grandiose, overconfident, and dishonest, credit-stealing, and blame-throwing, according to Chatman. They are abusive to their subordinates, think they are superior, don’t listen to experts, create conflict, and believe the rules simply don’t apply to them. They can explode in rage at any sign of disagreement or disloyalty. There’s always an “I” in their conception of the team.&quot;<p>It reads more like a complaint and not an observation. I think the basic mistake these and other people make when they interpret the myth of Narcissus is thinking that he is in love with &quot;himself,&quot; instead of the more incisive insight that he is preoccupied with his <i>reflection</i>, that is, how he imagines himself to be perceived by others. That is the crippling pathology, which manifests in bizarre behavior that is over-indexed on shaping the perfectness of that reflection. Whenever I see &quot;narcissism,&quot; mentioned anywhere these days, it&#x27;s always the same kind of complaint made by someone who identifies as feeling inferior to an imagined charismatic, glad handling, type-A personality.<p>Narcissism really is a pervasive problem, but mainly because it&#x27;s not what most people think it is, and the roots of it are not something most people are prepared to face.')
