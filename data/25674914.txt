He has been whipping up his supporters into a frenzy for some time.<p>Watch the video clips of his speeches he has posted on Twitter,  with yet more lies about how the election was &quot;stolen from him&quot;, the other side are &quot;evil&quot;, and how his supporters must &quot;fight&quot; for democracy by helping him overturn the will of the American people.<p>Listen to the tapes of him telling state officials to &quot;find more votes&quot;, with thinly veiled threats.<p>Watch the video of his speech shortly before the riot, where Rudi Guliani said the way to win was &quot;trial by combat&quot;, and Trump told them all to march on the capital.<p>Listen even to his video statement where he asks them to stop the violence - where he <i>still</i> refuses to denounce their actions, banging on about fraud and what &quot;great patriots&quot; they are!<p>He has, to my knowledge, never <i>explicitly</i> said &quot;let&#x27;s go and stage a violent coup!&quot;, because even Trump is just a tad more intelligent than that - but it is <i>abundantly</i> clear that this is what he was asking for and what he wanted, and it&#x27;s been clear for all to see for some time.')
