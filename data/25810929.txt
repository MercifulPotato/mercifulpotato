Most religions believe in some pretty crazy shit too, and I challenge anyone to find the difference between believing in a pedo ring in a pizza store vs the day of judgement and the layers of hell, angels, demons, resurrection, etc.<p>Nothing new is happening here.<p>Anyways, I think the belief in some of the crazy qanon stuff is a subconscious manifestation of their true nasty dispositions. The raw beliefs are probably embedded in racism, and it’s driving that subset rotten so much so that it is manifesting in a mutated outgrowth of a similarly nasty conspiracy (pedo rings, dominion by a lizard class).<p>It’s the same with religion, if you give it to mostly naive and dim witted people you will get dim witted beliefs and customs.<p>It’s the same with giving someone an elite education in a proper field, you get a highly useful member of society.<p>The rottenness of their basic beliefs is metastasizing into these forms that feel obvious to me. Believing in lizard dominators is no different than being unabashedly racist in this day and age, pure dysfunction. Hell, I’ll even suggest believing in semi-human demon form of a lizard person out to harm you is poetic licensing of racism, the belief in another human that isn’t exactly you and something to be feared, to be dealt with.<p>&gt; just random text fragments<p>Modus operandi of every religion, <i>it was written</i>. Just random shit that was written over ages. Why would the GOP be particularly susceptible to it? Well why wouldn’t they be? Their bread and butter base was always the evangelical or some form of white Christian. That’s a specific type of person through and through. Why wouldn’t this group be the ones that gravitate to this stuff?<p>A group of people that believe in the greatest conspiracy of all time about a deity, running things in a planned way, with all kinds of backstory and lore about the purpose of humanity, and yet we’re all shocked they gobbled up another equally laughable conspiracy. They’ve remixed their beliefs, god running the world and finding his true believers is repurposed in Trump secretly rallying his true believers against a world order that seeks to harm them. It’s not even original, they are just manifestations of racism embedded in the reality of a globalized world that is economically weakening them. Can we follow the money here?<p>It’s the same exact people guys, why is our memory so lenient?')
