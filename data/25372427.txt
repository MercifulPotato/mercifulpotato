There have been <i>many</i> of these - genocides, &quot;Lebensraum im Osten&quot; aka Nazi Germany invading Eastern Europe, the Holocaust, China&#x27;s &quot;1 child policy&quot;.<p>The best way a society can handle population management is fact-based sex education and safe, cheap access to contraceptives and medical abortion, and general access to healthcare and a social security network so that people don&#x27;t have to have half a dozen children if they want one or two to survive to adulthood and care for them at old age.')
