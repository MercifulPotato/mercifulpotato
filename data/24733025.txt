The system is set up that way as an inevitable consequence of modern technology; automation and economies of scale are simply <i>better</i> at producing valuable things, so much better that an individual worker with no capital can&#x27;t compete. We can change who has access to capital or reallocate the benefits of capital, but we can&#x27;t change the fundamental problem that capital is required to get anything done under modern technological conditions. The most dedicated shopkeeper on the planet couldn&#x27;t match Amazon&#x27;s capital-intensive delivery network, nor could the best machinist on the planet make a better washing machine than Whirlpool&#x27;s capital-intensive assembly line.')
