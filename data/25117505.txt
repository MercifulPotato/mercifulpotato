Item(by='mdasen', descendants=None, kids=[25118099], score=None, time=1605563858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114707, text='I&#x27;d guess (and it is a guess) that it wouldn&#x27;t fall under this because Yelp would only show this &quot;inauthentic&quot; number for businesses that have signed an agreement with Yelp.<p>Yelp is going to be a mix of businesses that are just listed and have no relationship with Yelp and then things like a restaurant that has signed an agreement for GrubHub to handle some ordering for them. That agreement could include something like, &quot;you agree that orders received via GrubHub will have this fee structure that you have to pay us and orders that come in via phone from our website are also considered an order generated by us and will have this fee structure&quot;.<p>At that point, the business is &quot;agreeing&quot; to that phone number. I put &quot;agreeing&quot; in quotes because restaurants might feel like they&#x27;re compelled to agree or lose out on significant business given Yelp&#x27;s market position.<p>I think it&#x27;s harder to allege impersonation or fraud if the business has agreed to it. I think it&#x27;s easier to allege that the business didn&#x27;t really have a choice in the matter given the company&#x27;s dominance in the market.')
