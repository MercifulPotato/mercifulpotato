It&#x27;s a lot harder to design a secure hospital IT apparatus than a safe. Also, in the event of a safe getting cracked, you&#x27;d likely have no recourse against the safe vendor. Safes are designed to present a firewall against tampering, but with sufficient physical access, no safe will stand for long. So your analogy fails two ways: one is that it trivializes the difficulty of the problem you&#x27;re analogizing, and the other is that even if it were a good analogy, it would cut against your argument.')
