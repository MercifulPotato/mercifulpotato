Of the dozen or so sources I looked at, half them are links to articles on right-leaning news sites or tweets parroting speech from Trump lawyers, with no links to primary documents. This isn&#x27;t evidence.<p>One source was a video of election workers moving boxes around, with a conspiratorial narrative overlaid. This isn&#x27;t evidence.<p>Several tweets showing &quot;voting spikes&quot; in favor of Biden as a result of regular counting operations. Nothing wrong here.<p>The remaining sources discuss &quot;irregularities of expectation&quot;, yet none provide any plausible narrative of wrongdoing. The most plausible explanation is that it Democrat-favored voting methods were more streamlined, reliable, and less contested this year compared to years previous. Obviously this nets more votes for Democrats, but nothing practical is stopping a Republican from voting by mail, either. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if the 2020 election was actually <i>more</i> fair than in previous years, due to a large decrease in wrongfully-rejected ballots. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if more Democratic votes were thrown away wrongfully in 2016 than fraudulent Democratic votes were accepted in 2020. If you&#x27;re concerned about the legitimacy and fairness of U.S. elections, you can&#x27;t talk about voter fraud while ignoring historical voter disenfranchisement. If someone thinks that mail-in voting was too easy this year, then their gripe is with the judicial systems that permitted this year&#x27;s election rules.<p>Conclusion: The linked website doesn&#x27;t seem to have very high standards of verification, as most items are obviously flimsy or easily debunkable.')
