These survivors are not distributed (by age, other comorbidities) the way fatalities are.<p>One thing I have not yet seen on Hacker News or anywhere else is convincing evidence that such &quot;long-term symptoms&#x2F;damage&quot; are substantially greater in number or intensity[1] than for any other respiratory disease that can occasionally kill, especially given how novel (wording intentional) SARS-CoV-19 is.<p>[1] Except a somewhat higher percentage of fatalities than the flu, depending on whether you define death as a long-term symptom')
