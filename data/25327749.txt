Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607297855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327041, text='I hate Christmas because Christmas decorations get stored around 10 or 11 months out of the year and I used to end up on antibiotics every year at Christmas. Storing stuff like that tends to leave it covered in mildew.<p>I spoke once to someone who was allergic to Christmas trees and she was sympathetic. Everyone else typically hates on me for mentioning it. I&#x27;m a party pooper for not wanting to be deathly ill.<p>It also aggravates me to see articles with themes such as celebrating &quot;the most Christmasy town in America!&quot; that really mean the most gaudily decorated every year. No, this does not mean some spirit of giving where homeless people are gifted houses or something like that.<p>I also find it baffling that strident feminists haven&#x27;t latched onto the angle that &quot;Christmas promotes an evil patriarchy!.&quot;<p>Christmas used to be a time when poor people and children got gifts. Now it&#x27;s a time when Americans load up their credit cards to engage in mostly pointless rituals that results in a mini depression every January and a chronic burden of debt on the country.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan and it has little to do with my general aversion to religion, though I found this article interesting enough to read and I posted the link to this HN discussion over on r&#x2F;UrbanForestry. (Crossing my fingers and hoping no one hassles me about &quot;Why on earth is this here??&quot;)')
