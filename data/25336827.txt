I&#x27;m curious how well executed that works when it comes to less well behaved anticheats (like Riot&#x27;s Vanguard generally stays hands off, but GameGuard will immediately heartbeat a &quot;ban me&quot; and intentionally cause a bluescreen to cause you to &quot;lose any data collected by your debugger&quot; when it notices it&#x27;s being looked at).<p>This type of BS is super common in Asian countries&#x2F;published MMOs and a bit less acceptable in the west (you still have EAC and battleye, but at least they make an attempt to use TLS?)<p>Another insane example: xigncode has long since advertised a feature that the game developers can remote control into your PC like VNC. I don&#x27;t know whether any developer has chosen to actually enable it, but the fact that they push it as a feature is some serious clown-egg-face.')
