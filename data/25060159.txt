If you work somewhere that has Java, Groovy, Scala and Clojure projects being able to canonically clone any of them and build them with <i>.&#x2F;gradlew clean build</i> is amazing. That forces your org to completely adopt Gradle but thatâ€™s not terribly difficult for a technically minded leader to enforce. Of course, that only applies in certain circumstances, and as you imply using the right tool for the job is the most important thing.')
