Honestly, I <i>do</i> intend to treat smart assistants that way. I can accept that they&#x27;re imperfect and that they&#x27;re tools that only work in certain ways. I can figure out a way to either make them be useful to me or abandon them if the way is too hard. I&#x27;m not asking for perfection.<p>The thing is predictability, though, and maybe handling the common use cases. It gets frustrating when they get worse. Kids, on the other hand, only get better at understanding you (though perhaps also better at frustrating you on purpose).<p>To put it simply, I&#x27;m happy to make myself perform incantations. I&#x27;ll say &quot;Ok Google, grooblepuff the bonkman&quot; to get the thing to do the thing. This whole thing has made me understand why wizards and sorcerers chant <i>Accio!</i> and <i>Sectumsempra!</i> and shit like that because if they just said &quot;Bring me my firebolt&quot; no one knows how the AI that runs magic in the world would interpret that.<p>And you know someone who feels this strongly about the product is pretty bought into it. Like, if I didn&#x27;t use it so much, I wouldn&#x27;t be complaining this much.')
