I do think C# is an easier language to follow, but Unity&#x27;s game engine API has less stuff built into it, which is a far more time consuming element to work around. If you want to say, launch a projectile, Unreal has the projectile movement component that you can slap on something.  Unity you&#x27;ll need to implement it yourself. I went from Unity to Unreal and find the number of things that are automatic vs. manually implemented is a way better time saver.<p>&gt; Blueprints kind of suck.<p>I&#x27;ve never had them run too slowly versus code. I do miss lambdas. But I think blueprints have some advantages that code does not. It&#x27;s incredibly useful to visually see at a glance what functions are pure with no side effects. It&#x27;s lovely to be able to collapse large sections of code into nodes with long descriptive names that you don&#x27;t need to look at. I code in blueprints as much as possible. I low key wish I could move my python jupyter notebooks from work to such an environment because it makes the pipelines so easy to follow. That is, I find it way easier to produce excellent documentation for them than with code. Mind you many people seem to have the opposite interaction and create lovecraftian spaghetti horrors.<p>I don&#x27;t quite follow what Imposters does, but I think this is likely to be outclassed in UE5 with its nanite and lumen. IK solvers are just a part of the engine via Control Rig. Haven&#x27;t used em though.<p>To each their own though. Unity is good. I just have doubts about its future management.')
