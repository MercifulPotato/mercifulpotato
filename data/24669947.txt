Unless this was somehow so narrowly tailored to Apple that it couldn&#x27;t apply to anyone else, it would be a <i>seismic</i> change.<p>(Also, I continue to be skeptical that forcing Apple to spin off the App Store is really a useful way to address the complaints people have. A separate company with an exclusive contract to run the App Store doesn&#x27;t solve anything, and if you&#x27;re going to force changes to make it non-exclusive, you can arguably do that without spinning it off.)')
