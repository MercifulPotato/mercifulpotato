Indeed, at least for snorted cocaine, the most common reaction I&#x27;ve heard from first time users is basically &quot;what&#x27;s the big deal?&quot; - aka the effects just weren&#x27;t as intense as expected based on the reputation.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve only met one person who has been able to use cigarettes occasionally (a few times a year). Everyone else has been at at least a daily smoker, and while I know quite a few people who have successfully quit, it&#x27;s almost always been a rough experience with multiple attempts required before succeeding.<p>If cocaine and heroin were legal and cheap, I&#x27;d probably be more concerned if a friend took up smoking than either of them. Conversely, if cigarettes were illegal, I&#x27;d be <i>really</i> concerned if a friend took up smoking.')
