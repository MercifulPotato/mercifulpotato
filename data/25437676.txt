It was a big bet for Google, they never shut up about how Cyberpunk will come out for Stadia. Based on a few reviews I&#x27;ve read, the Stadia version seems to have turned out OK.<p>The PS5&#x2F;SeriesXS versions are coming out in 2021. They don&#x27;t exist right now. The reason the game runs on PS5&#x2F;SeriesXS is backwards compatibility. That backwards compatibility didn&#x27;t exist at the time when GTA5 was released for PS3&#x2F;Xbox360.<p>The PS4&#x2F;XBoxOne versions of Cyberpunk should have definitely been delayed. However I think it&#x27;s not just the holiday season that is a factor here. It&#x27;s also that the new generation of consoles already came out. Rockstar managed to get GTA5 out for PS3&#x2F;Xbox360 a few months before PS4&#x2F;XBoxOne.<p>It&#x27;s clear that the PC version was the focus for CDPR - as it has always been for its games. It would have helped to schedule the PC version for later (like Rockstar scheduled GTA5 for PC - 2 years after PS3&#x2F;XBox360) so that initially the focus could be on PS4&#x2F;XBoxOne - it would probably have resulted in better reviews and a way more polished game. However ignoring PC for so long can be a hard pill to swallow for a PC centric developer - and indeed, they chose not to do it. According to the Q&amp;A PC pre-orders made up 59% of their sales, so from a sales perspective delaying PC probably not the best choice either.<p>--<p>I do wonder how the PS4&#x2F;XboxOne version of Cyberpunk looked 6 months ago and how much progress has there been. Hard to imagine it being way worse, but if it has been consistently so bad then it&#x27;s puzzling why there wasn&#x27;t significant steps taken as the quality of the game on those platforms wasn&#x27;t changing.')
