I took really hard escalations and had a low case count. My manager pointed it out and so next period I also did 100 remote password changes in addition to my hard cases and had like 3x the next closest case count.<p>I did this to show him how stupid his metrics are but he just said “great job, this is amazing.”<p>So I just made sure to min max  stupid metrics and do what I thought was right as it was easier than trying to fix the metrics.<p>I definitely don’t think it’s worth being fired out of principle if I know I’m measured for case count.<p>Generally, I try to set up policies where these metrics are not allowed for performance, but are visible.<p>And then whenever someone tries to enact them I try to say “this is a really stupid idea and here’s why” in front of as many senior, fancy pants people as possible.')
