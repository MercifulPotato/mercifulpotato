The answer is the same as in many other fields of engineering: it&#x27;s not efficient to overbuild every node in an network to handle any possible load when electrical loads are usually well-defined and do not change rapidly. We don&#x27;t have a universal train that runs in the metro, for freight and for high speed rail not because it&#x27;s not possible but because that would not be efficient. The same applies here.')
