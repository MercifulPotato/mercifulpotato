(He also used it when he won, of course. But it is a unique construction that has been manifested into being by him.)<p>This is a man who, in what any normal person, could admit was a mistake when tweeting about a hurricane having effects in Alabama. Instead he doubled down, tripled down, forced federal employees to make statements that he was right. He even drew sharpie on a map to extend the prediction cone because it didn&#x27;t show what he said.<p>There is a clear pattern of behavior here.<p>Additionally, those who are alleging massive voter fraud in public did not make those statements in court, because it would have actual consequences. Every state certified their results, including those with republican leadership.<p>So you either have to buy in to extraordinary claims of all kinds of (in many cases provably false) of voter fraud and a massive apparatus (Deep State) working against Donald Trump or accept the much more obvious and plain result.<p>If you listen to the call with Georgia, when the Secretary of State pointed out that they had investigated several of the claims, Trump&#x27;s response was that the investigators were either incompetent or actively working against him.<p>It goes beyond the pale.')
