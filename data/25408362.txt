Item(by='candybar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607881397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403796, text='This is misleading - yoga in the traditional sense means something along the lines of &quot;spiritual way of living&quot; rather than yoga as an exercise (hatha yoga) and naked yoga in this sense is an extreme ascetic lifestyle where you live with as little clothes as possible as a form of renunciation, to avoid any further entanglement&#x2F;karma in the world.  It&#x27;s about giving up comfort and status associated with clothes as well as avoiding karma associated with the production of clothes and it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense until you&#x27;ve already given up most of the comfort provided by the material world.  Associating doing yoga poses on Youtube naked for views and attention with an ascetic lifestyle is absurd.')
