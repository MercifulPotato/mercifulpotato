You say I&#x27;m in a bubble, but I&#x27;ve been surrounded by conservatives 31 out of the 37 years I&#x27;ve been alive. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t understand their motivations, or arguments, or sentiments. My father believes every Muslim wants to kill or convert us. He has never met a Muslim. My mother believes welfare queens pick up their welfare checks in Cadillacs. My sister believes Donald Trump was delivered by God to save this country. My brother believes transwomen just want to molest his daughters. This is just my immediate family. My extended family gets even more colorful and overtly bigoted. Quite frankly, I&#x27;m tired of being told I just don&#x27;t understand conservatives when I&#x27;ve been dealing with these people my entire life. Perhaps it&#x27;s your perception of conservatives which needs to be adjusted.')
