It is well known.<p>Iran is suspected to fund and ship rockets that are used against Israel. I won&#x27;t say it is confirmed but it will be no bif surprise if the rumors are confirmed.<p>Iran officials often speak about eradicating Israel. The opposite never happens.<p>Israel is not known to operate any milits in or around Iran, they are not suspected of shipping rockets to Irans neighbors and they are not known to talk enthusiastically about flattening Iran or killing its inhabitants.<p>I think we can agree that it is a poorly kept secret that they are probably behind a number of assassinations, industrial espionage and possibly sabotage but the difference is still enormous.')
