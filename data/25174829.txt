But I&#x27;ve been careful with the initial setup and have all the expected requirements covered : no open relay, SPF, DKIM, reverse ip, TLS,...<p>Been using the tutorial at workaround.org as basis for building the stack (postfix, dovecot, rspamd,...) and, while the initial learning curve was high, once its been set up, its been a really very stable setup requiring practically no maintenance whatsoever.<p>Not saying that&#x27;s for everyone, just saying it works for me.<p>I guess I was lucky at the dice roll mentioned by other comments.<p>Ah yeah, and testing your outgoing emails using a service like mail-tester.com is very very useful.
