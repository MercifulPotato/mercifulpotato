Sounds intriguing and would solve some real problems.<p>As for losing money, yeah in that scenario it&#x27;s worse. The dutch system sounds better in the regard that it only taxes gains, but of course you&#x27;d here have issues as well with volatile valuations where you have gains in one year and losses in the next.<p>Regarding your potential loss scenario, hypothetically if you&#x27;ve owned 100 million one year and then over the course of 3 years it went down to just 1 million. Wouldn&#x27;t it be beneficial for society had you contributed a little piece of those 100 million to society when you still had it? Other than you just holding onto it, benefitting nobody, not even you, as you lost it :). In the scenario where your money is stable or increases in value, this is no issue.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not the greatest fan of estate taxes. My main issue with them is that they basically force you to have some degree of returns otherwise your money disappears, which is IMO kinda sad as it encourages people to invest in even greedier ways. You can e.g. buy a rental property and come up with shitty reasons to evict the tenants. Or you can buy it and keep them around for as long as they live.')
