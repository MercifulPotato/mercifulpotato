If someone kills your child, you can hate them. If an automated car kills your child, you don&#x27;t have anyone to hate. Saying that this is about safety thresholds is a distraction from the true human problem exposed by automated cars:<p>&quot;Which individual will held accountable and risk jailtime if their car kills someone you love, and how can this individual be identified from the appropriate government registries within 24 hours of a death?&quot;<p>Until this is clearly defined in law, automated driving will continue to be resisted under any number of plausible justifications, and arguing with those justifications will have little effect.')
