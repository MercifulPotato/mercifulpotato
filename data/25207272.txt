I never hold a position for more than a week, and occasionally trade the same position several times within a one-day period. I&#x27;m on version 5 of my robot, and have recently been thinking of turning the data it gathers into a service to make it easy for other developers to get real-world data at a reasonable price.<p>I use my data to search for inefficiencies (however small) that exist in the market. I then arbitrage these efficiencies on a weekly basis. I do this across stocks, options, and futures (not Forex). To be clear my goal is not to find &quot;stocks that will pop&quot;, or &quot;stocks that will plummet&quot;, rather I purely exploit micro-inefficiencies that exist in the \nmarket, which means this cannot work at scale.')
