Would make the logistics of sourcing the same &quot;everything&quot; a lot simpler.<p>Intuitively, I&#x27;d expect that fabs would plan for this in advance, ensuring that 1. everything they buy, they have ways to get N of the exact same of that thing down the line â€” the same way that NASA missions contract to ensure they can get precisely-specced replacement parts decades down the line; and 2. that they build their first plant for a given process node in a huge empty expanse of land (much larger than what Plant No. 1 needs) where they either buy all that land ahead of time, or at least have a contract with the municipality to retain right-of-first-refusal on purchases of that land.')
