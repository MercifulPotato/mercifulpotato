Item(by='mytailorisrich', descendants=None, kids=[25231498, 25228542, 25230353], score=None, time=1606469176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25226871, text='Same happened to me and the locksmith just used a piece of strong plastic sheet (like credit cards in the movies) between the door and the door frame to open the latch bolt. It took about 2 minutes...<p>And once it also happened (I know...) with a secure door and lock, and although the locksmith had to break the lock he managed in under 10 minutes.<p>My conclusion is that residential doors and locks, even secure, expensive ones, are no match for professionals. They protect against opportunity theft and idiots.')
