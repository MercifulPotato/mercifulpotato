The one making the decisions is the head doctor in the hospital, because they have the most power.<p>They know fuck-all about software and fuck-all about the day to day work of the nurses and doctors who need to use the product every day.<p>And this is pretty much how we ended up giving Epic Systems 774 million for their MUMPS-flavoured piece of shit rebranded as &quot;Apotti&quot;. And the project - started in 2015 - isn&#x27;t even done, nor bug-free yet. The American model of everything being cost first didn&#x27;t fit the Finnish model of medicine - to the surprise of no-one outside of the organisation.<p>It was so bad that other cities refused to use it and went with their own solutions instead of using Apotti.')
