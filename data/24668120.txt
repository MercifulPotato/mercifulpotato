Swapping suns isn&#x27;t a thing outside of fiction.<p>As to me, since you made it personal, I&#x27;m sure somebody at an AT&amp;T store could attempt SIM swapping but they might have trouble because the system won&#x27;t give them my number from a completely different numbering system (different county) without a code they don&#x27;t have.<p>If you socially manipulate your way into getting a transfer out code (good luck with that, but I&#x27;m willing to accept it could happen) then the big problem is I don&#x27;t use SMS 2FA, as I wrote in the comment you&#x27;re replying to, so it&#x27;s a dead end.')
