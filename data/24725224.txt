The whole intent behind this type of positive discrimination is not to hold any specific race back, but to equalize the outcomes for some people that have been systematically disadvantaged in the past.<p>Part of the assumption behind equalizing outcomes is that it might illuminate negative discriminatory behavior, and allow the system to equalize on it&#x27;s own faster than it would without any intervention. I&#x27;d love to hear more about when &amp; whether this works. If it does help fix racism, maybe it&#x27;s worth some temporary action. If it doesn&#x27;t help fix the underlying issue, then maybe the Justice Department is doing the right thing.')
