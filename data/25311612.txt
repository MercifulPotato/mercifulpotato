With so high trade deficits, we are essentially saying to the world, &quot;sell me goods in exchange for the paper that I printed some big numbers on it&quot;, without getting as much in return.<p>Do you think this is sustainable in the long run? Will they keep giving us more goods&#x2F;services than they get? What would happen if they decide to not use US dollar as reserve or they start demanding another currency for trade?')
