But the difference is in which side is favored.<p>In the more common usage, the charge of hypocrisy comes from someone who is in favor of the stated value, the &quot;preaching&quot;, and is opposed to the inconsistent act or &quot;practice&quot;. In this case, the belief that the Governors should follow their own coronavirus restrictions.<p>But you also see a lot of the opposite. People who rail against hypocrisy because they are against the stated <i>value</i>, and are more than fine with the &quot;practice&quot;. In this case, people who are opposed to the coronavirus restrictions, but then are all too happy to scream hypocrisy anyway.<p>The latter case really aggravates me. It almost makes me feel their charges of hypocrisy are hypocritical somehow. At least, I wish the difference would be pointed out more often. It really is a different phenomenon. I think the former case has more moral authority, and the latter case is bad faith.<p>EDIT: Thanks for followup comments. After thinking about it more, I can think of plenty of other examples where I&#x27;m against the stated value and get aggravated at hypocrisy, so I guess I don&#x27;t believe it is bad faith after all. The <i>difference</i> between the two motivations still interests me though and I wish more people would be clear on which side they fall on (when they charge hypocrisy).')
