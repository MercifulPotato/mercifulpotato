I had a few consulting gigs here and there but nothing that pays enough to sustain life here. I have two kids who live in the area with their mother, otherwise I&#x27;d move away.<p>My problem is even with 25 years experience ( removed the first 15 from my resume)...I keep getting denied offers. I work with js for 10 years now, used all the modern frameworks. I don&#x27;t know what else to do. It seems all the bootcamps have flooded the js market with younger people.<p>I know I should be a staff or architect by now, but those positions rarely exist from what I&#x27;ve seen for FE. Also I am self taught so when I get the FAANG style &quot;hard core&quot; coding challenges I usually screw up. But even when someone talks to me on the phone they pass. Not even a tech screen.<p>Today I just got passed up saying they wanted someone with more experience working on teams. smh<p>I&#x27;m 46 btw, and am thinking of a career switch. What career should I persue?')
