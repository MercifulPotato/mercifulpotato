They&#x27;re recreating the old McDonalds fries, not the new because of the perceived superiority of the old ones, after all.<p>I only argue that if you&#x27;re going to be a snob, you should at least be a well-informed snob, though perhaps my intended humor came across poorly over the internet.<p>Imagine reading an article written by somebody who has never tried deep dish pizza (or any other kind) writing about their quest to replicate an old Dominos crust recipe.')
