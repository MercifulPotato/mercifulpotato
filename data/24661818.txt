I mean I can open flatseal and go disable Geeqie access to network and filesystem, so not sure how it is lacking - maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>Of course if I disable Geeqie access to the host FS it kind of defeats the purpose of the app, but at least I guess you can technically say it failed in that for Geeqie to operate as I expect it to, it needs access to the host fs.<p>EDIT: Seriously though, I am not sure how most of Gimp, VSCodium, PyCharm, Octave, Inkscape, Audacity or VLC will be useful to me or anybody else without host fs access.<p>Where the heck do you keep your stuff if not on your fs?<p>If you want to go fiddle with the specific directories that option is available to you in flatseal.<p>And I just had a look at some other apps like Bitwarden, Teams and Spotify, and there the permissions is much more constrained, for example none of those have blanket access to the host fs or home directory. Spotify for example is limited to xdg-music and xdg-pictures.<p>Another EDIT:<p>flatpak also does support blacklisting of directories, see nofilesystem in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.flatpak.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;flatpak-command-reference.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.flatpak.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;flatpak-command-reference...</a><p>I think support for this is lacking in flatseal currently but I&#x27;m sure it is coming.')
