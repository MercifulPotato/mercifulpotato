OP was probably ignoring those for a while. I dont remember windows forcefully updating at all<p>Those updates probably includes the bloatware microsoft adding and also needed security updates, but mentioning that wouldnt be as click baity. And this is a bloatware I am ok with. Takes no space and they are needed programs.<p>And if you are using notepad (which does not save your files automaticly) to write important stuff you deserve to lose them to be honest. Perhaps next time he will use microsoft word that was forcefully installed :) There are so many other alternatives even if you ignore online ones.')
