And changed to sleeping on my side.<p>In my case I had to tell people because I was quitting my job to have the procedure done. Some opinions from people in the healthcare field (nurses, etc) said I didn&#x27;t need surgery because I wasn&#x27;t overweight or old. Well they weren&#x27;t maxillofacial surgeons.')
