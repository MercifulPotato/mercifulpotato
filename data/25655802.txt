But coverage is patchy and uneven, and many families still suffer from food poverty.<p>How much better it would be for us to have a National Food Service, with country-wide service guarantees such that everyone&#x27;s nutritional needs can be met.<p>No more wondering where your next meal is coming from, or starving yourself to feed your kids, or eating unhealthily because it&#x27;s the cheapest option with the resources available. It&#x27;s just provided as needed and the cost is shared. Indeed you may even have paid for it already with your taxes, or will do in the future.<p>And a similar sort of thing should be done for housing, water, etc.')
