A cancer is not the same as a company, and the growth of a cancer is not the same as a growth of a company.<p>Living things increases entropy faster than dead things[1][2], and companies or organized economic activity increase entropy faster than non organized economic activity, and better (more profitable) companies do this better than less profitable ones, and bigger ones do this faster than smaller companies.<p>On average, the amount something costs is highly correlated to the how much it increased the entropy of the universe, where something that was more expensive than something else usually resulted in a higher increase in entropy.<p>This does not make companies that grow cancer any more than it makes life that evolves to increase entropy faster is cancer, it just in line with the universe&#x27;s tendency to transition to states of higher entropy and to select for processes that increase entropy faster, like life on earth, which is much better at increasing entropy now than 4 billion years ago.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yKbJ9leUNDE&amp;list=PLoaVOjvkzQtyZF-2VpJrxPz7bxK_p1Dd2&amp;index=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yKbJ9leUNDE&amp;list=PLoaVOjvkzQ...</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Entropy_and_life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Entropy_and_life</a>')
