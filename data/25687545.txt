Transferring or backing up history between disparate devices, which become trusted at different times, is one of those things that I think _is_ difficult to do without sacrificing security.<p>For example, in the classic case when a user adds a new device and wants history to be available on both you can&#x27;t let the devices controlled by one person simply sync with one another.  To do so would be making a security concession to the other members of the chat in that they no longer verify every destination of their message.  If you are unwilling to make a security concession everything in this area becomes magnitudes more difficult.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is impossible, but it&#x27;s definitely not trivial.<p>My gut reaction is also that it is difficult to _guarantee_ history in this type of security first mindset.  If you add a new device and someone doesn&#x27;t approve&#x2F;verify&#x2F;trade encryption keys with the additional client then there isn&#x27;t much you can do besides not make that data available no?  So I don&#x27;t think it unreasonable for developers to hold the mindset that history is not a priority for a security first application.')
