There&#x27;s no market price, and the company is only worth whatever investors can be convinced to pay for it.<p>To take your example: my hypothetical 10% isn&#x27;t worth $2m -- it&#x27;s worth an unknown amount (one hopes more than the $100k it started at). Only after somebody is willing to pay $5m for 20% of the company can one realistically say what my (now 8.2%) shares are worth.')
