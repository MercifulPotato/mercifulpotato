The fact that the parties might agree on something doesn’t immunize a Senator who voted for that thing of responsibility for the vote. NAFTA was bipartisan too (61-38 with 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats) and Trump strongly opposed that. The Iraq war was nearly unanimous and it would be totally fair to criticize Biden for that.<p>I actually have no idea whether this was a good bill or not. But who else voted along with Biden doesn’t really tell you anything. And that’s why it shouldn’t be the province of fact checking. It’s political defense of Biden’s vote.')
