Not all Catholics in her social circle are the same but many are. I can&#x27;t say she has a political social circle, so maybe she is able to balance her beliefs because she isn&#x27;t called on them. The issues her and her friends care about tend to be about extending entitlement programs, public education, assistance to immigrants, and things of a similar nature. For these the Democrats are much more inline with their views than Republicans, which is probably how she and other Catholics like her justify supporting the pro-choice political party despite being strongly against abortion.')
