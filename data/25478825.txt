It should only occur when you genuinely have no way whatsoever to prevent the exception, as such, it will be pretty rare.<p>Again, it does happen, for example we have an unstable legacy db we hit that we don&#x27;t have access to, but it should be fixed asap.<p>Tbh, this is a constant argument between our juniors and I. They want to write 15 line methods, but I <i>have</i> found that they don&#x27;t want to debug it.<p>It&#x27;s constantly them building quickly on top of my code and then me having to fix theirs because they get frustrated debugging their own code.')
