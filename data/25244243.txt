Thank you, I really appreciate your comment.<p>A powerful and dysfunctional IT department is indeed a horrible business practice.<p>The transactions between IT and staff are glibly treated as some sort of internal vendor&#x2F;client relationship.  But the vendor (IT) isn’t responsible to the client (me.)  The vendor’s performance is reviewed by their management, and their management’s management.<p>At some point up the tree the reporting structures do converge, but that nexus is sufficiently distant that any technical feedback is weeks old and diluted.<p>Luckily, the battle with IT is such a tiny part of my job that I’ve decided to just check out completely.  For part of my work I provide my own devices, network, and software and I’m quite open (constructively, with my manager) about the fact that I do so, and why.<p>I’m stoic about how the org chooses to interpret me voting with my feet like this.  Meanwhile I can focus on doing work, which is mostly what I care about.<p>Sometimes though, the idea of working at such a dysfunctional org makes me feel a deep unease.  My employer might also feel unease.  We may choose, unilaterally or bilaterally, to terminate our relationship and find partners that are a better fit.  Life’s too short to fight all the time.')
