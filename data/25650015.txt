The reader will just come out of the 30 minute read, or 40 minute video, knowing how to implement a very specific system design solution, and would have trouble adapting and wavering away from it in a real world (and that includes interview) context.<p>The YT channel linked above, and the O&#x27;Reilly Designing Data Intensive Applications are so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve seen, and having been on both sides of the interview, it&#x27;s pretty clear when someone has actually &quot;grokked&quot; system design, vs bullet consumed a bunch of blog posts and videos on &quot;grokking&quot; system design.')
