It&#x27;s flat, dense, everything is close by, and clean.  I&#x27;d be content to walk 45-50 mins to get somewhere.<p>In SF, I dread having to walk, bike or take public transit anywhere.  It&#x27;s unpleasant, unsafe, smells horrible and there&#x27;s rampant petty crime.  And not just one district, it&#x27;s like that in most of the areas you need to go to')
