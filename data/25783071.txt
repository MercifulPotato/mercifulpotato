True, that can be based on a consensus algorithm involving multiple parties in the real world, but it always ends up requiring trust that those real-world entities are playing by the rules. If we&#x27;re relying on the good faith of real-world entities, how is a smart contract any better than a legal contract (a human would have to step in as the arbiter in either case)?')
