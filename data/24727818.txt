Indeed, some suggest that e.g. skin colour may largely homogenise within a thousand years.<p>A thousand years might sound like a very long time wrt. a single individual&#x27;s lifespan, but for these issues it is nothing at all. In addition, some traits (e.g. pale skin colour) are quite recent from what we know.')
