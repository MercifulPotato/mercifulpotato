This is a 3 year undergrad with a 2 year masters. I went this route and I am glad I did.<p>Initially, I wanted to do mechatronics engineering but I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure so I did a Bachelor of Science at UoM, I did some mechanical eng subjects and kind of realized that I hated the math there so I switched into comp sci.<p>Now I am specializing my masters in distributed computing. \nIt&#x27;s really worked out well for me, I have a solid understanding of math thanks to my engineering background and math subjects that I did, this has been very helpful for the theoretical comp sci subjects that I am undertaking.')
