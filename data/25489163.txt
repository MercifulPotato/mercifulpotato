Emotions aren&#x27;t easy - they&#x27;re work. Like with many things though, the work pays off over time.<p>The most surprising part of therapy to me was just how rational, analytical, and logical it all is. Like, things start to make sense which didn&#x27;t before. Therapy has many components but identifying irrational distortions in our own thought processes is a huge part of it. Which strengthens our ability to rationally assess and interact with our own feelings as they arise.<p>Thus, counterintuitively, embracing emotional work actually decreases the discomfort&#x2F;negative impacts of the unpleasant or negative emotions we wish to avoid. Unfortunately, avoidance actually makes it worse.<p>And therapy often feels unpleasant, but, so does exercise. And therapy&#x27;s a lot less unpleasant than whatever motivates one to engage in therapy to begin with ;).<p>LOL FWIW I&#x27;ve basically found that personal growth is a process of discovering my own backwards&#x2F;inverted internal logics. : &#x2F;.<p>If the stuff I said before resonates, FYI, it&#x27;s all basically cribbed from Buddhist thought or research on mindfulness (UCLA has a pretty good center doing mindfulness research &amp; this is a good book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uclahealth.org&#x2F;marc&#x2F;fully-present" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uclahealth.org&#x2F;marc&#x2F;fully-present</a>).<p>I got lucky enough to be able to do (still do) a significant amount of therapy w&#x2F;a skilled shrink (psychologist with Phd with at least some cognitive-behavioral background work, ideally having significant clinical experience) which has been a huge help to me. I also got lucky and the shrink in question had excellent judgement and was the right kind of person for me, which is critical. Seen bad shrinks too.<p>Lol so all this means I&#x27;m definitely biased from my own experience.<p>FWIW I hope you find opportunities to cultivate the good emotions as they arrive in your life, from a simple cup of coffee (or whatever you like) to whatever. In addition to it&#x27;s own benefits, this has been shown to improve our ability to manage or mitigate negative emotions in a healthy way.<p>I don&#x27;t do it enough but there&#x27;s significant amounts of research showing that writing in a journal (about anything) about ten minutes a day has really positive mental health outcomes, as does making a daily short list of 2-3 small things (like coffee ; ) to be grateful for.<p>And of course stuff like exercise, yoga, some kind of physical activity. Sorry if I&#x27;ve gotten preachy - as you can tell it&#x27;s something I have strong feelings about, hah, pun intended.<p>Point being, while I can&#x27;t speak to your circumstances, as a general rule it&#x27;s actually very simple and straightforward to apply (but simple isn&#x27;t the same as easy! Doing 101 pushups - simple, not easy) all the good science around specific, straightforward techniques for increasing genuine and healthy positive emotions, and mitigating the discomfort of negative ones or sort of neutralizing them altogether.<p>And all of this eventually helps one cease any self-destructive coping&#x2F;self-medication behaviors (which I have done&#x2F;do) - drugs, alcohol, computer games, overwork, etc, which, <i>in this context</i>, beyond their moment of actual use, make negative emotions worse and make it tougher to experience positive emotions.<p>Like mastery of any skill it takes patience and time but pays off in a big way.<p>peace! :)<p>-a')
