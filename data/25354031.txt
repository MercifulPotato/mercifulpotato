You could see the court use something similar to Alabama v Arizona or possibly Mass. v Missouri. If they deny on standing, they can remove themselves from the spotlight while not having to decide on the merits which are extremely radioactive given that the future of the court is intertwined (albeit indirectly) in the outcome of any merits finding.')
