I set the bottom row and pinky keys to also have lots of modifiers &amp; layer toggles, and my pinky-fingers can hit those modifiers&#x2F;toggles when needed. Then moved basically all symbols to another layer on easy-to-reach keys.<p>This means I can type regular words as fast as I want, and can easily reach any symbol when I need it. Only downside is that it takes some adjusting and practice, but I personally think it was worthwhile')
