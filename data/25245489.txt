There are many people, like me, that barely have a sense of smell to begin with. I would never buy a scented candle for myself. But if I didn&#x27;t really know that Scott myself, maybe I would suddenly decide to get one based on an article about covid and scented candles and then be disappointed. The reason I say this is I didn&#x27;t really know how bad my sense of smell was until my son was born and I started dealing with various odours that I could handle easily and others found far stronger.')
