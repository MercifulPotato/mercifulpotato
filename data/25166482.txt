Maybe private care is better than public care, i don&#x27;t know, but insurance? Swisslife (one of the best&#x2F;most efficient in my country) reimburse 65 to 67% of their anual income, so roughly 33% of what you&#x27;re giving them goes into administration&#x2F;coordination fees. Public insurance? 20% of the money they receive via taxes are used for administration&#x2F;coordination.<p>So if i had a choice, i would pay a premium on public insurance (more taxes, or instead, asking my bosses to give the 120â‚¬&#x2F;mo to the public insurance instead of paying swisslife). Better ROI.')
