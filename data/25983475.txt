And it’s had a really negative impact, ranging from damaged relationships (both within and outside the workplace) to a serious mental health emergency (my coping mechanisms were basically damaging and deteriorating).<p>It takes a lot of courage to recognize something isn’t right. It takes a lot less courage to change it if you’re determined and have resources&#x2F;access to resources.<p>If you haven’t already, reach out to people who know your value and talk about wanting to make a change. You might be surprised by the opportunity to try something new and get into a situation that makes you feel happier.<p>Thank you for taking the leap to ask here open ended, and to come back and share your thoughts. It’s helped me remember why I left my last job and what I want in my next one.')
