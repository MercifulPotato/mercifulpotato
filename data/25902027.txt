The plot refers to a B+tree implementation optimised for main-memory (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panthema.net&#x2F;2007&#x2F;stx-btree&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panthema.net&#x2F;2007&#x2F;stx-btree&#x2F;</a>). We didn&#x27;t show the performance for larger&#x2F;smaller page sizes because in our machine they performed poorly. Indeed, you can see from the figure that the fastest B+tree configuration had page size set to 512 bytes. The one using 1024-byte pages is already much slower, that&#x27;s why we didn&#x27;t clutter the plot with page sizes larger than 1k ;)')
