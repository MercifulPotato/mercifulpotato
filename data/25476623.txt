We can keep dementia patients safe, and I can find my fucking keys.<p>Also AR porn is going to be wild.<p>However, we really have to interrogate the technology it&#x27;s self.<p>Ar needs hyper accurate location to work. This means both SLAM and off device location services.<p>To make the location services work we need a global database of visual keypoints to allow devices figure out their position to the nearest MM. We are not far away from that now. (google have already launched a service in google maps.)<p>This means that any picture taken in public, or in view of windows, will leak your location.<p>What I worry about most is Apps that might be allowed to run on these glasses.<p>With mm level location services, and onboard acceleration for face detection and recognition, its trivial for an app maker to create a Uber stalking app.')
