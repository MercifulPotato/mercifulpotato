Google&#x27;s report states images could appear and disappear from Google&#x27;s cache of Docker Hub at any moment, and a cache miss could result in containers failing to start.<p>The resolution steps are frustrating as well. Every Kubernetes pod that depends on a public image needs a `imagePullSecrets` setting, and every Kubernetes namespace needs a Docker pull secret.<p>My opinions on this change notwithstanding, I think the timeline for this change was too short for the magnitude of the impact.')
