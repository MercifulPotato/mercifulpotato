Throwing it again and redoing it has a high cost, staying with it has a (high?) cost. But if you want custom code or very specific code, it&#x27;s going to be one-off.<p>So yes, in general you can say that open source has better quality, because the best rise to the top, while in proprietary code it is what it is.')
