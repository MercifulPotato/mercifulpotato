An entry wound would not explode out like that. The thing that throws people off is that his head moves back when the front blows off.  I think that would be a natural movement from the force of the bullet exiting and blowing off the front of the skull but you also have to remember that he had a terrible back with limited mobility. As a person who also has a bad back, if you get pushed forward to the fullest of your flexibility, you will recoil back with force.<p>I was raised to believe in multiple shooters but I donâ€™t see it here.  One shooter.')
