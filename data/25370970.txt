[0]<p>Consider the fact that lab safety protocols are designed to contain pathogens, which creates very poor conditions for viruses to naturally evolve and transfer zoonotically, whereas Gain-of-Function research has the express aim of creating ideal conditions for evolution which is both directed and can proceed many orders of magnitude faster.<p>*Also, there&#x27;s plenty of doubt as to whether RaTG13[1] actually exists; we just have the RNA sequence and we&#x27;re currently just taking Beijing&#x27;s word for that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan-lab-millions-us-dollars-risky-coronavirus-research-1500741" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news-medical.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200910&#x2F;Scientists-claim-serious-data-discrepancies-in-RaTG13-sequence.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news-medical.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200910&#x2F;Scientists-claim-...</a>')
