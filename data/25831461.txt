Item(by='gyulai', descendants=None, kids=[25832294, 25832327], score=None, time=1611047848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823546, text='Many people here are commenting on the fact that public broadcasters tend to do documentaries and educational programming which wouldn&#x27;t be able to survive at that level of quality under a free market system, which seems to be a cause that almost everyone can get behind and an argument frequently being used for defending this system.<p>What riles me up personally: the ludicrous sums of money that these broadcasters pay for rights to broadcast the olympics and other major sports events.  I really don&#x27;t understand why I should be forced to give money to corrupt organizations like FIFA and the IOC to hold sports events that I don&#x27;t watch and otherwise don&#x27;t have a stake in, just because I happen to live in Germany, to make this stuff more affordable for other Germans.<p>Another thing that I find infuriating about the German system:  You have to pay even if you don&#x27;t watch and don&#x27;t even own a television and even non-residential addresses and addresses used solely for business purposes have to pay.  The only exception is that a home office within a residential premise doesn&#x27;t have to pay twice.  But in some cases you might actually have to.  For example if you have a residential home and run a car repair shop out of your garage, then you have to pay a second set of fees for the shop on top of the fees that you already pay for the residential home, even if there is no programming ever being consumed in either of the two.<p>I also find the collection tactics highly questionable: When you register your business, they send you an invoice for paying that second set of fees for the business and never advise you of the home office exemption.  It was only because of how infuriated I was that I did some legal research and then managed to claim the exemption after exchanging some letters with them.  I bet most people don&#x27;t do that and just pay up, which adds to the unfairness of the system.')
