I do some minor diy stuff and I can&#x27;t imagine not imagining stuff. I do draw on paper to brainstorm and use CAD but most of the design problem solving goes on in my head.<p>But then I am also an artist... Although more because of this than the other way around. Although drawing has further trained this ability, I have accurate detailed childhood (~5-6y) memories (of houses, schools, objects, etc) from before I was drawing consistently enough for it to matter (high school).<p>I wonder, can people who see 0 imagine movement if they&#x27;re seeing the object right in front of them? And if they can draw 3d objects, can they still do so if they close their eyes?')
