That was over 180 years ago. There were no phases, clinical trials or testing standards back then. Real medicine and snake oil were difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish.<p>Before Jenner, there were groups inoculating people with actual Smallpox (typically in the nose, because it was quicker to recover from). The Chinese started doing that 500 years ago, and it was even used by troops in the American revolutionary war. Some of those people would die of course, but the ones who recovered would have an immunity.<p>A lot of people may have died from many of these early tests, but so many people were dying it didn&#x27;t quite matter.')
