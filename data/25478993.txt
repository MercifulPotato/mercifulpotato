It&#x27;s basically irrelevant as it is not really a reflection of his contribution at all, but merely a formality or symbolic.<p>My only point is when you&#x27;re talking about his growth in wealth, you&#x27;re always de facto talking about his stock holdings and their growth and the idea of objective compensation goes out the window. In fact, even if you&#x27;re talking about straight compensation, it still is part of the discussion because clearly in this case, he is willing to take a paltry salary because he is benefiting from massive stock value growth.<p>As for this point:<p>&gt;If we assume that Amazon is fairly valued and that Jeff Bezos&#x27;s holdings of Amazon are in line with his contributions<p>He is not being &#x27;compensated&#x27; via stock nor is the total amount of stock he holds fluctuating based some sort of objective analysis of his contribution. He could contribute nothing and retire and still hold the same amount. So I don&#x27;t know how you can assume that.')
