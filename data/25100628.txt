I feel as though there&#x27;s a lot of peer pressure to say <i>I love working from home, and I&#x27;m so much more productive!</i><p>I hate it, it makes me miserable and I&#x27;m much less productive.<p>I&#x27;m back in the office 5 days per week again, through choice. Most of the time, I&#x27;m there on my own, but get to see others when they show up, and also get to leave work at the office, come home and relax.')
