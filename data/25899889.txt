I&#x27;ve outlined what I think it should do here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krita-artists.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;color-corrector-for-scene-linear-workflow&#x2F;1063" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krita-artists.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;color-corrector-for-scene-linear...</a><p>I think the biggest hurdle to clear is that it needs a custom color widget, the OS widgets are not suitable due to assuming a 0...1 range.<p>Krita&#x27;s a great piece of software and I readily admit I&#x27;m jus shamelessly trying to get someone to fix my pet peeve. But I also really do think this one feature is mostly what stands in the way of ditching Photoshop and using Krita for VFX work. In many other ways, including OpencolorIO support natively, Krita is already way ahead of Adobe&#x27;s offering.')
