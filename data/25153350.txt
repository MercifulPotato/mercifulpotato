I hadn&#x27;t considered room lighting - though I also need it bright enough for pen and paper.<p>Resolution seems ok - I zoom in when needed, which is rare. Some pdf&#x27;s have lines too long to fit on the screen, for the text to be large enough - but they are also rare. I think a 10&quot; would solve that (held lanscape, 10&quot; is basically A4 portrait width, if you zoom out the margins). So it doesn&#x27;t feel like resolution is a problem - although some people say fuzzier text tires eyes.')
