Even though he was extremely apprehensive in the beginning of the call, he was slowly &quot;eased into&quot; talking top-secret stuff on the non-secure phoneline. This was so incredible that his last words on the call were &quot;I was shocked by your questions. Was this OK that we talked about this on a non-secure line?&quot;. That&#x27;s crazy. What chance do normal people have against such a good social engineer?<p>2) The amount of pro-Putin commenters in this thread (mind that some of these comments are dead), claiming that this is a CIA false flag or some such.')
