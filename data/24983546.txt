The monitoring exists but as a reactive force not a proactive one. As the parent commenter said, there isn&#x27;t the protections that the west has nor the expectations that come with it. Someone steals your credit card info and you&#x27;re SOL (Or WeChat&#x2F;AliPay account since nobody actually uses credit cards). Nobody&#x27;s going to go after the bank for allowing it to happen so there&#x27;s no risk to the bank or to WeChat&#x2F;Alipay. Of course the monitoring exists and the banks will do whatever they need to do in order to make the CCP happy.<p>But one thing to keep in mind is that China is a very litigious society, where it has a lot of laws that are very strict but weakly enforced. It creates a situation where almost any person or organization could be tried for a crime should they piss off the wrong the person. In that environment, the bank doesn&#x27;t really care if it follows all regulation, as long as it&#x27;s keeping the people who matter happy.')
