I can understand how that might be off-putting or even obstructive to some though. But being too flexible is in a way what made CMake and autotools so bad.<p>I have only done really small stuff with Meson, so I haven&#x27;t had problems like the Emscripten one you described and I can&#x27;t say much about it.<p>Regarding static libs Meson docs explicitly state that &quot;library&quot; is preferred over &quot;shared_library&quot;, so that you can choose at build configuration time. If some dependency of yours does not follow this advice without having a good reason for it the fault is with them.<p>I use CMake over Makefiles, because for libraries you want people to be able to easily integrate your stuff, so you need to use what everyone uses. And in general it&#x27;s still the best way to have a (mostly) platform-independent build. Yes, almost all non-trivial CMake files have a bunch of platform-specific extra stuff, but at least you can do it. I also cannot believe how bad the dependency finding works. It actually doesn&#x27;t work more than it does work. Very often even with libraries that I installed through my systems package manager. I also consider CMake horribly flawed, but it&#x27;s still better than raw Makefiles.')
