There&#x27;s &quot;uptime monitoring&quot; and there&#x27;s &quot;write your own ad hoc failure injection&quot; and not a lot of agreed techniques around it.<p>A number of the open source &quot;chaos engineering&quot; tools are really &quot;just&quot; failure injection tools but that&#x27;s still pushing the state of the art forward IMO.')
