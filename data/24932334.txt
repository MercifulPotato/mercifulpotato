Item(by='pajko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603989345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930542, text='At 14, I wrote a functional virus on paper, hand-calculated the jump offsets and entered the &quot;code&quot; in debug.com. The first version was 273 bytes long. It did not do much, just printing the BELL character, then looking for non-infected COM files in the current directory and infecting one of them.\nF-Prot identified it as a generic virus and killed it.\nThat made me a little mad at that time, so added some polymorphism to it by decoding and encoding the virus code with a different key every time (using XOR). The code size has increased by about 60 bytes, and only around 10 bytes were unencrypted, which did the in-place decryption in memory.\nF-Prot identified it as a generic polymorph virus and killed it again...\nAfter that tried to make it resident, but intercepting the int 21h calls turned out to be a tough nut to crack, so tried to do something with EXE files instead. A basic variant was nearly ready, when I have fucked up my 40MB hard drive and lost everything... But that&#x27;s an other story of my early self-education :)')
