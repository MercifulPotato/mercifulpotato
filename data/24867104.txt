The code was written with Notepad++ (no IDE), no comments except when they copy pasted something from the internet, most variables are single letter and it&#x27;s the biggest spaghetti bowl I have ever seen.<p>To add insult to injury I have no experience with PHP (apart from peeking at this code to fix a minor bug here and there). To be fair the app works OK and has done the job for all those years.<p>This app has never been updated so it&#x27;s PHP version 4 or 5 I think, it runs on an old Debian 5 VM, it&#x27;s not facing internet, internal use only. It was supposed to be deprecated last year, but now given our budget (or lack thereof) and the sheer incompetence of our new provider I don&#x27;t see it happening soon.<p>Is there a way for me to have an IDE with a kind of &quot;compiler&quot; that would help me convert this to PHP 8 so I can migrate it on a more recent VM? \nOf course there&#x27;s 0 budget for this.')
