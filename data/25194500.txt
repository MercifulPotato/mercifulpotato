Item(by='rsynnott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606183803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189059, text='Apple tends to make sure they work properly before releasing (usually; please ignore the dodgy keyboards), is a big part of it, I think. Like, Microsoft had an ARM laptop-y thing a couple of years ago, but it was terrible. There were airpod-y things a year or so before the AirPods; they just weren&#x27;t very good. And so on.<p>And Apple has a reputation now for releasing new things which more or less work. I&#x27;m sure far more people bought an M1 MacBook before the reviews were available than bought an ARM Surface, because there&#x27;s a fairly strong expectation that the Apple thing will be decent, whereas there&#x27;s no particular expectation about the Surface (or, if you&#x27;d used Microsoft&#x27;s previous effort, the Surface RT, an _extremely negative_ expectation).<p>And notice that when Apple _does_ screw up (again, see the keyboard), people get very, very annoyed. Dell XPSes tended to have serious coil whine noise for a few years, but no-one really talked about it; if one MacBook had made an untoward sound we&#x27;d be talking about Coilgate for the next five years.')
