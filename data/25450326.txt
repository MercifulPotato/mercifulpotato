It&#x27;s way cheaper to run a targeted ad campaign than buy up a bunch of billboards on a busy freeway. It&#x27;s also more effective because people can click through and buy right away. All the ads are sold on an auction basis, so their price is directly connected to their utility to the buyer. I fail to see how the ad buyer is harmed.')
