I&#x27;ll expand on one as well:<p>&gt; try to reduce inflammation<p>Avoid the obvious things (alcohol, drugs) but also your diet has a huge effect on systemic inflammation.  It&#x27;s one theory as to why caloric restriction works.  Simply eating less, means less inflammation.<p>But WHAT you eat also matters.  As it turns out, SUGAR is highly inflammatory.

Part of living life, is enjoying good food.  And as it happens, a lot of good food is full of fat and sugar.
