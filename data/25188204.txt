The full physical  function of a piano can be described quite simply as a set of keys that cause mallets to hit strings (ignoring the pedals because you can play a piano without pedals, but not a piano without keys). The full physical function of something like a car or computer can&#x27;t be described so simply, yet in those fields swappable parts and customization are taken for granted. Swappable keyboards, swappable pedals, maybe even swappable mallets. These would preserve the timbre and function of a traditional piano, while also accommodating personal preference and variation. Is it so inconceivable to imagine that maybe there is some room for innovation with classical instruments?')
