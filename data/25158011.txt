Issue 1 is not affected M1 machine, in fact they’re blowing current machine, which is in itself a reason for adopting.<p>On issue 2, well the Windows App store has never been an attractive platform. MS tried multiple times to shove it down users throat, which build some antagonism. Moreover, it’s actually MS’ second iteration on this principle (Arm+forced store usage), where the first one failed spectacularly (Windows RT tablets). So, it’s crazy to expect a different results when the same parameters (store locking) are used again, and no sane company or individual would bet on this.')
