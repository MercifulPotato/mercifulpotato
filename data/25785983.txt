So it does not use Bitcoin as oracle. It uses Bitcoin as a settlement layer. (Oracles like Chainlink can be, and are being, built using Clarity lang for Stacks blockchain itself.)<p>For using Bitcoin state on Ethereum, you&#x27;ll need to implement Bitcoin SPV proofs. It&#x27;s entirely possible but fairly complicated to do that given (a) Ethereum is a separate network that can fork independently from Bitcoin (Clarity contracts on Stacks fork with Bitcoin), and (b) Eth miners have no native visibility into Bitcoin state (Stacks miners have full visibility into Bitcoin state). Possible but more complicated. Further, any asset generation and transfers etc on such ERC20 asset would have nothing to with Bitcoin vs on Stacks all asset generation and transfers etc settle on Bitcoin and are secured by the Bitcoin main blockchain.')
