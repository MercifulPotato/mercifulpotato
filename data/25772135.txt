As a maintainer, I don&#x27;t want a legitimate issue to get closed just because it&#x27;s not (yet?) a high priority for me, and I let it go for a while.  And as a user, if I&#x27;ve provided sufficient information to reproduce the issue, and the issue is valid, it&#x27;s really demotivating to have that issue closed by a bot.')
