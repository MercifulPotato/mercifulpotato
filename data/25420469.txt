Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607967606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419634, text='&gt; I can see how this could be called sophisticated, but worry about language inflation because we still need something to describe technical feats that are govt&#x2F;military level like Stuxnet.<p>To start, I want to clear a potential confusion in my previous comment.  By &quot;technical wizardry&quot; I meant &quot;technical <i>hacking</i> wizardry,&quot; e.g. buffer overflows, ROP, etc.<p>That said, I think Stuxnet and this hack may actually both be characterized by some of the same kind of sophistication I was referring to.  IIRC, one of the biggest unique things about Stuxnet was the application of professional software engineering practices to malware.  It wasn&#x27;t a quick and dirty thing that one or two guys whipped up, it was a project, developed professionally over time by a team, to meet a set of requirements and allow code-reuse, etc.  Not so much hacking wizardry but an application of government-scale money and personnel.')
