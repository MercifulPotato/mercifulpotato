Additional benefits such as Prime Video and Prime Music came along later.<p>Now, in the UK, next day delivery is often next 2 days or you get half your order one day and the rest some time later.<p>For Prime Video I&#x27;m now paying for random movies and TV shows because the included options are often poor. Somehow, I&#x27;m now also paying something like Â£13 a month for music that I was getting for &#x27;free&#x27; until I tried a 30 day upgrade that reverted to no music at all when I tried to cancel.<p>Despite this, sadly, for retail Amazon still beats the competition hands-down.')
