Did you think he mearly killed 6+ million people as an excuse to come to power while not believing it (not to mention he was already in power when he put that in process).<p>Before the &quot;final solution (gassing)&quot; was implemented, it was 8 years of progressive discrimination, and repressions, which were used to erode the whatever remaining civic fabric of the state.<p>And when they saw no real need left for the punchbag nation, and saw no further use for millions of inmates  (who still needed some minimal food, and shelter to prevent them going up in arms immediately,) and people who will eventually return Hitler a favour, they decided for a &quot;relatively clean solution.&quot;<p>The few surviving accounts of HSDAP top leaders own stances on the matter all confirm this.')
