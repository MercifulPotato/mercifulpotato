I love Apple laptops, but the OS-level back-button on Android is at least 1&#x2F;4 of the reason I prefer Android to iOS.<p>It&#x27;s just such a specific and weird feature that I never would have had the audacity to think &quot;hey, every single application will benefit from this being a constant fixture in the operating system.&quot; I know that applications can add a back button when they feel it&#x27;s necessary, and I know you can swipe to go back in iOS in various applications, but it&#x27;s just not the same.')
