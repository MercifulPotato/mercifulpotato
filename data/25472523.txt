Some had paper forms, especially initially, others used web forms.<p>People were worried that it would be easy to grab the filled out forms and get a restaurant&#x27;s guests&#x27; phone numbers and addresses (and it probably was). Predictably, one of the rushed web forms had non-existant security, making it easy to get all restaurants guests&#x27; phone numbers and addresses.')
