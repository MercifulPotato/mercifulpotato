While all the h.26x have commonalities but they don&#x27;t all have a linear relationship. Their commonalities are in high level concepts, not necessarily implementations.<p>As I said and thought I made clear, MPEG-1&#x2F;2 were unsuitable for streaming on consumer hardware of the era. The lowest practical bitrates for either was far higher than common dial-up rates. Neither spec supported Sub-QCIF frame sizes or frame rates below 15fps.<p>Similarly audio was a problem as the specs wanted to use MPEG audio which likewise did not have super low bitrate modes. A software decoder <i>could</i> handle such things but the content was outside of a spec so you&#x27;d need the encoder and decoder to work hand in hand to work reliably.<p>No one decided to develop h.263 and MPEG-4 just for funsies because MPEG-1&#x2F;2 handled everything with aplomb. Low bitrate&#x2F;high latency conditions (dial-up, cellular) were not well served by MPEG-1&#x2F;2.')
