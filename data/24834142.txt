There is no way to tell whether the other party is doing this and just one person in a group chat can accidentally &#x2F; on purpose back up the chat at any time.<p>Signal allows chat backups but it&#x27;s not the default option and the UX deliberately discourages this behaviour. They are also encrypted with a password which offers more security.')
