Meanwhile Python has a bunch of incompatible packaging systems which cause so much pain to so many programmers.<p>Did you know that pip won&#x27;t even resolve dependencies, and will break your programs silently? I certainly didn&#x27;t, because Python wasn&#x27;t my first language and therefore I assumed that the package manager will handle dependencies.<p>Like seriously, when a language designed by statisticians for statisticians (R) has a better packaging story than everyone&#x27;s second favourite language, something has gone horribly wrong.')
