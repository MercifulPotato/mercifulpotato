On lesser species, things such as number of offspring need to be measured (reproductive health seems to be the first to go a lot of times). On primates, we&#x27;d look for sperm count relative to a control group (again the first thing to go).<p>If any effect is seen at a 100x dose (of the amount expected to be ingested) the chemical would be dropped.')
