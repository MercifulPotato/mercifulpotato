Buying a stock believing it will increase in value is basically the point of the stock market. Believing it will increase in value because it&#x27;s been over-shorted is a legitimate reason to ascribe value to it.<p>&gt; The US Securities Exchange Act defines market manipulation as &quot;transactions which create an artificial price or maintain an artificial price for a tradable security&quot;.<p>It is my opinion that this demand is not artificial, it is genuine, although caused by factors other than the inherent value of the stock itself.<p>If this is considered to be &#x27;creating an artificial price&#x27;, I don&#x27;t see how a position where 140% of the shares of a company are shorted could not be, meaning significantly wider implications than just a single subreddit.')
