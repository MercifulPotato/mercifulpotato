Item(by='dimatura', descendants=None, kids=[25012035], score=None, time=1604701854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011651, text='Good to hear Theano has come back to life, it was my first deep learning library :). These days I do PyTorch, and while I really appreciate its debuggability and flexibility, I definitely can see in retrospect some of the advantages of Theano&#x27;s declarative approach.<p>In that regard, I am curious about why Tensorflow didn&#x27;t work out. I understand Tensorflow version 1 implements a declarative mode that I guess is in many ways similar to Theano&#x27;s. I&#x27;m assuming v2 still supports that mode, on top of the new eager mode -- is that the case? If so, was there some aspect of its implementation that made it unsuitable for PyMC?')
