That&#x27;s 4 seconds at the outside to evaluate a photo, make brightness and color corrections, next photo. No way I&#x27;d be able to sustain the same rate by having to mouse around and click at least four different targets, bouncing from brightness to magenta&#x2F;green to blue&#x2F;yellow back to magenta&#x2F;green to cyan&#x2F;red before giving brightness a final tweak. Fitt&#x27;s Law[1] is death to speed for all sorts of workflows.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that keyboard-based operation is superior in all cases, but a good keyboard-centric interface can eliminate the need to acquire a target (e.g. menu&#x2F;toolbar item) for the most common operations because there&#x27;s a hotkey.
