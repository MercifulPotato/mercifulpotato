This is so they can show the unsustainable growth that stock holders (still) demand from corporations.<p>They&#x27;ll look great on paper for a while as you say, at least until their cloud business fails for some reason.   When you average growth over a whole company, you do mask high performing parts with low performing ones... the same is true of cash flow and revenue.<p>If you get rid of parts of your company that are solid performers but aren&#x27;t doing as well now, then you&#x27;re getting rid of some of your safety net in the hope you won&#x27;t need it.<p>IBM&#x27;s most impactful business (in terms of wide use) is probably their research labs.   Many, many chips today  use SOI and copper interconnect technologies.   That sort of research doesn&#x27;t apply much to the cloud, but maybe they&#x27;re hoping their AI stuff will.')
