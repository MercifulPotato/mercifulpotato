Item(by='mwcampbell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602473836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748953, text='&gt; We will be selling servers.<p>Like you, I&#x27;m from the generation that grew up treating &quot;computer&quot; as synonymous with &quot;personal computer&quot;, i.e. something on a desk or in one&#x27;s lap. For some reason I can&#x27;t quite articulate, it saddens me that a new company with &quot;computer&quot; in the name is focusing on those other things called computers in far-away buildings that we can&#x27;t access. I hope that once Oxide starts making money from servers, it can branch out into workstations. Then, to me at least, it will more fully live up to the name &quot;Oxide Computer&quot;. Yes, I know this association is more emotional than logical, but there it is.')
