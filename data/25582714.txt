Offlining would have been nice though; had a couple faulty addresses that were busy, so all the MCE interrupts made the system really slow, and caused a ton of application congestion.<p>For USB serial console, I think part of the issue there is that the serial console can interface with the kernel debugger, which might be tricky if it&#x27;s USB (but I guess USB keyboards probably work in the kernel debugger, so maybe there&#x27;s a chance?).<p>Thanks for working on Ryzen ECC. I don&#x27;t work with a server farm anymore, and I&#x27;m too cheap to buy ECC for home use, but someday I might use that support.')
