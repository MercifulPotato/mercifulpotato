Growing such massive yields so densely consumes so much water in a relatively small area, such that the natural water cycle simply canâ€™t keep up and replenish it. A more diverse and lower yield farming practice would not have the same environmental impact. And at some level it comes back to having too many humans (mouths to feed).')
