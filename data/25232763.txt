And they got it by cramming for the exam like any other test. So my thoughts on Developer Associate are not very high.<p>Other developers have told me that one of the easiest ways to get a cert is to just pay someone in India to take the test for you in case you need it for a contract (for those developers in the consulting world).<p>Both being able to cram for it and it being required as part of crappy contracts but not genuinely mattering if the people doing the work did it seem like very negative signals about its value.')
