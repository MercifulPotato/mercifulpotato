My wife really wanted a Peloton so we got one. I&#x27;ve ended up selling my Wahoo and do power zone training on the Peloton. The pedal stroke is smoother, far less vibration and noise. I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping sweat off a bike or having a bike on&#x2F;off the trainer. It&#x27;s so easy and convenient to get a 45 or 60 minute session in that my FTP is higher than it&#x27;s ever been.<p>I came in skeptical but it&#x27;s been working well for me.')
