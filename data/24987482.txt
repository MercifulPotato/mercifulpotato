And I mean both the long term relationship and the expense having children part? The majority of my male friends are gay and while there are a lot of happily single men there&#x27;s also a significant chunk who are in healthy long term relationships and a load who are actively looking.<p>I know less about the children side but I know a few gay men who have adopted, single or as part of a couple, and they described the process as rigorous but not unduly so. I guess this depends where you live, I&#x27;m in Scotland, which is supposedly the least homophobic country in the world (an extremely depressing fact) so maybe it&#x27;s easier for gay men to adopt here.')
