How will it affect the next generation?<p>My daughter isn&#x27;t much older than this pandemic, and she&#x27;s been used to seeing people with face masks on her whole life; one of her first words is &quot;mask&quot;. She&#x27;s had to struggle her way through her first year not being able to use all of the usual visual cues we are used to seeing in peoples faces, but has done so without a hiccup that I can see, it&#x27;s just normal to her.')
