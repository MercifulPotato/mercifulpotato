So then you spin up a tools team to manage the engineering infrastructure since you can’t do it as-hoc anymore (CI, source control, etc). So to make that team more efficient, you let them force one size fits all solutions. While this may feel constraining for a given problem domain, it actually makes engineers more portable between projects within the company which is valuable. Thus having one DB or cloud thing that’s supported for all teams for all applications is valuable even if sometimes it isn’t necessarily the absolute best fit (and the complexity is similarly reduced as good companies will ensure there’s tooling to make those complex things easy to configure in consistent ways). Your tools team and the project team will work together to smooth out any friction points. Why? Because for larger numbers of engineers collaborating this is an efficient organization that takes advantage of specialization. A generalist may know a bit about everything (useful when starting) but a domain expert will be far more equipped to develop solutions (better results when you have the headcount).')
