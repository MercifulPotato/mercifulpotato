There&#x27;s probably a way to do it now from the command line.<p>Drives were much smaller and slower back then; getting rid of a few megabytes of unused across a bunch of apps could make a difference then.<p>The first Intel Mac mini in 2006 [1] started with a 60GB, 5400 RPM hard drive, so yeah optimizing space was a big deal back then.<p>There will come a time when macOS will only be updated for M1 Macs and there won&#x27;t be a need to ship Intel code any longer.
