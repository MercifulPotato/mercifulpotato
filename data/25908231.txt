Without satelite-satelite communication, both grounds stations have to be able to see the same satellite.<p>In GEO that&#x27;s not a problem - a lot of the planet is in sight. You have a ground station in New York and you can bounce off a satellite over the Atlantic and land the signal in Nigeria just fine.<p>With Starlink the orbits are really low, so the distance to the ground station is low. That&#x27;s fine if you are in the backwoods in Washington and bounce to a receiving station 100 miles away in Seattle, it&#x27;s no good if you&#x27;re at sea, or (in this case) at an Antarctic station -- one which can&#x27;t even see GEO satelites.')
