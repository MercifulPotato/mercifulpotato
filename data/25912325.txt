Slightly modifying the refractive collimating optics of the current design should make that approach possible.<p>I&#x27;d expect vibration in space to be a negligible issue, so an edge-mounted mirror should be stiff enough.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elib.dlr.de&#x2F;135960&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elib.dlr.de&#x2F;135960&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elib.dlr.de&#x2F;135960&#x2F;1&#x2F;1150604.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elib.dlr.de&#x2F;135960&#x2F;1&#x2F;1150604.pdf</a>')
