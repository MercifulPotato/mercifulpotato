What I do is, like, build little pieces of Google Maps over and over for people who need them but can’t just use Google Maps because they’re not allowed to for some reason, or another.<p>I&#x27;ve been working with web mapping for 15 years and I&#x27;ve never thought of saying it because it&#x27;s never been true for hundreds of applications. Google Maps has always been the worst map client to integrate with. OpenLayers, leaflet, MapBox and myriads of alternative data sources, layers, behaviors and widgets are more suitable for custom applications.<p>Some people seem to love a particular Google layer, like  <i>parcels</i> or <i>businesses</i>, but it never seemed vital unless they were trying replicate some Google Maps experience, in which case I would just advise to send a route or street view request directly to the Google Maps website or app, and be done with it.<p>The latest fad seems to be 3D terrain and 3D buildings. It&#x27;s so amazing in the product demso, but the real world usefulness?')
