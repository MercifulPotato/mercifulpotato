Linux commands I use on my production servers don&#x27;t work on my development environment.<p>I mean, you can dislike Powershell and love Unix tools, but your choice of words is remarkably funny.<p>If anything, Unix tools are archaic, generally organically grown and not that designed or designed based on principles from 50 years ago, in many cases principles that have been superseded.<p>Powershell actually has a design and a modern one.<p>Again, you might like one and dislike the other, it depends a lot on personal preference and familiarity.<p>But... Poor choice of words :-)')
