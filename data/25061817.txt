Netflix streams max out at 25 mbps, so even a 1gbps connection can support 40 people simultaneous streaming video.  The fastest game download I&#x27;ve ever seen only hit ~600mbps and was over in minutes.<p>I <i>love</i> maxing out my connection so would probably pay for 2gbps if offered but even I think its kind of a silly number at the moment.  There isn&#x27;t much consumer grade multigig networking equipment and the gear that does exist is easily 5x the price of the gigabit version.<p>Not complaining though!  Any internet speed upgrade is great news.')
