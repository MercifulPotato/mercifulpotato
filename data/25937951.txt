There are ways to use &#x27;class&#x27; keyword to make programs better (shorter, more readable) and there are libraries out there which use OO this way.<p>If you want to write something which can be proven true, you want to have something much more specific. Here are some possible titles one can have meaningful discussion about:<p>&quot;SOLID everywhere is not worth it&quot;<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t use objects where a function will do&quot;<p>&quot;single responsibility is the key to usable OO&quot;<p>and so on')
