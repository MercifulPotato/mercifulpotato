JavaScript had some egregious design issues from the beginning and strict mode is a remedy to some of them.<p>But when most people say &quot;breaking changes&quot; they mean things that suddenly cause legacy code to stop working, and non-strict mode will almost certainly be supported ad infinitum, so I don&#x27;t really count that. It&#x27;s also almost certainly never going to happen again.')
