It has been 11 years since I left college and I still haven&#x27;t been able to get a job. I have seen skilless people given countless opportunities to grow with a company. I have never been given the same opportunities as my peers and what was supposed to be my savior became 90k in debt and indentured servitude to the banks.<p>I don&#x27;t have money for December rent. I&#x27;ve been homeless once before so I will probably kill myself in 13 days if I don&#x27;t find a solution.')
