Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604765429, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015766, text='One of the elements in your system is either very old or borked.<p>I have an AppleTV4K, and everything is perfectly synced with at least 3 brands of Bluetooth headphones - an 3-year-old eKids one, a 1-year old TaoTronics one, and a 2-year old nameless one.<p>In the early PlayStation 2 days, many flatscreen TVs (both Plasma and LCD) had delays that made games like Guitar Hero unplayable, so the games added a latency estimation&#x2F;calibration setting you could use; My 12 year old Onkyo HDMI receiver has a special &quot;eliminate latency in game mode&quot; setting which disables some processing features and reduces sound latency by 50ms or so.<p>It&#x27;s not that there were never problems; But anything made in the last 5 years or so, especially using BT4&#x2F;BT5, should not have these issues.<p>Edit: just tried with an 8 year old or so JBL Clip I found lying around, and it does have ~100ms latency (estimated, not measured). But the newer ones donâ€™t have it.')
