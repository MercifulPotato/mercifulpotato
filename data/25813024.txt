There is no third party in this sort of proxy: the company is communicating with the internet. The fact that a company proxy is inspecting traffic from a company computer does not make the company proxy a third party because both resources belong to the company and should be used for legitimate purposes. Is a reverse proxy doing a MITM attack on a web server if it offloads encryption and authentication for it? No, because both resources are owned by the same party.<p>TLS inspection and DLP are not euphemisms, they&#x27;re valid names for a security practice. They&#x27;re not even the same thing--you couldn&#x27;t replace both mentions with &quot;MITM&quot; and expect another to know what you&#x27;re talking about.')
