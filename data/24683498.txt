I&#x27;m referring to what some people mean when they say that we changed from being a society that has markets to being a market society. If you think that it&#x27;s just a matter of Congress wielding unlimited power because it says so in a document, my question is how are you going to build the kind of political coalition to make that into a reality? In a society as hollowed out as ours, our entire conception of what the role of politics is will have to change.')
