I meant that they could write scrapers and fetch such information periodically from, say, recording companies&#x27; websites or more reliably, from e-commerce stores.<p>I&#x27;m saying so because I know plenty of 3rd party fandom&#x2F;crowdsourced databases are doing exactly this, for books, CDs, etc. The data obviously need some manual checks later, but this step saves lots of time.<p>Again, Discogs already have a <i>very complete</i> database for old releases, especially for vinyls. But what I&#x27;m talking is that they are lacking for newer ones (CDs or digital releases) and just provide a systematic (and tried) way to improve in that regard (considering their goal now is &quot;everything&quot;).<p>For something in 1962? Sure you&#x27;re right. But you don&#x27;t really need some fans to own a copy to prove the existence or get information for a hit album in 2010s.')
