I won&#x27;t say the whole budget will be wasted away, but I hold no hope of something useful coming out of it.<p>The EU has ASML, NXP, Infineon, maybe STM (not sure) and a ton of little shops, but all of them are far away from the major players. And they are moderately confortable in their niches. This is a very high risk endeavour, even with EU money.<p>And as far as I know, none of them manufacture for other end-user players, so even if there was a new fabless company with a cool project, it&#x27;s likely that wouldn&#x27;t be made in the EU bu by Samsumg or TSMC.')
