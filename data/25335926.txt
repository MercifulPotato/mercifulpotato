I recall local tech companies offering 1&#x2F;2 to 1&#x2F;3 of what you would get paid for average (non-FAANG) work in the Bay. In most smaller cities in the US &gt; $100k is still quite a lot for a household, let alone a single income. If take that income outside of even small towns to more rural areas, $100k can allow you to live very, very well.<p>Sure eventually we&#x27;ll see salaries reach an equilibrium, where local tech companies have to offer more and big tech companies will offer less. However, for the next few years, if you&#x27;re coming from a Bay Area company, you can take a pretty major cut to TC and still live extremely well. You don&#x27;t have to move to the middle of nowhere for this to be the case either.')
