Often it&#x27;s just downright petty and results in an overly dull experience. I&#x27;m what they would call a Liberal in the US but will often try to read opinions from the other side - Reddit labels those as &quot;Controversial&quot;. I&#x27;ve occasionally committed &quot;wrongthink&quot; there myself and it&#x27;s rather disheartening to know that few will ever read what I had to say. It&#x27;s no wonder that contrarians have all but abandoned the platform.<p>I find it interesting that HN also has downvotes yet somehow manages to not have the same vibe.')
