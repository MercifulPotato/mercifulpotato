They arise in an individual patient who has a poor immune response who can’t clear the virus for a long time. As their immune response tries to clear the virus it adapts to be more effective over many generations inside that patient. That’s why we have distinct lineages, each of these variants with multiple distinct mutations probably arose in a single person.')
