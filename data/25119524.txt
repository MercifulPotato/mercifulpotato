It&#x27;s showing the total death rates in a graph, and during initial spike in COVID, Sweden showed 20% increase during the peak. By definition, there&#x27;s no &quot;skewing&quot; possible, since it&#x27;s <i>all</i> death - unless you&#x27;re claiming hospitals are making up death.<p>If your main point is that reported death due to COVID might be inflated, sure, that&#x27;s possible but that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no increase due to COVID related death. If you want to point out the reported number due to COVID might be slightly higher than it really is, you should at least acknowledge that there <i>is</i> meaningful and substantial increase in death due to COVID as there absolutely is. By omitting that, your post can&#x27;t be distinguished from someone posting with a conspiracy mindset and ignoring actual data on substantial increase in death.')
