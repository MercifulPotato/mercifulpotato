Item(by='pdimitar', descendants=None, kids=[25943184, 25943163, 25942803], score=None, time=1611838349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25940245, text='On my last job -- which I do regret somewhat for losing -- I failed at meaningfully delivering that message.<p>There were SO MANY things to figure out, and I had no experience in Kubernetes (and only surface experience with Docker, Tilt and Helm) yet I was expected to be productive in 1-2 weeks after onboarding.<p>The main reason why I started taking too long in doing any tasks was that I grew more and more reluctant to ask questions. They were always answered extremely shortly and unhelpfully and left me with the impression that nobody cared to help me start becoming productive sooner. Also you were expected to hang out in a rather unofficial Mumble server the entire day if you have questions. What? Are we working remotely or are we simulating an office? Seems it was the latter.<p>So anyway, I took the long route and started exploring a lot while working on my first tasks.<p>Needless to say, this got me fired. I regret losing the very respectable salary but beyond that I am actually happy that it didn&#x27;t work out.<p>It&#x27;s like, I get it, you guys are all busy, but if you took one or two weeks to hand-hold me every day then we wouldn&#x27;t have a discussion at the 4th month mark about why am I so slow and that I have to be let go.<p>It was rather sad because I kind of liked the guys in the team -- but they were not helpful and you were expected to wing everything yourself. Which is fine, AFTER you receive meaningful initial help. Which I never did.<p>Sorry for rant. Reminded me of this HN comment (disclosure: not mine) which IMO nails it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25800104" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25800104</a><p>But, on topic again: I wasn&#x27;t able to express that message properly some of the places I worked at. There are people who were receptive to it (it == &quot;you need to properly onboard people even if that means some of your business-critical devs work at reduced capacity for a few weeks&quot;) when I said it in the past -- and most are receptive to it in my current job as well -- so it seems it really depends on the people themselves and&#x2F;or the culture of the company.<p>I guess it&#x27;s kind of like hiring: it&#x27;s much more randomness than anything else.')
