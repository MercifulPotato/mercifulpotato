(An extreme example is a stat arb shop running its portfolio optimizer.) But there&#x27;s another way to gain an edge, which is to iterate quickly on your &quot;fast&quot; algorithms and develop them so they take advantage of opportunities that are only partially exploited by competitors. Java seemed pretty good for that purpose for about a decade. Things like JVM warmup, GC, individual ultra-low-latency responses whenever necessary, were all dealt with after the fact.')
