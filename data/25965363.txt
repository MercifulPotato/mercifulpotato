For example, do GIFs even do HDR? And is there a 10-bits-per-channel specification for PNG&#x27;s? (I haven&#x27;t tried to look that up.)<p>Since HDR is a superset of the non-HDR color space, I suspect there will be not that much fuss converting 8-bit to 10-bit, but a whole lot of &quot;magic&quot; involved in converting 10-bit down to 8-bit.')
