Perhaps they’ll forge a doctor’s certificate, perhaps use some kind of acid that temporarily removes their fingerprints, that kind of thing.<p>It’s an unfortunate balance. With TLS, you decide eventually at some point that the problems of still supporting the old, less-secure version are too serious, and so tough luck for people stuck on the old version. With this, I certainly hope it would err much more on the side of not locking people out of the System. (Fortunately, although this particular condition is very rare, there are a much larger number of people that have damaged fingerprints or fingerprints that don’t work in whatever readers get used.)')
