Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608248887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461365, text='There is some strong academic debate as to whether it is &quot;normalized&quot; and in what contexts. Contrary to popular belief and anti-porn activists, porn is <i>not</i> getting more violent, and, in general, people aren&#x27;t either. Longitudinal studies have failed to verify the results found in lab settings (though there are methodological problems on all sides and questionable assumptions).<p>On the other hand, I also think that talking only about consent is missing the point of the criticism - that porn shapes desires as much as it satisfies them, and it can create new desires and fetishes. It&#x27;s not at all unreasonable to suppose that there would be fewer people interested in degradation and humiliation (fetishes consistently associated with lower than normal empathy in the available research) if porn hadn&#x27;t fed into that desire.<p>Whether it should be socially acceptable to participate in a market which creates people (typically women) who find erotic pleasure in their own subservience and subordination is a valid point to raise.<p>The solution, if that concern does motivate you, may lie outside of regulatory measures - regulation on sexually explicit materials tends to harm those at the margins first.')
