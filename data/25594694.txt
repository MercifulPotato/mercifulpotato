The only issue with “corruption” is that the tooling is bad at handling it. Which is a valid complaint. But in an alternative universe people would be complaining about plain-text because less crashed on any utf decoding issue.<p>Basically every journald using distro immediately forwards  the logs to syslog so you can just pretend it doesn’t exist and call it a day. I don’t because journald’s metadata and filtering is super powerful but nothing is stopping you from just grepping like usual.')
