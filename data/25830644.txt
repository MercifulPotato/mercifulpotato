I would hope that moderates and conservatives would not find those claims very credible, but perhaps they do or are not so offended as to downvote.<p>I was personally fine with the integrity of the election right up until censorship ramped up. Now I have <i>zero</i> confidence that I would hear about any problems. I still don&#x27;t think the election was &quot;stolen&quot; or anything, but I&#x27;m no longer confident enough to downvote such an opinion. How are we supposed to really know what&#x27;s true or not when we only hear one side of the story?')
