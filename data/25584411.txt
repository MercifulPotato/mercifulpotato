Even in the USA, from what I&#x27;ve seen, if you put a 15-20% down payment towards a home in a strong rental market (or what used to be), the mortgage will be less.<p>I moved into a residential development about two years ago, and people were buying houses and renting them out nearly immediately. Not sure what they pay on it, but for my scenario, renting the equivalent was about $200 more per month than getting a mortgage (taxes, maintenance and all). And the difference was increasing right up until the pandemic happened, not sure where it stands now.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to put a solid down payment into a home, you can pay less than rent would otherwise be, it&#x27;s just a matter of how much.')
