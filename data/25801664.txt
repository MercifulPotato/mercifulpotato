Most users will pick the default server. Over time other large (popular) providers will emerge and people will start to recognize the choice. Clients with branding will make that choice easy for non-technical users.<p>We know already it works. Federation and choice is a win for everybody. For this to start though you need either a good client&#x2F;server combo for people to individually adopt, or a GREAT&#x2F;POPULAR client with a default server.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to say that Element&#x2F;Riot fails flat on this. I&#x27;ve used Riot and then Element for a while, and it got worse in usability and features (I genuinely can&#x27;t stand it). As the reference client, it doesn&#x27;t support multiple server accounts, which kill the ability to have an independent server. Federation is nice, but what&#x27;s nicer currently is to be able to use matrix a teams&#x2F;slack replacement where tech users <i>can</i> drive adoption. The central matrix.org server is slow already, and even with federation you cannot tell your users to switch servers because of this, defeating the point.<p>The positive side is that on the client side there&#x27;s already choice. On the user front I&#x27;ve found FluffyChat to be vastly superior. Using Jitsi for audio&#x2F;video was weird at first, but it works <i>much</i> more reliably than signal (I gave up on signal for audio calls due to the time it takes to establish a connection and the horrible lag it randomly has - to the point I just hang up and call via GSM to finish the conversation, defeating the point).<p>If I was element I&#x27;d get FluffyChat and it&#x27;s author onboard as _the_ default client. On desktop I can choose multiple clients, and I have none of the &quot;Signal&quot; phone number&#x2F;pin&#x2F;central server&#x2F;electron BS. It works as intended, and it will only get better with time. It&#x27;s great.')
