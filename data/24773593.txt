A feedback system was set up, but virtually all the reports were ignored. They removed it altogether at some point, so you couldn&#x27;t even see reports or vote counts. It became <i>infuriating</i> to use; at first it was basically useless, the most critical issues were (slowly) fixed. But search and pagination was significantly worse than before, and it truncated <i>all</i> subjects, even if they would fit perfectly fine in view. The post overview literally looked like &quot;Can you ....&quot;, &quot;Question about ....&quot;, &quot;Processor is ....&quot;. Putting on the tinfoil hat, it almost seems like they <i>wanted</i> it to die, leaving this issue unfixed..<p>The (one) group I followed basically disbanded in the year following the &quot;new&quot; launch. I think it&#x27;s about a year ago they officially closed it down, activity moved to a Facebook group and a subreddit. It&#x27;s a pity really, I miss the mailing list architecture.')
