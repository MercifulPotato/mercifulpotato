Becoming an industrial researcher trades some independence for money, steady project funding, and the opportunity to more directly impact the world. In return your employer gets first or sole access to your research in order to make their products better and more profitable. Clueless suits forcing you to degrade the integrity of your work by demanding you soften your message or by puffing it up with PR need not be part of the equation. This case is over a research paper, not a press release. Smart companies know that employing researchers that are honest people rather than sycophants is good for their bottom line.<p>Probably, even Google knows this, and this is just a mistake. If I was in the position of this researcher, I’d threaten to quit, too. Google’s actions suggest it wants to appear to care about ethics in AI rather than actually caring. That’s not a environment conducive to her to have any impact, so why stay? Clearly she’s not going to have a problem finding a job elsewhere.')
