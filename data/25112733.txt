He did <i>ok</i> controlling his blood sugar, but he considered fruit to be &quot;healthy&quot; and so ate about as much of it as he wanted, which regularly caused blood sugar spikes.<p>And I know it&#x27;s not the same thing, but the number of times our small kids get offered juice as a &quot;healthy&quot; option when it&#x27;s got almost as much sugar as soda... I think it&#x27;s a real phenomena that certain things have a reputation for being much healthier than they are and it causes problems.')
