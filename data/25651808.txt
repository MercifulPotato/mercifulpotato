It claims that &#x27;Singlepass&#x27; compilation of clang.wasm took 2s and &#x27;Cranelift&#x27; took 9s.<p>Running the same benchmark myself in Linux on a 4CPU VirtualBox on a MacBook Pro, I see 11s and 42s respectively. For reference , V8&#x2F;Node.js compiles the same file in 27s.<p>Compiled files were 339 MiB (Singlepass), 640 MiB (Cranelift) and 90 MiB (V8&#x2F;Node.js).<p>Clang.wasm itself is 45 MiB.')
