E-ink looks good, battery lasts awhile, waterproof, and you can jailbreak it and install custom firmware if you wish. There are alternative reader packages for it that are great, but the base OEM one Nickel is okay for most epub books and supports non-DRM. (Nickel also lets you &quot;dog ear&quot; pages, highlight, and take typed notes. you can refer to all your notes&#x2F;highlights in a book through an index) It&#x27;s also the only one I could find that takes a micro SD. Don&#x27;t go higher than 32GB micro SD or it starts to act weird.')
