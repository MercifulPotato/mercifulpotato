What are the features? The meals? Every day, the same meals? With clear recipes and easy estimating when they&#x27;re done. Hundreds of features everyday and doing the dishes pretty much resets everything to a perfect clean slate for the next iteration of hundreds of features. Everything else needed for the features, stove, fridge, utensils, deteriorates on a totally different timescale, years and are always completely replaced.<p>I think the embedded video raises a very good argument that metaphors is dangerous and can&#x2F;does shape thinking. So I don&#x27;t want this to catch on and get people arguing with their stakeholders about &quot;we need to do the dishes&quot; when there are heavy refactorings that need to be done. :&#x2F;')
