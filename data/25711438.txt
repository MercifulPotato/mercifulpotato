You&#x27;re citing random links and assertions, and when they&#x27;re knocked down, you move on to new ones. That&#x27;s what a Gish Gallop is.<p>The fallacy you&#x27;re exploiting is the notion that we&#x27;re not supposed to see your assertions failing (and you refusing to acknowledging those failures) and draw conclusions about the rest of your assertions. A reasonable person looks at this exchange and concludes that there&#x27;s no particular reason to take any of your arguments seriously.')
