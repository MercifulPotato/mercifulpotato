They dont murder or steal because they&#x27;re afraid of the consequences. Theres plenty of folks you want to punch in the face. Maybe once, twice or until they stop breathing. You lie to yourself that you dont do it because you&#x27;re a good person. No, you&#x27;re afraid they&#x27;ll punch back, or their friends will intervene or assault charges. Or even better, you&#x27;re too weak to cause consequential harm.<p>Yes nukes stopped a lot of potential wars. Good. If the mere existence is all that&#x27;s needed to stop like half the wars that ever could be... and? Obviously I dont want them used. But wars happen and theres nothing anyone can do about that. Its human nature to be a bunch of cunts.<p>And there have always been a bunch of existential problems on the horizon. A decent reading of history shows that people have been fearful of whatever the latest fad of problems. The only real difference, in the last 100 years we are not at the complete and total mercy of nature. Only partially. It&#x27;s only fairly recent that a drought here and there, blizzard, tornado, hurricane or volcano doesn&#x27;t have epically large consequences in death toll. Those numbers are far less than they used to be.')
