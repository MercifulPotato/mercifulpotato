Otherwise, people who donâ€™t have a few drinks are subsidizing people who do have a few drinks.<p>The whole idea behind health care is that some people subsidize other people - ie. most people are healthy and use less health care services than they pay for, while a few people get sick and require health care services that they would never have been able to afford.<p>I&#x27;m fine with subsidizing other people, the alternative is to be okay with people that have problems to be thrown out of the system and not receive the care they need.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s not okay for insurers to have fine grained access to what people buy, eat, drink, do. I struggle playing it out in my mind in a way that doesn&#x27;t end horribly.')
