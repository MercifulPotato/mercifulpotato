Is the work of the person solving that 5k&#x2F;day problem that&#x27;s then sold to ten clients worth ten times as much as the work of the person who&#x27;s work is only sold to one client?<p>I think it&#x27;s important to recognize the semi-arbitrary source of where this value is coming from and understand that while employees impacting a lot of customers are indeed creating a lot of value the work they are doing isn&#x27;t significantly different from the work made by folks with more modest salaries.<p>Basically, at the core, I think there&#x27;s a significant ethical question here and I would highlight the relative infancy of the industry.  It&#x27;s likely that in a few hundred years all this incredible value creation will be highly commoditized and that innovative development will be relegated to academic pursuits that companies only adopt and bring to market after a lot of investigation and research.<p>Uh hrm - as another parallel you might compare this to speed running.  Right now we can do relatively simple things to dramatically create value (time saved off the run) but as time goes on and the run gets more &quot;perfected&quot; then the ability to shave time off the run (or create value for the business) will require a lot more investment of effort.  I&#x27;m not certain if this will happen since everything in how development works points to this being a really hard state of the industry to accomplish - but looking at economic trends it feels inevitable that eventually it will be more profitable to, for instance, produce a cheaper better whatsapp then being the first market entrent into the coveted Deciduous Tree Vlog Platform market.')
