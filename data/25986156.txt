If the 1998 football team described as &quot;black-blanc-beur&quot; had included players of Greek descent (and maybe it did?), they would have been part of the &quot;blancs&quot;, just like Youri Djorkaeff.<p>Take what you read with a grain of salt. I&#x27;m certainly very skeptical of the implied claim that Germans wouldn&#x27;t consider Greeks as white.<p>Note that being considered white doesn&#x27;t preclude Greeks from being discriminated against, just like some people discriminate against e.g. white Poles.')
