Or calms you down, soothes you, allows you to think clearly, methodically, etc....<p>I bring this up because it&#x27;s concerning to me that the &quot;right&quot; response is setting off &quot;never abuse this&quot; alarms.

My mind quiets down, my ability to hold attention increases dramatically, and my sense of well being ensues.  I speak slower and calmer.  I am less likely to argue with my spouse.  Yes, I feel &quot;good&quot; but I&#x27;ve always assumed that&#x27;s what its like to feel normal.  Normal people get their prefrontal cortex for free, mine is unlocked through a drug.')
