Why don&#x27;t you put cameras throughout your house, including your bedroom?&quot;<p>Clearly our actions reveal that we DO think privacy is important in itself. What &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; really means is &quot;I have not yet been personally affected, so I don&#x27;t care.&quot; It&#x27;s apathy, not a value statement.')
