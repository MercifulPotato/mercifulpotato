You need to roll your feet as you land, just as if you were running barefoot.<p>I don&#x27;t run much, but for walking I&#x27;ve preferred solid soles made from high durometer rubber for a while now, because they beat up my feet a lot less than a pair of cushioned sneakers for long walks, and it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> better than going barefoot in -5C weather :-)<p>My dad wore clogs for most of his working life. Not the old-fashioned carved wooden ones, but the type with leather uppers and a glued on anti-slip layer of rubber on thick wooden soles. He said they were the most comfortable working shoes for varied surfaces and uneven ground.')
