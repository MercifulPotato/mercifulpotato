When presented with concrete examples of where he was falling short of expectations he simply would not accept that he wasn&#x27;t doing a great job.<p>I and another very experienced and well regarded manager tried to break through to him and help him but all three times it ended with him getting angry and making crazy excuses.<p>It seemed he simply could not admit that he needed to improve in some key areas and in the end I had to replace him.')
