How much did a printing press cost in 1796?<p>From what I can find about Â£16 (the price I found was 15 guineas) in England, so, via inflation calculators and currency conversion, around $2,000 (yes, the conversion had more details, but more than one sig fig here is definitely false precision.)<p>Operating costs would probably take more digging.')
