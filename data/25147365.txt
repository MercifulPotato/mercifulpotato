(are logs UI? is crontab UI? eventually everything is)<p>Furthermore, you can&#x27;t build an embedded no-need-to-update-every-6-month system with available common protocol - you would need to continuously feed it the list of leap-seconds,  for which AFAIK there is no widely deployed protocol.<p>But if you use UTC, there are many protocols (TIME, NTP, SNTP, PTP), at least one of which you&#x27;ll use anyway because of clock drifts, that will let you keep working.')
