I mean if you can find alternative for 9 out of 10 goods then it’s of course still a big win). Similarly, boycott companies that kowtow to China (you can probably save a lot of money by doing so, e.g. by pirating all Disney movies&#x2F;tv series instead of going to the cinema&#x2F;paying for Disney+).<p>Support companies that voice support for those oppressed by the CCP (such as ProtonVPN, Notepad++).<p>Vote for politicians that are not afraid to stand up to CCP (I for instance voted for Trump despite having my political views mostly align with Sanders - solely due to his anti-China stance.. you can of course also argue that his administration has singlehandedly done more to stand up to China than the rest of the world combined in the past couple decades).<p>Spread awareness of China’s atrocities. If more people realized that CCP are even more evil and dangerous than Nazi Germany then we’d likely see more aggressive policies towards China (such as banning their companies from our markets, keeping the tariffs (Biden said he’d end them) - hopefully with other countries similarly implementing tariffs).')
