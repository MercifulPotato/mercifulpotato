No mayhem ever materialized though. We didn&#x27;t have any actual Triages, ICUs are not overwhelmed. And this seems to be true for almost anywhere except for extreme shit shows like in Italy early 2020. So ... my emprical conclusion is that Corona is bad but not as dangerous as our governments want us to believe to justify their powergrabbing moves. And gathering outside is probably completely irrelevant anyway.')
