Corn and wheat weren&#x27;t always as palatable as they are today. Fruits are all bigger and juicier.<p>At what point do we decide some life capable of naturally and spontaneously reproducing is patentable, and some life isn&#x27;t? Should it extend to breeds of animals as well?<p>If someone dumps a pack of grapes by the side of the road, someone else comes along and picks the fruit that later grows, are they pirating fruit? If they decide they like it and plant their own garden, is that a patent violation? They never agreed to an EULA or even knew of its existence. They found it naturally.<p>I&#x27;m sure this all sounds ridiculous. That&#x27;s precisely because it is.<p>The difference between patenting a chemical compound is a patentable compound is probably not producing itself naturally without constant human intervention. Someone, for example, won&#x27;t be patenting oxygen. They can maybe patent a specific process for producing oxygen, but oxygen is naturally occurring. If a plant is growable from a seed or some other self-sustaining method, it&#x27;ll continue to produce itself naturally without human intervention as well.')
