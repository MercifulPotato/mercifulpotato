The vast majority of roads allow cars, nearly every single home will have one or more parking spots. If you want to do everything by car, you absolutely can!<p>But once other modes of transport are viable, there is just no need to drive that much.<p>Kids going to elementary? A five-minute walk. Kids going to high school? A 15-minute bike ride. Same for sports, friends, and basically everything else they do. This means they don&#x27;t need to be ferried around by parents all the time and they don&#x27;t need their own car at age 16. With some minor infrastructure changes, the roads will be safe enough to do this on their own! This eliminates a part of car traffic, so you actually need less space for infrastructure.<p>This applies to adults as well. There&#x27;s no need to drive to work if it&#x27;s a 15-minute bike ride. Grocery shopping? Well, you pass a store on your way home, so just pick up the ingredients required for that day&#x27;s meal.<p>You can still do it the American way and drive everywhere, but not doing so is suddenly an option too!')
