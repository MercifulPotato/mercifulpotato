Instead we found ourselves hearing people asking for Prosecco or bubbly. Champagne might now be able to assert that only the&#x27;quality&#x27; product from their region has the name, but I suspect it&#x27;s just caused the companies that produce wine to make sure that they own the trademark, and push their brand, not the term champagne. Regardless of whether it&#x27;s from that region.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed a substantial change. Most people in the US I meet that aren&#x27;t really into wine still use &quot;champagne&quot; to refer to sparkling wine. I was actually looking at making mimosas the other day and picked out a bottle of okay sparkling wine (it seems silly to mix expensive wine with OJ to me), and my SO commented that mimosas she thought mimosas had to use champagne. I picked her brain about it (I was shocked someone would pay for champagne for a normal Saturday mimosa), and she thought champagne was a totally distinct thing from sparkling wine. She thought sparkling wine was force carbonated like beer, or maybe just flat wine mixed with seltzer water like a wine spritzer. She didn&#x27;t know what prosecco was, and when I told her, she said she would call that champagne.<p>I don&#x27;t think their campaign has had much of an effect on the average American. It makes a difference to connoisseurs, but the average American doesn&#x27;t know the technical difference (and likely has never had true champagne, because of the relatively high price).<p>I find that&#x27;s generally true of culinary things in America, though. Many of my friends buy their wine from gas stations and are happy with it, which I struggle with.  They typically only stock bottom of the barrel stuff like Barefoot; the white wines taste more like apple juice with vodka mixed in it than a real wine. The reds are generally exceptionally sweet; even full bodied reds lack the flavor and feel of tannins (probably to increase the appeal among people that hear cabernet sauvignon is a good wine, but don&#x27;t know they don&#x27;t like full bodied wines).<p>It&#x27;s really a shame. There are some quite good wines in the cheap range (especially if you go for less traditional regions, like South Africa), but gas stations don&#x27;t carry them and people tend to judge the region for unfair reasons. I get shocked looks if I open a bottle from Argentina or South Africa, as if wine is only meant for the wealthy and the grape vines can sense if they&#x27;re in an economically disadvantaged country and will refuse to produce good grapes until you transplant them to a country with a higher GDP per capita.')
