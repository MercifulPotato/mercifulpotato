They should ensure confidence by guarding against fraud, but not to protect against losses by institutions that never thought that activist investors would work against their own interests.<p>This isn&#x27;t really manipulation that we&#x27;re seeing: it&#x27;s people betting against the institutions that themselves bet against companies combined with a fair bit of FOMO.')
