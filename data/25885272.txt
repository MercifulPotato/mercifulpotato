Examples of non-generational collectors are non sequitur.  You&#x27;re talking the diagonally opposite corner of the square diagram.  (What&#x27;s the name of those 4-part square diagrams?  I forget the name of the guy they&#x27;re named after.)<p>For instance, you could have a mark-and-sweep collector that would mark everything and then first sweep just the most recently created arena, and only do a full sweep if not enough space was freed.  It wouldn&#x27;t be perfectly generational unless it was also compacting, but the youngest arena might be a decent heuristic.  Or, for the cost of one pointer in every object header, the GC could keep a singly linked list of the youngest generation.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great idea, but you can do a non-moving generational GC if you want to interact with C&#x2F;C++ without forcing pinning&#x2F;un-pinning of objects (or forcing C&#x2F;C++ to only interact with GC&#x27;d objects via pinned handles).')
