Now I only use React, due to how it maps so cleanly onto functional programming paradigms, along with Redux. I can use maps and folds in my JSX, everything is a function.<p>I didn&#x27;t like how with Vue there was something extra other than pure JS, which is their templating language, and the fact that you have to do stuff like registering a plugin for a library instead of just saying `import x from &#x27;x&#x27;`. Plus due to being a templating based framework, TypeScript support isn&#x27;t as good as React, though it&#x27;s better in Vue 3. There were little things like that shifted my preference away from Vue and towards React.<p>Oh, and React just has a lot more libraries.')
