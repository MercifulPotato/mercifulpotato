Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25619360], score=None, time=1609622768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25611422, text='It&#x27;s hard to know what you mean without a concrete example.<p>twblalock&#x27;s argument appears to be that editors are obligated to publish all pseudoscience dreck in order to refute it.<p>Now, there are plenty of pseudoscientific beliefs which are widely held, but are clearly not backed by evidence.<p>Consider Hollow Earth theory - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hollow_Earth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hollow_Earth</a> - which is outright untenable; there is no evidence in favor of it and plenty of evidence against it.<p>Why should I worry about implications of a Hollow Earth when there are so many other more interesting things to worry about?<p>Going back to pjc50&#x27;s comment, I am convinced by the evidence  that &#x27;bell curve arguments about some races being less intellectually capable than others&#x27; are bunkum. To start with, the genetic evidence over the last decades shows that the human-constructed concept we call &quot;race&quot; has no real biological basis. (Racial classifications is another pseudoscience. I linked to a video with more discussion about the flaws in the Bell Curve book.)<p>The evidence is so overwhelming that, like the evidence against YEC or Hollow Earth theory, it&#x27;s not worth my time to engage in the topic, much less worth my time to develop the specific rhetorical skills to engage charlatans, frauds, grifters, and true-believers at their game.<p>There are certainly some who do that, and I commend them for fighting the good fight. But when a YEC proponent presents a tired argument like &quot;If Human Beings Evolved From Monkeys Then Why Are There Still Monkeys?&quot; or &quot;Evolution Is Only A <i>Theory</i>&quot; for the n-th million-th time - I don&#x27;t have the patience. And neither do science journal editors, who use their freedom of association to decide to not publish a given paper.<p>I&#x27;ll now focus on the word &quot;censorship&quot;. You must be aware that supporters of pseudoscientific beliefs have all manner of ways to publish their works, hold meetings, get on TV shows, build museums, and more. So by &quot;censor&quot; you are not meaning censorship in any of its usual senses.<p>I think you mean something more like &quot;there&#x27;s an obligation to let the honorable opposition speak, in order that truth may ring out.&quot; But a YEC isn&#x27;t there for the scientific truth but rather wants to be treated as honorable (even though it isn&#x27;t!) in order to influence policy goals in favor of a certain religious viewpoint. I believe by jumping right to &quot;censorship&quot; instead of starting with &quot;maybe it doesn&#x27;t actually have merit&quot;, you end up supporting bad science.')
