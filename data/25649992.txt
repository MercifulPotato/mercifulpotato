Especially if it somehow had Hackers-era Angelina Jolie, Mathew Lillard, and Jonny Lee Miller. Or, plot twist: Those 3 are now the old&#x2F;lame parents of the young hacker(s).<p>Maybe I should revisit that script then... I&#x27;ve definitely gotten more ideas about where it would go now that we&#x27;re in 2021 and I have way more to work with to flesh it out. It probably wouldn&#x27;t end up appealing to the Disney crowds like the original, though. Ha.<p>How is the book app going?<p>I found more old scripts in boxes I want to update when I have the time, some of my other fan art pilots are digital but lack the proper format of a script and your project sounds interesting for amateur writers as I imagine you have specific templates for the specific type of writing one would use.<p>All of my formatting is all off and looks like I just wrote long format stories in paragraph with quotes for dialogue as I didn&#x27;t know any better and just did what I saw in books and wrote with total abandon in a way that only made sense to me.<p>What would be cool would be able to denote where the arcs and acts are as you&#x27;re writing to be able to go back to after long pauses.<p>I&#x27;d pay for that! ;)<p>Sidenote: I think I enjoyed finding out out Ray Bradbury wrote Farenheit 451 on a rented typewriter at UCLA just as much as reading the book, and especially more than watching the movie.')
