I found no config options in UI, and guides involving xrandr and fifteen different steps on the internet. I thought hell no and abandoned that idea altogether, cranked font size in the terminal and worked like that. And I actually &quot;can&quot; work in Linux and configure easier stuff. As far as I&#x27;m concerned at least some distros&#x2F;DEs have non-existent hidpi support right now.')
