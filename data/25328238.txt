And it&#x27;s blatant PR when the company is forcing the devs to do even more crunch time, then tweet about &quot;death threats&quot; and you see the conversation immediately switch from critical to supportive. It&#x27;s also not like tweeting &quot;Death threats are NOT OKAY&quot; is going to change the mind of the kind of people who send death threats.')
