As I looked around for a tool to audit my calendar to figure out patterns of how my time was being spent, couldn&#x27;t find any great option out there!<p>So, I did some data science [1] on calendar and discovered 3 primary dimensions which cause meetings to be draining and ineffective:<p>1. Wrong people in meetings  \n2. Agenda not well defined  \n3. Schedule not optimized for individuals<p>I was able to leverage these insights and cut down my weekly meetings into half!\nHence, decided to build a service so people in similar situation can seamlessly do the same.<p>I&#x27;d love to have you try and hear what could be built on top of the analytics to create more value for you?<p>[1] [Github link to analytics](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sitz&#x2F;calendar-analytics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sitz&#x2F;calendar-analytics</a>)')
