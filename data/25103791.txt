Even the connection to Facebook at all seems pretty weak; yes the engineer works at Facebook, but if this had been an official Facebook OSS project that they wanted to publish themselves, surely they would have done so under the facebook org?<p>It looks to me like this is just something an engineer at Facebook did as a side project.')
