Item(by='ppf', descendants=None, kids=[25135011, 25134981], score=None, time=1605692601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134077, text='I have so many issues with this, as it is just greenwashing at its worst.<p>For a start - the latest EURO emissions regulations already make it practically impossible to sell a new ICE-only car. At this rate, ICE-only new cars will already be a rarity by 2030.<p>The &quot;net zero emissions&quot; is only if the electricity used to power those EVs is generated from renewable sources (and I&#x27;m not sure how much further installation potential the UK has for those sources). Unless we return to nuclear power (which brings its own debate), the overall lifecycle CO2 benefit of EVs and hybrids as they stand is minimal.<p>I also <i>really</i> dislike the blinkered focus on CO2 as the only variable to optimise. Sourcing the lithium and other minerals necessary for EVs is <i>extremely</i> problematic, and lithium battery recycling has yet to be proven at all viable. Some initial research also suggests that heavy demands are going to be placed on lithium reserves.<p>The net result of this is that manufacturers will make hybrids that just about meet the legislated &quot;green&quot; requirements, meaning all new cars will bring the worst of both worlds to the road. In the &quot;green&quot; new future of Britain&#x27;s transport, everyone will be driving bloated hybrid SUVs.<p>Finally - for the &quot;EVs are great because they only have one moving part!&quot; crowd - how many cars have you sold or scrapped due to electronics faults, compared to ICE faults?<p>The only remotely sustainable form of motorised transport is an ebike (or maybe a bike with a tiny petrol engine), if you really take this whole argument at face value.<p><i>Edit:</i> Nearly forgot (which is odd, given the actual enormity of this point) - the UK grid in no way can handle any significant increase in pure EV usage. There would have to be significant investment, and new systems manufactured, for this to even be viable. As I said, I suspect that the solution that will actually be used is hybrid cars.')
