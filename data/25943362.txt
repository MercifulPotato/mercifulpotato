If it&#x27;s the wrong grade then it&#x27;s the wrong oil, even if it says it&#x27;s &quot;high performance*&quot;.<p>If someone gave you that oil under fraudulent pretenses then it would absolutely be their fault..<p>Now to say that Robinhood is engaging in outright fraud, but having your service expectations subverted like this is going to rightfully piss people off whether or not the underlying service is free.
