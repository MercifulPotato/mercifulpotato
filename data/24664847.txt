An engineer who had remotely ssh&#x27;d into their workstation needed to 2FA and realized that they could send an SMS to their phone, cause the phone to vibrate, and trigger a false 2FA event on the dongle. (Or maybe they got their computer to play a loud noise. I forgot the specific details.)<p>Similar to this fake finger, it was a cool hack at the time but defeated the purpose of 2FA.')
