Even if you can negotiate it to 0.8 c&#x2F;GB, you&#x27;re still talking about a huge piece of the PSF&#x27;s budget. They would have to either cut other expenditure (e.g. making grants) dramatically, or find a lot of new income (continuously, not just a one-off donation drive). And PyPI&#x27;s bandwidth is growing rapidly [1].<p>If PyPI didn&#x27;t have sponsor providing bandwidth, I&#x27;d guess it would implement some form of rate limiting and encourage people to mirror&#x2F;cache packages much more to reduce load. I don&#x27;t think it would die completely, but it would be less convenient and still cost the PSF a fair bit of money.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;di_codes&#x2F;status&#x2F;1235707819955032069" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;di_codes&#x2F;status&#x2F;1235707819955032069</a>')
