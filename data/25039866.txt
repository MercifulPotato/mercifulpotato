That is, the skepticism has to go both ways. Merely being attached to doubting the proposition is exactly denialism and exactly not skepticism.<p>More or less by definition it&#x27;s impossible for a denialist to tell that they&#x27;re not being skeptical, because they can move the goalposts on &quot;sufficient evidence&quot; indefinitely. This is a deep epistemological conundrum with no easy answer. But as a rule of thumb, skeptics generally include the &quot;both ways&quot; aspects in their definition of skepticism, while denialists focus solely on justifying their doubt.')
