(You may have to think very hard; it&#x27;s basically muscle memory for us these days...)<p>I&#x27;ve seen this trick in the wild. &quot;No autoplay&quot; means &quot;no autoplay without some user interaction first&quot;. And clicking one of those &quot;I accept&quot; buttons is indistinguishable from clicking on any other random element to make it play a video. So they just made the &quot;I accept&quot; button play the video as well as dismiss whatever thing was probably covering up the website.<p>Some people are terrible.')
