Yes you can get away with paying for your own infrastructure at a third the cost, but then when you compute the cost of all the individual requirements. colocation ISP prices, space, people to manage all of these machines, the software to then scale yourself in equivalence, you eventually end up at w similar cost apples to apples, oranges to oranges if you replicate for yourself exactly what you get through AWS.')
