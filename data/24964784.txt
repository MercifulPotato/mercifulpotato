Microsoft had the OS business locked up.<p>2. QNX cost more than Windows.<p>3. Their marketing was not very good.<p>Then QNX, the company, was sold off to an audio company. That was a disaster. Then it was sold again to Blackberry. Along the way, they went from closed source to open source to closed source to open source to closed source. This antagonized the QNX user community. QNX relied on ports of GCC, Eclipse, etc. for development, and all those communities stopped supporting QNX.<p>Right now, you can still buy QNX. But not on line. You have to talk to a sales rep. If you have to ask how much it costs, you can&#x27;t afford it. It&#x27;s widely used inside things like car dashboards. The classic line is &quot;you use Linux to run your web server, and QNX to run your nuclear power plant.&quot;<p>They&#x27;ve been terrified of people pirating it. I used to tell their people that their problem was not piracy, it was being ignored.<p>They should have a business model like Epic has for Unreal Engine - anyone can download and use it for free, and when you get over $100K in revenue, they get 5%. Although that&#x27;s easier to enforce in gaming, because few titles hit $100K in revenue and those are easy to find.<p>(Some years ago QNX had a sales win with a major auto manufacturer. They&#x27;d been considering an embedded version of Windows. Microsoft insisted that the Windows splash screen appear when the dashboard powered up. This was not well received by the auto company, and they went with QNX.)')
