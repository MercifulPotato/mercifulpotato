You also rank articles with truthyness and quality.<p>Let the people become the judge of truth, but in a more transparent way.<p>If i comment on an article in a socialist way, you&#x27;d mark me leftist. So my comments then are highlighted in shades of blue depending on how far left my ranking is by other community members. Likewise for Trump supporters.<p>Articles could also be ranked &#x2F; flagged as dangerous (inciting hate, violence, etc) and be removed or at least boldened, or as hackernews does greyed out, so it&#x27;s less prominent without complete dismissal, yet let the person not see the greying or know they&#x27;ve been greyed. Something along those lines, I&#x27;m sure other tweaks could be made to make a platform like twitter that&#x27;s more democratically policed - that keeps as much content as possible, but is very transparent on where that content lie in truth &#x2F; political slant.')
