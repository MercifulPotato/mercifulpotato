And those same people immediately start saying that no, they in fact do want to forbid whoever they choose from saying&#x2F;publishing anything anywhere.<p>Mind you, not that &quot;Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Google&#x2F;etc are private companies and can allow anything they want and that&#x27;s not censorship&quot; wasn&#x27;t <i>always</i> a motte-and-bailey, but it&#x27;s sad to see it on display so transparently.<p>At least most of them are downvoted, if nothing else.')
