Maybe 2 FTEs if they&#x27;re not automating their own job as they go. IncRev also has an office in Bangalore where I&#x27;d assume a lot of that low-level stuff gets done, so your estimate of ~$225&#x2F;hr, which is already too high for the U.S. average (but maybe not SV), could easily be too high by a factor of 3. And I doubt IncRev is really doing the report development, but maybe. So I&#x27;d guess you&#x27;re off by a factor of 6 and Thernaos was just getting fleeced.')
