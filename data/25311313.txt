I’ve worked in Solr, Lucene, and Elasticsearch for more than 8 years more or less constantly.<p>I have, at any given time, dozens of google tabs open dedicated to Solr, Lucene, Elasticsearch. Sometimes on basic things to jog my mind.<p>Knowing how to interpret information online, what exactly to search for, and having memory to be jogged by other context is just part of what it means to have a skill.<p>Memorizing documentation is rarely a good use of brain cells IMO, even pre google when instead you used a book index&#x2F;ToC to do the same thing.')
