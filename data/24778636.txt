I mean, Gatsby doesn&#x27;t have any backend CMS out of the box so that&#x27;s the most obvious thing. If you want to use Gatsby for clients who want to be able to manage their content, you have to select and integrate one.<p>But even for me, who doesn&#x27;t need a backend GUI stuff like a contact form was a pain. Luckily I host with Netlify and they have an easy form solution but imagine that across many other situations even for a somewhat simple site. Now you&#x27;re having to set up accounts with all these other services when before it was all contained in one place. All for what? The benefit doesn&#x27;t seem substantial enough to me to give all of that up.<p>Even if you use WordPress as the backend, you&#x27;ve still got to deal with integrating it&#x27;s API which is more work than something generating all the markup you need etc...')
