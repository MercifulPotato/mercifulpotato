And a ground station?<p>Let&#x27;s not be mad, here. There are proper, full-blown, popular, global-scale cloud service providers. That. Only. Offer. VMs.<p>Are we so drunk with corporate kool-aid to believe that we are missing out because we are missing... What do you believe you&#x27;re missing, actually?<p>I repeat: there are popular professional cloud service providers whose business consists of providing either VMs or access to bare metal. That&#x27;s where real-world companies run their real-world businesses. Why are we supposed to believe that you need more to operate your own stuff?')
