Item(by='cyberdrunk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603451171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24868053, text='&gt; What I have done is transition to an area in which my skills can be used to make money for me and others.<p>Money is both good and bad. Thee bad part is that it attracts a ton of unsavory personalities, who will do anything to get ahead. In coding, it results in endless self-promoting, pushing unnecessary (or downright harmful) new tech and project ideas in order to gain a promotion, one-upmanship in code reviews etc. All that bullshit gets old fairly quickly.<p>The reality is that, in a complex environment, it&#x27;s much easier to make money by doing some work and heavily manipulating people rather than doing good work and no manipulation. Hence, I want to exit complex environments as quickly as possible, which means distancing myself from society and modern economy as much as possible. It will probably mean living on $500-$700 a month, but hopefully the peace gained will be worth it. (Currently, it&#x27;s still all in a fantasy stage, as I need to accumulate some more money via coding job to make the jump).')
