Here&#x27;s a simple example of what can happen under RCV:<p>Pretend Bernie Sanders in 2016 ran under the Green Party after dropping out of the Democratic Primary. RCV claims to eliminate the spoiler effect, so it is &quot;safe&quot; for all the people who want Bernie as their first choice to actually express that. Assume everyone who likes Bernie the best follows that: they put Bernie as their first choice and either Trump or Clinton as their second choice. Presumably more will have Clinton as their second choice than Trump since Clinton is more centrist than Trump who is on the right.<p>Say the &quot;first choice&quot; votes go as follows:<p>- 45% top choice Trump<p>- 35% top choice Bernie<p>- 20% top choice Hillary<p>Hillary gets eliminated and the people who put Hillary as their first choice now have their second choices distributed among the remaining candidates. Say that split goes (within the 20%):<p>- 6% 2nd choice Trump<p>- 14% 2nd choice Bernie<p>Trump wins, even if all the Bernie voters had Hillary as their 2nd choice, because their second choices didn&#x27;t count for anything. So the claim that it was &quot;safe&quot; to express their true preferences and put Bernie as their first choice completely backfired.<p>summary: among three choices, under Ranked Choice Voting, you only get your votes moved to your 2nd choice in Ranked Choice if you do not come in 2nd place overall. If your candidate comes in 2nd, your votes are worthless.<p>A system that fixes this and other issues is STAR Voting, and it&#x27;s what people should be pushing for:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equal.vote&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equal.vote&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starvoting.us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starvoting.us&#x2F;</a>')
