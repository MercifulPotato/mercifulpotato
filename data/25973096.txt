Sometimes they are just the simplest solution and trying to design abstractions to avoid it just creates a huge mess.<p>If you&#x27;ve working with Java at Google (Guice) makes you learn to hate hiding circular dependencies behind dependency injection, since your binary gets injected by some huge tree of thousands of dependencies all that can create errors or interfere with each other. And without static checking trying to reason and fix those issues becomes really hard.<p>I strongly prefer using the languages actual type system to create circular dependencies that you can inspect using well known tools over that any day, better have a problem you can see than hide the same problem to satisfy some tools requirement.')
