It&#x27;s just about the worst cancer you can get. Over 95% mortality rate.<p>Jobs had GEP-NET cancer, which have 5 years OSR of 70% at stage IV. It&#x27;s a slow growing cancer, very survivable and even surgically curable in early stage.<p>The fast, almost always fatal is the pancreatic adenocarcinoma.<p>Also, the mortality rate of a cancer is a function of many variables (stage at the time of diagnosis, tumor differentiation, tumor location, etc.). A number like 95% doesn&#x27;t make any sense without a lot of context.')
