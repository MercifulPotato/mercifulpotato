Item(by='whimsicalism', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607706120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387817, text='&gt; When I break something in an Airbnb, I pay every time. When they fuck up the parking and I get towed, the Airbnb paid. So we both keep using the service.<p>This seems very orthogonal to concerns about being murdered.<p>&gt; Michael Sandel talked big talk about Airbnb monetized something that used to be generously gifted, but he omitted the special math of how rich people exchanging stuff with each other results in that thing being utilized 10,000% more, simply because it is sustainable in the sense of people retaining and not hitting the home button, and he never really talked about, ironically, the lack of justice when people break or steal your shit and there is simply no remedy.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, I honestly don&#x27;t really understand. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re discussing Sandel&#x27;s recent work on what he sees as the moral limits around markets.<p>You&#x27;re saying that markets provide a recourse for property damage, which makes them more just? That, again, seems unrelated - no reason you can&#x27;t have recourse for property damage even if you are letting someone stay in your house free of charge.<p>I also just think the narrative you&#x27;re spinning is sort of misleading. Rich people overwhelmingly <i>do</i> have remedies for wrongs and have the capacity to pursue legal action.')
