Every year, people have to justify their funding at the risk of having the funding removed. I have quasi-personal experience with the withdrawing of funding when Congress killed the Superconducting Super Collider. They killed it the same year that I was in high school and was going to spend time as an intern as several of my older classmates had done.<p>I know we&#x27;re speaking the same base. Science funding is woefully short for pure scientific research endeavors. The US gave up on the race for discovery a long long time ago before I was born. The &quot;why?&quot; must always be backed up with a solid money making something. &quot;Why?&quot; can no longer be &quot;because we don&#x27;t know what we might find out&quot; for a response that will get funded.')
