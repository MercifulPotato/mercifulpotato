I&#x27;ve found those to be more valuable, especially in the long term, since they&#x27;re typically harder to unseat if the keywords are too generic. I&#x27;ve set up a quick process for targeting keyphrases in sites and pages that I want to boost.<p>First, I figure out how much interest is in a phrase that is related to what my site is about. I&#x27;ll go to Google and Bing and start searching for various keywords and see what autocomplete suggests. If the suggestions are relevant, I&#x27;ll follow them and note roughly how many results there are and how relevant the top results are to the phrase.<p>Next, I&#x27;ll go to trends.google.com and compare the most relevant phrases to see how many searches are being performed for each. Then I compare that against the list of quality results to see where the biggest gaps are. That helps me to identify the phrase that I want to target.<p>Then, I&#x27;ll plug the phrase changes into the page that I want new users to land on (typically just the homepage, but this can sometimes be a particular section or article, depending on the site and its goals).<p>Then, I&#x27;ll go to seowarp.com and throw the page through a Full Scan which reports on phrasing information. Near the bottom, there&#x27;s a &quot;Duplicate Content&quot; section that will compare similarities between pages, so if there&#x27;s anything that is textually similar to my target page, I&#x27;ll adjust it to drive more attention to the target one for relevancy. I&#x27;ll also do a Single Page scan for my target page. The results of that scan will have a &quot;First Five Targetted Keywords Detected&quot; section that will show any keyphrases that are found on the page. Again, I&#x27;ll make sure that my target phrase appears and cull any others that might be taking away any attention from it.<p>After that looks good, I&#x27;ll distribute links to the page that contains the phrase. Usually I&#x27;ll see results start popping up within a week, but can take longer depending on the strength of the campaign.')
