I cannot operate without spellcheck, yet in a other language I can spell almost every word correctly. I always thought this is happening due to lack of consistent spelling. For those not familiar, in English you cannot tell how to spell a word if you hear it the first time. This because there are different rules for words with French origin (colleague) vs German (leitmotif) vs Latin (anima).')
