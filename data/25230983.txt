I am not saying that they have not did bad things, but if Germany had won, they would say the same about U.S., who, just as a reminder, dropped two nuclear bombs in civilian cities.<p>Both sides thought what they were doing was right and there is always a way to justify the means.<p>Disclaimer: I am from a country which was neutral during the WW2.<p>Edit: Here is the thing, I do not want this to become a &quot;Who is the most evil?&quot; thread, so I will not be responding except for this edit (I suggest everyone to do the same).<p>The point of this comment was that, public perspective is something that can easily be manipulated. The phrase &quot;History is written by the victors.&quot; means exactly that. I just wanted to mention that Germany would use the example I gave to justify their actions &quot;Wow they are evil. see what they did?&quot;. One should always be mindful where they are standing and check if they are being manipulated or not.<p>If this comment starts a flame war, dang, please feel free to delete the whole thread.')
