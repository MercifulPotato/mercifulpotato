But Timnit has less power (and can&#x27;t even release the email thread because she&#x27;s been locked out of her accounts as far as I know) and no-one I know who has worked with her seems to think of her as a vindictive person so until Google releases the email thread, I&#x27;m gonna slightly go with her version of the events.')
