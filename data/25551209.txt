The ship is propelled, at least in part, by large powered vertical rotors, sometimes known as rotor sails. German engineer Anton Flettner was the first to build a ship that attempted to tap this force for propulsion, and ships using his type of rotor are sometimes known as Flettner ships.<p>Container ships reduce the superstructure to enable loading but these rotor sails could possibly be used on oil tankers and bulk carriers. We donâ€™t hear about autonomous water vessels very often, perhaps a Flettner water drone is possible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotor_ship" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotor_ship</a>')
