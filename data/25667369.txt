Relatedly I found myself wondering the other day if anyone has done any work on making hardware and software to interface with Smart Media Card.<p>Specifically in my case, I have a Korg Triton Le 88 ROMpler keyboard that has a slot for Smart Media Card and my thinking is that instead of buying a Smart Media Card reader and card and all of that stuff it’d be cool to open up the keyboard and solder a connector onto the pins that the card slot of the keyboard connects to, and then with a bit of extra hardware to be able to connect my computer to it so that I can expose files directly from the computer to the Triton Le and have the Triton Le see it as though there was a Smart Media Card there. And hopefully that way being able to make new sample files and load them without going through an intermediate step of putting them onto external media.<p>And also because with the right parts this solution would be more readily replaceable, whereas Smart Media Card is an obsolete format that to my knowledge is no longer being created so Smart Media Cards are hard to come by [0] [1]. xD to SMC adapters exist though [2], but again connecting the computer directly would be more convenient and either way I don’t use xD for anything else so don’t really want to buy xD cards. And the only memory card reader I have for my computer anyways is SD&#x2F;microSD only also, because that’s the only kind of memory cards I currently use.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.vintagesynth.com&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=104354" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.vintagesynth.com&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=104354</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SmartMedia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SmartMedia</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.aliexpress.com&#x2F;item&#x2F;32356606261.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.aliexpress.com&#x2F;item&#x2F;32356606261.html</a>')
