Maybe they only use generated data for the train set and then do cross-validation on real data? I&#x27;d like to hear them chime in on this thread if any are reading here.<p>Theoretically speaking if the generated data has the same distribution and parameters as the real data [1], and encodes similar nonparametric features like seasonality and user activity, I <i>think</i> generated data might be fine. [2]<p>_________<p>1. Admittedly tricky if you have limited data and no insight into the underlying population distribution&#x2F;features, just those of the sample. But then you have a worse problem for modeling diagnostics anyway.<p>2. In the sense that anything is &quot;fine&quot;, which is a spectrum that requires some critical skepticism in statistics. There are always caveats but it may still be robust and useful.')
