He has been one of the primary cheerleaders for globalism which has been a major driver of corporations gaining more favor from the government. This favor has been in the many forms including favorable trade deals (to China and the companies that manufacture there), ignoring the environmental impact of manufacturing in China which hurts all people especially the citizens of China, lax immigration enforcement (which led to more competition for the workers and cheaper labor for the companies), and ultra low interest rates that make it difficult for people to save money without buying overpriced assets and accepting extended risk.')
