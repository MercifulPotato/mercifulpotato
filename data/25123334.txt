Truthfully, why do people think git is hard?  Seriously, as programmers we do many, many things that are really hard.  Things like thinking about abstract data structures, understanding concurrent processing, etc. I can understand not knowing it and how that frustrates people, but I genuinely don&#x27;t understand why people are afraid to just dig in and learn git. Some of the commands I admit are confusing at times, and I have to look commands up, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever looked at git and said, this too difficult for me to understand.<p>Honestly, I would really love to know, because I have to teach git fundamentals in a couple of months at work.')
