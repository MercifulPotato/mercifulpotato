But Debian already changed its ways in controversial shift to systemd that leave many users disappointed - pragmatism and modernisation efforts prevailed over traditional ways of composability, stability and predictability. Why shouldn&#x27;t this happen for the policy of packages as well? The Debian way is hitting its limits and is ripe for some updates. The amount of work needed to maintain foreign hard to comprehend software has to be curbed to make it manageable in the future. If enough people say &quot;yeah lets package it as is and be done with it&quot; why shouldn&#x27;t Debian go that way? It is natural to change and adapt. Big software with fast release cadency is going to get even more complex and harder to package each release.')
