Item(by='JoshTriplett', descendants=None, kids=[25637846], score=None, time=1609793479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636564, text='&gt; my current logic is to use cursor: pointer on anything that visually looks like a link (e.g. unstyled text), and to leave it as default for components that have a visual affordance that they are clickable (e.g. buttons or tabs). I realize this might not be the most web-like convention though - might be worth it to just move all clickable components to the pointer cursor.<p>The cursor isn&#x27;t the only problem. The way you present the screenshot fundamentally <i>looks</i> like a functional profile. It isn&#x27;t just that the links look like links but aren&#x27;t clickable. Text also isn&#x27;t selectable. In general, it&#x27;s in the uncanny valley that feels really uncomfortable. Consider making it look very obviously like a sample screenshot: caption it at the top, move it to the side beside (rather than above) the explanation of the site, layer a couple of profiles atop each other so they look like &quot;sheets&quot;, or similar. Those would help trip people&#x27;s &quot;ah, it&#x27;s a sample screenshot&quot; pattern recognition.')
