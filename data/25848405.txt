I found it absurd, here you are making an ordeal of holding doors for people, like it makes you a great person, a useless gesture, and meanwhile the singular act of goodwill we have needed from others in 100 years is a freaking mask, and it is &quot;robbing you of your freedoms&quot;.<p>I am biased though. I&#x27;ve always had a huge admiration of Japan and resentment that I couldn&#x27;t wear a mask when sick, because it is illegal in many jurisdictions in the US for anyone over 18 to wear a mask as well as those under when it&#x27;s not halloween.<p>I highly doubt after the pandemic masks are going to suddenly be legalized. Cops appear to just be ignoring the law right now, which is absurd.')
