It has only 100 or so employees. Has been in business for 25+ years. But we are on a continual drive to increase sales, hire new people, add size to the facilities. But it wasn&#x27;t always this way. It only happened once it went public. Now we are working for the investors. They need to see an increasing return on their investment. Management choices are no longer about the customer or providing a great product&#x2F;service. It&#x27;s about squeezing margins and duping the customer to join our mailing list or accept cookies. Otherwise &quot;the list won&#x27;t grow&quot;. And how can we market to more and more people if we can&#x27;t track how many pages they&#x27;ve viewed?<p>I&#x27;ve gone a bit off track there, but the point being, there IS no answer when I&#x27;ve explicitly asked &quot;why&quot; with regards to these things. Nobody knows. They just know they have &quot;targets&quot; and the targets are constantly moving.<p>&#x2F;rant over')
