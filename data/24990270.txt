But it&#x27;s a big problem how much incorrect information already exists in music databases (including copyright databases, which make a living off providing supposedly correct information), and blindly copying information between sources propagates such errors.<p>Preserving the diversity of sources, and only judiciously updating information, at least gives a chance of evolving toward a more correct representation of the world.<p>Discogs, for instance, seems fairly accurate for release dates (Something that e.g. AllMusic can&#x27;t be trusted for at all). And discogs is a wonderful source for photos of album front and back covers and record labels, which by definition are first hand evidence (even if they themselves not infrequently contain errors).<p>Information on e.g. track composers is unreliable, and musician and label information is sometimes a mess (multiple entries per musician, inconsistent attribution of releases to label &#x2F; country sublabels, musician &#x2F; band). All of this is hard to avoid in a huge database like this.<p>I have not worked with Musicbrainz as a source, but it does not have a reputation as being particularly reliable.')
