Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608155220, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421086, text='FYI kortbroek is <i>shorts</i> in English :) Afrikaans is &#x27;n grappige taal als Nederlander! :D Fun fact: you have an easier time understanding Dutch than vice versa, I always felt weird that you guys seemed to be fine with Dutch but I couldn&#x27;t understand sentences in Afrikaans but it seems that it&#x27;s not just me. Let me know if you care about the reasoning, I didn&#x27;t fully get it but can probably find the original video where I learned this.<p>Also sorry for the off topic but I figured two days after the thread mostly died (everything&#x27;s so ephemeral here) it doesn&#x27;t really matter.')
