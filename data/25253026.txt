I used to play as a young girl (pre-teen) and enjoyed it but as I got older didn&#x27;t feel welcome in the chess club. It&#x27;s nice how they show on TV that girls who wanted it just got in there and be involved but the reality was not as easy.. (hopefully it&#x27;s easier now, the 80s was not kind to girls with a nerdish bent).<p>I&#x27;ve started reading chess openings and tactics as a way to send me to sleep, on one of those chess sites that sets up a play for you. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever play chess again - time is limited and I don&#x27;t think anyone would suffer playing with me given what I&#x27;ve forgotten - but I&#x27;m enjoying learning strategies again. It&#x27;s great stuff for the brain.<p>I&#x27;ve put the Chess Tactics site on my weekend-lazy-reading list. Who knows, maybe I find my way back to playing games again.')
