The AMA is one of the two funders of LCME, the accrediting agency of medical schools for MDs (outside of the med school trade association itself). While they do not run medical schools, they have enormous power over training standards, who should be a physician, how medicine should be practiced, and who shouldn&#x27;t practice.

Much of this derives originally from the Flexner Report which created the current system of US medical education, which is still based on old sensibilities that physicians should be professional gentlemen and &quot;proper&quot; (and perhaps fueled by cocaine -- no seriously, google &quot;halstead cocaine&quot;).<p>I am not a physician, but I have been in the guts of healthcare for quite a while, and the AMA continues to pop up as the man behind the curtain surprisingly often.')
