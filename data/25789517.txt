Same for the meat, was kind of floppy and the cheese just didn&#x27;t taste like much. There were some good things from farmers markets, but at absurd prices.<p>I see differences in Europe as well, e.g. I think the quality in Switzerland is better than Germany and Austria. In Spain and France I was able to get really good food, probably because it&#x27;s closer to where it is produced.<p>Again this might be my perception, didn&#x27;t do a blind tasting. Unless the food is specially prepared to be stored (like fermented food, cheese, etc.), I don&#x27;t think the highly industrial production, refrigeration and long transportation is doing the quality any favours.')
