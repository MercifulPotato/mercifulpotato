Trump campaign wins, promotes policies that are beneficial to Russia (slow walking support for Ukraine, attacking NATO, generally gutting the State Department, and a plethora of other moves that cripple US soft power, edit: Oh, and how could I forget sanctions relief and readmission to G8?), and Putin approves a real estate project that benefits Trump financially. It&#x27;s telling that Trump is the first president in history not to divest himself of his global financial stakes, which represent a massive conflict of interest.<p>Pretty basic garden variety bribery.')
