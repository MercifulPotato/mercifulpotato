The article is a little odd.<p>&quot;free as in beer&quot; vs &quot;free as in speech&quot; is already such a perfectly clear way to distinguish between the two meanings of the word &quot;free&quot;, that it boggles me that people still manage to be confused by it. That IS already the simple intuitive non-academic small-vocabulary no-riddles way to illuminate it.<p>&quot;free as in beer&quot; is not about &quot;it&#x27;s a way to trick you into eventually spending more so it&#x27;s not really free&quot;<p>It just means something you don&#x27;t pay for, that&#x27;s it.<p>Maybe another way to say it is &quot;free as in money&quot; vs &quot;free as in permission&quot;.
