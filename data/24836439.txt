While there are various possible setups, one fairly common arrangement (especially in a more public-facing services) is to start a throw-away VM for each CI request. This is how our CI service works and you can see it here[1] in action.<p>And while it would have been nice to use Turing Pi, it does not appear to fit our requirements very well because we need to have high-performance storage attached to each node (where we store&#x2F;run the VMs). An ideal board for us would be a network switch plus for each module a PCIe (or better yet, NVMe) slot and USB 2.0 ports (at least 2x).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ci.cppget.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ci.cppget.org</a>')
