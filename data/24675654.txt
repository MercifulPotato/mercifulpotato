Regardless of their public statements, other countries aren&#x27;t actually trying to minimize the number of sick and dead. The public health measures in place are generally insufficient to contain the pandemic, so I predict that many areas will reach a significant level of herd immunity before a safe and effective vaccine is widely available. We won&#x27;t know whether that prediction is accurate until about a year from now.')
