I take every possible opportunity to extend timelines, create buffer, and reduce scope.  I&#x27;m highly incentivized to farm as much time as possible, so that&#x27;s what I do.<p>I try to target obscure projects that I already know how to do, where there&#x27;s an assumption that nobody really knows how to do it because it&#x27;s obscure.  Complexity and obscurity are great cover.  Picking up legacy projects on old tech is a good way to do this.  &quot;Oh no, PHP sucks! Nobody&#x27;s touched this code in years!  Not to worry, give me a couple of days I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll figure it out.&quot;  Now my estimate is 3x longer than it would be if I was working in the areas under normal development.<p>I&#x27;ve also got my notifications pretty dialed-in so I never appear absent when someone needs me.  I prevent slack from marking me idle.  I turn my notifications to a more aggressive setting when I want to take a nap.<p>Nobody knows how long it takes to get a piece of code working, not even other programmers, so who cares if it takes a week instead of a day.  Sometimes I keep a local branch that&#x27;s represents my actual work and a second branch for pushing to the team.  If I get in &quot;flow&quot; and want to get something done in a block of many hours, I can drip-feed the commits over a couple of days instead of dropping a PR at 2am and having everyone think I&#x27;m free to work on something else tomorrow.  With a little shell scripting, I can make commits and push on a timer too, which is sometimes useful if I need to &quot;work late&quot; because everyone is stressed.<p>When something blows up in prod, I put in the extra hours with a good attitude.  That helps create the perception that I&#x27;m the go-to person for things and a team player, so it&#x27;s not surprising to anyone if I&#x27;m running a little late on a deliverable because I had to drop everything and help with something important (another way to add more buffer).  I also try to pair sometimes, especially with new coworkers, so that they can see me working in short bursts.  Pairing serves as a psychological anchor that I must work that way all the time.  After all, I don&#x27;t want people thinking I&#x27;m lazy.<p>Sometimes mistakes happen and I do get stuck working an 8 hour day, but those mistakes would have been 16 hour days if I wasn&#x27;t actively avoiding doing as much work as possible.<p>As much as I can stomach it, I try to use the extra time to socialize with coworkers to help raise my visibility and build allies.  That&#x27;s the smart thing to do.  In reality, I mostly play video games, do housework, and anxiously wait until work is &quot;over&quot; for the day so I can detach from my notifications.<p>Has tech turned me into a sociopath?  Maybe.  Do I feel like a prisoner in my own home?  Certainly. \n But if I don&#x27;t use this strategy, I&#x27;ll constantly be over-committed, burned out, salty, and missing social connections with coworkers that are more valuable than the actual work.<p>I can&#x27;t wait until I have enough money to be financially independent and never have to do this nonsense again.')
