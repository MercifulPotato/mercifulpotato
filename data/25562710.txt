We should be looking for our open computing platform elsewhere - I think there is more than enough options. If a supposedly &quot;open&quot; platform wasn&#x27;t open then that would be bad, but Apple is about something different - offering a premium vertically integrated product for people that don&#x27;t even know what a CPU or OS is. If they were forced to open their platform it is very much possible there wouldn&#x27;t be any Apple platform at all, and I don&#x27;t want that kind of world.<p>&gt; though governing bodies may disagree!<p>That&#x27;s why I am reacting so strongly. If people begin to apply your thinking too broadly (e.g. to businesses like Apple) it will lead to governing bodies behaving like that. Let&#x27;s apply this kind of thinking to platforms that claim to be open.')
