Solo work at home, collaborative work in &quot;studios&quot;, basically reimagining the offices into collaborative&#x2F;convening spaces that you go into from ~once&#x2F;week to once a quarter depending on team&#x2F;role.<p>Remote-only cuts out the in-person experience entirely, which is problematic for building teams and culture; and ad hoc &quot;WFH whenever you feel like it&quot; gets a sort of worst-of-both-worlds situation where you neither get the same kind of flexibility nor the sense of community you typically get from an office (since a large percentage of the team isn&#x27;t there on any given day, and folks that come in the office less tend to be at a disadvantage in terms of visibility &amp; recognition).')
