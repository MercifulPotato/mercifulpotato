Whether that&#x27;s revolutionary or not particularly noteworthy depends on the individual use case. If you&#x27;re don&#x27;t care that much about power&#x2F;heat&#x2F;fan-noise, it&#x27;s neat but not (yet) world shattering. Bit if you live your life on a small laptop, it may well be.<p>According to rumors, we&#x27;ll see Apple&#x27;s 8 Firestorm + 4 Icestorm CPU  within a quarter or two in the 16-inch MacBook (current M1 is 4 Firestorm + 4 Icestorm, where Firestorm is the high-performance core). That will perform somewhere between a 5800X and 5900X (or some recent 16-core Xeon that nobody remembers the name&#x2F;number of). Again, revolutionary or meh depends on use case.<p>Linux native is not in the cards but it won&#x27;t matter, it will work fine virtualized with hardly any performance penalty (for ARM64 linux). If for some reason you insist on native linux, it&#x27;s time to recognize that Apple hardware is not for you.<p>Personally I run my server workload on servers far away and let other people deal with infra (particularly, power, networking and physical security). But it&#x27;s probably great for heavy media creators on the go.')
