Snowden is a fugitive. As it pertains to the majority of what was stolen, he is not a whistleblower, but a thief.<p>___<p>ps: Censorship Alert -- my account ios14 was shadowbanned after making these replies:<p>1 points by ios14 10 days ago | parent [–] | on: DOJ – International Statement: End-to-End Encrypti...<p>What are the odds that big tech and big brother are in bed creating a huge dog and pony show to counter the post-Snowden “going dark” reality?\nGiven: The public knows about mass surveillance. Big tech deploys supposedly unbreakable end to end encryption. The public feels more safe and protected from Big Brother yet again.\nTheory: Meanwhile, behind the scenes, government and big tech have, in secret, the ability to recover such encrypted comms. The DOJ initiative would then be part of an elaborate psyop to further deceive people into believing that FB “has their back”.\nI’m going to guess that third parties have extensively reverse engineered apps such as fb messenger to ensure that it is essentially impossible for the above to be the case, since E2EE occurs at the endpoints.\nCan an encryption expert weigh in here?\nEdit: this also raises general concerns I have about trusting an App Store to install what is supposed to be installed, and not a backdoor’ed version of an app. Something like: Let the reverse engineers have an unmodified app, while distributing alternate versions to other unsuspecting users.\nreply<p>*<p>1 point by ios14 10 days ago [–]<p>Also, odds that the govt has secret radically advanced quantum computing tech and does have a QC to recover using Shor’s? (Yea, probably unlikely as it would takes millions of qubits to achieve this..)\nHow long before lattice based crypto is sufficiently vetted for wide deployment?')
