Take a 100 track project with two plug-ins per track (say, compressor and EQ). If the compressor is x86 and the EQ is ARM, that&#x27;s 200 context switches per audio period. That makes it impossible to run at small buffer sizes. A <i>very</i> smart flowgraph implementation could attempt to batch everything into the minimum number of context switches, but that has other problems with threading. It&#x27;s very hard to get this perfect.<p>This solution works fine for when you just have a few straggler plug-ins of the wrong architecture, but it would still require quite complex engineering by the DAW to make it work transparently to the user. Consider, for example, that the plug-in UI needs to embed in the DAW across a process boundary.')
