And instead of thanking and trying to integrate (and understand) the way you live in your home, these people start thinking that they own your home and YOU should be the one who should be tolerant of their actions.&quot;</i><p>This is a fantasy.<p>The people who &quot;refuse to integrate&quot; are usually marginalized and oppressed, and have no realistic future in the society that insisting that they &quot;integrate&quot;.<p>Not to mention that &quot;integration&quot; usually means losing one&#x27;s own historical, religious, and ethnic identity, from language to customs, which those people in the majority who insist that minorities should integrate would themselves be outraged by if they had to give up their own identities in the same way.<p>People who are all gung-ho about integration rarely have even the faintest idea of what it&#x27;s like to live long-term as an immigrant or an outsider in a society very different from their own.  They think it&#x27;s a piece of cake to integrate.  They should give it a try themselves sometime in a radically different place and see how they like it.<p>Yet many immigrants do just that, if not by the first generation, then in later generations when their children forget the old ways and do anything to fit in, and yet that&#x27;s not enough for the bigots and xenophobes (ie. nationalists).  They have to be of &quot;pure blood&quot; down to the nth generation (especially ironic in the US where virtually everyone descends from immigrants of not so very long ago).')
