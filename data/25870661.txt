Then later, &quot;c&quot; changes, and you&#x27;d like to re-compute the total. One option would be to re-run the full sum, a + b + c, which would be fine. However, that repeats the &quot;a + b&quot; calculation.<p>Would it be possible to improve the efficiency of the total calculation by re-using the pre-computed &quot;a + b&quot; if only &quot;c&quot; changes?<p>Differential dataflow is one way to do that, but only really applies if you have lots of data with complex calculations. For analytics, maybe the &quot;a + b&quot; calculation would cover your last 5 years of operations, and then when a new day&#x27;s worth of data comes in, you just compute the changes to the totals, rather than re-computing the analytics for all those years, all without manually having to write distinct &quot;total&quot; and &quot;update&quot; code.')
