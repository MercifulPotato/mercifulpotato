Not only does Apple build their own hardware, they also have the trust needed to make it mainstream.<p>Trust in the parent company is a core requirement of AR, one that FB will never be able to deliver, their brand is kaputt in that regard. In FBs position I&#x27;d try to sell it, the team  they have working on it is great, they don&#x27;t deserve the backlash from the trust issues of the parent company.')
