Camus&#x27;s the stranger and Sartre&#x27;s no exit are great works that are foremost page turners while also demanding considerable thought. I like thus spoke zarathrustra a lot but it will be difficult with no background. If you want to get serious read the greeks. Beyond that it really depends on which area you&#x27;re interested in. The Stanford encyclopedia is a great resource. I&#x27;d stay away from Hegel and Kant at first, although they are incredibly influential. They&#x27;ll probably turn you away because it&#x27;s so hard to parse.')
