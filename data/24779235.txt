Manufacturing tolerance and reliability is notoriously bad for Teslas. Tesla also under pays and over works employees at a rate that&#x27;s unheard of in the valley.<p>Tesla&#x27;s strengths lie in battery technology, an army of blind supporters and it being run as a silicon valley tech firm.<p>&gt; &quot;Tesla, he (<i>VW CEO Herbert Diess</i>) said, isn&#x27;t just a carmaker, but also a battery manufacturer, a dealer and a service provider. He says this enables Tesla to identify customer needs in an &quot;unparalleled&quot; way and to generate profits in areas that go &quot;far beyond what we can do with our conventional car business.&quot;<p>He hit the nail on the head.<p>Elon Musk taught the Germans a vital silicon valley lesson. &quot;Moonshot investments even in the most stable of times are necessary to not get caught with your pants down.&quot; (AKA, Buy Instagram and Oculus for $2 Billion, or else it will cost you 20$ billion (whatsapp ) or worse, it can consume your entire market overnight (Tiktok).)<p>Auto manufacturers tunnel visioned on gas vehicles, and made investments a bit too late. Now they&#x27;ve learnt the wrong lesson. Their foolish billion$ acquisitions of unproven self-driving car startups that have nothing to show for it, is proof that they are panicking.<p>_____________<p>(<i>edit, I do not mean to downplay the battery tech. If anything, Tesla&#x27;s market position entirely showcases why it is so important. The blind supporters help, but the other 2 strengths count for a bit more.</i>)')
