In most countries, particularly former British colonies, a pardon power of some sort exists, but in developed ones it&#x27;s typically not, de facto, wielded by an individual (in the UK, for instance, it&#x27;s theoretically wielded by the Home Secretary, but in practice a Home Secretary who used it unilaterally would find themselves immediately looking for a new job, and the norm is that it&#x27;s barely used at all).<p>The UK used it a lot more at the time that the US became independent, which may be where the US got it from.<p>I don&#x27;t think _any_ developed democratic country has a pardon power as unrestrained as the US one (even in countries with executive presidencies it&#x27;s usually constrained in some way).')
