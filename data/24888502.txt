They are in no way mutually exclusive. I walked about three hours yesterday and it was easy (and I own a car too).  I download things from YouTube I don’t need to watch and just start walking&#x2F;hiking.<p>You will burn anywhere from 75-200 calories&#x2F;mile walking&#x2F;hiking. I did like 14 miles yesterday. I will take weight off of you or allow you to eat whatever you want the easiest vs perceived exertion.<p>Side benefit, the world is strange and people are weird and you get a good dose of that. Saw a ground squirrel running down a trail carrying a severed rabbits head the other day, fun!')
