(And because of some slightly cringey comments about not wanting to see so many homeless people, but that&#x27;s not the editorial comment I&#x27;m trying to make right now.)<p>But, he&#x27;s keeping his house in CA (for &quot;weekends and vacations&quot;), and he&#x27;s building his studio in Vegas to be an exact replica of the old one.<p>So, yeah, charitably, &quot;moving&quot; for the highly wealthy does not really look anything like &quot;moving&quot; for anybody else.<p>Less charitably, it seems like a scam. In GS&#x27; case, nobody can tell where he&#x27;s doing his work from, so &quot;oh we spent too long at the beach on this &#x27;vacation day,&#x27;&quot; better stay here and film tomorrow&#x27;s episode from CA, nobody will ever know.&quot; In EM&#x27;s case, I suspect he spends more time business-traveling than at home anyway, so it would be pretty difficult to prove which of his houses he &quot;lives&quot; in.<p>And if anybody balks, there&#x27;s a huge amount of PR content proving that they &quot;moved.&quot;<p>This wouldn&#x27;t bug me so much if it weren&#x27;t for the arrogant, selfish, hubristic political comments they always make on the way out.')
