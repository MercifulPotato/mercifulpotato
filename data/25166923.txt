They&#x27;re not shutting down all their reactors right away or anything.  But for a country that took pride in betting big on nuclear, officially planning to go from 70% nuclear to 50% is a pretty huge drop.  They&#x27;ve already shut down the first two reactors at Fessenheim as part of this.<p>Yes, they&#x27;re kicking the can down the road slightly at last news.  That&#x27;s not surprising since many of the reactors may be possible to life-extend to 50 years, and renewable energy costs are dropping quickly. Delaying a few years saves some money.  But that does not change the fact that many of the reactors will not be replaced when they hit end-of-life.')
