In reality the bill of rights is interpreted in a legal context that allows for collectivization of rights, but culturally there&#x27;s a strong tie to individual liberty that I am  shocked someone could deny with a straight face.<p>• You seem to be conflating collectivism with tribalism. Antagonistic and in&#x2F;out group relations are not necessary for or equivalent to collectivization. Making the two agree is the whole point of &quot;internationalism&quot;.<p>• Collectivization necessarily implies that the distribution of equity aligns with the needs of the collective. This is trivially false for all of the ways you&#x27;ve chosen to divvy up society into tribal groups except, I guess, catholicism vs protestantism (which I barely see as a dynamic here anyway).<p>More generally I think you are right, there are great instances of collectivization in the US:  I&#x27;m not seeing them in your examples, though! The Postal Service, the Public School &amp; Public Library culture are fantastic examples. Even the famously anti-socialist right can be quite collectivized if you look at how, economically, individuals distribute resources to their friends, family, community, &quot;tribe&quot;, etc. Arguably many churches in American Christianity foster very collectivized approaches to resource distribution—I know I grew up working my church&#x27;s food pantry....<p>However, if we as americans look in a mirror, we are trained to only see ourselves as individuals or part of small isolated groups or &quot;tribes&quot;, not as a cell of some larger, functioning, rational, identifiable whole america.')
