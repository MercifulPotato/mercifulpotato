Item(by='v64', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610870690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808924, text='&gt; But the only legitimate use of a flash loan is to do some arbitrage - and thereâ€™s plenty of that in existing financial systems.<p>There are two main differences:<p>1) The atomic nature of a flash loan makes flash loan arbitrage much less risky than performing arbitrage traditionally. Doing the same type of arbitrage non-atomically may mean that you miss the arbitrage opportunity, resulting in a loss from having to pay back the loan you took out plus interest without having made any money with it.<p>2) Because the debt must be repaid in the same transaction, the loan is uncollateralized. As far as I know, one cannot borrow millions of dollars in the traditional financial system without putting up some kind of collateral.<p>&gt; What a sensible attacker should do is: 1) watch for flash loan transactions to be submitted by someone, then 2) quickly submit a duplicate transaction with a larger fee, but change the destination wallets to your own.<p>This has been observed on the blockchain in practice. The paper I linked to describes the mechanics of how this plays out and what strategies competing arbitrageurs use to win these opportunities.')
