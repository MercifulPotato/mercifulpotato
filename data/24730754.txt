My feeling is that this was caused by how text and the images were combined to tell the story. Images contain too much information and tend to make me focus on them instead of the text outside them, so I was ending up missing part of the information. I find visual storytelling interesting as a concept but probably it needs an approach similar to comics? The visual part is dominant and the textual part of the story is embedded to it, so it&#x27;s easier to follow.')
