But I assume it probably has a much smaller probability than that.<p>If instead of a Wiener process, we model it as a Wiener process with drift, as X_t = \\mu t + \\sigma W_t , how does the probability of &quot;For all t in [0,7], X_{t+5} &gt; X_t&quot; vary with \\mu ? (well, obviously, as \\mu increases, the probability goes up, but I mean stuff like &quot;how big does \\mu have to be in order for it to not be unlikely?&quot; and &quot;how quickly does the probability increase as \\mu increases?&quot;, etc. . )')
