Some of the features include chroot, process groups, user&#x2F;group permissions, cgroups, network multiplexing (e.g. inetd, nat), namespaces (network, mount, pid, user, etc.) and unshare&#x2F;setns, union file systems like unionfs&#x2F;aufs&#x2F;overlayfs, etc.. There are a lot of ways you can implement container orchestration systems on Linux.<p>And as noted, OpenVZ and Linux Vserver were earlier container subsystems for Linux.')
