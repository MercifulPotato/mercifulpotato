But you&#x27;re right, there&#x27;s no laws saying one cannot guilt trip someone else or shame them for their behavior even if they are acting legally.<p>I think this is me criticizing those same &quot;social norms&quot;. In my opinion, it is unfair to guilt trip someone or have hidden expectations when someone does a good deed for you. Especially when you decided to do the deed on your own and you went and promoted it for others to benefit and use.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s nice when you do something and others thank you and acknowledge you for it. But it isn&#x27;t nice when someone complains they&#x27;re not getting a thank you for something they choose to do willingly and weren&#x27;t asked to do.<p>Now I reckon here it&#x27;s a bit different, because we&#x27;re talking about two actors of very uneven footing, and I would like to see Amazon being more thankful and recognising the hard work of open source contributors. I agree with that sentiment. I just wanted to say that in general, yes those social norms are often against what I&#x27;d consider a free society, since they are just another axis of power to force you into behaviors you might not have agreed to participate in.')
