The fact that the first example is using printf just shows that the best it can offer is some things we already know (template metaprogramming sucks etc.).<p>C++20 has std::format which is insanely more powerful, safe and performant than printf. To say that you should only be using the non-allocating functions is also bad advice. The whole thing reeks of someone who didn&#x27;t bother to measure where he was actually spending time.<p>I didn&#x27;t read the whole thing but I&#x27;m expecting that hes bashing exceptions too, even though they don&#x27;t cost anything other than code size unless you actually throw. And it&#x27;s perfectly fine to turn them off, if you&#x27;re fine with abort.<p>Really, the only thing I can think of that I really dislike about both C and C++ is that backtraces should have been a first class citizens since the early 2000s. I think that&#x27;s a huge reason why people pick up other languages more quickly too.')
