The strong points include rapid data and logic modeling, json serialization (jbuilder), robust libraries for user management (devise) and many other things, built-in security, routing logic, easy testing, and meta programming. You still get rapid prototyping in api mode, with a rails generate scaffold quickly capable of creating tables and a json rest api for that resource in a single line with no additional work necessary (assuming you had no business logic, which is generally easier to write in ruby as well).')
