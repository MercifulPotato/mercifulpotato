Community leaders can custom-tailor their approach to what their community needs, instead of a blanket, one-size-fits-all nationwide programs that waste money.<p>Many of them could be run as community charities or even profitable businesses, if national government would just get out of the way and let innovation work its magic!<p>And I mean well-intentioned, but wasteful programs like:<p>- libraries (partner with publishers instead!)<p>- grand-making arts programs<p>- mandatory Common Core preschools (instilling a dislike of education from a young age!)<p>- programs for reduced-cost and free lunches (just use surplus food that already exists!)<p>- community colleges (can be run for profit)<p>- job retraining programs (we already have technical schools!)<p>- public health and drug rehab (pharma companies can step-up instead)<p>- national parks and wildlife preservation (why not let the market decide which ones are worth it?)<p>Suddenly, we&#x27;ll have taken a big bite out of our unsustainable debt!')
