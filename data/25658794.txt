Item(by='almog', descendants=None, kids=[25659089], score=None, time=1609948569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658528, text='&gt; CLRS is over 1000 very dense pages. I assume the author just did a fairly casual reading and didn&#x27;t work through many problems.<p>When I saw his day to day plan include things like chapters 22-26 of CLRS, I thought the same and casual might be an understatement unless he has read this book multiple times already.<p>DDIA was by far the preparation reading I&#x27;ve enjoyed the most. I&#x27;m currently reading it again. It is so eloquent and fun to read but other than just the fact that internalizing these topics to a level where one can feel comfortable discussing and reasoning about them, you can also use this book to navigate a deeper learning path through its many footnotes.')
