Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25670353, 25669336], score=None, time=1610011047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668206, text='&gt; One thought that comes to mind is that I&#x27;m sure the most heavily armed nation in the world could have gotten rid of these people in no time, but perhaps they didn&#x27;t because of the symbolism of the location.<p>Oh no, the police let them through, there&#x27;s clips showing they literally opened the gates, pictures of them taking selfies, etc. It&#x27;s the &quot;blue lives matter&quot; subculture within those groups, where the police think they&#x27;re on their side and the protestors think the police is on their side. The policemen involved should be fired and charged with dereliction of duty and conspiracy or something like that. Of course, there should have been a lot more (riot) police active as well, since it was known in advance it was going to be a bad protest.')
