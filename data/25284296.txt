I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard for you to see why I&#x27;m not keen on it.<p>But there is a simple way to solve this. If your union has, as a bylaw, &quot;It is an immutable rule of this union that it shall never act to decrease or keep constant the number of immigrants to the USA. If this union acts in that manner, it shall be immediately dissolved and all membership rolls shall be destroyed after refunds for that month&#x27;s membership fees&quot;, then I won&#x27;t oppose it.<p>Considering that we are to act in solidarity, all I&#x27;m asking is for that measure of good faith. Just put down the knife and go stand in front. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.')
