Item(by='knaq', descendants=None, kids=[25403082, 25402566], score=None, time=1607805837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398612, text='Likewise, a lot of us are hoping that a significant number of Democrat voters <i>know</i> the truth and are just playing hardball politics, not that it is much better.<p>You didn&#x27;t want this result?<p>You should have thought about that when you supported weakening election security. Republicans aren&#x27;t buying your excuses about the virus, or about black people being unable to get an ID card, or about anything else. You broke security on purpose. Any lack of evidence is because you purposely make it impossible to collect the evidence. (like a cop turning off his camera before doing evil) The result has been expected for months: a fraudulent Biden victory.<p>Next time, maybe cooperate on election security? Is that too much to ask?<p>Ink the fingers, since we&#x27;re 3rd-world now. Have ID, just like India and Mexico do. All votes must be cast in person. Take extra pictures when voting (face, fingerprints, iris, retina), to better enable prosecution of misbehavior. No machine goes on a network. Every machine is observed by multiple unrelated people (don&#x27;t know each other) for the entire time, starting from verification that it is empty and continuing until all recounts are completed. No excuses.<p>You asked for the current situation when you dismantled what little security we had. Expecting opponents to trust the result is absurd. You broke security because you knew that fraud in your favor would happen if people didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting caught.')
