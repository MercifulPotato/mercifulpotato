Five people died. You can claim their shouts to kill the VP were bluster if you&#x27;d like, but personally I&#x27;m in no doubt that things could have gone south very, very quickly if they&#x27;d found Pence, Pelosi or anyone else. Just watching the video footage of the violence is enough of a hint of that.<p>&gt; with no plan whatsoever<p>To an extent I agree with you here. It was a mess of anger and resentment, not a convert military operation. But there were also pipebombs, and the current theory is that they were going to be used to distract Capitol police. People arrived with plastic zip ties to be used as hand cuffs. It doesn&#x27;t require the whole mob to be organized, it just needs a small group within that mob. Just because the plan was not successful does not mean there was no plan.')
