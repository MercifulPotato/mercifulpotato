Item(by='marcinjachymiak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611270380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864357, text='&quot;It is completely unambiguously obvious to me that&quot; the author is an intellectually lazy rube who recycles tired old arguments. Anyone who talks about &quot;China-based&quot; miners hasn&#x27;t done their research on the <i>actual</i> hashrate distribution today. That&#x27;s a talking point from like 2015.<p>What the author misses, and what many on HN miss, is that technical expertise does not translate into financial&#x2F;economic expertise. You may grok Bitcoin on the CS level and still totally misunderstand the economics.')
