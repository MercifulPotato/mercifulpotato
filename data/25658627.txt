That&#x27;s a serious question. Emacs, VS Code, and quite a few of the other popular editors are open source. You can download them and use them. I have both Emacs and VS Code on my machine, and I use both of them, but for different purposes.<p>Now, if you wanted to talk about a war between open source and traditional closed-up-tight, walled-garden commercial software, I could get on board. It&#x27;s really hard for me to understand your framing when you have freely available products that are not in any way exclusive.<p>On your other point, if I were to speculate, I&#x27;d say VS Code&#x27;s main advantage is that it doesn&#x27;t have a 1970&#x27;s graphical interface. Port GNU Emacs to Monaco, give it some good default settings, and see what happens to adoption.')
