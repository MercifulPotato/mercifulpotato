Item(by='RC_ITR', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608138266, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438736, text='&gt;Much of the land in the United States that is currently occupied in grazing cattle was formerly inhabited by vast herds of American bison, an animal so genetically similar to domestic cattle that they can actually interbreed, yet the methane emissions from the bison didn&#x27;t bring on a global climate crisis. Why not?<p>Bro, I&#x27;m answering your question as to why cows cause a global warming crisis and bison did not.<p>You&#x27;re intentionally being obtuse on that point though, right?  Like yeah, cows may be just like bison in a very very narrow frame of reference, but bison did not get their food trucked to them &amp; they did not cut down trees to graze (both of which are things cows require now).<p>That&#x27;s why.  Period.<p>EDIT: If you want to narrow your frame of reference even further &amp; just talk about methane, then 1) It&#x27;s not the main culprit so I guess we agree there. But again, Global Warming is a cumulative thing, so they fact that they product that methane AND require carbon emissions to exist is pretty bad. 2) Yeah, it&#x27;s a crude estimate, that&#x27;s why I almost doubled it to give you the benefit of the doubt.')
