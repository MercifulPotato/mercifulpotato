Item(by='sorjuana', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611601301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903219, text='Here in Uruguay (South America) WhatsApp is the norm and you make all &quot;digital errands&quot; (even the grocery open markets and all kind of delivery services) with it. I have been annoying my friends and family for years to switch to Signal or even Telegram with little results and my obligation to remain fixed to it. Nevertheless, after this WhatsApp&#x2F;Facebook ultimatum I was astonished to watch dozens and dozens of contacts migrating, and I knew it was my moment to <i>delete</i> WhatsApp before they get sweetened by the delay of the deadline until May, so they begin to use the other tools, too (I don&#x27;t think the majority will delete WhatsApp, but it will be a great improvement if at least the personal conversations and contacts remain <i>out</i> of their claws). I really didn&#x27;t expected to witness such exodus: people seem to be hypnotized by social media and Pavlov&#x27;s bell -the dog is not to blame-, but maybe we could think that, although it takes a lot of time to appear, a critic mass is all that we need for a change. Businesses and government should be aware of that and don&#x27;t take us for granted.')
