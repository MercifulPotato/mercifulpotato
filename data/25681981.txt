We still need batteries (of all kinds) to power the future as energy needs and mobility increases.<p>There are still major issues with hydrogen containment since it can leak out of just about everything (being the smallest atomic structure) and also many hydrogen systems are used as fuel-cells to produce electricity rather than combustion for physical force. In that case, a Tesla vehicle powered by hydrogen would just have a fuel-cell energy store but still retain the same electric drivetrain.')
