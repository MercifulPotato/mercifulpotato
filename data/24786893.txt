Instantly. Faster than the speed of light. Nothing travelled from here to there. No particle, no photon, nothing. How does over there &quot;know&quot; that I did something over here?<p>Sure feels kind of spooky.<p><i>To me it would be more straightforward to say the concrete state of the particle is simply unknown until it is observed.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just unknown. It&#x27;s undecided. It <i>has no concrete state</i>. It&#x27;s not that it IS a one or a zero and you just don&#x27;t know it. It&#x27;s not yet been decided whether it&#x27;s a one or a zero, but as soon as the decision is made for one of the entangled particles, the decision is also made for the other one, a light year away. Instantly. Spooky.')
