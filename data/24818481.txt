I used to be a DBA for 5 years. I’m thinking now that the role of Data Engineer is the combining of what were three roles at my first job: Data warehouse engineer, DBA, and software engineer: it’s really the best of many worlds. I really enjoy it. I get to write the Python I’m good at (was never really good at general software engineering and feature development), gate keep a bit to keep my DBA chops up (SQL code quality, query tuning, access control etc but without all the need to be intimately well versed in any particular database), and spend my time creating new ETL processes and maintaining various EDW’s and data lakes.<p>It’s my favorite role I’ve had to date and I’m really happy in it.')
