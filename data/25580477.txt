What it does provide though, is a safety net to make sure you&#x27;ll have food on the table but no more.<p>Suddenly if you&#x27;re hating your job, it&#x27;s not that scary to tell your boss that their abuse is over. You can have some time to re-train, and be whatever you really wanted to be.<p>There&#x27;s also loads of activities that aren&#x27;t counted as work that would suddenly become very developed such as volunteering.<p>Yes, some people might suddenly realise that if they live on the cheap they might play video games all day, but I don&#x27;t think it will be most people.<p>It also depends how it&#x27;s rolled-out, if its start at 50 EUR a month, then increases each year for the next 15 years, the economy will have the time to adapt, the citizens will have the time to adapt etc.<p>It also present an interesting effect.
