You <i>can</i> light a small puddle of diesel using a match[0], since wood burns at well over 400F, you just need the patience for the match to slowly heat up the diesel to it’s flash point. Given that Kerosene has an equal or lower flash point, it should work too.<p>The issue of course is ambient temp. Heating up a small puddle of Kerosene from 70F to 100F using a small match might be doable, but getting it up to 100F from -20F might not be. Never mind how much faster everything cools down when it’s that cold outside and blowing.<p>0 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7soVqyGq4i4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7soVqyGq4i4</a>')
