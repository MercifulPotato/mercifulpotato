But if they are really avoiding taxes why not simply... charge them for that? Hint: They can&#x27;t because all the taxation schemes used by these companies are legal. EU bureaucrats could simply write a tax code that makes them illegal but they won&#x27;t!<p>All the whining also distracts peoples from asking themselves why European policies failed to grow a healthy growing tech ecosystem like in the US.')
