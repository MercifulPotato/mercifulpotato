Nobody has been able to rigorously define &quot;AI&quot; yet, so there&#x27;s no way of saying whether it&#x27;s possible with a Turing machine architecture. The human brain, at least, doesn&#x27;t seem that similar to a Turing architecture. Neurons don&#x27;t carry out anything like discrete operations.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible to run AGI on a Turing machine, maybe it&#x27;s not, but there are more options than simply &quot;possible with a Turing machine&quot; or &quot;completely impossible&quot;.')
