It is on fact much closer to an Optional than to a 0 pointer.<p>First of all, in SQL NULL is entirely your choice - no column is forced to accept NULL values.<p>Secondly, most SQL functions treat NULL just like mapping over an optional - a &lt; b works just like a.map(|a| {b.map(|b| {a &lt; b})}).<p>The only exception are aggregation functions, that also do the more sa e thing in my opinion, at least for most use cases - AVERAGE() over (a, NULL, b) is a+b&#x2F;2.')
