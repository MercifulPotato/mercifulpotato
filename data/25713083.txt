And that governments would be able to do so, with most cheering them on?<p>Is that a conspiracy?  If I had said that to you last year, you would have called me mad.<p>Contrast that, with what would happen if you tried to prevent just one individual coming near you, even if they had provably caused you harm.  You would need to go to court, prove your case, get a restraining order, etc.  And you would never be able to exclude them from work, enforce a passport, mandate good citizen score for loans and travel!!  Apparently none of the legal stuff is applicable if the whole world is being locked down.  No one needs to go on the record to state why all this is required.<p>This is where we are at!  Do you really want to trust CNN?  lol')
