They use a magnesium alloy chassis that feels like flimsy plastic. They are light, but they feel like a something that&#x27;s going to imminently break compared to Apple&#x27;s aluminum unibody.<p>In my view, the Gram trades off too much stiffness and chassis robustness for weight to be palatable to a non-niche audience.<p>I thought I was in the niche of users that prized weight over all else but I had concerns that a light on-the-go laptop that was so flimsy would last. I returned my Gram due to the fact that I just couldn&#x27;t get used to Windows (after using Linux and Mac for &gt;10 years) so the build robustness and weight ended up being a moot point')
