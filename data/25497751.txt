One never knows when I might need one, right?<p>One day I went to BBnB looking for something specific, but didn&#x27;t find it. As I was roaming the store, I came across a dear friend of mine, who was headed to the Wedding Registry department. She was getting married soon, and wanted to buy some high-end china (dinner place settings, I guess; I&#x27;m not into that, so pardon the lack of vocabulary). I went along with her, chatting, catching up.<p>The settings she selected were $120 each. 8 sets: $960 total.<p>Then I realized that the lump in my back pocket was a thick wad of BBnB coupons. I whipped them out, and we were able to knock $24*8 + some more off the total price. The best part is, these coupons stack. I think I had a 20% off entire purchase in there too. She saved a ton of money that day (well, she spent a lot too).')
