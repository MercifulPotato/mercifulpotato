Historically the USD has been worth more than CAD, except for two times in 1974 and 2007.<p>It gets worse because Canadians that come down for &quot;just a few years&quot; probably end up staying longer since the original logic that drew us down in the first place is likely still valid. Throw on top the overhead and friction of uprooting your settled life (friends and maybe kids) and then it becomes even tougher to go back.<p>Next thing you know, you&#x27;re applying for a greencard and the rest is history.')
