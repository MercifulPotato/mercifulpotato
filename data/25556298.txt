His presentation on DNA computing in general (linked at bottom) goes into some depth there.<p>What caught my eye is that a common apple has a DNA size roughly as large and complex as the human genome itself, with a disclaimer that the DNA size doesn&#x27;t translate to complexity.  But meanwhile, we don&#x27;t even know how many genes a human being has (estimate changed in 20 years from 100k down to ~20k), but a level beneath that complexity we don&#x27;t even know &quot;how our own cells know where a gene begins&quot; (quoted from his presentation).')
