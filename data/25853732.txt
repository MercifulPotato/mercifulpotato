There are all kinds of cities and viable jobs all over the country. People don&#x27;t HAVE to live and work in the most desirable places on the planet, and they don&#x27;t have any right to expect that. And yet, they repeatedly complain about SF, Seattle, or whatever not accommodating them the way they want. Guess what - you&#x27;re not owed anything.<p>People have the freedom to move to a smaller city or a &quot;second tier&quot; city. They have opportunity to thrive in those locations as well, and can help turn those cities into equally desirable places. Likewise, people don&#x27;t have to live and work in the same neighborhood. They can commute, or they can decide the commute is not worth it, and get a different job elsewhere. People also don&#x27;t have a right to attend whichever school they want. If they can&#x27;t make it work, there are other options in life.<p>Sure people may not have the exact job they want, or environment they want, or lifestyle they want, or whatever. But life is not perfect and you don&#x27;t get to have everything you want. You have to trade off between these different things.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s selfish as fuck and worthy of scorn.<p>Everyone is selfish. You&#x27;re just arbitrary placing one person&#x27;s desires above others. People living in a city owe nothing to newcomers who want to come there and change they very things that made the location desirable in the first place.')
