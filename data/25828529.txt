Many (but by no means all) of the participants were clowns.<p>However, it was <i>absolutely</i> an attempt. People died in an attempt to storm a seat of government and install a different regime. People were chanting &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot;, constructed an actual gallows, and then went looking for him. And they did this, let&#x27;s reiterate, <i>in an attempt to overturn the election</i>. The people trying to track him down had specific objectives in mind (however realistic or otherwise they may have been) and they weren&#x27;t &quot;giving him a bouquet of flowers and a hearty thank you for performing his entirely ceremonial role in the election process&quot;.<p>We can argue about how incompetent the insurrection was (clearly, very), and how close it came to achieving any of its objectives (still quite unclear). And we can certainly argue about whether a single failed insurrection attempt justifies the response; I think a very valid case can be made for the &quot;no&quot; argument. But words have meaning, and the word &quot;insurrection&quot; means <i>precisely this</i>.')
