And all the places I lived in SV so far have had A&#x2F;C so that hasn&#x27;t been an issue. But what&#x27;s great about being near the bay is that at night, most summer nights, it still cools down way below 20C so it&#x27;s easy to simply keep doors&#x2F;windows open after sunset and close them in the morning to have cool air inside the house, without an A&#x2F;C, almost every day. There are exceptions of course like we had this summer where there were 2-3 days long heatwaves with no drop below 25C at night, A&#x2F;C helped with that.')
