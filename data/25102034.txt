This has nothing to do with COVID-19, and COVID-19 virus or vaccines are not mentioned at all (AT ALL) ... and yet you&#x27;re arguing some hypothetical.<p>&gt;Well, let&#x27;s add some actual context that the article lacks.<p>Why does it need more context? Or rather, why does it need the specific context that you&#x27;re arguing for?<p>The fact that one cannot even put together a factual article about something that really happened, without getting criticism that some larger narrative isn&#x27;t constructed (either that vaccines are good, or that COVID-19 vaccines will be safe - unless administrated by the Trump administration) should provide  a clue why news outlets are so distrusted by the large swaths of the public.<p>To make it more personal: I don&#x27;t need help to make up my own mind what this polio outbreak in Sudan means for my life, my choices, and my politics. Tell me what happened, give me good-faith context to understand the background of the events, and let me do the rest. If you don&#x27;t, I just won&#x27;t believe you because now you&#x27;re not a journalist but an actor pushing politics or ideology that I may not agree with.')
