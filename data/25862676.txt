In all the states that I&#x27;m aware of, the enforcement was non-existent for individuals. For example,  you could drive to a state park 50 miles away from home that you were supposed to stay-at, that was officially completely closed, and there&#x27;d be 100 cars parked along the road next to a closed trailhead.<p>I was assuming the enforcement&#x2F;lockdowns are like that because they wouldn&#x27;t stand in court, but then did a little bit of research and found out general-purpose freedom of movement in public spaces does not actually appear to be a well-codified (or often argued in court?) right in the USA, so I guess it&#x27;s just the culture of liberty, and the politicians being afraid of the reaction if there was enforcement. It made me very proud and happy to be an American by choice ;)')
