If there&#x27;s any downside (I honestly don&#x27;t know, maybe there is?), those people should be given the choice to determine their course of action for themselves.<p>But I agree completely, having people who pay taxes and can&#x27;t access all the machinery of government they fund is criminal. (This also includes disenfranchised felons, but especially disenfranchised ex-felons.)')
