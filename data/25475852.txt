Just because the biggest financier is Saudi owned doesn&#x27;t mean Sand Hill road is going down. But in a way, the biggest SV VCs such as Sequoia, Accel, a16z, have all begun focusing outside of SV and looking at more regional companies - and a number of former classmates who are partners at these firms tell me that&#x27;s not going to change any time soon.<p>Tbh, I feel remote work and big corporations moving out will further accelerate the decline. It&#x27;s far easier for a tech firm to be a regional monopoly, than to come to SV and fight it out with an SV tech firm, eg: Lyft vs Ola or Didi or Grab.<p>The biggest appeal of SV is the startup environment, which admittedly does feel a bit suffocating at times.')
