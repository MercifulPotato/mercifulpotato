Blue tribe clicks the article and laughs at Red Tribe for being so stupid. Red tribe clicks the article and decides &quot;Blue tribe is laughing, at us!&quot;. Red tribe grifter starts accepting donations to buy Starbucks cups and throw them into a paper shredder. Blue tribe starts a Foundation for Freedom from Religious Latte Art demanding depictions of Satan in their lattes. Suddenly everyone has extremely strong feelings about something as absurd as whether or not there should be a Madonna depicted in their latte.<p>In many cases, it seems the original nut turns out to be someone who spent most of their life at reality TV auditions.')
