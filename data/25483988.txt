I tried a huge number of window managers, DEs, all sorts of arrangements. IceWM stuck around on my computer for a bit but since I was a teenager it just didn’t look hackery enough. I wanted something more so I ended up with openbox, so minimalistic it’s all in lower case. I think it’s fun to experiment with how your environment works but eventually you need to get actual work done and the fun of setting up different environment fades a bit. Still, I am grateful to all those projects for getting me to mess around with my computer in yet another way.')
