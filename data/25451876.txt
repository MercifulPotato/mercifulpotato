When you only have 20ish minutes to pack as many gags as you can, and the narrative setup is fundamentally immovable (i.e. episodes are entirely self-contained, there is little or no substantial continuity), subtlety will soon go out the window, and characters will become stereotypes who exist to trigger jokes.<p>Also, that sort of narrative setup tends to accrete over the years: if you’ve seen Barney being the idiot drunk for 5 years, that’s where your mind will go as soon as he’s in the picture, even if he’s had the occasional redemption story (he’s a poet, moviemaker, etc).')
