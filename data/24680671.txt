The big question is how these building blocks organized themselves into the complex structure of even the most primitive microbes.<p>Every new form of life tends to fill successively smaller niches. There are more prokaryotes than eucaryotes, more singe celled than multi celled etc. but there is nothing in between the primordial chemical soup and the simplest life forms. I would expect a huge mass of simple RNA based life forms simpler than prokaryotes.')
