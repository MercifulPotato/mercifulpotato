I&#x27;ve been clicking outside of the pop-up to close and never thought of using the back button. And yes, the scrollbar is currently included on the click-to-close function (again, I&#x27;ve been scrolling with my mouse and didn&#x27;t notice).<p>I&#x27;ll look into fixing both.<p>Also, working on a filter for part-time&#x2F;contract and remote (you can currently search for remote&#x2F;anywhere) for the next update.<p>Thanks again! I appreciate you!')
