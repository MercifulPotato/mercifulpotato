This is all well and good, generally, but I have no formal education background in CS&#x2F;SWE, which I imagine would immediately disqualify me from any workplace that filters applications in an automated way. If anything, I’d imagine that trying to have the same micro-optimized resume that follows basic online advice may actually be detrimental here.<p>It’s tough as looking for a job is not super fun, so it’s tempting to try and find some magic bullet solution. I came to the conclusion that I’d rather try and present myself as honestly and effectively as I can and not take 99% of what I see regarding resumes to heart, and try and direct any interested people to my portfolio&#x2F;work as soon as I can.')
