I don&#x27;t think that having a box of votes disappear into a, from our perspective, somewhat mysteries process filled with rooms full of volunteers counting things in relative secrecy, could provide as much confidence in the process. I&#x27;m not sure how that could be achieved without some digital system. Maybe a required mix of physical and digital systems?<p>For any system, I think some form of adversarial counting is required to know that someone &quot;on your side&quot; had a chance to count your vote. This could be implemented by having each party of interest select the counters, along with an &quot;unbiased&quot; automated system&#x2F;digital results. The votes could be randomized between them. Some portion is then feed back through to help catch if any of the intentionally biased counters tried to tilt the system, to keep everyone honest. Regardless of the system, I think the minimum requirements for the counting process should be enough to obtain some level of trust, and be at a federal level, since we all have to live with the results.')
