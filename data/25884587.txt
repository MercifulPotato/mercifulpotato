It&#x27;s a collection of millions of communities, and even then just one medium for them, which all have different norms, standards, goals, beliefs, and types of people.<p>Facebook&#x27;s position is inherently unwinnable because they will be hated regardless of how they attempt to moderate their platform. It is all too easy for us to say &#x27;just do better moderation&#x27; without realizing how intractable that problem is, due to 1) differing communities&#x2F;people, and 2) scales in the <i>billions</i> of users (for example, imagine one employee is tasked with monitoring content from 10,000 people. If you needed to moderate 2 billion people, you would need 2B&#x2F;10K = 200,000 full-time employees just for moderation. Hiring enough employees is also not enough, as they need to be consistent with each other as well).<p>This isn&#x27;t intended to be a defense of Facebook, but rather just another point demonstrating that centralized platforms for all of humanity are not the right solution for how we should communicate.')
