I didn&#x27;t suggest becoming the cheap option I suggested re-evaluating its premium pricing strategy in the short-term to reflect current and future customer value. Margin stickiness seems to be a built-in bias similar to the sunk-costs fallacy.<p>Server-side Neoverse is a threat but a slow-moving one. I&#x27;m assuming that &quot;Breakup&quot; (going fabless) will not show benefits for many months if not years. Price seems like an obvious lever; perhaps I&#x27;m being naive about pricing but it&#x27;s not obvious to me why.')
