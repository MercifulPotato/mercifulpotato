US citizen produce an average of 16 ton per year.\nSo you can solve global warming by just 160$ per year per head, it&#x27;s really not a big deal.<p>For me this 10$ per CO2 ton is extremely misleading. It maybe correct for now, but as soon as more people try to offset their CO2, the price will skyrock, because there isn&#x27;t many 10$ per ton opportunity for CO2 offsetting.')
