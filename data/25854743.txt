The fact remains people <i>can and do</i> trust produce; the extant food systems we have are working.  The extant systems, regulations and all, provide the reliable, safe and cheap supply of food our civilization requires, and it do so pretty damn well.<p>As for waste, do you really think some shipping containers in the parking lot will provide an elastic supply?  Even if you can install more containers on short notice, it would still take weeks at least for those units to start producing.  The extant systems can and do respond to changes in demand in days, not weeks.  If these were relied on for anything but luxury produce, you&#x27;d often have too much or too little.  To provide a buffer, you have to start storing the produce, which negates the ultra-fresh appeal.')
