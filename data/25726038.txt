Taking away people&#x27;s ability to organize on mainstream platforms didn&#x27;t stop the HK protestors from organizing against the CCP. The lack of online platforms didn&#x27;t stop the Color Revolutions in Eastern Europe. Even the Arab Spring, while often attributed to Twitter, happened in the face of mass censorship and Internet shutdowns.<p>IMHO the decisions to de-platform these groups will do nothing to put a dent in their political ideology, and will only serve to throw gasoline on the fire at a contentious period where many millions of people feel like they don&#x27;t have a voice. And it&#x27;s likely that peaceful discourse and political thought will be wiped out as collateral damage as a result of the decisions these companies are making.')
