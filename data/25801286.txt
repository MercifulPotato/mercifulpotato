I think its more popular than you think.<p>I agree that modern java has lots of modern tools to write reasonable code - like closures and functional primitives. But its very normal amongst java programmers to never use that stuff.<p>I worked as a professional interviewer for a year or so recently and interviewed 400+ programming candidates. One of the tasks was a 30 minute coding challenge - using the candidate&#x27;s own computer and preferred language. A huge percentage of the java programmers, even under explicit time pressure, wasted time adding needless junk (like getters and setters or extraneous, pointless classes) to their code. Out of maybe 50 java programmers I think I only saw 1 or 2 java candidates use any of java&#x27;s functional programming primitives (like map) to keep their code terse and clean. Most typed everything manually, and didn&#x27;t know or didn&#x27;t use their IDE&#x27;s codegen features.<p>Is that the fault of java, the language? I don&#x27;t know. As I said in another comment I think the problem is cultural. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with java-the-language. But a large part of java-the-community seems blissfully content with mediocrity. I took java off my resume years ago because I don&#x27;t want that kind of coworker.<p>&gt; How do you write code, are you copying something by typing?<p>In the languages I use, copy+paste is never needed. Thats what the compiler is for, and things like rust&#x27;s derive(Eq) macros.<p>&gt; Iâ€™m sorry to assume it, but I think you only know about java development from third-hand infos and it has nothing to do with reality.<p>Nope.
