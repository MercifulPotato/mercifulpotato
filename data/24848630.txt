That doesn’t mean we aren’t pretty good at doing the right thing and rationality (like EMH) is a good, if imperfect tool to analyze behavior.<p>The granularity of the &quot;correctness&quot; is the major difference here and you&#x27;re asking the author to be ok with an extremely rough success criteria when they are proposing a mathematically perfect success criteria.<p>So, define how you would quantify &quot;pretty good&quot; in comparison with &quot;mathematically optimal&quot; and you might get what is in effect an infinite delta.<p>&gt;but a basic model of rationality would say that humans can “perfectly” solve it.<p>&quot;basic model of rationality&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense. Rationalism has not been shown to provide a pathway to a general epistemology.<p>Fundamentally the author is making a really good case for the idea that oblique or poorly specified&#x2F;constructed goal and measurement criteria (eg. EMH) should not be assumed as a competent goal vectoring mechanism for society.')
