I would say engineering&#x2F;STEM schools are openly designed to get students good jobs. But good engineering schools don not have &quot;bird courses&quot;, the number of mandatory classes to electives is really high.<p>If you are at a school where students are doing the behavior you say, perhaps you are at the wrong institution or degree program.
