If that&#x27;s a &quot;relatively recent&quot; invention, what about computers?<p>0 comes up if you&#x27;re doing any arithmetic at all. It&#x27;s a natural and useful concept for almost anything. As long as you always can take something aways where there is something, you&#x27;ll need 0. It wouldn&#x27;t be very useful to make something such as a non-empty list type, to then be able to take away all elements except the last one, which must remain.<p>In more mathematical terms, 0 is called a neutral element (relative to the addition operation), and almost anything you might want to do (for example subtraction) requires as a consequence a neutral element.')
