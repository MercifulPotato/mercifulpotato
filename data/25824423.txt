It does subscriptions (channel bookmarks, basically) without requiring a login, and that&#x27;s plenty good enough for me.<p>As far as a video sharing platform, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything with quite the flood of content, since YouTube is such a household name. I&#x27;m looking into running a PeerTube instance as an alternative to stuff I want to publish, so I&#x27;m not at risk of Google pulling my plug randomly, but I&#x27;m also not looking to make money with any of my videos. My limited personal utility will be easily met by a far inferior platform.')
