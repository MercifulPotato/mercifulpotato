That conversation took about two minutes and ended in a hard no.<p>Our registrar is MarkMonitor who specializes in large portfolios.<p>I’ve got a dedicated account rep. We know each other well. We talk often, not just domains but college sports, etc.<p>I need something I email my guy and it gets done.<p>Registering a .es domain requires a scan of my drivers license.
