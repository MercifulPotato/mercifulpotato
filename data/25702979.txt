Assigning a value to a variable cannot return an error.<p>So you get a fine SIGBUS to your application and it crashes. Just the other day I used imagemagick and it always crashed with a SIGBUS and just when I started googling the issue I remembered mmap, noticed that the partition ran out of space, freed up some more and the issue was gone.<p>So you might want to set up a handler for that signal, but now the control flow suddenly jumps to another function if an error occurs, and you have to somehow figure out where in your program the error occurred and then what? Then you remember that longjmp exists and you end up with a steaming pile of garbage code.<p>Only use mmap if you absolutely must. Don&#x27;t just &quot;mmap all teh files&quot; as it&#x27;s the new cool thing you learned about.')
