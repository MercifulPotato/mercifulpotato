In fact, it&#x27;s the #1 reason I don&#x27;t enjoy &quot;Ruby&quot; anymore.  Ruby as a language is great if you stick to a small subset of its capabilities (meaning, largely skip the metaprogramming, and definitely skip the make-a-dsl route).<p>Basic procedural Ruby, with some thoughtful functional style collection operations, is very elegant and fun to use (because you can get a job done in few lines of code which aren&#x27;t terribly hard to understand later).<p>But as soon as you start dipping into metaprogramming, you&#x27;ve lost your ability to see what&#x27;s happening.  You have to understand the system to... understand it.  Defining methods on the fly, calling methods via send() and a string&#x2F;symbol, and using method_missing as a dynamic dispatcher are some of the most abused and least easy to understand later without current documentation of their use in the system.<p>In general, there&#x27;s too much magic in a lot of the Ruby ecosystem, and some of us are really pushing back against that.')
