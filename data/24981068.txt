In a smaller Midwestern city I visited this summer, there is essentially unlimited land in all directions from the city center - it is just farm fields. Regardless, the new construction they build is still priced 50% more than the exact same homes would have cost just 8 years ago, or about triple what they would cost in late 90&#x27;s. You can verify this on sites like Zillow.<p>$8 &#x2F; hour was the &#x27;retail&#x27; wage back in the 90&#x27;s in this area, and now maybe it has gone up to $14. I would imagine the professional salary has gone up even less - it has certainly not tripled from 1998.<p>Housing has far surpassed the rate of wage increases even in areas where land is not constrained. It has far more to do with interest rates and the monthly payment.')
