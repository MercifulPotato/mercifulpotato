Just like you, I&#x27;m an advanced user, a software developer, and Mandrake was my first serious Linux.<p>For me though, software isn&#x27;t missing on Linux, it&#x27;s missing on Windows. I rarely need an office suite, and my needs are limited to simple Word&#x2F;Writer documents and even simpler Excel&#x2F;Calc spreadsheets, so even MS Office 97 or StarOffice 5 have all the needed features (minus support for XML file formats). The extent of image editing I do is limited to cropping, rotating and resizing images, so even GIMP is way overkill.<p>On the other hand, the software I do use and like is a pain on Windows. First it&#x27;s basic text manipulation tools. Things like grep and sed are missing on Windows, and I want to e.g. &quot;replace this line in all files in this folder&quot; far more often than I open an Excel file. I use SSH, which isn&#x27;t on Windows, and applications like putty are great but don&#x27;t provide anywhere near the seamless experience that Linux has with SSH. Then there&#x27;s the desktop environment itself - I use KDE Plasma 5 and find it amazing, having been a fan of KDE since 3.5. I like KDE Plasma overall much more than Windows Explorer, and then there are the individual power features, e.g. I have a button on the titlebar that toggles always-on-top for a window, and I exclude certain applications from appearing in the taskbar because they already have a systray icon.<p>I use Linux at work, and haven&#x27;t had to boot Win7 at home since Steam Proton. I&#x27;ve heard that Win10 makes some things better, like it has built-in SSH. But I haven&#x27;t tried Win10 myself, and at this point it&#x27;d take some Windows killer feature to make me switch.')
