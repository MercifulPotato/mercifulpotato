Do you have a lot of bank accounts&#x2F;credit cards so that logging into each bank site is a pain?<p>I tried to get into finance tracking along these lines (YNAB), and it was a lot of work. I don&#x27;t care where every penny goes because it became clear that most of my pennies go to the same place every month (housing, utilities, etc.). I just want to spend less money on the every day things I have control over.<p>I&#x27;m trying out a system for that specific purpose over at spendweek.com.
