Once people have a copy of the content in a format that&#x27;s going to be indefinitely forward-portable, they will never buy another copy again.<p>Not even for &quot;higher&quot; quality versions.  I have an AVI of my LotR movies ripped from DVDs from whenever people bought DVDs and ripped AVIs.  The quality is still very good, even played on a 4K TV.
