They let you purchase your apps for real, they&#x27;re not forcing anything, and then I think I should support their efforts.<p>Additionally their licensing is: buy a license, type in your code, your program works.  You can use your personal license on all your machines and they trust you.<p>Last they allow you to save your data to &quot;the cloud&quot;, but don&#x27;t force it.  And &quot;the cloud&quot; means you can conveniently store it on their server, or on your own or someone else&#x27;s webdav server.<p>More people should follow their good example.<p>(and remember, with trust, commerce is unlimited)')
