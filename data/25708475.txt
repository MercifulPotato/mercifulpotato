I don&#x27;t have an account because I didn&#x27;t want to find a burner phone.<p>One of the things I do is pay a lot of attention to the rhetoric of people on the US right... I&#x27;ve been trying to understand what all is being said and why, and my general understanding is that there are a lot of folks with legit grievances filtering them through highly, uh, metaphorical understandings of reality.<p>A lot of what I see in other media taken from Parler is out-and-out falsehoods about the world.  And I have seen quite a lot of content in the various right-wing FB groups I have been in... enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I have no gauge for what the discourse there looks like.<p>You&#x27;re correct that they aren&#x27;t directly &quot;planning political violence&quot;.<p>However, it is a system where there are unchallenged and wholly fictitious views of the world being spread as if they were the patent truth.  That&#x27;s legal, but it&#x27;s the epistemic equivalent of smoking meth and if I were a tech company interested in the continued function of the US I&#x27;d do everything in my power to stop that process.')
