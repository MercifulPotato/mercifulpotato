I cringed&#x2F;facepalmed all throughout it - he doesn&#x27;t do a single thing an actual sailor would do (at least in a timely manner). The only way this movie would be acceptable was if the character was actually teleported onto the boat in the beginning of the movie with no prior sailing experience. So much stupidity.<p>One of my &quot;favorite&quot; moments was when he tied the liferaft to the sinking boat and went to sleep <i>in the liferaft</i>. And there were similar facepalm moments from beginning to end. I was so disappointed to see him rescued at the end of the movie. Drowning would&#x27;ve been a fitting, well-deserved ending - he was trying so hard.')
