Item(by='nmlnn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604548950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995377, text='&gt; Bitcoin simply isnâ€™t that<p>Agree to disagree. I would say you&#x27;re the one twisting the definition of &quot;hard currency&quot; (Wikipedia is not the source of all truth).<p>&quot;Hard money&quot; originally reffered to gold. When paper currency took over the term &quot;hard currency&quot; was used to distinguish between good and bad paper currencies.<p>I maintain that the &quot;hard&quot; part (which derives from gold) refers to the inability to be inflated easily. But I&#x27;m happy to concede that Bitcoin is not a currency yet in most peoples&#x27; eyes. I&#x27;m happy to switch to calling it a hard money.')
