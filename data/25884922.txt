You call out any hypocrisy and the knee jerk response is “how could you even begin to think both sides are the same, that’s so idiotic” without really caring that pointing out hypocrisy is <i>not</i> saying everyone’s the same. Reaching the level of meme, you don’t even have to think about what you’re responding to! What’s sadly hilarious is that you see the same meme... on both sides.<p>There’s a ton I disagree with Greenwood about. But there’s also a lot I agree with. To dismiss him fully because of what I consider his bad ideas would be to also miss out on a lot of good insights.')
