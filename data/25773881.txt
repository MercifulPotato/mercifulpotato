Seeing it for the blessing that it is is actually quite nice.<p>&gt; <i>This can be nicely solved by decentralization. Have multiple different sources of power, let people live near those who they like and trade with others.</i><p>This doesn&#x27;t sound anything like reality to me. Mobility requires resources. Some people are born into resources, and others are not. Did you know that CEOs are taller than average? That within any particular ethnic and gender group, being taller means you&#x27;re likely to have more power and earn more money over your lifetime? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because of any central authority punishing short people.')
