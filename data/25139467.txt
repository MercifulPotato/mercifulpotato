Rationalism and empiricism in the historical sense are interesting philosophies, good to study.<p>The &quot;neo-rationalism&quot; that you tend to find online (especially in HN &amp; LW adjacent communities) falls much more into the criticisms you define, but I hardly really consider those communities actually &quot;rational&quot; at all.<p>Heuristics are important, but what I find management often does is <i>lie to themselves</i> about what is an intuitive heursitic, (perhaps justified by a story of how it worked in another company) and what is something that is generally justified by empirics. Sometimes you need to make ad-hoc, intuitive decisions due to resource constraints, but you should be <i>aware of when those times are</i> and shouldn&#x27;t act as if they are equivalent.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this happen in some companies and it is not pretty: when you don&#x27;t distinguish between the story and fact, then everyone just starts telling stories and it becomes very difficult to ascertain what is happening.')
