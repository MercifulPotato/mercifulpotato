He can still publish through the White House press. He can contact press, or communicate as American Presidents have always done. He is not being forcibly gagged as a whole. He has freedom to speak, just not where he pleases.<p>I feel like people are conflating &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; with the &quot;Freedom of Platform&quot;. This is an important difference. If I send a letter to Bloomberg or The New York Times, no one would find it surprising or wrong when they decided to not publish it (for ANY reason). If I violate their commenter section policies, they remove it and no one blinks. They decide what&#x27;s on their platform without answer.<p>I am not against the idea of governments guaranteeing certain freedoms and access to platforms, but they currently do not exist as far as I understand. Saying some right has been newly violated is somewhat silly, especially given that the subject in question is a member of a political party who has fought tooth-and-nail to preserve this exact right for businesses -- to arbitrarily chose who they do business with. That is what we&#x27;re contending with.<p>TL;DR: The discussion needs to be recentered.')
