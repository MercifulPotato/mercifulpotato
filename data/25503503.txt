If you had to wake up at 3am, you get an unspoken amount of time you can claim without official PTO, on top of not having to come in at 9am. So assuming you&#x27;re on call for one week, you should still only have worked 40 hours, but you can stack up that extra time to supplement a vacation or something.')
