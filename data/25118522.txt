Here are the questions that I have to start:<p>Does &#x27;there-is&#x27; evaluate to a boolean (is boolean a thing? is evaluation a thing?)<p>I was surprised that the axioms don&#x27;t use there-is but I sense I shouldn&#x27;t be?<p>what does &#x27;(when 0 (or 0 1))&#x27; mean, it&#x27;s described as &#x27;when 0, then there is either 0 or 1&#x27; but I&#x27;m not sure what that means? is &#x27;(when 0 0)&#x27; true and &#x27;(when 1 0)&#x27; false? Why not use &#x27;(when A B)&#x27; as equals?<p>Not a question but in the axioms I assume pairs should be pears and applies should be apples.<p>How goes &#x27;implies&#x27; get introduced by &#x27;(when (when q r) (when (or p q) (or p r))&#x27;? Also, this introduces a category in the example i.e. fruits but not sure how that happened.<p>Why do we need to have second &#x27;(not (factor? x 3^22 ...))&#x27;, isn&#x27;t it sufficient to say that (factor? x 3^21 ...) to establish that the 2nd term is &#x27;there-is&#x27;?')
