You can set a small cache TTL (like 30 seconds) so it only let’s one request through per TTL (30 seconds). And with varnish even if you get 10k hits right when the cache is stale, it can be configured to only process the first request and serve the stale cache to the rest.<p>Using a TTL isn’t great if you have a long tail of content, but pretty awesome if it’s a limited surface area that’s taking the load even if your dynamic backend is something heavy like Wordpress.')
