Is this situation the <i>actual</i> &quot;will of the people&quot;, as we are endlessly told is what Democracy (and nothing else) delivers?  I believe there is a fairly substantial amount of evidence that it is not what people want, although that sort of topic seems a bit socially taboo, so all one can do is speculate.')
