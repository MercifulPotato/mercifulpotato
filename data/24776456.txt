Ouch.  She watched more TV, and via Zoom got to see what everybody else&#x27;s living rooms looked like, but in the U.S. most professional class kids don&#x27;t get a lot of free-roaming time anyway, so the only difference is you&#x27;re trading school time (never their favorite part) for house time.  So I&#x27;m not sure this means quarantine isn&#x27;t so bad, more like we have kids in quarantine all the time nowadays compared to a generation ago so it wasn&#x27;t much of a change.')
