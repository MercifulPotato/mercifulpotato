Major resolvers do not support it since it directly conflicts with with their data collection business.</i><p>Except those users using Firefox or Chrome, which come with DNS over HTTPS (DoH) preconfigured. Or those who&#x27;ve been running DoT on their home networks, which I setup quite a while ago now.<p>From the Wikipedia article on DoH, emphasis mine:\n&quot;A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks[1] by using the HTTPS protocol to <i>encrypt the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based DNS resolver</i>.<p>DNS over TLS (DoT) RFC:\n&quot;This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide privacy for DNS.  <i>Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network</i>, such as discussed in RFC 7626.&quot;<p>The lack of DNS encryption isn&#x27;t what Apple and Cloudflare are addressing; it&#x27;s that whoever runs the DNS resolver can still see the websites you&#x27;re visiting and ODoH fixes that.')
