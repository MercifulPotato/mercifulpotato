Item(by='bocklund', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609959175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659921, text='The first paragraph in the &quot;Isolation of single emitters in silicon&quot; section of the scientific paper[1] says that they &quot;implanted&quot; carbon ions into silicon. The rest of the paper discusses how they were able to detect these point defects (carbon atoms).<p>The outlook, as other commenters mentioned, is that this means we could theoretically detect other single atom point defects in silicon, such as impurities or quantum dots.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;s41928-020-00499-0" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;s41928-020-00499-0</a>')
