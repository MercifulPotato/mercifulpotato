I would love to hear about a _single_ R1 university that is hiring based on identity criteria, where the majority of the staff are &quot;career bureaucrats who contribute nothing to research&quot;. The way you get grant money is by doing research that gets published at top-tier conferences, and at least in CS it is pretty hard to bullshit your way into those. Try not to make authoritative sounding posts like this without any knowledge of what you are talking about.')
