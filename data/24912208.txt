A mouse that can still find its way around a maze that it learned is hard to compare to a person that can still find their way to their office but can&#x27;t remember colleagues&#x27; names or whether they are married.  Apes wouldn&#x27;t help with the problem that AD symptoms are tied up with relationships and experiences unique to the only species that has language.  (Side note: as someone approaching retirement from a family with a strong history of AD, I&#x27;m not entirely sure that the unique faculty of language is worth its associated cost: that we&#x27;re the only species whose members know they will senesce and die,)  Edit: shit, that&#x27;s maudlin.  Need a drink. Ignore me.')
