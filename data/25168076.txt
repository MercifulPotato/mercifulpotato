Item(by='Schnitz', descendants=None, kids=[25168284], score=None, time=1605937890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25167137, text='I’ve used Android 2010 to 2012, iOS 2012-2014 with iTunes Match, Android 2014 to 2020 with Google Music and just switched back to iOS with an iPhone 12 mini and Apple Music. I’m on Fi since 2015. After reading your message I realized how I probably should have used Android during the last year. To be honest, none of this was clear to me. I rooted for Android all the way, but at some point I started to migrate off the Google product and into an alternative when I got pushed from one service to the other for no benefits to me. On top of that, Android became more closed, with less and less apps being open source and replaced by proprietary Google apps. Now that I’m back to iOS I’m really amazed how the good parts just haven’t changed. Apple supports bringing my library just as well as iTunes Match did, for example. Also getting voice and sms on my laptop works out of the box, whereas a Fi on Android customer it sometimes worked better than other times for example I have no idea what I would use on a computer now that hangouts will be gone?')
