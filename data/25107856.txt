I also didn&#x27;t do a good job restricting computation, selecting time complexity as a metric instead of <i>literally</i> anything else - there are far better ways of doing that.<p>There&#x27;s more to properties than just syntax-sugar as I initially said (such as being a single unit), and I think I&#x27;ve built more of a case for why using property-based getters&#x2F;setters over fields are better that working with fields directly. If the syntax sugar isn&#x27;t your cup of tea but you agree with using methods over fields, I think that&#x27;s the limit of my argument here.')
