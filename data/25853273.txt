Totally right about the time zone benefits (although some of our talent is willing to adjust to US time zones, the employers rarely seem to believe it).<p>Also true about the fact that this sort of thing has sprouted in other regions, including South&#x2F;Latin America. We&#x27;ve been trying to connect with them &amp; share lessons learned because we think there&#x27;s a big need in this space &amp; we should all help each other succeed. I&#x27;m not sure I understand how Globant is similar to us though, is it an agency?<p>The ones we&#x27;ve spoken to so far that are pretty similar to ours (last-mile prep for job placement) include: PestoTech (engineers in India), PAZ.AI (refugees in Europe), Shift.org (veterans in USA), Insight Fellows (data science in USA), Talently.Tech (devs in LatAm), Laboratoria (women in LatAm), Outtalent (devs in Eastern Europe).<p>So far it seems to me that they&#x27;re not far ahead of us, but nevertheless they&#x27;ve made enough progress to share some important lessons. First, it&#x27;s important to start with and maintain quality. Quality for candidates means getting a job that&#x27;s much better than what they would&#x27;ve gotten on their own, within 2-6 months of meeting our requirements. On the demand side, quality means that candidates meet or exceed the expectations of their standard talent selection process and performance post hire. Second, it&#x27;s important to take a talent-first approach because that&#x27;s what attracts the top talent. This includes being careful not to charge the talent an unreasonable rate. Employers may not all pay for the talent at the beginning when we&#x27;re establishing our reputation, but ultimately that&#x27;s where the main financial opportunity is - and charging a subscription fee ensures long-term mutually beneficial relationships.<p>Of course there&#x27;s also the outsourcing agency&#x2F;staff augmentation model that has existed for decades in Eastern Europe and South Asia... Andela is a more recent&#x2F;visible example in Africa. Those are more easily profitable, but we&#x27;ve avoided that approach for now because we see that the top engineers prefer to work directly for great companies (whether remotely or on-site) and it is more beneficial for their career growth to do so.')
