He helped push the Mac further during his tenure at Apple, and his work at BeOS also pushed the state of the art of personal computing.  There are two major standouts in his career that I greatly appreciate:<p>1.  His transformation of the Mac from the non-expandable appliance it was in the original 1984 Macintosh to Macs that supported expansion slots, such as the Macintosh II and the Macintosh SE.  The Macintosh II series led to other expandable Macs such as the Quadra, the Power Macintosh, and the Mac Pro.  While the Mac Pro would lose its expansion slots when the 2013 Mac Pro was released, the latest Mac Pro has expansion slots again, and I hope Apple keeps them if it releases an ARM version of the Mac Pro.<p>2.  His work at Be, Inc. after his departure from Apple.  I never had the chance to use BeOS (I was in elementary school during the heyday of BeOS), but I&#x27;ve read a lot about it.  In my opinion, one of BeOS&#x27;s most interesting features is its searchable file system.  Indeed, the creator of BeOS&#x27;s file system, Dominic Giampaolo (who wrote a well-written, accessible introductory textbook on file system design), moved to Apple after Be&#x27;s demise and worked on Spotlight, which is macOS&#x27;s search tool.')
