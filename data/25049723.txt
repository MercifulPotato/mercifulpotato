He appears to be serving his third sentence. I went looking for more of his writing and found this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publicpolicerecord.com&#x2F;florida&#x2F;doc-prisoner&#x2F;MOSER_RYAN&#x2F;D84878" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publicpolicerecord.com&#x2F;florida&#x2F;doc-prisoner&#x2F;MOSE...</a><p>It looks like he&#x27;s on his third go-around, and was probably jailed immediately on a parole or probation violation on his third offense (which explains how he&#x27;s been away for 6 years despite his current sentence being 5 years). I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s also going to have to serve more time due to probably having violated his parole for earlier offences.<p>I hope he gets his life together, for his sake and the sake of his family. It&#x27;s a shame that he couldn&#x27;t have been diverted into a first-offender program and rehab many years ago back at his first offense, rather than doing what looks like a &#x27;revolving door&#x27; run through prisons.')
