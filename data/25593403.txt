E.g. tax code, employment laws, separating health care from employment, etc. I&#x27;m no expert and I don&#x27;t know what the &#x27;right&#x27; answer is but I imagine it&#x27;s some combination of thought-out policy changes that, when combined, apply an economic force to pull the wealth gap closer over time.')
