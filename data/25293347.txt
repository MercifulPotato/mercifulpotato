You can give guests outside your organization access as well. Beyond passwords, you can also share company cards, credential files, and 2FA tokens.<p>In addition, 1Password does a great job of letting you know when you should rotate your passwords, when you&#x27;ve re-used passwords, and when any password you&#x27;ve used has been leaked (in conjunction with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haveibeenpwned.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haveibeenpwned.com</a>). This helps ensure better security practices across the team.<p>Only downsides I&#x27;ve come across:\n- Granular permissions are really hard. For example, at my last job, we had vaults per client we worked with. However, not everyone that works on that client needs access to all of those passwords. The only way around this was to make&#x2F;manage hundreds of vaults for Client+Function variants.\n- There&#x27;s no way to guarantee security of passwords stored in someone&#x27;s personal vault.\n- Users can create a vault and remove owners&#x2F;admins from it (unless this has changed).')
