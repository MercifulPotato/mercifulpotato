Which is actually rather surprising; it&#x27;s a reasonable hypothesis that lots of kids would get infected and then pass it to vulnerable family members. But the results from schools around the world show that that&#x27;s not happening to any significant degree.<p><i>It is far better to be overly cautious than not cautious enough in such a case, even if it comes at the expense of inconvenience.</i><p>You can&#x27;t make that general statement without quantifying the harms on both sides. Denying education and socialization to children, throwing millions of people out of work, and telling people they can&#x27;t visit family or friends for an indefinite duration goes well beyond &quot;inconvenience&quot;.')
