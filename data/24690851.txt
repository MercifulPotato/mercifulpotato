Definitely a problem that&#x27;s above my pay grade.<p><i>&quot;The algorithm for diagnosing and treating CPP (Algorithm 1) has been developed to guide a physician through\nthe process from diagnosis to management. A physician should follow the lines by answering the appropriate\nquestions with yes or no. By doing this the clinician will end up at a box that refers to the chapter in this\nguideline that contains all the information needed.<p>Because CPP is pain perceived in structures related to the pelvis, it is necessary to approach a\npatient diagnosed with CPP as a chronic pain patient. Confining the diagnosis to a specific organ may overlook\nmultisystem functional abnormalities requiring individual treatment and general aspects of pain in planning\ninvestigation and treatment. This idea is easily recognised in the algorithm where the division in specific\ndisease associated pain is made on one hand and pelvic pain syndrome on the other.<p>The algorithm also illustrates that the authors advocate early involvement of a multidisciplinary pain\nteam. In practice, this should mean that well-known diseases, e.g. ‘true’ cystitis and endometriosis, will be\ndiagnosed and treated early. If treating such conditions does not reduce symptoms, or such well-defined\nconditions are not found, then further investigation may be necessary, depending on where the pain is\nlocalised.&quot;</i>')
