As in many other contexts, you cannot completely kill an idea, you cannot purge thoughts from people&#x27;s heads.<p>Keeping those ideas from hurting a society requires vigilance and effort, especially in history education and education of why reactionary ideas are morally and ethically reprehensible. Germany didn&#x27;t try to hide away what happened or cover it up. There has always been a focus on education and telling the story of what happened, with historical references.<p>What was&#x2F;is actually banned was the uncritical dissemination of reactionary and fascist symbols, ideas and beliefs. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not allowed to simply hang a swastika flag from your balcony, but you are very much allowed to hang it in a museum in a historical context that explains what it is, who used it and what it stood for.<p>That&#x27;s why id Software was not allowed to distribute Wolfenstein 3-D in Germany with the original textures, because it was entertainment and not in a factual historical context.<p>Besides, if the best argument you have for saying something is &quot;I have the right to say it&quot; and not the actual content of what you&#x27;re saying, maybe that says something about what you&#x27;re trying to say. Ideas, not speech.')
