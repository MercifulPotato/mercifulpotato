Recreational cocaine will be still ilegal in any other country and the internal and medical markets are not significant to the problem. So you are legalizing an export industry that cannot be lawfully exported anywhere in quantity.<p>This is problematic for many reasons. By necessity the legal producers will have to sell large quantities to clandestine entities that export unlawfully it out of the county (since nobody would accept a lawful import with all the required customs paperwork). The value chain will push prices down in the supply and manufacture and reward the international smugglers who take the risks and can eliminate competition by forming cartels. So you will have immensely powerful cartels based in Colombia that purchase in bulk on the legal market, that can bribe politicians to maintain a favorable regulatory framework, you get the whole Escobar situation, state capture and narco-state structures.<p>The next fallout is diplomatic. Countries served by smugglers based in Colombia will ask for cooperation to stop those export routes. You either ignore them and get sanctions or military action, or you put pressure on the legal industry, driving it underground again.')
