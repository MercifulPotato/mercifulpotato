In the same breath, you are supporting the argument that it does nothing to prevent people from contracting and spreading the virus.<p>You guys are acting like this is all rather obvious, but it&#x27;s not at all.<p>If I walked up to someone on the street and said that a vaccine will give them immunity, what do you think they would take that to mean?<p>Well, the NHS, and the CDC are both saying that the vaccine gives &#x27;immunity&#x27; and &#x27;protection.&#x27;<p>You have to stop getting angry at me, and consider that if you&#x27;re not making a convincing argument to me, how the hell are you going to make a convincing argument to somebody who <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have a degree in biochemistry.')
