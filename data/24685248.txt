It would make Formula 1 engines relevant for road cars. 2. It would attract new manufacturers to the sport.<p>1. Failed miserably; there is 0 road relevance for F1 engines.\n2. Failed miserably; only Honda entered the sport and they are pulling the plug now. Juicy detail; they extended their IndyCar contract and IndyCar is switching to V6 Turbo Hybrid engines in a few years.... So the &quot;carbon free tech&quot; reason they gave to pull out of F1 isn&#x27;t entirely true.<p>What F1 should do is one of two things;<p>1. Find a way to become road relevant again. I&#x27;d say the only way to do this is to skip Electric as Formula E is doing this already and go for hydrogen fuel.<p>2. Screw road relevance, and focus on entertainment. This means abandoning the insanely complex&#x2F;expensive engines and go for simple, powerful, and most of all cheap engines.')
