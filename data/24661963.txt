Just because we didn&#x27;t find it in the last hundred years doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t in the future. Real growth in % terms eventually stops because it hits a physical limit; that isn&#x27;t a controversial idea. It is almost too obvious to state. Humanity can&#x27;t maintain 1% Year-on-year growth in crop yield indefinitely. At some point; the improvements stop. The longer the improvements have been going on for the <i>more likely</i> it is they will stop.')
