Item(by='Veen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605448187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100191, text='&gt; it&#x27;s not based on lies or misrepresentation. In each case the inciting incidents actually happened and in many we have footage.<p>To play devil&#x27;s advocate a little: BLM&#x27;s ideology (the core activists, not the average supporter) is based on a specific view of anti-racism â€” critical race theory. CRT is not the only way to think about race, and many would argue it&#x27;s a bad way to think about it: it&#x27;s illiberal, divisive, wedded to ideologically left-wing ideas about power and social relations, and not particularly amenable to evidence-based thinking. In fact, it could be argued that the CRT is a huge misrepresentation.<p>Furthermore, while each of the &quot;inciting incidents&quot; did happen, so did hundreds more involving every racial combination of police and victim you can think of. It is a misrepresentation to focus on a subset of incidents because it moves focus from the actual cause of the problem. It is not racist police. It is poorly trained, unaccountable, and psychologically unsuited police officers. You could drum every racist police officer out, make every one of them take the knee and attend endless mandatory bias classes until only dyed-in-the-wool CRT advocates are left, and these incidents would keep happening until training and recruitment undergo a radical change.<p>Moderate right-wing people don&#x27;t oppose or fear &quot;anti-racism&quot; or the support it receives in the corporate world because they are racist, but because they think i) It doesn&#x27;t work and can&#x27;t work, ii) it&#x27;s a bad diagnosis, iii) it leads to socially damaging second order effects.')
