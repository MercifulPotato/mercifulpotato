Access to the public was immediately revoked and multiple casinos were built on the part of the land near a lake and closest to the highway that ran through the land.<p>Is this a similar case?  Also if anyone has a recollection of what I&#x27;m referring to, that would be awesome.  My search skills are failing me.')
