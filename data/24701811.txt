And it sounds like unnecessary complexity is something they would evolve to create, not diminish, because it&#x27;s a great moat for them to hide behind.<p>Is that what we&#x27;re hoping to accomplish? Create a few hypercorporations with tens of thousands of people working bullshit jobs because they&#x27;ve shaped industries in such a way so as to force that bullshit to be the cost of entry?<p>No thanks.')
