That&#x27;s what happened when I cancelled my &quot;non-refundable&quot; spring break tickets.<p>I got an email from Alaska Airlines recently saying essentially the same thing. They&#x27;d rather let people cancel in return for a credit than have people simply not book at all out of fear of needing to cancel. Hell, they&#x27;d be happy to take your money now for a plane ticket in the future. It&#x27;s basically a loan to help them weather the pandemic.')
