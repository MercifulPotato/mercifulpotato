There are some places that offer degrees in the last two, and some places where you can focus on CS degree on those more practical aspects, but CS by nature is more theoretical and abstract, bearing roughly the relationship to those other things that Physics has to Mechanical Engineering or Automotive Maintenance.<p>Of course, you don&#x27;t have places looking at Physics degrees as entry stakes for auto mechanics, but I&#x27;d they started doing that the problem wouldn&#x27;t be with the Physics programs.')
