And then we will also have easier time keeping focus.<p>People who like coding will probably not see it as only work but also choose to do it in their own time and that usually results in private projects.<p>I do electronics at home and this usually includes some kind of microcontroller and coding, just because I like it. But I don&#x27;t have public repositories and I don&#x27;t do open source projects because I do my own fun projects at work and get directly rewarded for it.')
