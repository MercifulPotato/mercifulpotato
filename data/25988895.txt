Dotnet interactive notebooks still has some rough edges to smooth out (and it&#x27;s currently only available to VS Code Insiders) but, eventually, I think the new syntax coupled with dotnet interactive notebooks will make it <i>a lot</i> easier for people to try out F# and work through some problems&#x2F;examples.')
