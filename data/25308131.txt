I am surprised that this doesn&#x27;t violate Google&#x27;s standards! It would certainly violate mine.<p>OTOH Timnit sounds like a down-the-middle SJW type, which means that every conflict is about identity, privilege, and so on, which honestly hurts her message. To me, its enough that Google shut her paper down and wouldn&#x27;t tell her why or give her even a chance for a different outcome -- perhaps it is, ironically, her SJW nature that makes it risky for Google to engage her in the way she wants to be engaged, because a deeper conflict <i>cannot</i> look good for Google in the current cultural climate. (E.g. sounds like she&#x27;s got strong intellectual integrity points, and weak SJW points to make about Google, but they couldn&#x27;t engage the former without also dealing with the latter.)')
