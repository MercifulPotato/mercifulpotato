Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25343509], score=None, time=1607409380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339903, text='&gt; Should we allow a factory in Indiana to avoid environmental regulation if they just pay a 30% tariff?<p>There are problems that tariffs are a solution to, like currency manipulation. Lack of environmental rules is not really one of those problems.<p>&gt; The answer is to ban them just like we should ban U.S.-made products that don&#x27;t follow the rules.<p>The real problem is that there are two problems, which currently sort of cancel out.<p>The first problem is that the existing rules in the US are effective but prohibitively burdensome. The second problem is that the same rules don&#x27;t apply to China. Businesses solve the first problem by invoking the second.<p>We can&#x27;t solve just one. If you imposed the existing rules on China, things would become unreasonably expensive. If you stopped imposing them on the US, there would be as much pollution in the US as there is in China. We need more efficient rules. Which is hard. Worse, it&#x27;s not sexy and nobody wants to do the work.<p>But in a sense we can have one solve the other in the opposite direction too. Apply the same rules to other countries and they can&#x27;t be avoided by leaving the US, which then creates pressure to fix the rules so that they&#x27;re not prohibitively inefficient, since they can no longer be avoided.')
