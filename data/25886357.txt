Everything counts.<p>If you go to a 5 star hotel where everything is perfect but when you try to use the shower it doesn&#x27;t work, your overall rating will be 1 star. For a experience to be gratifying, everything needs to work together.<p>I&#x27;ve read countless articles and postmortems of the style &quot;why X is successful&quot;, and then seen games that follow those documents closely and produce a horrible game. Because they are unable to capture the whole experience.<p>Lately I played a game, Ex-Zodiac, which is a StarFox clone. Only the demo is available, but the author really captured every single aspect that made StarFox great. That attention to detail is what makes games fun.')
