It&#x27;s a newer&#x2F;cleaner&#x2F;simpler version of my go-to site for anything detailed related to exercise: ex-rx.net.<p>One suggestion: add more of the detail that site has on the other muscles used during a particular exercise. Example is bench press, which is pec-focused but engages lots of other muscles - it might be useful to show the body-diagram highlighting all of those muscles.')
