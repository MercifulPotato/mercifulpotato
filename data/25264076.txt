That&#x27;s just not a high price to pay for anyone who cares about not being on facebook. If they are not willing to pay it, it is an indication that they just don&#x27;t care. It seems that tech people have a hard time to realize this: most people are fine with facebook, knowing all its evils.<p>And of course the other platforms, they should keep improving and bringing those number of clicks down, and polishing up the UI, etc. But I just mean that they are already up there in terms of usability, at least in the same league.<p>PS. Heck, people can&#x27;t even be bothered to spend 5 minutes listening about and 5 clicks installing adblock&#x2F;ublock... I suppose that&#x27;s Zuckerberg&#x27;s fault too. &#x2F;s')
