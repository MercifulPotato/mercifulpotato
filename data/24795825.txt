It&#x27;s really about attempting to force ideas into the definition of &quot;the mainstream&quot;.<p>Facebook and Twitter legitimize content. From a social media perspective, they define the vanilla. When people say &quot;I saw it on Facebook&quot;, you instinctively intuit it was on their feed between a photo of a kid and advert for Red Robin.<p>If you want rocky road rather than vanilla, you can go find it on (2^n)chan. It&#x27;s not hard to find. The presence of FaceTwit doesn&#x27;t stop those forums existing or censor them.<p>When the President has a tweet deleted or some covid conspiracy group is removed from Facebook, it&#x27;s not that there isn&#x27;t somewhere else that content could go. I mean Trump is literally continuously on TV and has the entire Federal government at his disposal to get his message out. The covid conspiracy nuts can go to some smaller&#x2F;madder corner of the Internet.<p>The reason to raise a ruckus is because being kept out of TwitFace means being kept out of the mainstream. I saw the Proud Boys update next to that cute GAP ad. I got the latest @QAnon post after the one from @KimKardashian.<p>To hell with that. Don&#x27;t normalize that garbage. Moderate away.')
