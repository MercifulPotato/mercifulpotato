I was there for 35c3. Worst part is that since you don&#x27;t know if you will get a ticket or not and you book hotels&#x2F;flights only after you nab a ticket, you are paying increased prices vs booking far in advance.<p>Defcon has CCC beat in this area because you know you will get a ticket at Defcon. On the flipside, Defcon 27 last year was a complete mess because there were so many people. It was more Linecon than Defcon. However I am thankful to DarkTangent and his crew&#x27;s efforts. The Goons did the very best they could and I am glad they are still doing it.<p>At 35c3 I got totally ripped off by Leipzig Taxis and my hotel which was cheaper but further away and not on the train path(at least easily).<p>Was it worth it? YES. Was worth every last penny. I am so thankful to the Chaos Computer Club for their efforts in putting on such an amazing event year after year. If I manage to make it back there again I will be volunteering as an Angel. I just wish it was cheaper to make it to Leipzig from the US but I understand that they are stretched to the gills in terms of capacity.<p>I heard a rumor that they have already maxed out capacity at Leipzig and there is no bigger place in all of Germany?')
