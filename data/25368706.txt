This is not the case, Redis is, and will remain, BSD licensed.<p>&gt; What is happening instead is that certain Redis modules, developed inside Redis Labs, are now released under the Common Clause (using Apache license as a base license). This means that basically certain enterprise add-onsâ€¦<p>That is from a few years ago, but I believe it&#x27;s still true, and basic redis is still FreeBSD. This isn&#x27;t a slight of hand where &quot;basic redis core&quot; is open source but not really useful by itself, I think the majority of redis installs have never been using those &quot;enterprise add-ons&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily a problem for the author&#x27;s theory in general, which I am generally sympathetic to as accurately describing something going on in the software world right now, but I think it&#x27;s misinformation about redis.')
