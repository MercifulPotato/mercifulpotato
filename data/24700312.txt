It makes for a unique mix.<p>There&#x27;s a variety of reasons for this I could speculate on, and three of the firmer ones are refugee resettlement (Minneapolis and Somalis, pre-cool Cali and Hmong, Michigan and Syrian refugees), Central&#x2F;South American immigration patterns beyond the border states, and military bases which tend to show up all over the midwest&#x2F;west&#x2F;southeast&#x2F;southwest (Korean, Vietnamese, German and maybe smaller ones but those stand out).<p>These communities exist alongside the traditional cultural elements of the city and can often be blocks away. But, the areas tend to look a lot less like Chinatown and more like Flushing - maybe more insular, but still plenty authentic.')
