It not only has demonstrated to be a failure economically, but it&#x27;s an arrogant attitude by politicians, giving the message they know better than individuals, and that a free market leads to preventable bad outcomes. Also, it&#x27;s tied to price controls and redistribution concepts. They will assign the money to each person they find moral.
