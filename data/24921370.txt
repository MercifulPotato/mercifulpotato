Running one every 15 minutes around a small town in a loop isn&#x27;t that expensive.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything fundamental about density. Its about ridership and funding. Even LA could have functional mass transit if it had the will to fund 15-minute busses on a grid all day. A 25 cent tax on gas would do it. If even 2 people average rode each bus, it&#x27;d break even on traffic density as well?')
