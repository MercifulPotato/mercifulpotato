Item(by='pbourke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610491228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25751378, text='&gt;&gt; There is no similar human rights mandate for a Parler account<p>&gt;Canada considers internet access a basic human right, and it&#x27;s pretty clear the rest of the world will move in that direction shortly.<p>Having a Parler account and having access to the internet are two different things.<p>Funny that you mention Canada. Parler would likely have trouble existing as a Canadian entity due to Canada’s hate speech laws and the courts’ propensity to leave carriers exposed to liability for hosting content that violates those laws.<p>Also, the Canadian government has a broad power to restrict speech in times of crisis through the War Measures Act. They could easily have switched a site like Parler off if a similar event occurred.')
