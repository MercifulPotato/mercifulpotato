I&#x27;ve had this idea kicking around in my head about using machine learning on complex time series data for a sort of anomaly detection. You could use example time series data to train a neural network to find conserved quantities in the system, essentially trying to learn the internal energy of the system, and then changes in that internal energy would be your anomalies.<p>It looks like this paper is getting at the same basic idea, though obviously actually fleshed out and with better results than I would have thought were possible. It&#x27;s going not for anomaly detection but actual forecasting, and directly isolating the non-conserved force.<p>I&#x27;ll need to start reading the related papers, I wonder if people have tried doing this with nonlinear equations, or systems where the dynamics aren&#x27;t well defined? I imagine actually forecasting a nonlinear system wouldn&#x27;t be possible beyond short time frames, but maybe you could still learn the underlying equation and dynamics? It would be interesting to see if you could give a neural network a bunch of nonlinear data and have it find equilibrium points, identify regions where the dynamics are almost linear, etc.')
