Item(by='KozmoNau7', descendants=None, kids=[25543616], score=None, time=1608985290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25538780, text='&gt;&quot;Does HN have any thoughts about living a smaller life by doing fewer things and having more time to just live and enjoy life?&quot;<p>I heartily recommend it.<p>Get off the &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; carousel, reduce your living expenses and enjoy both having your money stretch much further as well as building up savings. I invest a sustainable amount of my monthly income into climate-friendly mutual funds, as I expect climate change to drive massive innovation in that field. I do not invest in any other segments, for moral reasons.<p>We prefer to live a frugal life and try to avoid buying unnecessary things. In our current living situation, we are lucky enough to not need a car on a daily basis (bicycles and public transit work great here), so we&#x27;ve joined a nonprofit car sharing service (dedicated cars, not people&#x27;s personal cars) for the occasions where we do have to go outside of practical public transit reach.<p>In general, we try to buy second hand when possible and repair our things ourselves. Most of my clothes have one or another kind of fix or slight modification at this point, aside from t-shirts, which are just hopeless in that regard. Men&#x27;s shirts take repairs so much better. One thing you learn quickly is that tightly-fitting clothes wear our a lot quicker, especially those with elastic fibers added. Looser-fitting clothes last significantly longer. Tightly-fitting synthetic athletic wear does last pretty well (probably due to the reduced friction), but we are trying to avoid synthetic fibers.<p>It also becomes a hobby in its own right, as I&#x27;m writing this I&#x27;m adding suspender buttons to some nice thick cotton twill pants that I found recently, because it beats the hell out of belts for comfort. It&#x27;s hard to find anything but dress pants with suspender buttons these days and clip suspenders chew up the waistband.<p>On the occasions where we do have to buy something brand new, we try to find the locally (Europe, in our case) produced products, both for the environmental impact and for the worker protections factor. Organic and sustainable production is something we prefer to seek out, as well.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to live frugally and you don&#x27;t have to take it to extremes, if you don&#x27;t want to. Just learning to repair things instead of throwing away and buying new, is a great first step.<p>I recognize that we <i>are</i> privileged in that we can actually choose to live like this and have the services around us that make it practical, but I think most people would feel a lot less stressed if they slowed down and lived in a more frugal fashion.')
