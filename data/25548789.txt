The idea is to use existing natural gas pipelines to transfer hydrogen.<p>It’s true that a small fraction of hydrogen will permeate the pipes and leak; however, that leakage is not economically significant:<p>“... this theoretical distribution main leakage rate (43 million ft3&#x2F;yr) would be 0.0002% of the 24.13 trillion cubic feet of natural gas consumed in 2010.” [1]<p>Hydrogen can be blended with natural gas (the above calculation was made assuming a 20% blend) or it can be sent down the line exclusively. As for how the hydrogen is produced, there are several ways:<p>1. It can be cracked from natural gas, after which the carbon is captured and stored back underground. Or,<p>2. It can be produced from electrolysis of water using energy from a renewable source such as wind or solar, effectively storing the energy for later use.<p>Either way, the point is that hydrogen is a useful fuel that can be transported over existing infrastructure and then used in a variety of ways that may help with the transition to a zero carbon system. Just to give one example, hydrogen can be combined with carbon dioxide to create jet fuel.
