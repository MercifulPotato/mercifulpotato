Item(by='acdha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611803934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933920, text='&gt; I probably should have spelt out that I&#x27;m by-and-large talking about application development<p>I was as well. My point is just that not everyone works on the same things or has the same resources, and there is no global optimum. I&#x27;m generally in the “more functions, fewer classes, minimize inheritance” camp personally but the most important underlying principal is remembering that methodology is a tool which is supposed to help, not hinder, and adjusting based on local conditions.<p>Part of the value an experienced developer brings should be having a good sense for when a particular approach is a good fit for the problem at hand and being willing to say that whatever you&#x27;re doing needs changes. This can be tricky because methodologies often have a quasi religious aspect where people take the decisions very personally but the worst project outcomes I&#x27;ve seen have been from cases where people treated the status quo as holy writ and refused to consider how problems could be avoided or transformed by picking something different.')
