Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=[25003879], score=None, time=1604608422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25000761, text='&gt; Pretty big claim to say it&#x27;s cheaper when, as of now, they haven&#x27;t produced or sold a single truck.<p>They&#x27;ve taken pre-orders and accepted cash, it&#x27;s a contract. Tesla will sell those trucks for the announced prices.<p>Even using $38k as the base price of the Model 3[1], it is still a good value compared to competing electric vehicles which tend to have much lower ranges, slower charging networks, and worse performance. The Model Y competitors are also generally more expensive and have lower ranges.<p>They are still a bit pricy compared to non-EVs, but compared to other EVs, Teslas are not priced at a premium. If you value performance, the gap is even more significant.<p>&gt; I guess it works though, because every time a competitor puts an EV truck out there, someone inevitably claims that the Cybertruck is cheaper.<p>It works because as I mention above, Tesla has a track record of delivering decent value. It is extremely fair to say Tesla vehicles are often <i>behind schedule</i>, but their pricing (again compared to other EVs) is usually extremely competitive.<p>[1] It was possible for quite a while to get a Model 3 for $35k, it was just a little tricky without a pre-order.')
