If Amazon sells it so cheaply why don&#x27;t enterprises go direct to Amazon instead of paying a SaaS provider like you?<p>It&#x27;s about economics not accounting.<p>Once you get into cost comparisons you&#x27;ve already lost. AWS is purpose built for an accounting narrative.<p>To illustrate what a dead end accounting is, accounting can&#x27;t explain things like, &quot;I spend money today to possibly make money more than 1 year in the future.&quot; That&#x27;s basically every startup and accounting doesn&#x27;t have a story for it.<p>Of course a free tier looks good <i>accounting-wise</i>. How does one &quot;account&quot; for lock-in though? If you can&#x27;t figure that out you will not convince bean counters to consider alternatives.<p>And good luck teaching economics (as opposed to accounting) to bean counters.<p>Here are a few compelling explanations: the cheapest bid (i.e. free tier) is always the worst one. Some people are so addicted to accounting storytelling - as a way to organize their world, a whole philosophy - they are actually always convinced the cheapest bid is <i>always</i> the <i>best</i> one.<p>Another: AWS is so overpriced, the $50k you spend on developing against AWS services to use $500k of &quot;free credits&quot; will deliver less value than $50k you spend developing for a single vertically scaled beige box computer with simple ergonomics and running it.')
