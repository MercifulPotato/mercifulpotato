It&#x27;s impossible.<p>Is it though? If harder drugs were legal, wouldn&#x27;t harder drug use be much more common? Cannabis is one thing, the perceived impact to oneself is relatively low. Meth, a hard, illegal drug - is growing in some areas radically; so are some prescription drug use.<p>There is a large group of citizens who don&#x27;t try things because they are illegal (because they don&#x27;t want to bring legal trouble) rather than not trying those things because they are bad for health. (Humans are fairly bad at rejecting things that are bad for them - but good at numbing them). eg: Alcohol, smoke, caffeine, soda, refined sugar.')
