Nintendo fixed that in a hardware revision around two years ago so there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of Switches out there which cannot be hacked by the open source methods, but can with Team Xecuters hardware mod. RCM was patched before the launch of the &quot;Switch 2.0&quot; and Switch Lite, so the only way to get homebrew along with the improved battery life of the 2.0 or greater portability of the Lite is via that hardware mod.')
