If you want to build good theoretical understanding and critical thinking, that requires the learners to work a lot, and is harder to quantify and test, but allows you to keep the material consistent over a long period.\nAlso, different subjects can lend themselves better (or worse) to a distance learning situation.\nThe OP mentions kids moving at different paces -- but that happens in person too -- they just don&#x27;t notice&#x2F;see it.<p>I think one issue is the idea that you can take a few pieces of quality &quot;content&quot;, thread through them and have a meaningful course.\nMastery is a great thing to talk about -- what is it exactly? For most, it&#x27;s doing well enough to get a certain mark on a test. But I&#x27;d argue what you want is to ensure that learners use concepts they have mastered in a demonstrative way -- but again, this is harder and will cost more.\nIt would be great if education was concerned about deeper understanding, but right now the focus seems to be &quot;will this be on the test&quot;.')
