Maybe you can&#x27;t spam them with links to every conspiracy website you come across or an endless stream of your kid without them becoming annoyed, but you absolutely can communicate with them. Facebook has only stayed relevant because of the natural lag in popular websites (older folks always get on late) and by buying platforms people have switched to in recent years likes WhatsApp and Instagram. But people do switch and people also are on multiple platforms')
