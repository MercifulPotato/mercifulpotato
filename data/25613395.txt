We are America. We are usually behind when it comes to regulations because we don&#x27;t want to be like China. We are free.&quot; This was a few years ago when discussing the implications of cryptocurrency.<p>So, this legislation feels like a break from that consciousness.<p>Instead of playing cat and mouse with these entities - which the above quote illustrates as the American legislative way - we are going for the jugular of this issue.<p>To be clear, it&#x27;s not necessarily this specific act that has me concerned, but the change in perspective that allows a provision like this to pass... it sounds like the surveillance bourgeois is becoming the predominate member of congress.')
