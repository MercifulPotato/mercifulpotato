Item(by='m11a', descendants=None, kids=[24883234, 24882623], score=None, time=1603580216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866734, text='The issue is here: &quot;I have no problem solving most of algebra or calculus problems, but if you asked me to explain what I&#x27;m doing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you, at least not using mathematical constructs&#x2F;words.&quot; This is slightly unclear; there are two possible problems here from what I can see, and they&#x27;re totally different problems to have.<p>Either you cannot do maths, and you&#x27;re only good at solving repetitive problems of the same genre from school textbooks. Or you can do maths, and you struggle to follow the generally accepted set of notation.<p>If your problem is the first, you need to explore a wider range of mathematical problems, which will fundamentally require you to think, apply your skills to the problem in various new ways. Maths is a subject where learning to think and learning to solve a specific set of problems are two very different things. Good resources for this are the Art of Problem Solving, and various Olympiad questions. You can also just try to apply your mathematical knowledge to real life examples.<p>If your problem is the second, I don&#x27;t know a solution, but this is a far better problem to have than the first. I&#x27;d rather have the problem solving ability and use my own set of notation that nobody else understands, than have less problem solving ability and understand the notation. But, in short, that&#x27;ll just come down to practice, seeing the general notation, and somehow forcing yourself to use it. Alternatively, just try to define your own set of notation at the start of your solutions. It may depend on what kind of professor you have as to how many credits you&#x27;ll get, though. A good professor will not penalise you that much for making up your own notation, if your solutions are correct, but may try to encourage you to use standard notation (as this is required for any kind of collaborative mathematics).')
