It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate the spoiler effect, just makes it less likely.<p>I understand how votes are cast in each system and they seem similar. STAR seems like RCV, but you can put multiple candidates in the same rank.\nI&#x27;m not sure how STAR votes are tallied, but wouldn&#x27;t you be able to implement that same system with RCV? The only difference is same-ranking candidates. Is that the key to STAR&#x27;s improvement?<p>EDIT:<p>Is it just this simple? You sum their score, then instant runoff the top 2?:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NuVSn2rAFVU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NuVSn2rAFVU</a><p>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s better or not yet. It still definitely doesn&#x27;t elect the condorcet winner... which you can see from 3 voters and 12 candidates:<p>Voter 1: 4 for A, 3 for B, 2 for C, 1 for J<p>Voter 2: 4 for D, 3 for E, 2 for F, 1 for J<p>Voter 3: 4 for G, 3 for H, 2 for I, 1 for J<p>It&#x27;s more contrived than the example for RCV, so I think it&#x27;s more resistant to spoiler effect, but it clearly happens here. Essentially, every favored candidate higher than 1 is different and they all have the same candidate for their last favorite candidate. As you can see, A,D,G have the most votes, but in 1-on-1 face-offs, J would win most of the elections. Voter 1 likes J more than D,E,F,G,H, and I. Voter 2 like J more than 6 other candidates as well and same with Voter 3. But in STAR, he gets eliminated.<p>I believe you could come up with an example where the top two candidates aren&#x27;t tied, but it would be more complicated.<p>These voting systems are difficult to measure. I thought RCV was very secure until this HN thread. Hopefully STAR holds up, but I think you&#x27;d have to look more into the incentives to fully know if it eliminates the spoiler effect.')
