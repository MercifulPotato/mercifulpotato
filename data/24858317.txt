At the very least, I think an AGI will need to exist in an interactive environment rather than just trained on preset datasets. Prior context or not, a child doesn’t learn by being shown a lot of images, it learns by being able to poke at the world to see what happens. I think an AGI will likely require some aspect of that (and apply reinforcement learning that way).<p>But like I said, I’m no expert and that’s just my layperson opinion.<p>[1] if the goal is AGI, if it’s not then of course there’s no reason to stop<p>[2] some people are doing just that, of course')
