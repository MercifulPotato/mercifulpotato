Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24665357], score=None, time=1601661170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664416, text='&gt; This is posed as a computational resource problem, but it strikes me as an information problem.<p>I thought the point of the gas illustration was to show how the assumption there&#x27;s an information problem (i.e. heat, second law) is actually not correct.<p>That it only looks like an information problem and it&#x27;s really a computation problem.<p>The theory being that if you can <i>compute</i> were the molecules are going to be, from the initial state or from interactions you have already learned from, then the motions don&#x27;t appear random any more.  There are no surprises; you have &quot;decrypted&quot; the apparently random movements.<p>It&#x27;s just to illustrate the idea, and an immediate objection would be &quot;but we can&#x27;t know everything to that much detail&quot;.<p>That is addressed by a more subtle version of the argument, which says:  Although you don&#x27;t know all the motions precisely, your ability to compute motions from the information you obtained so far gives you progressively increasing knowledge about motions locally or which you recognise as related, and causes &quot;regions of effective coherence&quot; to expand.  It&#x27;s effective coherence not actual coherence, because the molecule motions don&#x27;t change, only the precision with which you can anticipate some of them as well as relationships between them.  What would have appeared random, now with the benefit of some prior information and computation resolves gradually into local clusters of more predictable related motions, even if you don&#x27;t know every motion accurately.  With the result that the effective fluid properties change, so your ability to &quot;swim&quot; through the gas changes.<p>In the 2d closed box model, with perfect balls and perfect interactions (i.e. a mathematically perfect simulation) it&#x27;s plausible that this may work perfectly.  That is, if you have your own &quot;special&quot; ball and it undergoes a number of collisions and you get perfect measurement of those collisions, eventually you end up with enough information to model the contents of the rest of the box.  If in that model you can dynamically adjust something about the collisions of your &quot;special&quot; ball, for example changing the ball&#x27;s shape, mass or radius, it&#x27;s plausible that can be used to travel anywhere in the box much faster than diffusion, but only if you have the information up to that point and excellent computation - which might be irreducibly hard computation for a reasonably sized box.')
