Item(by='mturmon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603297720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843649, text='&gt; You should familiarize yourself with power law processes...<p>Since you brought it up: my PhD was in applied probability, and I work with heavy-tailed natural data every weekday.<p>*<p>As my comment noted, ML literally says 170K or maybe 175K, and flat-out dismisses 220K.  The latter is an interesting figure, because we recently surpassed it.<p>We&#x27;re now well out of the 170-175K envelope and still rising at about 5K deaths per week, about 20K deaths per month [1].  Note that our weekly death toll is <i>the implied accuracy of ML&#x27;s prediction</i>.  This is a failure.<p>If ML thought there was a power law behind the mortality from an in-process event, he should have said &quot;170K deaths or maybe 1.7M&quot;.  But he didn&#x27;t say that, did he?<p>*<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see an interview with an excellent science communicator.  They will say what we know, and not a bit more than that.  They will choose their words carefully.  They will distinguish between speculation and accepted truth.<p>I live in southern CA, and Lucy Jones (formerly of the USGS) is such a person, for earthquakes.  These people are a treasure, because this stuff is hard and it&#x27;s important to get it right if you&#x27;re going to make public statements.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;forecasting-us.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;forecas...</a>')
