Conway&#x27;s Game of Life: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8</a> It takes many many steps of the inner game of life to produce a single iteration of the outer simulation.<p>In general, with emergent behavior, it takes a lot of inner steps to produce a single meaningful step in the outer system. So it makes sense that our cells are much faster than we intuititively think of as &quot;fast&quot;. Because our intuition about speed is itself the product an emergent system. We are that larger Game of Life there, so it looks incredibly fast to watch the inner one according to our own time scale.')
