I&#x27;ve tried reading it several times. I just can&#x27;t get into it. My major complaint is that it gives a ton of code examples and then &quot;don&#x27;t do this&quot; is written under it. So one has to be extremely alert at all times while reading through the book. It dives right into the subject as if one has already been writing threaded code. Perhaps that&#x27;s the target audience.')
