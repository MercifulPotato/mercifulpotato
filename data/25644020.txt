Private sector development funding optimises for drawn-out therapies that manage a condition indefinitely rather than ones that cure it. This is an unconscionable status quo.<p>Public funding is fine for when your end-goal is known. In medicine, the end-goal is known: cure&#x2F;manage condition X, which will save lives or improving quality of life of sufferers.<p>Optimising for patentable, innovative techniques is no longer a distraction (because those aren&#x27;t needed to &quot;protect your investment&quot;). Optimising for ongoing therapy rather than a one-off&#x2F;infrequent cure is no longer a distraction because you already got your money from the government and ain&#x27;t getting any more. You can just focus on getting the job done quickly, with the cheapest techniques available (though boring they might be), and with the cheapest possible total cost of running the therapy start-to-end.')
