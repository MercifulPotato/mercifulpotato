If two services aren’t in the same VPC, they can’t talk to each other. It theoretically limits the damage of a rogue node.<p>Of course, it also creates a ton of overhead and complexity, because you still have to wire all your VPCs together to implement things like monitoring and log aggregation, for example.<p>As other people have suggested, the better solution (imo) is to have all your traffic be encrypted with mTLS, and enforce your ACLs with certs instead of network accessibility.')
