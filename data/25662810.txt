Now I recognize that the best outcomes are a) when the lawmakers reach across the aisle and forge what both sides would consider a compromise and more importantly b) when the lawmakers we elect actually enact laws and run the country in a way that benefits the people they represent.<p>I suspect that our best way forward as a nation is to resume carefully growing the middle class.  This will by nature mean that the financial elites (some of whom are clearly moral despots) will lose a small portion of their wealth.  But it&#x27;s amazingly analogous to the reforms at the beginning of the last century that started to protect labor from the robber barons.<p>I think the second step is to (yes, at a cost) restore at least some manufacturing capability to the US.
