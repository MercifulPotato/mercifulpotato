What about heat? Parts of California get COLD. A therm (100,000 BTUs, roughly 29.3 kW-H) is $0.36 according to SoCal Gas. The equivalent in resistance heat would be roughly $5.80 @ $0.20&#x2F;kW-H (being generous here, my electric rate was much higher in Los Angeles).  A heat pump (reverse air conditioner) can double or triple your electric heating efficiency, but only works when it’s relatively warm outside (&gt; ~30F &#x2F; 0C) and you’re still looking at $2+ for the equivalent heat energy. So you’d more than QUADRUPLE heating bills. Not gonna happen.')
