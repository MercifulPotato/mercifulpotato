I wasn&#x27;t happy about it, but I was aghast that so many people voted for a con man, not convinced that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be true that more people (in the right places, at least) wanted him than the second-worst political candidate I&#x27;ve ever seen run for President.<p>Also, by the time the certification comes around, the <i>actual</i> voters, all 538 of them, have publicly voted, so not only did I think the election was fair, but by then I knew it was 100% <i>legal</i>.<p>IMO big tech doesn&#x27;t really do much censoring until pushed into a corner, now or in the past; they&#x27;re more about the money than the politics.  The Russians (along with a few other players, no doubt) absolutely fuck with our elections, but they do it the old fashioned way -- by spreading propaganda on social media and convincing American citizens to believe in conspiracy theories, and turn against their fellow citizens, etc.<p>FWIW, no Democrats stormed the Capitol in 2017.  The losing candidate conceded, and relatively quickly at that.  After losing by a lower margin than Trump in 2020, while beating him by millions of votes nationwide.<p>There isn&#x27;t really a good way to spin it.  Trump supporters storming the Capitol is <i>bad</i>, but it&#x27;s actually a fairly distant second place to what the sitting President is doing.')
