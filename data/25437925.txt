This issue was obviously noted with the Big Sur beta roll out where that may be forgiven more readily. But now it’s in the public release. Knowing nothing about the matter I guess I could see how new OS releases break things and how it’s sometimes hard to triage bug reports in a giant organization like Apple. In desktop Linux these sorts of problems are almost a matter of course— I still remember having to drop Arch when I no longer had the time to read every changelog as recommended before evergreen updates. With Ubuntu is easier— just go with LTS and install stuff from source when the packages don’t have what you need. On the other hand Windows didn’t seem to have any of these issues. Not to mention Mac controls the hardware it installed on and Windows had to work on much more diverse hardware. In the end though I think Apple works out its new OS kinks within a few months of release and, even though there ideally wouldn’t be workflow breaking bugs in public releases. You just have to kind of treat the public release as unstable for a few months. Ideally you don’t upgrade before then lest Apple revoke the install signatures from the previous stable release.')
