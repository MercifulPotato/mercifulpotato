That simply does not exist within the EU as an institution. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to easily explain exactly what&#x27;s wrong with the EU&#x27;s accountability and anti-corruption structures; endless column inches have been spent on the problems, mostly in somewhat niche publications and read mainly by people deeply interested in EU politics. (Which may also be part of the problem. Even before Brexit, few cared, and the political polarization around Brexit has pushed the idea that the EU has structural problems outside the realm of mainstream discourse. Take a look at the comments in this HN discussion for example!)')
