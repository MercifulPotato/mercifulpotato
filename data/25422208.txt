Reuters and the Washington Post have breathless claims of Russian hackers &quot;according to officials familiar with the matter.&quot; Uh huh.<p>Saying &quot;APT29&quot; or &quot;CozyBear&quot; doesn&#x27;t make the accusation any more credible.<p>If multiple US agencies are trumpeting the same story, you really must ask yourself &quot;Why? Why this? Why now?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s pretty amusing, in a depressing way, to see how quickly so many otherwise intelligent people can be made to snap to attention and fight the Russian Menace with a few anonymous government claims.')
