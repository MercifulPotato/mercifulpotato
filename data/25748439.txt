Usually the county doesn&#x27;t need to deem it necessary because property value increases (which has the effect of increasing tax revenue)<p>So basically what I&#x27;m saying is... the POTUS doesn&#x27;t need to do song and a dance in order for taxes to increase for people. For a lot of states, as long as the value of the property keeps increasing, the residents are paying more and more taxes every year. And if the income from your job doesn&#x27;t increase at the same rate as your property taxes... it can put a lot of financial strain on you (my relatives in NY moved to a different state because the property taxes in Albany were eating them alive)<p>Example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baltimoresun.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;real-estate&#x2F;bs-bz-tax-assessments-rise-2021-maryland-20201230-kk27ul3nrrfbph7kyfinjcunpu-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.baltimoresun.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;real-estate&#x2F;bs-bz-tax-...</a>')
