She was the one with the down payment and the one who would be the primary driver. She had already done all the research about what she wanted down to the exact used VIN she wanted to buy from them. When the salesman started directing questions to me, I simply would just look at her and let her answer. This quickly made him realize I was just there as a cosigner. Only thing I said the whole time was asking to see under the hood and about anything they knew about the car and it&#x27;s maintanence that wasn&#x27;t already on the Carfax report. She didn&#x27;t have any technical questions for the salesman as she already knew what we wanted, just a test drive to make sure it rode fine, and then we bought it. The finance guy had me fill out some paperwork but all of his questions were directed to her.<p>I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a car dealership without knowing exactly what I want. It is such a waste of time listening to a salespitch by someone that has a absolute interest in you maxing out your budget.')
