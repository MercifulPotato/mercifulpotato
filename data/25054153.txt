If you&#x27;re eating vitamins or protein in food or in a pill, what would the difference be? Are smoothies or soups not food?<p>Nutrition studies are quite difficult to perform, and the biology of digestion is not well understood.  Certainly different foods eaten in different ways are absorbed by your body differently.  Your smoothie example is a good one: fibrous vegetables travel farther through the gut* and their nutrients are absorbed differently than when the fibres are chopped up so that they travel through the lower intestine faster.<p>&gt; ...The only way I could imagine they&#x27;re useless is if the the vitamins themselves are structurally different and indigestible?<p>Likewise an iron supplement alone (or just iron from a piece of meat) will not raise iron levels as much as when taken with lemon juice or, yes, vitamin C.<p>You can measure this effect for yourself by measuring glucose rise when eating various foods: a raw apple, for example, vs the same mass of apple sauce vs the same mass of apple juice.<p>* of course it all makes its way the same distance from mouth to anus!  I mean arriving intact, or less processed, in the lower intestine and spending a longer time there.')
