There&#x27;s a lot of small details, and you can string them along to form the big picture. An example is going from symptoms -&gt; diagnosis -&gt; treatment options -&gt; drug side effects. You can&#x27;t just memorize use drug X for Y, but you incorporate information that you know to formulate the best plan.
