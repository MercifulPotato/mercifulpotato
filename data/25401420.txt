Item(by='geophile', descendants=None, kids=[25401658], score=None, time=1607805031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400980, text='Read a CSV file, foo.csv, and sort by the sum of the 4th and 7th columns (which are integers):<p><pre><code>    read -c foo.csv | sort (*x: int(x[3]) + int(x[6]))\n</code></pre>\nI suppose we could argue about what is a &quot;natural&quot; operation. Marcel grew out of a set of tasks that were &quot;natural&quot; in the domain I was working in. An important part of that domain was operating on databases, and clusters of nodes, and databases on those nodes. So marcel has features for those capabilities.<p>Partly, I was also scratching an itch: I prefer using Python to exploring the sublanguages of various shell commands. Much cleaner, in my opinion.')
