I would love it if [[sign up]] could be just &quot;click here to start a digital garden in logseq and have it show up in the Agora&quot;.<p>Unfortunately the format that logseq uses to encode blocks is not compatible out of the box, as they use Markdown headings instead of nested lists -- but I&#x27;ve spoken to them and IIRC they have an issue open to support nested lists as a block encoding convention, which I personally believe makes sense (there is a tradeoff here, though).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;sign-up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;sign-up</a>')
