Item(by='Schweigi', descendants=None, kids=[25971766], score=None, time=1612021010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969112, text='I did make my own option trading algo which is similar to the one in the Git Hub repo (but I used Scala, which gave me additional returns, jk :) ). Return totally depends on the delta of the options you write and the option symbols in your basket. Mine could be configured to be between 10-100+%. The higher the return the more volatile.<p>The idea of using multiple symbols like SPY and TLT is to reduce the tail risk. But in the end there is still tail risk like for example in the crash of 2015. Making the strategy delta neutral with hedging could improve it but I never completed that part.<p>There is an interesting book with all the math by Euan Sinclair about option writing and how to minimize the risk if you are interested.')
