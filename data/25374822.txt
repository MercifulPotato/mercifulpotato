I can only imagine that the music industry has many such use cases, including enterprise-style auditing&#x2F;reporting needs and the ability to limit an audio file&#x27;s distribution to within an organization. Not for the faint of heart to approach that, but there could be real opportunities there.<p>Some other random thoughts: This would be a perfect UI to standardize the pattern a lot of YouTube ads do: a ~5 second teaser clip that pre-plays the full material. With this and other network features as you grow (say, &quot;submit demos to my SongBox drop box, and then I can quick-review my inbound SongBox feed&quot;), you could gain the reputation of - &quot;if I receive a demo on SongBox, it means that the sender is being highly respectful of my time.&quot; You might not want to build all that social-network functionality, of course, but it&#x27;s a possible direction to go!<p>Also, custom subdomains (and beyond just removing branding, letting people add branding) could be a high-ROI way to add another pricing tier!')
