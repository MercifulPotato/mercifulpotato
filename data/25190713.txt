Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606160109, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190329, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve seen you mention marketing several times. What expenditures would you include as a marketing expense?<p>I don&#x27;t get to define that, companies do, but basically it includes everything that does not involve a lab, technician, doctor, nurse, statistician&#x2F;programmer, etc. The US and the rest of the world are quite different here - if you&#x27;ve ever watched US broadcast in the evening, you&#x27;d see TONS of ads for prescription only medicine (&quot;suffering from foo? Ask your doctor about bar&quot;); that&#x27;s marketing. Taking three hundred cardiologists on an all-expenses-paid 7-day cruise with one 30-minute &quot;purely informative lecture about our new drug&quot; and 7 days of fun? That&#x27;s marketing too. Lobbying to congress? That&#x27;s also marketing.<p>Outside of the US, the marketing budgets are smaller and less overt - but the cruise-style legal bribe-like events are prevalent everywhere.<p>&gt; Would you consider each of the excluded candidates a failure?<p>Possibly. You&#x27;ve described one style, but it&#x27;s not the only one. Many times, it&#x27;s a weird result from some other research (how Viagra was discovered, how DCA tests were started).<p>But many things are essentially complete and utter failures - you have a line of research where no viable compound was found at all. BiondVax just failed a 15-year mission trying to develop a universal flu vaccine. Remdesivir is essentially failed even though it is FDA approved (It failed for Ebola; if you look at the data critically, it failed for SARS-COV-2 -- which the WHO&#x27;s recent studies show even more clearly).<p>There is some benefit from this research - new techniques, often new devices - but the drug itself is a failure in the sense that it will not generate any income to the company.<p>Edit: just saw your earlier comment about marketing. It is those things (which you and I mentioned) and a lot more, but it is basically for the company to define in their books and a rule of the thumb would be “an expense a university department developing this to completion without expectation of profit would not have to spend”')
