There were also optional office hours, as I recall.<p>It was certainly nothing like just hanging out with colleagues in the cafe between classes, but for those (like me) who just can&#x27;t go to a school like GT in-person, I&#x27;m glad the opportunity is available even though I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably the hard-mode version of the program given the limited course catalog (not all courses are integrated into the program yet) and lack of in-person interaction.')
