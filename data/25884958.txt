If I know the exchange is going to be synchronous I can be a lot more sloppy in my formulation because I know I&#x27;ll be there to clarify ambiguities, provide missing info, etc. in real time.  If it&#x27;s going to be asynchronous I have to put a lot more effort into making sure that the inquiry is self-contained, unambiguous, etc.')
