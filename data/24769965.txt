Human nutrition is largely confused science. Industry takes advantage to make billions in profit with snake oils.<p>I am this close before calling it pseudo-science but I think it&#x27;s just the biological complexity that gets lost among nutritionists. We know so little that we shouldn&#x27;t hand out advice at all apart from &#x27;don&#x27;t drink battery fluid&#x27;. It&#x27;s hyper confusing:<p>Salt bad, salt good [1]. Coconut oil holy, coconut oil devil [2]. Fat is evil, fat is saviour from the grandmaster of hell &#x27;sugar&#x27; so it&#x27;s good again. Take your vitamins but actually don&#x27;t because compound vitamins <i>increase</i> mortality [2] but it actually doesn&#x27;t matter since uptake is shit anyway. Eat Goji berries because that&#x27;s what George Washington did to become POTUS (according to that companies marketing). Just kidding, he merely ate bread which is bad for you and just like stopping oat from taking over we need to sell you <i>actual</i> milk for your bone health that also kills you because antibiotics and cholesterol which, newsflash, has no links to heart disease [4].
