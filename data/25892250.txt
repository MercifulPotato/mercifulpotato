Is there really much of a difference between &quot;I&#x27;m not going to work on this system because it&#x27;s terrible&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m forking this system and I&#x27;m not going to support the previous version&quot;?<p>In both cases you can say &quot;well someone else will just come along and support it&quot;, and for py2 they did, for a bit. In fact I believe you can still pay if you happen to want py2 support.<p>But if you&#x27;re not paying, you&#x27;re saying &quot;hey, this thing you work on and provide to me for free - why are you working on it in the way you want rather than the way I want??&quot;')
