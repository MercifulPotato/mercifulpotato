Item(by='SkyMarshal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609907282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652595, text='<i>&gt;If he has showed you he&#x27;s interested in programming then go ahead,</i><p><i>&gt;As a counterpoint, I started programming on my own at 7 with no guidance.</i><p>To nitpick, that&#x27;s not really a counterpoint.  Parent comment already allowed for the possibility that OP&#x27;s 7yr old is independently interested in programming.  If a child develops that interest of their own volition, with no pressure or leading from the parents, then by all means support and cultivate it.  It&#x27;s only a problem when the parents try to force the child in that direction before the child has developed their own interest first.')
