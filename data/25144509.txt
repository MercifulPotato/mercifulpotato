This is different from z&#x2F;OS AT-TLS in which the OS does the TLS handshake, certificate validation, etc as well.<p>(Strictly speaking, I&#x27;m not sure if AT-TLS actually is implemented in the OS kernel – or &quot;nucleus&quot; to use the z&#x2F;OS terminology – it may actually be implemented somewhere else, say in the C library. I know some of it is actually implemented by a daemon called PAGENT. But, from the application programmers viewpoint, it is provided by the OS, however exactly the OS provides it.)')
