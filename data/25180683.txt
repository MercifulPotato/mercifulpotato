And that&#x27;s why some of them tried opening coffee shops or brewing beer or hiring consultants to help them create better merchandising to &quot;reach female buyers that like to shop&quot; and ways to spend your money with no return. Why manage one struggling business (your bike shop) when you can manage two struggling businesses (your bike shop and your coffee shop)!<p>Really, retail has largely been gamed past the point of no return. &quot;Win the Holidays&quot;, as Best Buy put it a few years ago. Consumers evangelize their hookup, not their service experience.<p>Maybe bike consumers don&#x27;t need the support and service the bike business traditionally offered. Camera stores are gone, but camera sales have never been better. Cameras are better and more accessible than ever before, too. Maybe the bike business will follow the same path. Time will tell.<p>EDIT: Funny enough, cameras are still subject to MAP and it is generally enforced fiercely.')
