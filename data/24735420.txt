There are plenty of other Lisp dialects with a faster startup time - Chez, Fennel, CL, etc. You still would want REPL-driven-workflow. Practically, it&#x27;s the other way around: Clojure&#x27;s slow startup time doesn&#x27;t matter because it&#x27;s a Lisp, and no other non-homoiconic language (except maybe Smalltalk) gives you the productivity boost that &quot;true REPL&quot; allows, no matter how fast change&#x2F;test&#x2F;debug cycle is. Because it&#x27;s not just about fast cycle, with non-homoiconic languages that do not have &quot;true REPLs&quot; you also have to think about the program&#x27;s state and other things.<p>Homoiconicity of Lisp allows you to evaluate any expression or sub-expression without any kind of ceremony. Other languages do not have the luxury of giving you the answer right away. There&#x27;s always some &quot;ritual&quot; involved, automated or not, but it is still required, but in a Lisp connected to a REPL, you immediately get the answers.')
