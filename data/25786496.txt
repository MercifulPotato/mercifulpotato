Item(by='1propionyl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610679868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25785070, text='&gt; They say younger guys have problems finding a girlfriend, because they expect her to take care of him the same way his mother did, and younger Japanese women don&#x27;t want to put up with that kind of attitude anymore.<p>This is rampantly common in (esp. Southern) Europe as well. The stereotype of the Italian or Greek &quot;mama&#x27;s boy&quot; who can&#x27;t do anything around the house and expects their SO to be their surrogate mother is very real.<p>I really don&#x27;t think you should be using this as evidence to paint Japan as developmentally retarded as compared to &quot;Western&quot; countries. Respectfully, it comes off as parochial if I&#x27;m being charitable, or as working backwards from a desired conclusion if I&#x27;m not.<p>Moreover, this is a trend that crops up all around the world, not just in Japan or Europe. There are <i>plenty</i> of people like this in the US as well. I&#x27;ve met several grown men with well paying jobs who eat out for every meal and have their mothers do their laundry every weekend.')
