Item(by='spike021', descendants=None, kids=[25907108], score=None, time=1611599734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903873, text='I&#x27;m not a huge anime person, but there&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve watched that seems a bit relevant. In _Accel World_, they wear this thing on their neck called a &quot;Neurolink&quot; and basically are able to connect to things like the Internet or private networks (school, home, hospital) wirelessly with it. I believe it takes over signals coming to and from the brain. But they also have a wired connection mode so they can do that or do a special direct, wired connection with someone they are close to.<p>The ramifications of access like that are described surprisingly well in the show.<p>For instance, two close friends (they&#x27;re in a relationship but young enough I&#x27;d just consider them close friends) use the direct wired connection feature because they feel comfortable enough doing so. But at some point one of them decides to use that private access to plant a virus of sorts. While the purpose is irrelevant here, it does show how brain connections, especially between people, can become increasingly vulnerable.<p>The main plot point of the anime though, is this game application that can be installed to the Neurolink, and basically it has the ability to also wipe away or hide memories.<p>While what Newell is talking about is still a ways away, it&#x27;s interesting to consider exactly what we may need to be worried about when the time comes.')
