All countries have discussed herd immunity at some point.<p>However, herd immunity was never the goal, as you can read from the email exchanges in the original source the article links to. It was merely a discussion about a possible side effect of the actual goals, which was to prevent a collapse of the Swedish healthcare system, and to prevent side effects that lockdowns have (because they&#x27;re not a silver bullet either).<p>Now, if they were successful is another question. I&#x27;m a Swede and I do not agree with our strategy.')
