I’ve never used the downvote on HN (unless I bumped the teeny tiny arrow accidentally on my iPad while trying to upvote), and the main reason is because receiving downvotes feels so harsh to me, and upvoting good things mostly has the same overall effect on the order of the conversation. It made me see clearly the good reasons why downvoting privileges are withheld from new accounts, that period did help me learn how to be more positive and constructive in my comments.<p>But - lately I’ve been second guessing myself and wondering whether there’s any virtue in continuing to not use this feature, which is sometimes useful. There are a minority of comments that should be downvoted and I agree with downvotes they receive even if I don’t hand any out.<p>One reason I’ve been questioning my personal policy is because I’ve recognized that - in the spirit of the article here - that downvotes on HN are given for a wide variety of legitimate reasons that don’t necessarily amount to disagreement. Sometimes comments are very off-topic, sometimes they make assumptions, sometimes they’re polite and nice but factually wrong, sometimes they’re jokes that aren’t funny. I’ve started to view downvotes as being symmetric to upvotes, and I give upvotes liberally and for a huge number of reasons. There’s nothing really wrong with downvotes being seen in the same light... other than negative feelings it might cause and the times it leads to destructive responses rather than constructive responses.<p>I’d love to hear what others thing, should I start using downvotes now, or continue to abstain?')
