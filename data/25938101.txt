Happily married with a kid and full time job. BUT I will say it became a crutch and a money sink.<p>Heading into my 40s with the plan to stop daily consumption, currently only have CBD strains in the house, my friend likes to the call it methadone for pot heads. Wish me luck.<p>The one person from our group of friends is schizophrenic and it was heavy cocaine use that seemed to have opened that pandoras box. He&#x27;s many many years sober and steady eddy on his medication doing really well.<p>Another friend is bipolar schizoaffective and his relationship with cannabis is toxic at best. He knows it&#x27;s the last thing he should be indulging in, but unfortunately in his mind he can&#x27;t find any other way to fall asleep. Heavy indica strains tend to bring on mania for him.')
