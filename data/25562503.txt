Cost of insurance? Over half that, annually.<p>How bad is your driving record, and are you getting anything beyond liability? I have paid about that much, for 2 cars, and I have a lot more than liability. Even now, for 2 cars I&#x27;m paying under $1300&#x2F;year - and have more than liability coverage. When I paid the bare minimum, for 1 car, the <i>most</i> I paid is $600&#x2F;year. Even adjusting for inflation, it would not amount to over $1000&#x2F;year today. And I paid that only for 1-2 years while building enough of a driving record. Looking at my financial records, when I had just liability on an old car, I typically paid $350&#x2F;year.<p>&gt; More expensive if you do a monthly payment plan.<p>Not all plans are like this. For the last few years I&#x27;ve been on a plan that costs the same whether I do monthly or annual. Shop around.<p>&gt; And then comes maintenance of a 30yo vehicle! Total cost of ownership was about $3k&#x2F;y<p>First, if you paid $3000 for a 30 year old car, it&#x27;s a bad deal. 2 years ago I bought a 15 year of Honda Accord for $3500, and it did not have a lot of miles. Second, if you&#x27;re paying $3000&#x2F;year for maintenance, you bought a bad car. Sell it and get a reliable car. As an example, I paid $350 this year for maintaining my car (including oil changes). I paid about $1100 last year. Looking at my prior old car, I&#x27;ve gone as low as $100&#x2F;year. In fact, looking back at almost 10 years, that $1100 was the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for maintaining an old car.<p>&gt; Even cheap cars ain&#x27;t cheap, and that&#x27;s one of many reasons that poverty is a spiral.<p>Good cheap cars are always cheaper than the alternatives. Always.')
