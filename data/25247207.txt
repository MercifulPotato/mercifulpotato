Sleeping only 6 to 7 hours is suboptimal for most people. Spending 9 hours in bed and getting 8 hours total sleep would probably be a good target (for most people). I imagine the 3-4 hours of disrupted sleep would become more efficient and shorter if you didn&#x27;t wake up in the middle from alarms and etc.<p>Also, as usual, don&#x27;t listen to random folks on the internet.')
