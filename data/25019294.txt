It was divided from the very beginning; our founding document itself was the product of a compromise between two mutually exclusive governmental ideals.<p><i>There is more in common on many points between Estonia and Ireland than between California and Arkansas.</i><p>I doubt that very much. Arkansans and Californians speak the same language, eat the same food, watch the same shows and movies, listen to the same music, learn the same history. There are ideological differences, sure, but those ideological differences are the same as you see in other countries, including Estonia and Ireland.')
