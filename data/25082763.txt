At least in the broadest of senses if nothing else. Both profess love for America!<p>Obama predates Trump as a serious political animal. And all this divisiveness predates Trump. I think Obama bears significant responsibility that Trump was even elected in the first place. I think Obama slipping in hyperbolic divisiveness here is a tiny example of exactly why Trump fans were looking for someone like him. It shows a real lack of perspective to not be able to separate political opponents from utter enemies.')
