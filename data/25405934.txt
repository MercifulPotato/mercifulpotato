Advertising as a model has forced a need for engagement, notifications, stickiness, attention grabbing.<p>I&#x27;d argue the term &#x27;pay for the services [they use]&#x27; is too vague here to be meaningful - there are too many options that would drastically change the incentives.<p>Pay per API call? APIs start to need 5 calls to get all the info you&#x27;d need for one request. Subscription model? Consumers are going to have to juggle a different account for every provider they use. Subscription to aggregator who then pays content providers based on usage? We&#x27;re back to the clickbait situation we were in in the early days of advertising and are arguable still in.<p>For me the insane thing is that there are no options. I can&#x27;t universally buy any song I want DRM free from a range of providers. I can&#x27;t pay per article for news from an RSS feed.<p>TV is an interesting one because the industry has convinced the user base to pay for content, but the subscription model is already showing some of the limitations shown above.<p>I feel like the biggest innovations in this space aren&#x27;t so much new ideas or &#x27;just convincing people to pay for things&#x27;, it&#x27;s a case of making the payments as easy and understandable as their previous counterparts.')
