It’s mainly a sentimental piece for collage days and girls you knew back in your youth who are now lost to you in time. That sounds good but Murakami’s strengths are in light surrealism, dream logic plots, some humour as well. He reminds me of William S Burroughs but without the seedy mentions of young boys with over developed buttocks. I’ve been working through his novels chronologically and hit a snag with Norwegian Wood.')
