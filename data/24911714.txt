Classic ways to build your design portfolio usually centre around small businesses, community groups, events and non-profits because they have clear needs that are easily served by design.<p>Another place where designers play is with open source&#x2F;license fonts, icons, design systems etc. which makes sense because they are designing things for their peers.')
