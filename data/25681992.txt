When you&#x27;re effectively a nation state like SK (with all due respect), it&#x27;s super easy to have conversations among all the players about linking (<i>all</i>) the traffic management systems to the modalities to the consumer experience, air or ground. Koreans are very used to multimodal transit, and have a rapid adoption rate of new technologies. If you&#x27;re comfortable creating an integrated(&quot;open&quot;) information traffic system, agree to conform to standards, things like literally leaving your car stuck in traffic to drive itself to the office and switching to an electric scooter that your car automatically booked for you just up the street from your location becomes a lot easier. A lot of the primitive to create new transit systems are there, it&#x27;s the cooperation&#x2F;integration and government will that is missing, South Korea has these in spades.')
