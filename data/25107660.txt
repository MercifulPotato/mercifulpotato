Item(by='SamBam', descendants=None, kids=[25107775], score=None, time=1605497602, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106961, text='It is definitely the Mercator projection. Here is the first frame of your video overlaid on top of a standard Mercator projection: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;4cHi6Di" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;4cHi6Di</a><p>As for whether it looks &quot;so bad,&quot; it&#x27;s hard to tell from that video, because it&#x27;s a small segment of the map, all in the northern-most latitudes.<p>The Mercator projection is very shape-conforming (except close to the poles, as you can see from the huge top of Greenland), and its size distortions depend on latitude, so locally it&#x27;s always going to be very &quot;good&quot; compared with a globe. You&#x27;re not going to see any huge &quot;errors&quot; just comparing the before-and-after shapes of Greenland (although, again, the top of Greenland is very distorted there), or comparing its size to its closest neighbors.')
