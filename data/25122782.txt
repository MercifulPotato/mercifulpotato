As the OP states, Apple merely postponed the IDFA functionality.<p>I cannot prove it, but this whole piece reeks of being algorithmically generated, and I do believe that this factual error is proof of that. Any human journalist operating in the field of technology would be well aware that iOS14 has already been released and would have phrased accordingly; I think that what weâ€™re seeing here is some algorithmic synthesis of background facts (one of which was apparently source of confusion, because of references to iOS14 and postponement, not of the whole OS but of a relevant portion thereof).')
