Is it the exact same RNA as in the coronavirus or is it artificially generated by them? Does it do the exact same thing that the RNA in coronavirus does and is the spike protein the exact same spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus or is it different (even if subtly so?)<p>Can anything go wrong at any point in this process (can the body misuse the RNA, or the spike protein, or anything else) and if so what?<p>*edited')
