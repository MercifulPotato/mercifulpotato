We live on the outskirts of Munich and it still works fine. Suburbs of Munich you can still get by without a car easily enough.<p>Hell, even little Bavarian towns that I&#x27;ve visited, you don&#x27;t really <i>need</i> a car, the way you do in the states. Somewhere like Lenggries or Bad Toelz, you can absolutely get around walking and biking, it&#x27;s safe and pleasant and convenient in-town, even though these are nowhere close to big cities (IIRC Lenggries is like 10k people). Now, visiting any other city using buses&#x2F;trains out there far, that&#x27;s a pain, so you probably want a car, but you don&#x27;t absolutely need one for daily life.<p>Compare that to living in the south SF bay area, which has a sizable population, but getting by without a car is nevertheless a nightmare. Biking is dangerous -- the year before I moved, I got hit twice by cars, including once with my son on it -- there&#x27;s almost nothing within walking distance (and it&#x27;s highly unpleasant to boot) and public transit is sparse and slow.<p>Anyway, I can&#x27;t speak for Poland, but just about everywhere I&#x27;ve visited in Europe, compared to the US the necessity for a car is very drastically reduced. Even the places where you want a car for some trips, you often don&#x27;t really need them for daily basic errands.')
