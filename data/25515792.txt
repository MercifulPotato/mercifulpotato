But I am a bit disappointed they didn&#x27;t go further, I would have at least liked to see extensible variants. The tuple-based syntax, also makes it rather noisy to use anonymous records as arguments (e.g. for named parameters).<p>If I was designing a new modern language, I would make the default types structural records and variants and use a single &quot;new type&quot; form for creating nominal types, when necessary. Compositional datatypes are much easier to achieve with structural records&#x2F;variants (e.g. define a new enum set based on another). It is also trivial to make a structural type nominal, but not to go the other way. But having structural records as something special alongside nominal ADTs (like Flix, Elm and Purescript), does not exploit the duality and does not give a modern rethink that IMHO is needed.')
