The &quot;bootstrap&quot; stage which is best to be in C (for the targets which don&#x27;t have LLVM) will be just the output of the compiler compiling itself to C, and that will be regularly produced and pushed as the compiler grows? And that&#x27;s one of the steps to make it LLVM independent?<p>P.S. Amazing work up to now! Kudos! I&#x27;m a fan just for everything it does what other language designers ignore, like designing the language to both compile and link fast. Cross compiling always available is a masterpiece. I guess that feature wouldn&#x27;t have to be present on the platforms which don&#x27;t have LLVM, if the language is to work on such too?')
