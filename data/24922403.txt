Maybe they don&#x27;t consider it to be full hands off and thus have made this statement? It could center itself and drive within the same lane in a highway going around 100-120km&#x2F;h without any involvement from me. It also nudged me to the lane whenever I tried to change lanes without using the blinker.')
