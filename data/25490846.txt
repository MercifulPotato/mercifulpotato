When dogs play with each other, they mostly wrestle or chase. It&#x27;s hopefully in a non-violent context at the dog park, but it exercises the same muscles and reflexes that dogs would need for real fighting. It&#x27;s been cool seeing my dog grow up and get better at skills like catching a ball in midair (chasing prey).<p>Even human play mimics skills needed for survival, we just need more complicated skills, like war strategy and creativity. Just think about sports, board games, and so on.')
