Then you&#x27;d have DigDug. On the other hand, this isn&#x27;t really dig-but-in-rust, so I suppose there is no real reason to relate it.<p>It does look neat when comparing it to the classic output you have in some other tools; not always the easiest to spot the records in then a lot of debug information that looks the same as &#x27;output&#x27; information is often stacked on top of each other making it less readable and even without the colouring this looks like a better fit if you simply want to look at some records.')
