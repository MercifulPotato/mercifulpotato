Item(by='roca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605648534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25126122, text='Your three sources in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25119518" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25119518</a> do not seem to mention compliance at all. They are all arguing that the restrictions requested by the Swedish government were too weak, which I absolutely agree with.<p>Can you quote sources saying compliance with the government&#x27;s requests was low? Because I see, for example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.eu&#x2F;article&#x2F;sweden-coronavirus-lessons&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.eu&#x2F;article&#x2F;sweden-coronavirus-lessons&#x2F;</a>:<p>&gt; 93 percent of the population say they are following social-distancing recommendations.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.government.se&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;social-distancing-and-markedly-reduced-travel-in-sweden&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.government.se&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;social-distancing...</a>:<p>&gt; Swedes are largely following the advice and recommendations issued by the Public Health Agency of Sweden.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-53498133" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-53498133</a>:<p>&gt; a survey released this week by Sweden&#x27;s Civil Contingencies Agency suggests 87% of the population are continuing to follow social distancing recommendations to the same extent as they were one or two weeks earlier, up from 82% a month ago.<p>[It does also say &quot;there have been reports of large gatherings and mingling in some tourist hotspots since domestic travel restrictions were relaxed last month&quot; but that is anecdotal.]<p>Reports like these formed my view that compliance with the (inadequate!!!) Swedish government restrictions has been high (though I have also read reports of decreasing compliance lately, consistent with trends in other countries). Perhaps these reports were never accurate but I&#x27;d want to see sources saying so.')
