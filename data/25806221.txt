If a company runs their own DoH or even regular DNS or AD resolvers, then the company&#x27;s client computers (the laptops their employees take home) should not be querying any old resolver hard-coded in their web browser (Firefox, CloudFlare) for internal company domain addresses.  That&#x27;s literally all this is saying.  It&#x27;s good corporate IT policy anyway and it&#x27;s only being reiterated with DoH.')
