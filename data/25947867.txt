Market making activities create billions in profits. But we are seeing the flaw in the market making algorithms.<p>Do we <i>need</i> market makers to let us always take a position in every single option when no real market for that option exists? I would argue no. It&#x27;s completely artificial and they profit from it. If companies want to be market makers and profit from every single transaction, they need to be prepared to take a loss when the math doesn&#x27;t swing their way.')
