If you reduce the average speed of a section of road, say for example in heavy rain, the capacity or throughput of that section of road is reduced since less vehicles can pass through in the same time.<p>If you can keep drivers attentive enough to maintain safe distance between vehicles, you can increase the speed of a section of road.<p>&gt;&gt; Once you hit the peak for that road section<p>You can increase the practical peak in an imperfect world by increasing attentiveness of drivers.<p>For example, you could defer the onset of gridlock by X minutes by making more efficient use of the available road space. In some cases it will be possible to increase X such that gridlock is never encountered for the same traffic volume.<p>&gt;&gt; Some roads are exceptionally safe at low speeds<p>And yet the focus on speed means that roads which are not exceptionally safe at low speed have reduced incentive to be improved. Why improve a road (hard in some cases) when the impact is not measurable and speed is an easy band aid.<p>Better to pretend the immeasurable doesnâ€™t exist and simply focus on speed. Even if other approaches could have a greater impact on road safety.')
