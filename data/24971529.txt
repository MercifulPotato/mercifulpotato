Unless you live in a very flat area, being too far from civilization to get wired internet significantly correlates with being too far to get good cell reception.<p>I recently moved out of the bay area to a my house in relatively rural Oregon. I can&#x27;t actually work from home though, I had to rent a second house in a nearby town because the best internet connection I can get at my actual house is GEO satellite internet which is far from suitable for work.<p>I&#x27;m only 7 miles down the road from a town of 700, and only ~30 miles from a city of ~20,000, yet I have 0 options for wired internet and 0 cell reception from any provider at home.')
