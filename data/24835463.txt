This Pentium can do it too, granted with more colors and a CD ROM drive and a fancy &quot;where do you want to go today&quot; movie, but does that warrant all this hype of being called &quot;multimedia&quot;?<p>Oh well, that was the 90s, things moved so fast then so of course things would sound outdated and cheesy very fast.')
