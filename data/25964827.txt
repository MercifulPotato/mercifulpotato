I bought a copy when it appeared on one of Bill Gate&#x27;s summer reading lists.  It&#x27;s a great book.  The story of the Piggly Wiggly stock corner is great, as is the story of the creation of the Xerox machine.  I think I lent my copy to a co-worker who I&#x27;m fairly certain never read it.  They also never gave it back.  Oh well.<p>For anyone looking for a book in a similar vein I recommend &quot;The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed&quot; by John McPhee.')
