I&#x27;m also not as isolationist as ron paul the same way a spotlight is not as bright as the sun.<p>There is nuance here though.<p>If I tweet that the sky is purple, then maybe Twitter puts a fact check on that noting that I haven&#x27;t presented any evidence of the sky being purple, and the general consensus is that the sky is, in fact, blue.<p>Sure, whatever.<p>If in a forum other than Twitter I incite a riot over the sky being purple[1], then any future tweets I make about the color of the sky should be taken in that context and are arguably no longer peaceful.<p>1: I honestly haven&#x27;t heard the full Trump speech on Wednesday, so I&#x27;m not going to say if Trump is or is not guilty of inciting to riot.  TFA claims that because the tweets were peaceful, they should not be removed from twitter; my comment here is a rebuttal of that claim.')
