The sheer number of individuals here who presume scientists are idiots, that the decisions they make are dumb or ill- motivated demonstrates the sheer hubris and lack of humility of a large portion of HN commenters.<p>I guarantee you that scientists are as smart and capable as the best of the non-scientist HN population, and were the story roles reversed, that scientists on the whole would be more humble about the limits of their knowledge about programming practice and design, etc. They would not revel in the &quot;idiocy&quot; of your bugs, security lapses, or petty spy-based mobile apps. Well maybe the last.<p>Have some humility.  Stop building up fragile egos by tearing others down, pretending that you wouldn&#x27;t make similar &quot;mistakes&quot; or produce designs with similar weaknesses or limits.\nEdit 1:Yes I&#x27;ll defend my tribe.
