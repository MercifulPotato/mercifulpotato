Within the scope of TFA’s definition, a language (or more precisely, <i>an implementation</i>) absolutely can be portable. Any implementation that can bundle all dependencies (including the runtime) into a single artifact can said to be portable per TFA’s definition of the term. Python could even be portable in this sense if it could zip up the interpreter, libraries, and all so files (however, these bundles would be hundreds of megabytes compressed in practice).')
