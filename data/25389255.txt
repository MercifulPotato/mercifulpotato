It&#x27;s just a good bit of marketing.<p>Rolls Royce is a luxury company. Rolex is a luxury company. Apple sells a product that&#x27;s in the pocket of every other snot-nosed preteen.<p>However, they charge a larger-than-normal markup, so people feel like it&#x27;s luxurious.<p>EDIT: There seems to be some misunderstandings of what a &quot;luxury&quot; good is. Something isn&#x27;t luxurious just because it is subjectively a little bit better than the competition. Bosch makes the best dishwashers but they are not a luxury brand. Similarly, the Golf GTI is an absolutely incredible $30K car, but that does not make it luxurious.<p>A Rolls Royce is a luxury car because it is full of extravagance and opulence. There is absolutely no concern with keeping costs down, and there is no expense spared to make the car as comfortable and luxurious as possible. It also fits the economic definition[1] where spending on luxury cars increases with income. The richer you are, the more money you spend on luxury cars. This isn&#x27;t true of Apple products because it is a mass produced, mass market good. A billionaire can&#x27;t buy a better iPhone. That&#x27;s the opposite of what it means to be a luxury, exclusive brand.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Luxury_goods" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Luxury_goods</a>')
