I just switched back to Kubuntu from MacOS and Windows 10. The only app I really need that I can&#x27;t run on Linux is Xcode for building iOS apps. I can&#x27;t really think of one hardware feature that doesn&#x27;t work better under Kubuntu than Windows or MacOS: printer works, bluetooth works way better, multiple displays work, sleep&#x2F;suspend works, sound works better, USB works better  (Linux will mount and connect to stuff that Windows and MacOS won&#x27;t) and that&#x27;s before we even talk battery. The biggest surprise is that I&#x27;m getting 4-5 hours of battery with Kubuntu out of a Dell XPS-15 (i7 w&#x2F; Radeon graphics and 4k display) when Windows would kill the rather large battery in about 35 minutes. Honestly, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised, and I have to go do command line config stuff about as often as I did on the Mac.')
