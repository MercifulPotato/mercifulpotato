Bike lanes are built to kick cyclists off the roads that motorist believe belong to them. It is very ironic that because of the pandemic so many defenders of bike lanes are coming out like mushrooms. I find it ironic, because to me, the pandemic has shown precisely that there is no need at all for bike specific infrastructure. In Madrid, the city where I live, during the worst months of the pandemic, I would go out with my bike and there would be a ratio of like 20 bikes to 1 car. The cyclists that I saw used the traffic lanes as they needed. It was quite something. You would think that proponents of bike lanes would have to shut up. But no, now they say that bike lanes are the solution to the pandemic!')
