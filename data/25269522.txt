But I’d much rather have a robot do the automated landing for me. Cold. Calculated. Reliable. Fearless. Every time.<p>In a way, you can say that, NASA “had” to send a man to the moon, because they couldn’t build the computers, electronics, and software in the 1960s, to automatically land the machine itself.<p>NASA and the Soviets did send robotic probes to the moon, but they were on a ballistic trajectory. Basically, it was a controlled crash landing. The probes could’ve landed on a boulder and tumbled over. I’m surprised it didn’t.<p>Neil Armstrong had to take over the robotic controls from the lander, and go into manual mode, because the lander was about to land on a boulder, and topple over.<p>The Chinese probes here, did an initial ground survey first, before finding a safe landing spot. Granted, they had the benefit of 40 years of additional advancements in technology.<p>Next up: Mars, then Europa.<p>Looking forward to them releasing the full HD videos of the landing sequence, that they need to download from the lander itself. It seems the transmitted images from the lander, were sampling progress shots. It seems there isn’t enough bandwidth to do a full HD transmission of the live landing.<p>And it would also be nice if America can put aside its political differences, and work together with China, like they did with the Soviets. But I don’t see this happening in my lifetime.')
