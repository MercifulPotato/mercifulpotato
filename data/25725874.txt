First because Google certainly knows which applications they removed from their store for malware reasons, but even so, I would expect Google Play Protect to at least flag any app it finds on my phone that is not on their store. Such an app is not necessarily malware, but it should certainly be flagged.<p>Google Play Protect could also do some behavior profiling to analyze what apps are doing in the background. A service launching recurring VIEW intents on web sites in the background should have raised a flag to the system.&quot;<p>Sounds good.<p>I sense that there so many teams involved such a feature is not on their radar. So &quot;they already know they blocked it&quot; and &quot;the existing installed app should be blocked&quot; imply that two teams know what the others are doing.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that the team that does the removal from the store has no communications path to those who would add a flagging mechanism for already installed apps.')
