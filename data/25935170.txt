Could a wealthy hedge fund not simply have made the same bet as the million strong WSB army, but even more pronounced? Why isn&#x27;t a Carl Icahn short squeezing these guys if it&#x27;s so easy and obvious? Simply buying calls and buying stocks and forcing a short squeeze, could a bigger established fund have made this bet?<p>I think the general answer would be no, because at the end this fund would be a bagholder of $350 stock that&#x27;s worth about $30, and when trying to get rid of it the price would crash down.<p>My question then is, how are we somehow thinking that WSB doesn&#x27;t have the same problem? The only issue is that the bagholders will be retail. It&#x27;s being played off like some giant win to WSB. When really, those who have closed their positions have won, probably a select few. There&#x27;s probably a lot more that are bagholders who&#x27;re yet to feel the pain, which inevitably comes as everyone agrees that outside of the temporary short squeeze, this stock is not worth much more than $30.')
