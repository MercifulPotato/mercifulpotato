Alibaba, and 1688 had an even more dramatic loss of quality, and vendor oversight.<p>P.S. People talk about party affiliation of Ma from him joining the part to be allowed to teach in eighties, while forgetting that Tsai does not even hide his affiliation with the United Front (an organisation for CPC&#x27;s version of &quot;useful idiots,)&quot; and is a much more outspoken political player, and party appologist.')
