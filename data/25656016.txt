Obviously you&#x27;ll need to renovate parts of your house over time, but as I summarize it to my friends, I care most about the parts of the renovation I you won&#x27;t be able to see. How is the paint job behind the wall-mounted heater? Did they clear up rubble in that space under you kitchen? Did they tile over your old tiles (usually easy to see) and do you now have small spaces between the tiles where water can collect over time?')
