I had previously tried reading PDFs and technical documents on my Kindle but it was pointless since it was so small. The Note 2 is just a little smaller than regular letter size paper and it runs a full Android operating system so it&#x27;s easy to get whatever document management system you want to use working on it (including the Kindle app).')
