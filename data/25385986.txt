People convince themselves that things they heard about from the news or other people actually happened to them or their friends. Maybe it starts out as a simple story told at a gathering, exaggerating for entertainment &amp; abridging context for simplicity - &quot;one time my friend...&quot; - but after repetition and several years becomes a thing they believe literally happened as they told it. You often see this manifesting as tales of local criminal acts or encounters with homeless people. This sincere fabricational tendency, while humorous, does ultimately amplify a very skewed &amp; harmful perspective in local politics.<p>It&#x27;s the reason why boomers swear they were present at every major event during their lifetimes, as though we&#x27;re surrounded by Forrest Gumps.')
