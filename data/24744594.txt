The lack of free will doesn&#x27;t stop you from doing anything or being anything you want. What you want (ie, will) may or may not be predetermined, but it feels remarkably like it isn&#x27;t, and for all intents and purposes of living, it isn&#x27;t predetermined.<p>If free will doesn&#x27;t exist, so what? It still doesn&#x27;t change anything when it comes to living day to day. Perhaps the only thing it would impact is ethics and morality, but even then, it&#x27;s a far stretch to say you don&#x27;t have a choice in doing the &quot;wrong thing&quot; and the &quot;right thing&quot; because you obviously do. The thing it might teach us, is that it&#x27;s even more important to make sure we teach &quot;the right thing&quot; to our children and students. To make sure we predispose them to doing the &quot;right thing&quot; when a decision is presented, and not the &quot;wrong thing.&quot; Shouldn&#x27;t we be doing that anyway?')
