The intergenerational transmission of this skill somehow diminished over the last decades. In contrast, in the poorest part of the world, pretty much everyone cooks at home, it would be unaffordable to live on processed foods only.<p>But oh God, so many Westerners are absolutely clueless in the kitchen. I am not sure whether this is caused by not having enough time, by successful advertising from processed food producers or from a cultural stigma that cooking is somehow backward and a kind of self-oppression. But cooking is dying out, for the first time in human history.')
