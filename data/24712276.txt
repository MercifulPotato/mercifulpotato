E.g. if it&#x27;s known that a transmission of a particular chunk of a stream failed, the next transmission can capture that chunks plus additional data from that stream instead of just blindly retransmitting a full datagram.<p>Besides that the crypto and handshake parts also need streams with guaranteed delivery and ordering, since they carry TLS stream data.')
