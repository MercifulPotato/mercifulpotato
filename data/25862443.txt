I am not someone who is trained to appreciate art, but I find it relaxing to take a break from coding to look at landscape paintings from time to time.<p>I should also plug Google&#x27;s Arts &amp; Culture Chrome extension. It can show you a new piece of artwork on the &quot;new tab&quot; splash page, rotating either every 24 hours or every tab. It&#x27;s been a great way for me to get exposed to artwork and artists that I may not have found otherwise. My only complaint is that the set of works is somewhat small and after a year of use (with 24 hour rotations) you will start to notice repeats.')
