No reason to compete if there&#x27;s no economic reason to compete. They are qualitative, reasonably priced and tend to have good reviews.<p>Sadly the Fernuni is in one way stuck in the past: for many (all?) courses there are mandatory presence seminars. You can do the exams at many places in Germany (e.g. Volkshochschulen) and at all embassies and Goethe institutes abroad, but for the seminars you have to still go in person it seems.
