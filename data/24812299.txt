Other civilizations ranging from the maya to the khmer were also included.  By necessity, none of them are examined in depth but they all got at least a few pages.<p>The simple fact is that pre-industrial history has had literally thousands of different thriving civilizations around the world.  It&#x27;s simply not possible to even briefly cover anything but a fraction of the more &quot;important&quot; in a non-university setting.')
