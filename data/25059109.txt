A chart like this used to be called something like ‘tools to monitor and understand postgres’. \nObservability is the ability to derive the internal state of a system from the outside. Usually done through traces.<p>It would be great if Postgres could emit a trace per query, showing in real-time which internal components were hit by this query. A sort of continuous query explain service.<p>Combine these traces to database clients and other front end services and you’ll be able to point to the front end service version which causes cache misses deep inside postgres.')
