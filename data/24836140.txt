Trademarks allow a legitimate company to protect their customers from scammers and other kind dodgy behaviour. If you have a popular brand like theirs you have to use external services that are setup to help you protect the brand and, guess what, mistakes happen.\nA number of fan websites can end up being targeted because they might be a bit too &quot;naughty&quot; in the way they use the brand for SEO.
