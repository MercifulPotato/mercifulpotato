Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=[25026397], score=None, time=1604849199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025940, text='The #1 job of any manager (and employee), <i>as far as the company is concerned</i>, is to represent&#x2F;forward the goals of the corporation.<p>&quot;forward the goals of the corporation&quot; can mean a lot of things. As any parent knows, it&#x27;s dangerous to let kids have everything the want. Same with pets. If you let your dog eat all your chocolate chip cookies, I hope you have an animal emergency room nearby. Same with a corporation.<p>In one or two cases, I deliberately took a risk, and disobeyed orders&#x2F;policies, because I <i>knew</i> that they would be eating chocolate chip cookies. That&#x27;s a big risk, because there&#x27;s usually quite a bit more behind policies and orders than an individual can see, and what I did could have been destructive. I am happy to report that these were <i>not</i> destructive, but it isn&#x27;t a practice that I can recommend.<p>But &quot;forward the goals of the corporation&quot; can also be in direct conflict with the goals of the employee, which, if they are healthy, may start with things like &quot;my kids, my spouse, etc.&quot; Balance needs to be had, and it&#x27;s a mistake to look to a corporation to provide that balance.<p>Usually, the best source of balance is the direct-report manager. They need to be &quot;in tune&quot; with their employees, and be able to negotiate the competing priorities.<p>In any case, a manager that puts their own, personal goals ahead of those of the corporation, <i>and of their employees</i> is (IMNSHO) negligent in their duties. I was a manager for 25 years. I think I did a decent job of it, and I kept senior-level employees for decades (not an exaggeration -when they finally wound up my team, after 27 years, the employee with the <i>least</i> tenure had ten years).<p>My experience, is that whenever I have discussed my philosophies and methodology, I&#x27;m attacked for either being a &quot;wimp&quot; (other managers), or being &quot;two-faced&quot; (other employees). None of these attacks have come from people that have actually worked with&#x2F;for me.<p>When I became a manager, I assumed a different role. I had to make the commitment to put aside my personal aspirations, in favor of those of the corporation, then my employees. My own goals came behind those.<p>But that was just my experience. YMMV.')
