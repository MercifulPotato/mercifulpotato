I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to think of it, I&#x27;d have to do some in-depth study to really have an informed opinion and chances are the effectiveness depends on the country as well; I&#x27;m not sure if generalizing &quot;all sanctions are {good,bad}&quot; across all countries is a good idea, as North-Korea is not the same as Iran.
