I am a Christian from Kerala ( a Southern state). On most North Indian encounters, after a while, I start getting quizzed on what my ancestor&#x27;s caste was. I eventually have to reveal that I have no clue, but we are General Category (not eligible for affirmative action - or reservation) and that sort of ends it usually. If they do not probe, may be they have already made up their mind, and have imagined the worst.<p>(I am not calling out North Indians. Keralites can make out my caste&#x2F;denomination from my name)')
