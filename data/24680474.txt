I&#x27;m 20 years into a career that many would find enviable except strangely devoid of any tenures longer than about 30 months, because that&#x27;s the longest I&#x27;ve been able to surf my bipolar swings before imploding. Those meltdowns traditionally resulted in me running away from work to fall into a boozy depressive mess for six months, them returning once the mania kicked in again.<p>This year, a low coincided with the onset of COVID lockdown and I put myself in the hospital. Not checked myself in: I tried to hurt myself badly enough to be in the ER, ICU, and then inpatient psych care.<p>Even there, I was the &quot;eloquent, self-reflective&quot; model patient, much like I&#x27;ve been (in the manic times) the persuasive, thoughtful, creative employee that people couldn&#x27;t wait to hire and promote.<p>After a couple of months of medical leave I went back to my previous job instead of quitting. It was driven largely by financial insecurity, as I had burned through my savings after not working at all in 2019...once again, due to being in a low phase _and_ getting sober and having no bandwidth left for anything else.<p>Being back to work at a place that has seen me swing from &quot;A+ performer, definite strong leadership&#x2F;promotion track, etc.&quot; to &quot;can I keep a job, any job here? Ideally one that won&#x27;t demand more than 40 hours a week of my time?&quot; is far harder than jumping into an impossible workload while manic. Grinding out yet another week full of stand-ups and PRs when I have zero confidence is gut-wrenching, and on top of it all I have to be there and stable and not a depressive mess for my family, because I can&#x27;t let them take care of me while the world outside is on fire.<p>All I want to do is get on my bike and ride for six hours a day, then cook dinner for my family, then do a little programming and writing before I go to bed. Literally, that&#x27;s it.<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not a lifestyle I can sustain, even if I suspect it might be the thing that would keep me alive past 40. So it&#x27;s back to work, taking my meds every day, and lying through my teeth when folks ask how I&#x27;m doing.')
