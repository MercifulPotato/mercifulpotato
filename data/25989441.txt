Can this project <i>really</i> afford to start slicing off additional portions of its userbase? I agree that multilingual blind users are in the minority, but those users are probably the most likely of anyone to be interested in a text-only web.<p>And even ignoring blind users, it&#x27;s just... what&#x27;s the point of any of this if Gemini is not going to be semantic? It&#x27;s like religiously adhering to the GNU principles of always printing human-readable text on the command line, and then not shipping a shell with a pipe command or any text parsing capabilities. From just about any perspective, whether you&#x27;re worried about accessibility, or parsing, or search -- it&#x27;s useful to know what language a document&#x2F;section is in.<p>One of the few advantages of having a limited, well-defined, non-extensible spec is that it&#x27;s easy to work with and write parsers around. And immediately Gemini is just saying, &quot;filtering sections by language? Good text-to-speech support? No need for that.&quot;<p>If nothing else, Gemini is theoretically built specifically for generality[0], and it&#x27;s already guaranteeing out of the box that it can&#x27;t be used well with voice assistants. Those things aren&#x27;t a fad, a general-purpose document format kind of needs to support them. And trying to have a voice assistant that intuits the current language is just a really bad system for everyone.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html</a>')
