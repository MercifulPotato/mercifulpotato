Who doesn&#x27;t miss MagSafe?<p>I don&#x27;t miss MagSafe 2. The laptops had gotten light enough that the selling point (would come detached if someone snagged the cord) meant that the magnet had to be weakened. The cord constantly came undone.<p>Bits attracted by the magnet would be lodged in the port sometimes, interfering with the charging in odd ways as well.<p>I had a lot of Magsafe 1 chargers, which compounded the frustration. I had to use a little magnetic dongle.<p>The cord was attached to the brick directly, so when it frayed (not if, when) you were out $100. Your brick was now a brick.<p>It was a big charger I couldn&#x27;t use to charge anything else I travelled with (phone, ipad, headphones, etc), _and_ there were zero third party accessories (battery packs, etc) that worked with it because it was proprietary&#x2F;patent protected.<p>If laptops have enough power to go 12+ hours on a single charge, the value of magsafe goes way down. I&#x27;m not operating the thing on a kitchen table with a cord draped down and across the room to the wall. I am charging it overnight.<p>Not to mention, there&#x27;s a huge benefit of sitting down at a desk and having a single USB-C&#x2F;TB cable to plug in to get connected to everything, including power.<p>If the choice was magsafe or USB-C charging, I&#x27;d pay extra for USB-C.')
