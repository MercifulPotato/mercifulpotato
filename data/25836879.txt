I think class differences are an underappreciated source of conflict in our world today and there are inequities that we should be working hard to correct.<p>That said, my point was we need not abolish all the many ways that people differentiate themselves in order to have (more) universal cooperation: involving mostly everyone and mostly everywhere, not necessarily on everything. And we need higher levels of cooperation to address the biggest challenges humanity faces.<p>&gt; That adds a significant level of complexity.<p>Any system that aspires to unify a wide swath of humanity with all it&#x27;s diversity and frailties will be tautologically complex.')
