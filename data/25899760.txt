COVID-19 will be with us forever [1], which means that governments can forever point to it as a reason to push for increasingly oppressive restrictions.  The economic meltdown resulting from these restrictions is pushing even the most capitalist countries much further onto the socialism spectrum than anyone could have imagined just a year ago. Some political parties view that as a positive outcome, regardless of how it was achieved.<p>So as long as COVID can be used as a way to achieve long-standing political goals, there will be absolutely no political will to relax the restrictions, even as infection rates start to fall as a result of vaccinations.  It will take serious pushback by the populace - people making it clear that incumbent politicians will lose their next elections unless restrictions are relaxed - to return to any sense of normalcy in a reasonable period of time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;covid-19-will-likely-be-with-us-forever-heres-how-well-live-with-it&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;covid-19-...</a>')
