If you can afford to make one single threaded pass over the CSV data, then future operations truly do become embarrassingly parallel. It&#x27;s a simple low-tech solution, although the UX is worse because you need to take a manual step.<p>As for zero copy, could you say where you saw that? I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to describe xsv that way. The csv parser does have a lower level zero <i>allocation</i> API, but there is no zero copy API.')
