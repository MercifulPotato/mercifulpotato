(1) the cost of doing the minimization itself (2) the cost of runtime or compile time differences if any. Also one needs to keep in mind, that less code does not mean easier to maintain either.<p>Perhaps the amount of code is the wrong metric to optimize. Perhaps it is readability, simplicity, maintainability that we really want and those are harder to put into numbers than LOC.')
