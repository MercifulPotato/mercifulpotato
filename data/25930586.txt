It simply counts the number of people who earn below a certain income. So people dipping $1 below the line are counted the same as those dipping $10,000 below the line. So, poverty-rate alleviation measures can be implemented simply by focusing on the top end of those under the limit - of course, this doesn&#x27;t help much. What we should really worry about is the poverty gap - the amount of income people need to get people above the poverty line.')
