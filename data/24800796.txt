Item(by='Siira', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1602856224, title='Ask HN: A CLI alternative for mobile scanner apps?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have been looking for a CLI alternative to apps like CanScanner, Scannable, Office Lens, etc. I have taken a look at ocrmypdf, unpaper, http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fmwconcepts.com&#x2F;imagemagick&#x2F;textcleaner&#x2F;index.php, scantailor. None of these seem even close to the commercial apps (which just take your colored photo of the document, auto-straighten it, deskew it, crop it, and enhance it). Does anyone know of a solution?')
