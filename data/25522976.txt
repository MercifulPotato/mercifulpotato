Selfish people should listen to advice to be more selfless, selfless people should listen to advice to be more selfish. This applies to many things. Whenever you receive advice, consider its opposite as well. You might be filtering out the advice you need most.<p>I think of this with parenting books.  The parents who tend to be strict read the books telling them to be strict, because those are the books that resonate with them.  But what they <i>need</i> are the books telling them to love more and be harsh less.  And those who tend to be lenient need the books that tell them that kids actually do need discipline, but they tend to read the books that tell them that kids really need to be given room to do their own thing.')
