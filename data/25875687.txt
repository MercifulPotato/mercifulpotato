It&#x27;s my opinion that minorities deserve a place at the table.<p>Do you think we didn&#x27;t have that? It took a LOT of protesting and lobbying and effort to get changes made in the US, more than in many other nations which, say, <i>didn&#x27;t</i> need civil wars to end slavery.<p>We had to change the majority to get those things, and while it&#x27;s sad that the majority didn&#x27;t move faster (and that&#x27;s a <i>different</i> problem), now we have problems created by groups that can&#x27;t even command a majority of the population being able to set policy.')
