I approximately never go near it or think about it, but the only times I do when I have to check something or connect&#x2F;disconnect something, I&#x27;m annoyed by how it&#x27;s designed to stand up precariously, and does so poorly because it&#x27;s too flimsy cheap and plasticky.<p>This reminds me of the &quot;I&#x27;m clever because I see the lottery is a tax on fools&quot; sayings. Well, gambling is fun and mass is useful and stable clocks don&#x27;t get knocked over when you dust the bedside table in their vicinity.')
