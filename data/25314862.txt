I’ve always been concerned about this as a downside of the “this is a super terrible disease” messaging - there’s a huge range of outcomes where the disease spread is merely mitigated rather than halted, and we’ve trained a lot of high-conscientiousness people to not accept that as a success. When I see experts talking about how they won’t ever go back to normal, I’m concerned about how much of the population will get stuck in that rut with them.')
