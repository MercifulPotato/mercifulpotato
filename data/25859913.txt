Most states forbid smoking in bars&#x2F;restaurants, because it creates a public health hazard for others.  Similarly, lack of vaccination causes a public health hazard for others.  As to where to draw the line, I would say when it starts adversely affecting the health and safety of workers.  Requiring workers to work in a smoke-filled environment is damaging to health, and may not be a condition of employment.  Requiring workers to be vaccinated is not damaging to health, and is in fact beneficial to health, and therefore may be a condition of employment.')
