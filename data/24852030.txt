The notes on the piano, the parser, on GraphViz and on React all hit very close if not exactly things I&#x27;ve thought about or programmed.<p>Second, the means of presenting things is awesome too. I get lost very easily so there are probably ways to improve but this is very clever and interesting. The creativity and pedagogy here is incredible at all levels.<p>I am very impressed.<p>I need to keep an eye on this. I wish there was an RSS feed. I&#x27;ll contact him.')
