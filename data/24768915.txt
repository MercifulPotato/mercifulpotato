Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602615525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768789, text='I have a long history of doing &quot;community development&quot; type work both online and off. And that includes being lead mod for an organization trying to make the transition to registered non-profit and volunteer work of various sorts over the years and so forth.<p>It&#x27;s actually hard to communicate what I do. I&#x27;m sort of like the &quot;mortar&quot; person described in this article about trying to convey your job title: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bradfrost.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;job-title-its-complicated&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bradfrost.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;job-title-its-complicated&#x2F;</a><p>I do a variety of things and I know something about design and I know something about economic development and I know something about community building (the social fabric part of that) of various sorts and so forth. It&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s partly that community development work tends to suffer from this problem that outsiders have no idea what &quot;planning&quot; (or &quot;development&quot;) is and so forth and it&#x27;s partly that I&#x27;m kind of a Jill of All Trades and I never quite know how to tell people what I do.<p>Thank you for that suggestion in your second paragraph. I have no idea how to do that, but that&#x27;s terrific feedback and a great idea.<p>I&#x27;m currently short of sleep, but will try to make those changes at some point (hopefully soon-ish). That looks like a huge improvement to what I did and I will think some more on what I did there and how that got misinterpreted by you and how I can make it better.')
