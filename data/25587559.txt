He&#x27;s not saying that there&#x27;s requirement for a soul or anything, but that a digital computer and a biological system are not necessary equivalent. That is, not everything is &#x27;computational&#x27; simply because people keep saying that it is.<p>He demonstrates this by showing the difference between semantics and syntax. A pocket calculator can solve mathematical equations, but the calculator does not understand them, it is simply manipulating strings. It could be playing chess or poker or anything else, it cannot and does not distinguish what it&#x27;s meaning or intent is.<p>Searle points out that biological systems go far beyond this, we have an actual conceptual understanding of the world which we express in syntax, but we also have an underlying model, and understanding of what it is we&#x27;re expressing.<p>And the important thing to notice here that it&#x27;s not Searle who appeals to a &#x27;soul&#x27; (he is simply taking the very materialist viewpoint that brains and computers are not the same thing), but it&#x27;s the &quot;everything is computational&quot; crowd who have almost supernatural belief in some higher realm of mathematics that is completely decoupled from physics or biology.')
