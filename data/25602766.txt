But the incentive must have come from your side, and the guy must not have used the name of the restaurant to advertise for his services or even pretend to be a &quot;part&quot; of the restaurant.<p>Legislation often is widely different for the same eventual business act, depending on how the parties came together. It&#x27;s not new stuff, real estate agents have had such huge difference for ages (at least in Germany, but I assume that other countries also differentiate depending on who initially hired an agent, even though eventually, the agent ends up having contracts with the selling and buying party).')
