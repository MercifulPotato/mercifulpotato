(Apple proprietary firmware is a big question and so are the various drivers obviously). This is why ARM is a mess that isn&#x27;t worth dealing with even with better performance per watt.<p>What would be really great is if Apple did what Dell does - Make a downloadable Ubuntu ISO with drivers and firmware integration available that works as a fully functional alternative OS. Or make the h&#x2F;w specs available so people can do the work themselves. I am well aware none of it will actually happen but nonetheless it would get more people to buy into what seems to be an excellent hardware platform.')
