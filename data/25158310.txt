It&#x27;s Not an Emulator, because that would be slow and error-prone. Instead, it finds a way to abstract the appropriate functionality within the existing system.<p>Talk about irony. But I share the author&#x27;s desire to see WSL share resources transparently between the W and the L. USB serial devices are a good example: it took forever for WSL1 to sort of support them, and it&#x27;s still spotty with WSL2.<p>This is an area where WSL could be very appealing: many embedded workflows rely on one or two legacy Windows applications, but most of the core tooling works fine in Linux. But if you can&#x27;t easily pass your USB debugger between OSes, you can&#x27;t easily split your workflow across OSes.')
