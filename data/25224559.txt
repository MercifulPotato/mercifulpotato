Item(by='thisrod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606437012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25223936, text='Literate.jl comes close.<p>You maintain a file README.jl, with a mixture of Markdown text, example code in Julia, and hidden code in Julia.  Inspired by Knuth&#x27;s literate programming idea, there are several things you can do with that file:<p>* Weave it to get README.md, with the text, the example code, and the output from running the example code.<p>* #include it in your tests, to run the example code, then run the hidden code to verify the results.<p>* Super-weave it to generate a web notebook, where people can modify the example code and see what happens.<p>This isn&#x27;t perfect.  When the examples generate graphical output, you have to write some boilerplate code to capture it as a GIF and link it in README.md.  That gets annoying in a numerical language like Julia.  But it&#x27;s pretty good.')
