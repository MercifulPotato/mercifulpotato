He was with me every day throughout my depression. It&#x27;s awful, it hurts and I&#x27;ll never be able to replace the role that dog played in my life. I don&#x27;t feel depressed though, I feel distraught.<p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to have lived an incredibly privileged life, with a stable family, excellent education and opportunities etc. so today is the worst I&#x27;ve felt in ages. With that in mind, I don&#x27;t feel like I can lay claim to even &quot;Shit Life Syndrome&quot;, I live in a country that has nearly eradicated COVID, I have a strong support base among family friends and coworkers.<p>With all that in mind, all I want to drive home is that if you&#x27;re depressed, you don&#x27;t need a reason. Though if you do have reasons you could have depression or you could not (I&#x27;m never going to tell someone the way they feel is invalid), either way I hope everyone out there is looking after themselves as best they can.')
