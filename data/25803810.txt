They strangely block out a part of their response, but we can see &quot;was cleared&quot;, which sounds a lot like &quot;the malware some nefarious agent put on my site was removed&quot;.<p>How sites end up on the block list-<p>-they host malware, either intentionally or because they were hacked.<p>-they host a phishing site, either intentionally or because they were hacked.<p>Protecting users is a monumentally more critical task than your concerns.<p>And this system is <i>incredibly</i> valuable. When I get a text to a phishing site, I immediately report it to the safe browsing list. I also notify the nameserver, the hosting agent, and if applicable the SSL cert provider. Bit.ly if in the chain, though they <i>never</i> do anything [fun fact, even -- phishers and malware authors love putting bit.ly in the chain because they&#x27;re paying subscribers, and as domains are taken down they can just change the destination. Bit.ly exists on the backs of scumbags, and itself should be on the safe browsing exclusion list]<p>Usually the safe browsing list addition happens within an hour, saving many people from being exploited. The nameserver and host -- DAYS. Namecheap takes an eternity to do anything, even for outrageously blatant phishing sites. GoDaddy - an eternity. SSL providers seem to act quickly, but propagation delays makes that negligible.<p>EDIT: 11 days ago I reported the scn- prefixed netflix.com to all of the above. This is a <i>blatant</i> phishing site, and was mass texted to Canadians. It was blacklisted by safe browsing within an hour, likely saving a lot of people grief.<p>Namecheap, who I informed by their email and by their garbage ticket system, still host the nameserver and physical hosting for this site. 11 days later. Grossly negligent behavior, and there needs to be some window of responsiveness because these players are just grotesque at this point.')
