Just get a moving anime avatar and a voice changer. People are flocking to these new anime avatars that aren&#x27;t even synced up properly (edit: talking about the trenders hopping on the train, not the Hololive cast).<p>Many streamers either fall into collecting simps, or collecting simp-bashers.

If you don&#x27;t fall into either of those extremes, you&#x27;re fighting for a much smaller audience and it is very likely you&#x27;ll hit a hard ceiling around 50-500 viewers with very few exceptions (especially people that don&#x27;t have a huge legacy from the early 2010s).')
