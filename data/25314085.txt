Their power should be limited.<p>Cloth masks aren&#x27;t effective yet we&#x27;re all pretendying, even the experts (who were all laughing at the plebs who were scared before mask mandates, wanting to wear masks and not knowing how to use them) [I&#x27;m in a very large medical community and this was the general sentiment before the WHO and Fauci changed their tune]<p>Experts disagree. Politicians fear blowback so they see who the media are agreeing with and then do that. They aren&#x27;t rational actors.<p>And no, mask wearing has many negative effects.<p>E.g. of Experts and Politicians making mistakes: lockdowns, they have much worse negative effects than positive but they look politically good. Experts don&#x27;t present any reason for them that is backed scientifically as a whole.<p>Who should we give the right to take away our freedom?<p>Experts lie, politicians lie and they do don&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t trust them with that much power.')
