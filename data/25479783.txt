There is just one problem with this approach: as far as we can tell viruses aren&#x27;t intelligent and they don&#x27;t think.<p>On the other hand, if you consider the possibility that viruses might be a tool used by someone else (God, aliens, evil scientists hired by bad governments), fatality becomes an important, if not the defining aspect of the tool.')
