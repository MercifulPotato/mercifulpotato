Even your example shows it, since before ACA, there was no out of pocket maximums, and hence you continued to receive bills.  In fact, before ACA, there was a maximum benefit amount the insurers would pay up to, and then after that, the costs would fall on you.<p>And your GA state program is most certainly made possibly by the expanded Medicaid funding due to ACA.<p>&gt;There isn&#x27;t any trust - as many posters here describe, paying medical bills in the US is (feels like?) a constant struggle against being defrauded by both your insurance company and your doctor.<p>This is true, but it would help if healthcare providers would list the codes they will charge so that people can look up the cost with their insurer and aren&#x27;t signing blank checks every time they enter a medical office.')
