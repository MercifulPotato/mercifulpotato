I think Apple&#x27;s statement that they&#x27;ve produced the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest CPU core&quot; is overall a valid statement to make, just from the info we independent third-parties have, but only because AMD Zen 3 is so new. Essentially no third parties have Zen 3, Apple probably doesn&#x27;t for comparison, but just going on the information we know about Zen 3 and M1, its very likely that Zen 3 will trade blows in single core perf with the Firestorm cores in A14&#x2F;M1. Likely very workload dependent, and it&#x27;ll be difficult to say who is faster; they&#x27;re both real marvels of technology.<p>Multicore is harder to make any definitive conclusions about.<p>The real issue in comparison before we get M1 samples is that its a big&#x2F;little 4&#x2F;4. If we agree that Firestorm is god-powerful, then can say pretty accurately say that its faster than any other four-core CPU (there are no four-core Zen 3 CPUs yet). There&#x27;s other tertiary factors of course, but I think its safe enough; so that covers the Intel MBP13. Apple has never had an issue cannibalizing their own sales, so I don&#x27;t think they really care if Intel MBP13 sales drop.<p>But, the Intel MBP16 runs 6 &amp; 8 core processors, and trying to theorycraft what performance the Icestorm cores in M1 will contribute gets difficult. My gut says that M1 w&#x2F; active cooling will outperform the six core i7 in every way, but will trade blows with the eight core i9. A major part of this is that the MBP16 still runs on 9th gen Intel chips. Another part is that cooling the i7&#x2F;i9 has always been problematic, and those things hit a thermal limit under sustained load (then again, maybe the M1 will as well even with the fan, we&#x27;ll see).<p>But, also to be clear: Apple is not putting the M1 in the MBP16. Most likely, they&#x27;ll be revving it similar to how they do A14&#x2F;A14x; think M1&#x2F;M1x. This will probably come with more cores and a more powerful GPU, not to mention more memory, so I think the M1 and i9 comparisons, while interesting, are purely academic. They&#x27;ve got the thermal envelope to put more Firestorm cores inside this hypothetical M1x, and in that scenario, Intel has nothing that compares.')
