They know it&#x27;s over, and that the lawsuits are formalities at best (often dealing concretely with just dozens of lost ballots and the like, although Pennsylvania&#x27;s lawsuit could still be interesting (they want the mail-in ballots received after the 3rd (but postmarked at or before the 3rd) to be dismissed. It won&#x27;t change the election results at all though, those votes have already been kept separate and not yet considered, pending the lawsuit.')
