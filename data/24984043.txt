Not even close. Demand for cheap goods was the driver for the West and the fact that Chinese policies teed up super cheap supply via their policies is the story.<p>So I don&#x27;t think your comment isn&#x27;t accurate. But it would be accurate if you said our western leaders were more than happy to keep the flow of cheap goods going because it was a favorable arrangement and it had a nice side effect of not having to deal with environmental cleanup or pushback.<p>If the cost of goods was the same in the west, the west would surely deal with environmental issues in exchange for the jobs and tax revenue.')
