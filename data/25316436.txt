Genetics makes a difference.  Yet also, <i>training</i> makes a difference.  So for those with normal or above normal genetic bounds for the above, training helps immensely.<p>And driving, responding quickly to issues, is often about training.  Hence all the driving ed programs now mandated in many localities, prior to obtaining a license.<p>Still, it goes beyond that.  One becomes more skillful, better at driving, as time progresses.  At least, those capable of that.  Meanwhile, we&#x27;re moving humans further and further from direct learning experiences, and with each &#x27;crutch&#x27;, reducing training scenarios as well.<p>Of course, we&#x27;re on a path here.  The goal is ultimately to move more towards safety.  However I suspect that &quot;things will get worse&quot;, before better, as drivers will be less trained on manual tasks.<p>Edit:<p>My main point is, we&#x27;re going to get to a point of &#x27;AI drives, you monitor&#x2F;intervene&quot; eventually, as the mainstay.<p>Yet <i>new</i> drivers, will be <i>less</i> able to intervene.  They won&#x27;t have developed, or trained, via the same number of &quot;close calls&quot;, and direct driving experiences.<p>Eventually, asking drivers to &quot;intervene&quot;, will be asking for the least skilled to take over, to monitor, to watch.<p>And there are a lot of areas that are very high bar to handle with AI.  Think on this ; all current driving tech is literally &#x27;low hanging fruit&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s been a lot of work, I grant that.  Yet it&#x27;s been a lot of work for just that low hanging fruit!<p>For example, most AI driving is urban, in the southern US.<p>How about:<p>- In rural Canada<p>- In the middle of a snow storm<p>- With ice, and white-out conditions on the road<p>- on rural dirt backroads, which are 20 or 30 km long, comprised of potholes and other such irregularities<p>- with zero mapping<p>- at -40C<p>I have extremely strong doubts that AI can even remotely handle that well currently.  I&#x27;d trust a 5 year old to handle this task far better.<p>Now, what of drivers who never really drive, end up on this side road, and get &#x27;stuck&#x27;, with the AI unable to handle things?<p>When all of the above is <i>normal</i> in the winter.  For example, often schools do not close in rural Quebec, for such typical, and normal, conditions.')
