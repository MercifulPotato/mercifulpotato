If you want your company to value something over money you could establish a non-profit or a B corp and that&#x27;s equally acceptable, but you can&#x27;t just decide one day that growth isn&#x27;t the primary goal of a C corp because then you&#x27;ve misled your shareholders. The same way if you established a non-profit or B corp with a specific social purpose and then decided to prioritize growth over accomplishing that social purpose, that would be misleading your donors&#x2F;shareholders')
