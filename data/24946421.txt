Anecdotally, I have been involved in 10 accidents or so as a passenger or driver, and none were reported to the police.<p>So I can&#x27;t find good numbers on what the real number is but I think its conservative to estimate it at 1&#x2F;2 are reported to the police. In addition, &quot;Crashes&quot; mostly involve 2 cars, so the &quot;police reported cars that crashed&quot; is roughly 2x, or &gt;12M.<p>Basically, those changes makes it roughly 8 crashes per million miles for normal driving, or Waymo being basically the same.<p>I still think that accident rate is too low though. This estimate is 6 crashes every million miles based on allstate data <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashable.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;google-driverless-cars-safer-than-you&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashable.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;google-driverless-cars-safer...</a>.<p>If that was the case, then humans would be at about 12 vehicle crashes&#x2F;million miles, almost 2x as dangerous as Waymo.<p>So about 2x better than human performance?')
