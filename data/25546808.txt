Many of the developing countries still have manual processes and controls in place, given how unreliable electricity and internet are in those places. So a large scale cyber attack while causing severe damage, would be unlikely to bring a developing country to its knees.<p>I couldn&#x27;t say the same of the US. Simple ransomwares have stopped entire hospital systems and cities from functioning. Imagine what a large scale attack could do.')
