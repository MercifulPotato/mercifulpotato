I&#x27;m glad for what they have done, and wish them luck in the server space.<p>There are others who are now better positioned to pick up where Canonical left off on the desktop. ElementaryOS, Pop!_OS, Zorin, all of these are amazing projects that have picked up and pushed forward from where Canonical left.')
