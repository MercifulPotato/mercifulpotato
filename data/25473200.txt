This means more components end up in land fills. Apple&#x27;s own extended warranty program makes billions of dollars. And the repair industry itself is quite large - millions maybe hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Apple products clearly fail and need repair at some point or another.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll join everyone else in demanding Apple stop opposing right to repair legislation.')
