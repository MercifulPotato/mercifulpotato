Item(by='akvadrako', descendants=None, kids=[25992925], score=None, time=1612207134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25990968, text='<i>&gt; Why your existing bubblewrap&#x2F;flatpak-spawn&#x2F;bash-wrapper works only okay, and why Bedrock might be a possible improvement?</i><p>One thing is managing all the &#x2F;bin links and taking care of all the directory mappings that are needed. Say env-A calls gcc which is installed in env-B: First, env-A needs a wrapper for all gcc packaged binaries - and those wrappers need to ensure the current directory stays the current directory, &#x2F;bin and &#x2F;lib become merges of env-A&#x2F;env-B, etc. It gets hairy and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s even needed - I haven&#x27;t done something this complex.<p>I think I read bedrock has fuse for managing links which seems like the level of complexity that&#x27;s needed.<p>Also managing fonts is something I haven&#x27;t looked at. And I&#x27;m sure there are more things.<p><i>- Why you don&#x27;t want to use Bedrock Linux as your distro?</i><p>Because it makes things more complex. I expect things will break and reasoning about security will be more difficult.<p>My ideal setup is a base system which is fairly minimal, but handles boot, init and kernels for sure. And then isolated packages on top (docker, flatpak, nix, homebrew, distro-chroots) which do integrate with each other when needed.')
