Trump has disavowed white supremacists clearly and repeatedly, and the claim that he called them &quot;fine people&quot; is not true. Let me say that again: it&#x27;s <i>wrong</i>. This is not ambiguous: \nit would have taken you a single Google search to find out that when Trump talked about &quot;fine people&quot; at Charlottesville he explicitly said that he wasn&#x27;t talking about the white supremacists and neo-Nazis and that those people should be &quot;condemned totally.&quot; And that&#x27;s just one of countless times that he&#x27;s condemned white supremacists and distanced himself from them.<p>The media repeats this easily-debunkable falsehood again and again and again and again, people like you fall for it, and then they have the nerve to tell us that it&#x27;s only the Right who engage in &quot;misinformation&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CuwFa0c-GnM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CuwFa0c-GnM</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9JmOSsv-KSg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9JmOSsv-KSg</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realclearpolitics.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;trump_didnt_call_neo-nazis_fine_people_heres_proof_139815.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realclearpolitics.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;trump_...</a>')
