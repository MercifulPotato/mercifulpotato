The reality, though, is that plenty of people suffer cancer, cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure or strokes. Or they end up caught in traffic or work-related accidents.<p>You could derive probabilities from population statistics and agree that, depending on your specific situation and with the information you have today, the probability of dying from any of those might be quite low. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s impossible. My personal - quite sobering - experience is having attended a fair share of funerals of people who passed away before they even hit 35.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that one should live life as if every day might be your last. That&#x27;s not maxim I like to live by. It&#x27;s important to keep perspective that you might live for many decades to come; but by the same token, one should remind themselves regularly that the opposite scenario exists too.<p>In culture, this reminder is called &quot;memento mori&quot; (Latin: Don&#x27;t forget to die) and it has been expressed through music, architecture, literature, poetry and so on many times.
