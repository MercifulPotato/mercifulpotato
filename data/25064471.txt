Or SD cards. Or floppy disk drives.<p>Raspberry Pi isn&#x27;t as laughable as that, but the fact is that what you are getting out of this is a learning opportunity, not a reliable or high-capacity computing platform.<p>And even there, 4 Pi4Bs with 8GB will cost you $400 and more, once you add in power supplies and SD cards and desiderata. The first hit on Craigslist just now was a $200 4 core i7 with 8GB of RAM (upgradable) and a 256GB SSD in a nice small case. Two of those will get you better overall performance and leave room for expansion.')
