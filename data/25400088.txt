If that is true then what you are saying is wrong, because the fact that the vaccines can treat what is now filling up hospitals and killing thousands per day means they are the opposite of useless and in fact one of the most valuable things in existence right now.<p>Even the regular flu shot was recommended as being more important this year so that there would be less spread and less to deal with.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m just stating I am going to wait and see if the problem is actually solved before acting like it.<p>No, that isn&#x27;t what you said. That might be what you are trying to claim now that you said something ridiculous.')
