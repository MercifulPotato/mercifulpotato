Hopefully with an influx of new users and with that, funding, it can reach feature parity with WhatsApp which is currently much better for groups. WhatsApp and Uber and Lyft etc, are very well crafted applications on iOS. They feel magical. Signal can get there as well, but it will take funding+effort.')
