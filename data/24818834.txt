Eg. 14 days.  If the government can&#x27;t accept or reject a request in that time period, it is auto accepted.  If it is rejected, a resubmitted request must be accepted if it addresses the rejection reason.<p>* Allow a business to operate for 30 days before, during, and after submitting a license request, and with no penalty if &#x27;in good faith&#x27; they believed it was reasonably likely their request would be accepted.')
