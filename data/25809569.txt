They even play music for the plant!<p>I&#x27;m running several aquariums at home between 17 and 240 litres that I try to run with as little intervention as possible, so I&#x27;m quite interested in self-sustaining minuature &quot;ecosystems&quot;. In aquariums the plant growth is usually the one thing that requires intervention, as some plant species (especially stem plants and floating plants) will completely overrun the ecosystem within weeks if not trimmed back, and they often will shade the other plants causing them to become stunted or die off entirely.<p>Aquarists or aquascapers (which is a trend that in its modern interpretation also originated in Japan) will often take pride in being able to grow rare or demanding plant species in their tanks. In some cases this can require holding a lot of parameters in balance: Light, micro- &amp; macro-nutrients (in the water and in the soil), water hardness, PH and temperature.')
