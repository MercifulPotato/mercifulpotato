Messing with it (blocking it, forcing people to use another) will make a lot of people refuse to use the app. Not messing with it will make activists mad and result in bunch of &quot;Signal is crap for proper security&quot; posts.<p>They need to choose. And sitting on both goalposts is the worst option here.')
