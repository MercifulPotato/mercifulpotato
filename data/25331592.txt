But they couldn&#x27;t sustain that because they have the sort of economy where slavery makes sense. The Saudis and Qatarians will be the same when the oil runs out.<p>An economy with slaves does not, fundamentally, make sense. It isn&#x27;t going to be the least bit competitive with a modern capitalist economy with wages without wealth literally bubbling up from the ground in the form of oil. Everyone in such an economy will be less wealthy than their peers in a free market.')
