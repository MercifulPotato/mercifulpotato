But since you brought it up I can tell you about my accuracy in Excel:<p>-  The process involved 2 people checking my work before it was sent to payroll. And we did catch and correct mistakes. We were able to trace back where and how the mistakes were make, and build in ways to prevent or flag future mistakes.<p>-  The job was necessary because of all the garbage in the database. Excel&#x27;s data-checking and data-cleansing and flexibility was superior to the database.<p>-  After 1 year all of my work was audited. For several dozen sales people, there was ONE person I wasn&#x27;t 100% accurate with. And that one was off by 0.5%. SUCCESS!<p>-  If we&#x27;d gone with the report coming out of the database, things would have been such a confused mess.')
