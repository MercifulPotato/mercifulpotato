You don&#x27;t want to put a program and its data on one local disk, because that one local disk has almost no resources. The later-period thinking at Google is the opposite of shipping the program to the data. Instead, you allocate the data randomly over as many spindles as you can find, then when you read it all back out you very briefly use all of those spindles at once. Really, it&#x27;s something to behold in action.<p>That&#x27;s batch processing: mapreduce and flume and whatnot. Search is still very much an exercise in getting the queries out to where the index shards live.')
