This seemed like a fair compromise to balance productivity, an aggressive cadence and remain competitive. It&#x27;s been pretty good for the most part.<p>End of October and this policy of every other Fridays off is due to expire. Management is looking for feedback as to why we should keep it, what are the benefits, how it has personally impacted us, etc. So we submitted feedback up the chain.<p>This got me thinking, I have seen several SaaS companies have kept these reduced work hours (mostly large ones, but several medium and many small). Are reduced hours (i.e. 4 day weeks, or every other Fridays) something your company is working with? have they kept&#x2F;removed the policy? Did it impact your release cycle, quality or productivity?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am grateful for the time off and in a good position overall. Just curious as to where the industry is headed.')
