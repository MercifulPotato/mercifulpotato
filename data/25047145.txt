Unreal is working on their own game store. PS and Xbox has had exclusives for years.<p>If it keeps going this direction, Valve will have to pull a rabbit out of their hat. Either by making some great games again or surprising us with something completely new.<p>Competition is great for consumers, but I am somewhat rooting for the guys that improve free, open source software in the process.')
