Gun rights are a big deal for a large number of people.  Abortion is a big issue for many people, as is immigration policy.  Saying that, &quot;One side is better on the things I value!&quot; is startlingly blind to the fact that a whole lot of people don&#x27;t value what you do, or value things in the same order.<p>I could just as easily turn it around and say, &quot;It&#x27;s easily verifiable that Republican states have better laws for gun owners.&quot;  Now do you see the issue?  Your above statement matters only if your primary goal is benefiting wage earners.  It would be like me saying that Republicans are better at building a border wall.  Maybe so, but that&#x27;s not top priority for Democrats.')
