Hopefully we&#x27;ll see even more reductions when QML3 is released (which really focuses on embedded). Another interesting thing is that QML now has cross-platform desktop widget via QtQuickControls2 (i.e. native Windows and MacOS styles) and the improved CMake support is also pretty convenient. I can now get rid of my .qrc files and just write everything in CMake.<p>I really admire how smooth this migration was and it shows Qt really cares about minimizing breaking changes.')
