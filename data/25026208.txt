Draw the rest of the effing owl<p>Yes, you only have to write your Nix expression code in a couple of files; of course, the issue is &quot;how to write that Nix expression code correctly&quot;.<p>&gt; Looking at any of the 60,000 packages in Nixpkgs should give one an idea of what to write.<p>This is exactly the fallacy I addressed in my comment--Nixpkgs is a really brutal reference for a variety of reasons. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re building a Python project--first of all, good luck finding a good reference package in nixpkgs <i>if you don&#x27;t already know where the Python packages are</i>. Secondly, the general scheme seems to be &quot;import nothing, write some function that takes dependencies as arguments&quot;, which means you&#x27;ll have no import statements pointing you to the source files for the dependencies. Further, because nixpkgs doesn&#x27;t believe in docstrings or static types, you&#x27;ll have nothing that helps you infer the shape of the thing you&#x27;re searching for or otherwise provide you with reliable grep criteria. You&#x27;ll need to grep for the call site for your function to determine what gets passed in, and that thing might be the result of calling some other function with its own args, so you end up recursing through this process for the whole dependency tree. It&#x27;s needlessly tedious, and this example is just the tip of the painful iceberg.')
