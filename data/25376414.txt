I know Quanta Magazine articles sometimes get some negative comments here on HN from readers who expect a different kind of exposition than what is suitable for a magazine of that sort, but for my part I&#x27;m really grateful to Quanta Magazine for bringing attention to papers like this, and writing nice articles about them with history, good illustrations, quotes from other mathematicians, etc.<p>For the impatient, Wikipedia has a short article on the problem and earlier progress: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Goat_problem&amp;oldid=993368252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Goat_problem&amp;oldi...</a> From this it&#x27;s more clear in what sense this is progress: whereas earlier the answer r=1.1587284730181215178...
