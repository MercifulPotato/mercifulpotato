I realized this is kind of my situation.. advice on what do is much appreciated :)<p>Are you considering yourself as &quot;slightly crazy and more productive&quot; (it&#x27;s not certain from the wording)?<p>If so, you may want to think in terms of time perspectives. Another way of viewing the dichotomy is &quot;Most companies ultimately value (more predictable and <i>less productive in the short term</i> and <i>more productive in the long term</i>)  over (slightly crazy and <i>more productive in the short term</i> and <i>less productive in the long term</i>).<p>Thinking oneself as &quot;more productive&quot; doesn&#x27;t motivate to build the personal and technical skills required in the long term, instead, it centers the focus on one&#x27;s ego (I&#x27;m cool; if they don&#x27;t hire me, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re wrong).<p>But I&#x27;m also skeptical of the entire concept, at least in some cultures. Excluding staff workers, there&#x27;s a lot of mobility in American companies, to the point that it&#x27;s quite common to change company every few years (say, 2 to 5). How &quot;crazy&quot; should one be to start disrupting productivity even before a couple of years?')
