People who are motivated to convince others of this are lying to them. Some are literally inventing &quot;evidence&quot; like registered voter counts that have been shown to be inaccurate, or arguing that states violated their own laws, when the state supreme court, the final adjudicator, rules otherwise.<p>Frankly, it doesn&#x27;t matter &quot;who is right in their own point of view.&quot; We have to be able to stipulate to a basic set of facts that are supported by objective evidence. You can&#x27;t just make shit up and expect everyone else to cater to it.')
