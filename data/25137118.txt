That&#x27;s it. Nothing else is needed. It would fix the problem with the diploma mills and degrees that don&#x27;t recoup the investment.<p>Obviously people would declare bankruptcy the day they graduate so there needs to be a special type of process for discharging the loans. There&#x27;s income based financing and there is loan discharge after a certain time so you&#x27;re never in a &#x27;spot&#x27; not to &#x27;pay&#x27; them but the gov&#x27;t is propping up the market and that needs to end.')
