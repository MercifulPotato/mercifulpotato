If it wasn&#x27;t for the most recent delay of release date, Cyberpunk 2077 would&#x27;ve been released before PS5 and the new Xbox were even available for purchase. You&#x27;re acting like people are trying to play this game on an NES.<p>If the game ain&#x27;t gonna work on a certain console, don&#x27;t sell it for that console. Plain and simple. Or if you&#x27;re going to release it anyway, at least let gaming critics review it and let the public make an informed decision, which CDPR deliberately didn&#x27;t do.<p>I&#x27;m baffled as to why so many people are defending this incredibly shady business practice by CDPR.')
