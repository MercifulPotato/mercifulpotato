However it&#x27;s rarely romanized this way.<p>At some point we have to admit that especially for names (of places, people) we don&#x27;t need to have a &quot;1 to 1&quot; conversion between hiragana and romaji. People pick the name that work well in English or other alphabet-based languages rather than a direct conversion.<p>People who can&#x27;t speak Japanese are not going to pronounce names correctly anyway.')
