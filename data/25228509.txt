And also because people aren’t going to pay $50 for some French fries, at that point they would start making food themselves, but that’s the same as “insufficient demand to pay someone enough that it would cause $50 French fries”.<p>I don’t see the purpose of a moral argument when it’s a fact retail businesses earn low single digit profit margins.  Walmart can’t pay more even if it wanted to, they would have to raise their prices and then people shop at Target. It looks like it makes a lot of money, but to doesn’t split over all of its employees, and same with every other large retail operation.  There’s a couple large ones serving the upper middle class market like Costco and Apple and Nordstrom and Trader Joe’s that might pay a little more, but they are unique and it wouldn’t scale for the whole population.<p>Here’s another example.  Two people buy some land, and build two different hotels.  Person A pays labor near to as low as people are willing to accept, and Person B pays more.   Let’s say person A pays $15 per hour and person B pays $25 per hour.  10 years later, it’s renovation time.  Person A has saved more money for renovations so they can make their hotel nicer than person B.  Now, customers will prefer to pay person A more than person B, and they will be able to earn more revenue.<p>Now person A has more capital to purchase land.  They can get bigger loans because their operating income is higher, afford to pay for more land in a more prime location, and build a new hotel.  They can expand and take more market share from person B.  You can see where the is is going.<p>Therefore, I don’t see the purpose of discussing the moral imperative for a single business to pay a material amount above market price.  Consumers will, by and large, not reward the morally correct businesses.  They might pay a $60 premium to Costco, but that’s about it.')
