We masked up early and our national broadcaster was constantly warning everyone non-stop. Schools were open however.<p>We were the poster boy for lockdown success up until at least November. Other nations were commenting on our achievements. You can see what has happened since.<p>The WHO warns that lockdown should only be treated as a last resort, to truly flatten the curve and no more. We ignored that.<p>It&#x27;s my sincere opinion that we&#x27;ve tried to push back a virus through our lockdown measures and social distancing that eventually cannot be controlled.<p>Holding back a virus is like holding back a damn, eventually something will burst and typically at the wrong time.<p>If we had listened to the WHO by not locking down, gaining natural immunity during the summer (when coronaviruses aren&#x27;t as prevalent) we wouldn&#x27;t be in the mess that we are in now.<p>The median age of death of this virus is 82. Please conceptualise this. Less than 20 people under the age of 44 died from covid in 2020. With our current technology dying is a part of life that cannot be avoided. The people who are dying from covid at the moment are people who were going to die this year, remember, people have to die, most of them have already made peace with this idea.<p>If we didn&#x27;t try so hard to prevent these aged people from dying we wouldn&#x27;t have our resources stretched thin which is compounding the death rate further.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to be the person to tell you this but we all have to die, we shouldn&#x27;t be stopping the living from enjoying their days on earth. Lockdowns are hurting the young and middle age to a drastic degree. You may not care because you work from home and are still guaranteed a paycheck. It&#x27;s easy to virtue signal that you want to save everyone from the comfort of your keyboard. You aren&#x27;t impacted by business closures but if you had any shed of humanity you would disagree to these lockdowns because they are causing more harm than good.')
