I just got myself a cheapo ThinkPad E15 to use as a backup computer if Apple somehow screws up my old MacBook Pro. Installed OpenSUSE Tumbleweed on the ThinkPad and everything seems to be working quite well (or at least predictably).<p>That being said, after each reboot I do need to put the machine to sleep using the power button once. After that the sleep&#x2F;wake works perfectly just by closing&#x2F;opening the lid. It&#x27;s a minor inconvenience and I&#x27;m actually kind of loving the thing!')
