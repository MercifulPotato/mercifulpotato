I honestly can&#x27;t imagine how they tasted way back then, coz it must be awful.<p>But the thing is MSG is like drugs, you seemingly need ever more of it. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t really like modern Chinese eateries, they might taste fantastic, but I know they are constantly search for the next MSG-derivative that can &quot;wow&quot; people(in fact MSG is realy outdated, it&#x27;s mowhere to been seen in China now, there are countless stronger synthetic flavor &quot;essence&quot; in the market.)<p>I actively avoid it myself, dishes just taste fake, only add it when like I&#x27;m doing a seaweed soup.')
