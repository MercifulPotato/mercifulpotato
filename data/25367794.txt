Unfortunately many on the left are morons and got led away from the real story (Russian interference) over to the fake story (Russia-Trump collusion) which left the real story forgotten and ignored.<p>&gt; Why are Trump supporters on the other hand not allowed even a few weeks to investigate their doubts<p>Because the &quot;investigation&quot; isn&#x27;t being done in good faith. The complaint has its basis in the Trump playbook and not on serious evidence of organised electoral fraud. The &quot;investigation&quot; is clearly designed to sow <i>permanent</i> doubt where none is warranted.<p>The medium-term effect will be to make Biden&#x2F;Harris considered illegitimate in the eyes of some Americans.<p>The long-term effect will be to lessen American confidence in elections and democracy. Perhaps it&#x27;s a coincidence, but this is exactly what Russia has been trying to achieve around the world for decades.')
