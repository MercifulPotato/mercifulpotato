No, it fucking is not. Or let me rephrase, it does but just for an extremely small subset of things. Cars? No, more expensive in the third world. House? Not at all, for a similar house, same quality of construction, and neigborhood, expect to pay at the very least the same amount of money you pay in average in the US. Food? No. Clothes? No. Land? Probably but if you have to sell it if will be sold to a lower price too. The only reason the dollar is worth more is because the local wages are pitiful, that&#x27;s it.')
