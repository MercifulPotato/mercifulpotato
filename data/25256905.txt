Like most everywhere else in America: if your policy suggestion is &quot;give up a lot of space and turn your residential neighbourhood into multi-family housing,&quot; you&#x27;re going to get a lot of resistance.<p>It&#x27;s not so land locked, which has delayed things since people can expand out, but look at what traffic is doing as a result! It&#x27;ll keep sprawling, and costs will keep going up in the more central areas, though not as fast for sure.<p>Is it <i>better</i> to have growth spread to places that aren&#x27;t in a not-geographically-bottlenecked-already-full area? Sure, probably. Seems a lot more sustainable and a lot less just a boon to existing lucky landholders. But then your policy solution goes back to &quot;close SF and the other places that are full to push the growth elsewhere,&quot; not some sort of &quot;just manage SF&#x27;s growth better!&quot; wishful thinking.')
