The term does not define a whole micro-architecture, esp in modern complex ones, but I&#x27;m not really sure how you would implement old school CISC chips without microcode concepts. The 8086 was microcoded: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reenigne.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;8086-microcode-disassembled&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reenigne.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;8086-microcode-disassembled&#x2F;</a>. It basically means that &quot;you&quot; program some low level internal details of a chip, e.g. the muxes connecting various buses to execution units. Most of the time the &quot;you&quot; is only the chip designers, and it is stored mostly in a ROM. Sometimes microcoding is accessible by actual software programmers, but it is quite rare.<p>And modern u-ops are not necessarily like what was done at the time of old-school microcode.')
