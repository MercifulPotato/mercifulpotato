If they piss off their customers who wanted to sell, that&#x27;s just how it is<p>No, the price change occurred when new money couldn&#x27;t flow into GME, due to deposit requirements. Stopping sells when there isn&#x27;t any technical reason to do so is also an intervention, and arguably a bigger one.<p>&gt; That will give them an incentive to keep both options open instead of restricting traders to only buying or only selling when it suits them.<p>And doing the reverse suits the HODLers, who would love nothing more than to prevent others from breaking rank and tanking the stock price, but sucks for everyone else who wants to get off the wild ride. On Thursday MUST asset management sold off its stake in GME. If people weren&#x27;t allowed to get out, and it tanked further, I could easily imagine accusations that robinhood was doing it to the benefit of wall st firms, to eliminate competition for sells.')
