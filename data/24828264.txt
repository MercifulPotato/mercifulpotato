Last time I played it was D&amp;D and my experience was it was more of a tactical game focused on combats than characters and story. It was about the squared map, knowing all the rules of your weapons and spells and trying to beat the GM in this game. All the rest seemed like cutscenes to the combat mini-games.<p>I didn’t enjoy this that much, especially since I do not know all the rules, limitations and possibilities of my weapons&#x2F;spells.<p>I would prefer to develop a story together. A system where you don’t need a exact map with squares&#x2F;hexagons to make decisions, for example. Where story and character decisions on what to do matter more than tactical decisions in combats.<p>Also, despite living story-driven games, I am not much into “acting” (doing voices, emotions and reactions like my character). Not sure if I have too many restrictions to find a good system or group here.<p>So, which system should I look for that it’s welcoming to beginners and story-driven?')
