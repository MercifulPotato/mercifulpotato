At this point I reported it to Together, and they said it was something to do with scanning the data for each module and the workaround was to keep all the data at the monorepo level. That got the load time back down to 20 minutes (less if you ejected some of the less interesting modules from the project). They also fixed the problem in the next release.<p>About this time I actually sat down and plotted the trend line, it fell almost exactly on an O(n^5) curve. I&#x27;ve seen n!, I&#x27;ve seen x^n loads, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen n^5 before or since.')
