Further, if your company&#x27;s finance department is worth its salt, any such customizations and integrations are assets with real value, so even if your company&#x27;s engineers are &quot;wasting time&quot; tinkering, the company can - and should - still capture this value on the books.<p>And further speaking from experience: with relatively few exceptions, I&#x27;ve found enterprise software vendors to be pretty much useless in terms of support, and to be more often than not an obstacle to business operations than a value to it when things go wrong.  All for a pricetag that doesn&#x27;t even come close to justifying their meager SLAs (that they&#x27;ll inevitably weasel their way out of anyway).<p>The decision to use transparent software <i>is</i> more often than not a decision in the best interests of a company.  Transparency is a dependency of trust; without that transparency, you have no real way of knowing whether you can trust your business on it.')
