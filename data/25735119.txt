Colorado Civil Rights Commission these last few days, but it seems very few people actually know what was decided in the case. The Supreme Court didn’t want to get its hands dirty with this issue so it was a very narrow reversal. Specifically, they said that the Civil Rights Commission was not neutral in it’s consideration, comparing the treatment of the baker (where the commissioner said that invoking freedom of religion is “one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use”) to other cases where non-discrimination exceptions were granted when bakers refused to make an anti-same sex marriage cakes. The question is still legally open.<p>I personally think it’s ridiculous to argue that the baker’s right to free expression is involved in this. But then again we have people boycott service providers for their choices of customers all the time.')
