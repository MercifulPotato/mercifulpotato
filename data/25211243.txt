It&#x27;s time saved not running the test suite, for example. An uncompilable regex is a category of errors that you can ban completely from your program. Like java bans syntax errors as a category of (runtime) errors. It&#x27;s time saved as any developer will not break this in a way that is not a semantic error. It&#x27;s time and mind saved not thinking about a whole class of errors.')
