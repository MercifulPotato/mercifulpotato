I thought, any directed attempt to send data from A to B is going to leave traces of a path. With enough command of the network you&#x27;ll be able to figure out from various side-channels who is communicating with whom.<p>Clacks just randomly sends stuff between peers, it&#x27;s up to the peers to decide if it&#x27;s relevant or not. With encryption and payload size obfuscation there would be no way to know which node is directing communications with another node.<p>Anyway, obviously the drawback is performance. It might take a while for all your packets to reconvene on the intended target.')
