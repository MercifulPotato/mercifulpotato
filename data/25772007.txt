This is only plausible if the spot price of Tether remains at $1. They will need to regularly inject money to keep the spot price of Tether at $1, but as you say the fees and ponzi can allow this as long as the number goes up.<p>The problem would come if the number stops going up and there isn&#x27;t enough money to cover all the people dumping the Tether IOUs simultaneously. I assume they cannot cover $25 billion dollars of worthless IOUs. Even more if their assets are also simply bitcoin, which in such a scenario would also be collapsing in price.')
