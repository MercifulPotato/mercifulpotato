I still think that there is a difference between the tokens that is somewhat hardcoded into the way the system of our mind is setup.<p>Information I&#x27;ve seen&#x2F;heard&#x2F;read indicates that people are able to understand language and have an area of the mind dedicated to it from very early in life. The same is true for other sorts of behavior.<p>This to me indicates that DNA has hardcoded &quot;instructions&quot; on how to configure a mind to be able to process tokenized information from the start.<p>It is entirely possible that every section of the mind is just a huge freeform fpga that is initialized by DNA, but I think it is more hardwired than that.<p>Game of life has certain structures that can replicate themselves or eat other pieces though, so it is entirely possible that certain initialization leads to things that appear to be hardwired structure.<p>I agree that the mind is distributed, and have also seen the experiments where people continued to function with disparate brains when the connection between the halves was separated.<p>My thought on it is that there are many subconscious thought streams that we are normally unaware of. People who become aware of them are thought to be crazy, but really I think the normal blocks from their conscious reasoning are just weak.<p>I agree also that some people don&#x27;t have the same &quot;internal dialogue&quot; and the stream of tokens are not equal to words like we communicate with others. I don&#x27;t think that invalidates that there is some sort of token stream though.<p>The question I&#x27;ve always had is &quot;how much of consciousness shuts down when you sleep&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;does staying awake longer mean your conscious thought process gains more access to the rest of your mind&quot;. My speculation is that the latter is true, because if you stay awake too long you will appear to be &quot;crazy&quot;.')
