But yes, it&#x27;s less than 1 Angstrom; the deposited structures (for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rcsb.org&#x2F;structure&#x2F;7A6A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rcsb.org&#x2F;structure&#x2F;7A6A</a>) record atomic uncertainties, &quot;B-factors&quot; or &quot;temperature factors&quot; in crystallographer-speak.  In the example I pulled out the B-factors are in the low-double digits for the main-chain atoms, and if I&#x27;m remembering the math correctly, this will correspond to atomic displacements with a radius around 0.5 Angstrom.  (Of course that&#x27;s just an estimate by the software that performed the model optimization, but my understanding is that this part is relatively straightforward.)')
