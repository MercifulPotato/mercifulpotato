Can&#x27;t cope with it at all.<p>I&#x27;m working in audio DSP as a rule, so I already have to maintain state of &#x27;what the audio is doing related to this set of sample data&#x27;, and often some things about how controls must move and feed information into the program to relate to a desired change in the audio which itself can be somewhat indirect. Maybe I am just stupid, but when I have to track DRY code I just blow a gasket immediately and can&#x27;t parse it at all.<p>I&#x27;ve wondered whether some of that stuff is about taking trivial problems and making them hard to follow for the uninitiated, to protect employment. WHY not repeat yourself, when the problem is repeated tasks? Or more relevantly, why not write a complicated and long sentence, rather than mangle the sentence into a series of more abbreviated footnotes? DRY reads to me like that chain of footnotes. You lose the plot.<p>Well, I do :)')
