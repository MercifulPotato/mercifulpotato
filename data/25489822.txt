SV prides itself in solving &quot;hard problems&quot; (whether that&#x27;s actually true is another issue entirely), so are you honestly saying that the issue with high chargeback rates or illegal content is too difficult to solve? I mean, SV can create advanced electric cars, launch rockets into space, serve millions of queries a second, but porn spam is too difficult?<p>I think the moralistic argument makes much more sense. Most of the VC types who want to &quot;make it big&quot; in SV do it not just for the money, but also for the approval of their peers and the praise of their Ivy-league brethren (&quot;Wow, look how smart he is, he was one of the earliest investors in Facebook!&quot;) Making it big in porn just wouldn&#x27;t have the same cachet, and would be a potential minefield of social opprobrium.')
