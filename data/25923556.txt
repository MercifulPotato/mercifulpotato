Another important reason is h.264, equivalents do exist, but given the state of hardware acceleration it’s irreplaceable, at least not on mobile devices.<p>JavaScript ain’t an essential tech, as it’s replaceable on both clients and servers. Your kids would learn equally efficiently using a native app instead of these JS-rich web sites.')
