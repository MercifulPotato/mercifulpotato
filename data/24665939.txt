Many more such studies and articles on both sides. As long as the median demographic for family formation continues to bleed usable income with each passing decade, the advocacy for either way won&#x27;t matter if there simply is insufficient economic incentive to have children and raise them, and we&#x27;ll see continued patterns like extended family or high-trust non-familial clans grouping together for sheer survival. We can handwave the trends away by hiding in median compensation figures, but societies with big and durable bifurcations aren&#x27;t fun to live in for most people on the wrong end of that bifurcation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ifstudies.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-real-roots-of-the-nuclear-family&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ifstudies.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-real-roots-of-the-nuclear-fam...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake&#x2F;605536&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-nuc...</a>')
