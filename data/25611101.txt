I agree in the sense that typing isn&#x27;t what takes up my programming time.  1000 lines of code at 100 wpm (which most coders could beat) is what, 10 minutes?  I wish.  I&#x27;ve spent hours on a single regex.<p>I think efficiency and accessibility are at odds with each other to some extent, and we&#x27;ve more neglected accessibility and flattening the learning curve, because we don&#x27;t need it, we already know how to code.  But custom software is basically a subscription service to the programmers that created it.  I had a client that hired a guy who had invented his own programming language and built their whole system, then disappeared on not great terms.  Boy were they in trouble.<p>But come to think of it, regex is a perfect example of something that could probably be interactively visualized and made more efficient.  Let&#x27;s ask google.<p>Yup: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debuggex.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debuggex.com&#x2F;</a><p>So I&#x27;m in vim or visual studio or whatever and I want to use this plugin and I... what?  Google it in a browser and copy and paste regexes back and forth?  This is so not 2021.  The lack of a shared information model between tools&#x2F;paradigms jumps out as a big shortcoming.')
