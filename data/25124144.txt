There has been a push in the past ten years for mail order handled by Pharmacy Benefit Managers. PBM&#x27;s are entities that work directly with the drug manufacturer to purchase in bulk, then delivering straight to the consumer at a lower cost than the pharmacy. The retail pharmacy industry, both chain and independent, absolutely despise PBM&#x27;s and fight vociferously against them because it gives consumers the option not to go to the pharmacy. I predict Amazon will face the same attacks.<p>Much to a larger issue, though, is the question: Do we really need pharmacists that much anymore? Vending systems would accomplish the same task, for less money. I contend most people don&#x27;t even speak to a pharmacist anymore.')
