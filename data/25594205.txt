A country going through an economic contraction still has a massive GDP. There are no IMF policies that favor growth rates, just the raw GDP.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s beyond silly to claim that capitalism doesn&#x27;t require endless growth.<p>Capitalism requires no such thing. It’s human reproduction and striving for better conditions that requires economic expansion. That doesn’t change under socialism&#x2F;communism&#x2F;whatever.<p>Finally, GDP growth does not imply anything about carbon production. Some of the biggest growth sectors going forward are entirely about clean energy.')
