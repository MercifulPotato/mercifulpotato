It is not hard, and people have done this before [0]. The real question is: can you make a ternary computer which is somehow better (faster, power efficient, cheaper, etc...) than a binary one? But to answer this you need to talk MOSFETS, voltage levels, gate charge, and current tecnhology capabilities. Shannon and Von-Neumann won&#x27;t help you here.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;6284-tern-ternary-logic-circuits" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;6284-tern-ternary-logic-circuits</a>')
