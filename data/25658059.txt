Item(by='tristanperry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609943570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644158, text='An interesting research paper, thanks for posting it.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been fairly interested in smart homes, which (alongside WiFi) often use ZigBee and&#x2F;or Z-Wave protocols.<p>Whilst Z-Wave isn&#x27;t covered in this paper, ZigBee (which runs at 2.4 Ghz - but on higher channels than WiFi to prevent overlap) is covered. If I&#x27;m reading correctly, the paper seems to say that many anti-jamming techniques are successful with ZigBee, unlike previous research that concludes that it&#x27;s usually harder to block ZigBee jamming attacks (ref 21)?')
