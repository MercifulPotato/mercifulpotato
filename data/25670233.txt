I served with former Force Recon Marines who had more extensive training in Close Quarters Battle (CQB), foreign weapons, field trauma and medical, linguists, etc... in addition to better selection of weapons, lighter&#x2F;better gear, etc... Note that these members still serve the actual Marine Corps. Each branch maintains it&#x27;s own &quot;special operations capabilities&quot; and if memory serves me correctly these are mandates by Congress.<p>I only have one friend that actually serves in Special Operations Command as a Marine. The difference with him is a broader set of training. For instance you won&#x27;t go to some in-house training if they need a comms specialist, they will send you to college. They have personal trainers, dieticians, and different height&#x2F;weight&#x2F;grooming standards than the rest of the services. Their gear selection is essentially whatever they prefer. These people work for Special Operations Command and are only loosely responsible to the branches they joined under.<p>Even the average Marine line company is trained regularly in guerilla operations. They organize without formations or with very loose ones, they&#x27;re cross-trained heavily with other MOS&#x27;, and they&#x27;re taught to thrive in very minimalist and harsh environments for which they train year round as part of the 24 hour response programs.<p>Special Operations capabilities and SOCOM are just sharper versions of the same spear in my view. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not really what SOCOM was supposed to be about, but nonetheless that&#x27;s <i>part</i> of their job. SOCOM also does anti-terrorism operations across the globe from small incidents or recon you might never hear about to interdiction operations of high value targets or rescues.')
