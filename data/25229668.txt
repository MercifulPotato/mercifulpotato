Nobody is saying don&#x27;t use hydrogen. The challenge is that people are proposing hydrogen in replacement of electricity and it&#x27;s a needless extra step.<p>&gt;Maybe you have a ton of electricity that you just have to throw it away or pay people to take it because batteries are still not as good, if you have too much electricity you could attempt to transform it in chemical energy and store that.<p>Certainly. The better use for said energy would be say desalination or many many other options.<p>&gt;I am not sure why some people think there is a Hydrogen conspiracy that is attempting to sabotage electric energy, the issue is with batteries and storage.<p>I think you misunderstand. I care about climate change and people who think they are getting into &#x27;green energy&#x27; via hydrogen will be wrong. The vast majority of hydrogen production is from fossil fuels.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting &#x27;green hydrogen&#x27; is a conspiracy in the sense that fossil fuel folks know hydrogen is still fossil fuels and are pretending it&#x27;s green.<p>I&#x27;m saying there&#x27;s a very huge chance that it won&#x27;t be green and even if it is. It&#x27;s no where near as efficient as other options.')
