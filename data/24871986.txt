If I get an actual sale for a featured job it covers a few months worth of hosting.<p>I haven&#x27;t spent much time on it lately and there are a few things I need to fix but I have been too busy.<p>While I am not in the black with the project (even if I consider my time as free) it still helps be think about other streams of income that maybe aren&#x27;t passive but can be tied into my hobbies so will feel much less like work.')
