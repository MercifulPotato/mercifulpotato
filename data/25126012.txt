I have a pihole (and use OpenDNS). Bypassed it all yesterday, as an experiment, to look at an anime site my eldest started using and immediately was hit with a pretty impressive and convincing phishing attempt (mimicking my ISP).<p>Pretty much all of us on HN seem to use some form of &#x27;DNS&#x27; based filtering (pihole, or even just hosts file). UK ISPs offer DNS based filtering as a default (and have to filter some pages by law, and are encouraged to filter others [through threat of law]) ... but a lot of people want that, many many families, schools, businesses.<p>Certainly I don&#x27;t want it to be easier for advertising and malware to bypass my chosen DNS-style filtering.')
