Item(by='cstaikos', descendants=None, kids=[25988292], score=None, time=1612144398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25984437, text='I&#x27;d suggest going solo rather than w&#x2F; a sitter honestly - it can be intimidating the first time but I think even the best-intentioned sitters can bring their own hangups into the mix and get in the way. Perhaps a good middle-ground would be to have someone who knows what you&#x27;re doing that you can call if you need to?<p>I think there are definitely parallels with a solo session and dancing w&#x2F; eyes closed at a rave - the same process really but as you say at a dance event there are a ton of distractions, and less space for really releasing when you need to. For instance, shaking has been a big part of the release for me, but it would be hard to do that at a public event w&#x2F;o people being weirded out - they&#x27;d probably think you took too many drugs and need medical attention.<p>Re: music, yes I always listen to music, but it&#x27;s been tough to find the right stuff sometimes. I have read that some folks prefer silence as well, so I&#x27;d suggest trying both and seeing what works - might be different in different sessions as well :)')
