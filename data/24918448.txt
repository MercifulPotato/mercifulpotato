I think people (me included) just don’t do enough work to move stuff from our working memory into our long-term memory.<p>I&#x27;d say we could be better at remembering that some piece of information exists and where to find it instead of having to memorize it. This seems more powerful.<p>And for things you do often, you will probably memorize it anyway.<p>Lack of focus leading to not remembering the content of a meeting is problematic though. I don&#x27;t have this issue fortunately.')
