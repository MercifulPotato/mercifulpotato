I.e. things a CPU can do.<p>&gt; And there we have it: with a fixed bit-width, this becomes a constant term.<p>It makes sense because that is how the CPU works: arithmetic operations on fixed width types are performed in constant time in the CPU ALU. Adding anything below 2^32 requires the same number of cylces.<p>It is only confusing when you confuse basic CPU operations with basic python instructions (an arbitrary precision addition is certainly not a simple operation from the cpu perspective)')
