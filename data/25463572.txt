It’s not particularly common any more, and I don’t think any app stores support the concept.<p>Deactivating features based on battery life? That’s absolutely still a thing on native apps. If you throw Windows into battery saver mode, for example, the acrylic material becomes opaque; if you put Android into power saver mode, native controls will shut off their gratuitous animations, things like that. Nothing <i>major</i>, but a bunch of small things.')
