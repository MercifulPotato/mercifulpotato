Trolls get a kick from getting people riled up, which definitely isn&#x27;t the case with Jon.<p>He is often quite blunt though. He doesn&#x27;t usually go out of his way to say things nicely and, being somewhat in the same boat, I think this is mostly because he&#x27;s just sick of seeing the same bullshit over and over. It is frustrating.')
