If you think that matches Stalinism then that&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve introduced to the conversation, not me. People opposed to Stalinism like Trotskyists were also in favour of dictatorship and violently forced equality. Stalin didn&#x27;t have a monopoly on demonstrably shit ideas for oppressively and violently reshaping society.')
