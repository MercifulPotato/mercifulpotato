There&#x27;s probably a theoretical % of employees who could go remote that in turn will make a company move office space or fire cooks. Otherwise, those are fixed costs and don&#x27;t come into the picture here.<p>I don&#x27;t think either % get hit for the class of SWE I&#x27;m referring too, so it&#x27;s just lost benefits to the SWEs.')
