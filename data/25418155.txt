I undoubtedly believe luck influences many things. The majority of who I am is dependent on &quot;luck.&quot; My gender, my parents, the country I live in, my childhood growing up, and even the name I identify myself with is outside my control.<p>The problem I see is too many people focus on things outside their control. Even if luck controls 95% of the outcome. It&#x27;s uninteresting to focus on. Focusing on it doesn&#x27;t change the outcome. Too many focused on it and surrender to it. &quot;It&#x27;s all luck anyway.&quot;')
