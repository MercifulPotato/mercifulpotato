The best I can do right now is offer an example outline of what I do. That said, if I&#x27;m working with a good project manager my format will differ: I&#x27;ll focus a lot more on the technical details and leave all organizational aspects out (e.g. timelines, dependencies and impact on other teams, etc).<p>The key principle is that <i>anyone</i> (sales, marketing, support, product, etc) should be able to benefit from reading it and find it intuitive to see where you&#x27;re getting into the technical details and skip ahead to the next major point.<p>1. Overview<p>A paragraph of two explaining the what and why of the project. Maybe some links to other related key documentation. Don&#x27;t put anything technical here.<p>2. Change Log<p>Bullet-point list of dates and major changes. Think of it like a git commit history.<p>3. Scope<p>What systems are affected? Are there phases to the project to be called out? If its principally one system&#x2F;repo&#x2F;etc in question, what major components are changing?<p>4. Requirements&#x2F;Tasks (the main body)<p>Use a numbered list and aggressively refactor as you go so high-level items rise to the &quot;left&quot; and all related details are broken out as sub-lists. You can loosely think of it as something like &quot;[section] &gt; [epic] &gt; [task], [task], [task]&quot;. Prioritize the list based on dependencies so you&#x27;re always referring back to already-mentioned requirements instead of yet-to-be defined things.<p>5. Supporting Docs<p>Put long-form examples, scenarios, diagrams, etc in their own section. Some people will only care about these, especially if they provide integration examples.<p>6. Concerns and Questions<p>Ideally by the time a first draft is done this section no longer exists, but usually you&#x27;ll find that you need to do research or get feedback from others to finalize the whole thing.')
