I think Cloudflare has advantage here of not being that mess of overload.  They dont have the legacy cruft, the legacy customers.  They purposely ARENT trying to be everything (by supporting all identity providers but not being one.  By not being an MDM.)<p>I feel the same way about Cloudflare as I did about Velocloud.  When Velocloud came out, their pitch was that they WERENT &quot;WAN optimization.&quot;  They purposely werent compressing the data on the edge to squeeze a couple extra bytes down a tiny pile.  By starting from the ground up, and not transforming a legacy product, they kept their hardware costs down.  They didnt need the extra horsepower to do things that werent necessary in a modern paradigm.  Instead they offered a unique cloud service that made their product a bit different than the rest, and at a lower price.<p>Cloudflare here has that same competitive advantage of being able to design everything from first principal, with no regard for how things were before.  Maybe even moreso.')
