I have in the past put a trainer on my road bike. They are a bit pricey for decent ones and when I tried them in the past I just really didn&#x27;t like it as much. I also didn&#x27;t like putting on and off trainer.<p>That said I really bought this setup as a spin bike for spin classes. Which to me I don&#x27;t want to put stress on my road bike and I want that resistance in the fly wheel.')
