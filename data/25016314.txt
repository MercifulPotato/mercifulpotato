You are told &quot;take this&quot;.<p>This is not in circumstances of hospitalization, let alone involuntary hospitalization, but regular outpatient treatment.<p>People who are in a bad place generally don&#x27;t research meds, and if they are not extremely uncooperative, or paranoid, will take them and the doctors&#x27; words at face value.<p>Consequences are severe and long-lasting.<p>Absolutely shameful and despicable. These doctors should be shamed by the scientific community for [almost] using prehistoric notions of &quot;hysteria&quot; to mistreat ilness by basically showing &quot;see, he&#x27;s not crying anymore! PROGRESS!&quot; while pointing to a barely awake, sedated patient.<p>Any and all progress is usually SSRIs and psychotherapy, if available. Why do they give these antiquated meds that are not appropriate for the situation (i.e. CPZ) is beyond me. These are not psychoses, this is <i>Episodium depressivum, gradus moderati</i> .<p>Sorry, had to get that out. This is from personal experience.')
