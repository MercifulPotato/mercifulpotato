Even when that information just doesn&#x27;t exist in the perfect a priori knowledge about the system, which is something that if this <i>special molecule</i> could obtain somehow and then store for later use should violate half a dozen theorems or so.<p>Really this could make some sense if we were talking about an ideal gas of classical particles that obey deterministic mechanics, but then not even the <i>special molecule</i> would be able to determine the initial conditions with sufficient precision to make useful predictions, beyond a short path and a few collisions in the system.')
