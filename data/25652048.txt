The ecig addiction was way more painful to go through. I suspect that&#x27;s because you end up injesting quite a lot of nicotine when you can hit an e cig basically anywhere, and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel nauseous like too much chewing tobacco or hoarse like too many cigarettes so you just keep hitting it.<p>I had splitting headaches and trouble sleeping for a week then it was done. Cold turkey is the way to quit nicotine imo. Patches, gum, ecig, etc, are all just ways to drag it out and spend more money on nicotine, with the side chance of still being addicted. Cigarettes aren&#x27;t heroin. It&#x27;s gonna suck but then suddenly it won&#x27;t.')
