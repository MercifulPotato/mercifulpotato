The error message from Gmail is the following:<p>550-5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist.<p>This is a global issue, and it impacts all email providers trying to send email to Gmail, not just ProtonMail.<p>Because Gmail is sending a permanent failure, our mail servers will not automatically retry sending these messages (this is standard practice at all email services for handling permanent failures).<p>We are closely monitoring the situation. At this time, little can be done until Google fixes the problem. We recommend attempting to resend the messages to Gmail users when Google has fixed the problem.
