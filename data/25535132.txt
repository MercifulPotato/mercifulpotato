Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608885180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535123, text='Ableton Live, the only one used for live performance by any of <i>my</i> circles (admittedly, in the electronic music scene, not Broadway) is cross-platform.<p>Logic Pro is, of course, Mac-only as it&#x27;s made by Apple.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about an organization moving to Windows here, we&#x27;re just talking about a single, appliance-like keyboard-input-to-audio-output computer for someone to play music on in a live Broadway show.  TFA writes about <i>buying</i> the machine new for that single purpose.  There aren&#x27;t really &quot;switching costs&quot; in the traditional sense in that circumstance.<p>TBH I think it&#x27;s just an ad.  The circumstance (we have to buy two brand new computers for every run of a show!) and claimed impact are just too contrived.<p>EDIT: Further supporting the idea that it&#x27;s just an ad, every other post from this domain on HN is promoting a product.')
