I live in Austria where the average income is high among the developed world and even here, through a poll on reddit, most people said they are not willing to pay for any private&#x2F;secure messaging platforms on the arguments that <i>&quot;why pay for something I can get for free?&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;I have nothing important in my communications worth datamining&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;I already have a Facebook account so they already have all my private info, what&#x27;s the point of privacy at this point?&quot;</i>.<p>So even people with good incomes are super stingy when it comes to paying even a couple of bucks for things that they are used to being free and don&#x27;t care much for online privacy as long as their basic needs are being met.<p>IMHO, until a massive hack&#x2F;leak hits one of these <i>free</i> services, people can&#x27;t be bothered to care.')
