To report a bug, I had to pay.  Yes that&#x27;s right, I had to put in a credit card, and pay $100.<p>If it turned out it was deemed to be a real bug, I would be refunded my $100 money.  If it wasn&#x27;t, well that should teach me for wasting their time.<p>Guess the folks running the bug program got promoted.')
