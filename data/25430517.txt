Item(by='LocalH', descendants=None, kids=[25431078], score=None, time=1608042007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429995, text='When corporations grow above a certain size (the exact size of which is for another discussion), they tend to gain power against the individual. I&#x27;m not sure which is worse - powerful government, or powerful corporation. Both serve their own interests ahead of individual liberty, and collectively it means that people are less free and more beholden to corporate interests.<p>I don&#x27;t want to put so many restrictions on small business, because they&#x27;re more directly driven by individuals (although if their behavior starts having a significant negative impact on individuals, then perhaps that can be investigated). Small business has far less power to negatively impact individuals when compared to multi-billion-dollar multinational organizations.<p>I believe that society should favor and protect the freedom of the individual over the freedom of the large corporation. Without those individuals, society is useless. Of course, that&#x27;s sidestepping the issue that society far too often sticks its teeth in where it doesn&#x27;t belong, and won&#x27;t bite down where they&#x27;d actually be useful.<p>Your last sentence is honestly a copout (not on your part personally, but in general as an intellectual idea). That basically embodies a race to the bottom, as countries around the world erode freedom, and the rest of the world &quot;harmonizes&quot; so as not to be disadvantaged on the world stage. You see this now with the current copyright situation.<p>It&#x27;s kind of the same idea as the GPL protecting the greater freedom of software by restricting some of the freedoms that a developer may wish to have. Many similar arguments can apply too, as for example I&#x27;ve heard it said &quot;GPL&#x27;s restrictions will just push people to use less-restrictive licenses&quot; That may be somewhat true, but there are also people who value the greater freedom more than their personal freedom to use the software in a non-free manner. Note that this isn&#x27;t an endorsement of GPL over other licenses, just a parallel to be drawn that is somewhat relevant to HN.')
