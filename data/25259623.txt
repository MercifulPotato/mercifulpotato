The 4096 colors were the whole palette (3 bits per color -&gt; 2^12 = 4096 colors), but you could only use 32 of those colours without limitations. And then there were the &quot;special modes&quot; (EHB with 64 colors, where the second set of 32 were the first set with half brightness, and HAM, where you could theoretically see all 4096 colors at once, but only with careful optimization of the base 16 colors). Plus you could use the &quot;Copper&quot; (coprocessor) to set a new palette for each scanline. Some games used all of these tricks (and more) to achieve some very impressive results, but I don&#x27;t think cross-platform titles like Monkey Island really invested that much effort into Amiga-specific optimizations...<p>Details: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theamigamuseum.com&#x2F;the-hardware&#x2F;the-amigas-graphic-modes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theamigamuseum.com&#x2F;the-hardware&#x2F;the-amigas-graphic-mo...</a>')
