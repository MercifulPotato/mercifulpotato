Certainly the largest three cities in Canada (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal) are significantly warmer than Helsinki. Of the ten largest cities in Canada, only two (Calgary, Edmonton) are colder than Helsinki. It is true that you&#x27;ll be contending with around 50-100% more snow, except for Vancouver or Victoria. But you&#x27;ll also have much less daylight in the winter in Helsinki.')
