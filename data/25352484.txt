With that analogy one can probably find an &quot;app maker&quot; that similarly is just drag &amp; drop for some basic CRUD app. Just not sure that anyone actually makes those and tries to publish them to commercial repositories whereas I did get a lot of mp3s sent via MSN because half my friends were making music, and honestly many of those tracks were hard to distinguish from what I&#x27;d expect from a professional. Nowadays there wouldn&#x27;t be much stopping them from signing up for a random music site account and uploading the songs there.<p>And yes I did learn to play an actual instrument, I know it&#x27;s shit^W painfully slow (that&#x27;s why I stopped taking lessons).')
