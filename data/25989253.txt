I love when new sensors appear!<p>Some (minor) questions:<p>&gt; both visible and thermal imagery - at a resolution 9x higher than what is available today<p>This sentence is infuriatingly ambiguous.  Does the 9x refer to only thermal, or also to visible?  And what does 9x even mean?  Today I can buy worldview3 data which is 30cm&#x2F;pixel.  Are you offering 3.33cm&#x2F;pixel?  I don&#x27;t think that this is possible without a major, Nobel-prize deserving, breakthrough in optical imaging.<p>&gt; Today, buying commercial satellite imagery involves a back-and-forth with a salesperson in a sometimes months-long process, with high prices that exclude all but the biggest companies.<p>This does not match with my personal experience.  For many satellites, I can just click a region of interest on a map, and pay the satellite data using a credit card.  It is much cheaper to get images from the archive than tasking, but apart from web-UX shenanigans the process is quite streamlined.<p>&gt; The current climate crisis requires a diverse set of sensors in space to support emissions monitoring<p>What wavelengths are you aiming for?  What spectral resolution?  I&#x27;d say that most emissions detection happens at the near and short-wave infrared bands, far from the thermal.  What climate-relevant emissions are you thinking about, specifically?<p>I love the contents of this message, but I would like to see it much more specific.  This first paragraph it&#x27;s ok but reads like marketing-speak, not a scientific language.<p>&gt; While the use cases for satellite imagery are endless, adoption has been underwhelming<p>This sentence is comically false.')
