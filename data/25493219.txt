But the article is talking about &quot;The ability to build a one-off product such as a boat or small yacht, directly from CAD&quot;.<p>I dunno about you, but I&#x27;ve designed and paid for injection molds, and there is nothing cheap or fast about producing the first one.  We were a small company, those molds cost us a substantial fraction of our capital.  I would not describe the feelings engendered by unpacking and checking that first one as magical.  Words that spring to mind are hope and dread, and eventually relief when we realised it would not be that expensive to move through holes in PCB&#x27;s by 0.5mm, and adjust metal jigs, and resignation that the aesthetics of the thing were not quite as we expected, but would do.<p>Now a technology that allowed us to print something in 24 or 48 hours for a few thousand that was actually useable in the field - that would have looked absolutely magical.  Being able to print something size of a boat hull that is strong enough to sail is almost unbelievable, even now.')
