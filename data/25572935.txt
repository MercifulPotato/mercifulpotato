I invite you to revisit the comment I replied to and recognize the way it denies women&#x27;s agency by presuming that the author understands women&#x27;s aspirations better than they themselves do. Paternalistic attitudes about how women don&#x27;t belong in the workplace for their own good are rooted in misogyny, and facile appeals to &quot;brainwashing&quot; don&#x27;t make for a compelling statement to the contrary.')
