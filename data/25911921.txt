Item(by='SAI_Peregrinus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611630132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25911570, text='Much of the internet makes fun of &quot;choosing beggar&quot; &quot;influencers&quot; who want to pay people with &quot;exposure&quot; instead of money. Permissive licenses are the reverse: they&#x27;re asking others to pay you only in &quot;exposure&quot; instead of money. If expect to gain any return (other than some CV padding and personal satisfaction) due to contributing to permissively licensed projects you&#x27;re a sucker. Permissively licensed software is charity work. It&#x27;s good, useful work in many cases, but it&#x27;s not going to make you money.<p>Give money and time to causes you support. Go contribute to the BSDs. Volunteer at your local animal shelter. But don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re going to get rich from it. You&#x27;ll save some puppies and help some people (and maybe some megacorps) but that&#x27;s all you can expect.')
