Generally the arch specific stuff is less than 5% of the content vs general configuration info about the daemon.<p>And other fundamental system level stuff like how grub2 and booting is handled on Arch, or full disk encryption, etc.<p>I have also seen some instances where the arch maintainers who package some daemons choose the installation location and configuration location for stuff in a different file tree structure. And cases where the default out of the box configuration for the daemon is different on Arch than on another Linux.')
