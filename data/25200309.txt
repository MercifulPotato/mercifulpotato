There are three problems: unstable govs in 3rd world countries, capital moving restrictions and QEs.<p>I&#x27;m, for example, not from developed country, so I have several restrictions on my own money, some of which may be applied to US&#x2F;Europe citizens and some may not:<p><pre><code>  1) my gov, speaking softly, is not stable. I have no guarantee on my bank accounts in the long term (eg 20+ years). I can assume that funds can be at least inflated in several times, if not withdrawn in the name of some &quot;patriotic&quot; gov initiative. It would be much better to have my funds away from such jurisdiction. It&#x27;s safer to have the funds out of **any** jurisdiction due to some political conflicts and attacks. US and their banks are likely to freeze Russian&#x2F;China&#x2F;Iran citizens funds as well when another conflict will arise. \n\n  2) Capital moving. Even if someone assume that some jurisdiction is safe - there is another problem - not any country makes capital flowing outside its border legal. You just **can&#x27;t** move your **own** funds somewhere where you see it fit the most. Domestic banks may be completely controlled by the gov and too much cash can be easily arrested on its way by customs. \n  \n  3) QEs, which is my favorite part and applied to any human on the earth today. Your money is used to &quot;save&quot; someone without your direct permission even if you live in good country, paid your taxes and did nothing wrong. Just by printing more money - practically making your hard-earned money cheaper and less useful. They&#x27;d say that you can move your money to stocks (US, by the way, there is no stable stocks but theirs), but you both will need to pay tax from your so called profits (the hell, on SP500 I won&#x27;t even earn on the long run, I barely save initial funds considering inflation!) and forced to invest in american economy, which not everyone (surprise!) want to do. And stocks can fail badly.\n</code></pre>\nWith some assumptions, crypto solves all three problems <i></i>very<i></i> efficiently.')
