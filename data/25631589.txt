There&#x27;s no way the actor would be punished in the country of origin if their country of origin was not only OK with their actions but supporting them.  Does that mean whoever did it should be free to travel anywhere they want without repercussions?  You&#x27;re essentially saying that countries are no longer allowed to enforce their laws on any foreign citizens... that seems EXTREMELY short sighted.<p>Furthermore, how would the country of origin even prosecute when the victim wasn&#x27;t one of their citizens.  What are the mental gymnastics to say that your citizens can&#x27;t be prosecuted anywhere but their country of origin...b ut the victims have to what?  Travel to your country to get justice?  If a nigerian scammer is caught, you expect a US citizen to fly to nigeria on their own dime to try make their case?')
