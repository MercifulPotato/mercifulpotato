It wouldn’t matter much anyways: it’s a huge commuter town (daytime population is double or more the resident population), so the base to tax is relatively small. The real untapped taxable value in the city is land wealth. Until Prop 13 allows the city to tax land equitably, it will be forced to try harebrained tax schemes on employers or sales.')
