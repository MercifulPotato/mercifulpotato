Its quite expensive, and in my case, since im not using any fancy stuff, have transferred all of my servers from EC2 to a more simple service (hetzner) and now pay less than half the cost.<p>I think most businesses need to really evaluate this issue before blindly putting everything on AWS since it can really get pricey once you need good performance.<p>So my point is, all these AWS specific config languages really create an even more tight lock in with the platform, maybe it would be best to do it in a cloud agnostic way, which of course also comes with its own issues.')
