It is a very neat example because it&#x27;s something that everyone thinks they know how to do, but there are enough places to introduce an off-by-one error that it is very easy to mess up if you aren&#x27;t careful.<p>The big takeaway for me was the importance of thinking about invariants, and of documenting said invariants in comments next to the code. It has become my go-to example if I need to teach someone about invariants.')
