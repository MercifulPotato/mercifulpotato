But there&#x27;s nothing <i>domain specific</i> about that.  I might want a decent looping construct in any domain.  That&#x27;s just trying to make a decent language, not a domain specific one.<p>Or is the idea that, as soon as I go beyond the Common Lisp standard, it&#x27;s &quot;domain specific&quot;, no matter how completely general my extensions are?<p>I&#x27;ve always interpreted DSL as creating a way to write programs in the language of the problem to be solved.  A loop construct, no matter how useful, seems to fall short of that.')
