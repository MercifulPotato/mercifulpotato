If H1Bs are being awarded to a handful of exploitative firms, then it makes sense that wages face a downward pressure. On the other hand, if H1Bs are being awarded to truly exceptional workers, then that’s a brain drain for their home country and a benefit for the host country. In the latter case, if the H1B applicant is the right employee for a job since a local candidate doesn’t meet or exceed the bar, then there isn’t much of an increase in the labor pool to drive down wages.')
