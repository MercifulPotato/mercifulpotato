They&#x27;re trying to convince corporate gatekeepers to adopt it, and &#x27;more features&#x27; sells to them.  The avg person in charge of deciding to use slack at a company is likely not going to care if memory usage impacts other stuff on the users&#x27; systems.<p>re: the google docs sharing thing - I really hate it, because I&#x27;m pretty much <i>always</i> asked this question, and I say &#x27;no&#x27; or remove the alert, then I&#x27;m asked again next time.  And the next time.  And across every org i have to use slack for.  Either use &#x27;corp&#x27; or &#x27;room&#x27; preferences for this, or remember and respect my own preferences.  Quit asking something repeatedly.')
