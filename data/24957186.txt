(Also it would suck if all that time went into the bin a few years later!)<p>From my experience, here&#x27;s a ranking of how long code lives:<p>* Proprietary &quot;webcrap&quot; and plumbing logic at companies. This dies the fastest (6-24 months).<p>* JavaScript frameworks and tools, open source. &quot;Dies like flies&quot; -- many of them, short intense life, then everything dies down and the buzz moves to the next swarm.<p>* Proprietary backend code. Lives 5 years, then gets rewritten or dies a long death.<p>* Open source code in dynamic languages. 5-10 years, then mass extinction events end some lineages, such as &quot;The Tertiary Era&quot; (Python), &quot;The Discovery of the Fundamental Theorem of Write-Only Code&quot; (Perl), and &quot;The Birth of the Script Kiddie&quot; (PHP).<p>* Open-source code in static languages (Haskell, C++, C). Usually around already 10 years before I started contributing, and showing no signs of getting old.')
