(Also, last I checked, most CEOs, boards, and sales forces don&#x27;t have technical backgrounds.)<p><i>&gt; to organizations that can ruin people and have little oversight based on how well those same algorithms are supposed to work?</i><p>And how do you get oversight?<p>That&#x27;s a political problem, not a philosophical problem. If you want to sway the opinions of regulators and legislators, please do not reach for the philosophy dept. Convincing regulators and legislators to do stuff is not the job of a philosopher. So what is the job of a philosopher?<p>This kind of brings us back to my original point from which we&#x27;ve now strayed. Philosophy is a field of study. The job of a philosopher is to do philosophy. In order to do <i>that</i> job well, philosophers require more input from technical experts than they currently receive.<p>This matters precisely because philosophy is important; good philosophy is the lifeblood of a healthy society, but it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to do good philosophy without some scientific training.')
