The internet has been able to allow people to get to the truth. Look at that maga hat kid story; if this were 75 years ago. The newspapers would never have retracted. The change is that we can watch the whole thing and see how the media spun the story in a completely false way. As they have done for decades. The internet has ruined their long history of being able to spin stories. They know their enemy, it&#x27;s the internet.<p>That story doesn&#x27;t show what you think it does.  The media didn&#x27;t create the initial misleading cuts of that event, <i>social media users did</i> (i.e. &quot;the internet&quot;).  The media reported on those cuts (and the reaction to them), then it reported on the longer cuts that surfaced later.  If the internet hadn&#x27;t existed, the whole thing would have been a literal non-event.<p>While social media &quot;has been able to allow people to get to the truth&quot; it <i>also</i> has been at least as effective in helping people get to lies and disinformation.  See QAnon, Pizzagate, and this Covington High School student video, for instance.<p>&gt; Just look at presidential debate. The proud boys, whose leader is a black man, were labelled white supremacists. Last I checked, white supremacists dont follow a black man as their lead.<p>Watch the video again: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JZk6VzSLe4Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JZk6VzSLe4Y</a><p>Trump was asked to condemn &quot;white supremacists and [right wing] militia groups&quot; and was pretty equivocal and strangely reluctant to do so.  <i>That&#x27;s the story.</i>  The Proud Boys were just an example that was thrown out by Biden.  While they probably fit more into the militia group side of that formulation, the they don&#x27;t seem like the kind of top-down bureaucratic organization that would allow easy inference about the group from it&#x27;s &quot;leader.&quot;')
