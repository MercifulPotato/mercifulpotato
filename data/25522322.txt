Look how often people lose patience with each other online.<p>&gt;85. Cultivate compassion for those less intelligent than you. Many people, through no fault of their own, canâ€™t handle forms, scammers, or complex situations. Be kind to them because the world is not.<p>Interestingly, being smart does not protect one from scams. Look at all the smart people who got duped by Madoff. Smart people are just as inclined to believe BS as less intelligent people are , if the BS is dressed up in such a way to appeal to smart people. If anything, being dumb helps, because scams typically require forms and complex schemes, such as investment schemes.')
