Whether that is APNews or NYT or straight from the government website.<p>The question of &quot;Who gets to decide the truth&quot; is <i>extremely tiring</i> to refute - someone has always had the authoritative voice is determining what&#x27;s true and what&#x27;s not. You&#x27;re shifting the burden of truth from one source to the other until there is no one you can trust.<p>Statement: Foo is Bar. [1]<p>[1] Source Baz.<p>You then need to argue, why does Baz gets to decide what&#x27;s true or not? This goes on ad-infinitum.<p>By asking &quot;Who gets to decide the truth&quot;, you&#x27;re essentially saying &quot;Why should I trust anyone?&quot; and by that logic &quot;I cannot trust anyone, so everything must be false.&quot; The society&#x27;s fabric is based on trust in institutions.
