Many who do just fine in procedural and&#x2F;or OOP don&#x27;t transition to FP well.<p>FP shops have tried since the early 60&#x27;s to stay viable and expand, but usually fail outside of niche domains. I&#x27;m just the messenger. FP has had more than plenty of shots throughout history to prove its mettle in the real world.<p>I personally have found FP hard to debug. The &quot;naked state&quot; of imperative programming is actually helpful when debugging, because the context is laid out on a nice little e-desk to examine. With FP you mostly have to open and inspect one drawer at a time.<p>One FP proponent replied, &quot;well, then make fewer bugs.&quot; No comment, other than reminding that one can&#x27;t control other people&#x27;s creation of bugs even if they can control their own.')
