That being said, if the art is an expression of the ideas that are considered reprehensible, then it becomes much harder.<p>With the example of Heidegger, his core works, including Being and Time, did not expound upon his Nazi sympathies. Had Being and Time instead be a work which deeply integrated Nazi ideology, the dialog around the work would be significantly different. Instead, a clean line can be drawn between Heidegger the Nazi, and Heidegger&#x27;s work.<p>With Yarvin on the other hand, his work actually expounds upon the ideology he created. There&#x27;s no clear way to draw a line between Yarvin&#x27;s ideology, and Yarvin&#x27;s software, since they&#x27;re so deeply linked.')
