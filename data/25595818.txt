You can get a desk big enough to support a tripod and monitor without sacrificing ergonomics, but then you have to have a <i>massive</i> desk. My current desk is 32&quot; deep, and I&#x27;m certain that bringing the monitor close enough to make room for a tripod on the desk would involve bringing the monitor too close for comfort. In my specific case it would also necessitate giving up the gas-arm that my monitor is attached to since it only clips to the back of the desk, and I don&#x27;t want to give that up.<p>You can make it work, if you rearrange your entire office space around this requirement. I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but to each their own.')
