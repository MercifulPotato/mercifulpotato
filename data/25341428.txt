You can be carbon neutral, and I don&#x27;t buy for one microsecond that there are 0 technologies that could filter soot from smokestacks. In fact, we could recapture all of it.<p>You said “pollution” should be banned. That includes a whole lot more than soot. And no, you can’t recapture “all” of the soot from a smokestack. Filtering particulates out of flue-gas stacks is a whole field of engineering. And that’s just one source. PM2.5 is produced by a huge variety of human activity: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pca.state.mn.us&#x2F;air&#x2F;sources-air-pollution-most-impact-health" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pca.state.mn.us&#x2F;air&#x2F;sources-air-pollution-most-i...</a>. The dominant source is actually residential wood burning.<p>&gt; If you read about the history of pollution, you&#x27;ll see that the &quot;informed tradeoffs&quot; is a complete fairy-tale. It&#x27;s mostly ignorance and abuse of the poor by the wealthy (who put polluting factories in poor areas like West Virginia).<p>I focused on environmental policy in law school. It is absolutely about informed trade-offs, within an economic framework. Equity is one part of policy, but the field is not “mostly” about that. Of course that aspect of it gets a lot of press, because it makes for easy narratives for liberal arts major journalists who have trouble with science and economics.')
