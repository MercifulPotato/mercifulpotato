California experiences a net influx of highly skilled workers draining them from the rest of the US (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jec.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;index.cfm&#x2F;republicans&#x2F;2019&#x2F;4&#x2F;losing-our-minds-brain-drain-across-the-united-states" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jec.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;index.cfm&#x2F;republicans&#x2F;2019...</a>) and red states mostly lose their brightest people or absorb California residents from older failing industries who can’t afford the rents. The majority of this is about cost of living not taxes. Corporate taxes and income taxes have not really changed in recent years and California overall ranks in the middle of US states by EFFECTIVE tax rate (not the top marginal which few people pay but conservatives love to cite)<p>Go read that study by the government on internal US migration.<p>These “shackles” you’re talking about took me from someone who used to live in a ghetto to someone in the top 1%.
