How about you convert the markdown files to CSV and import it? Recently I used it just for fun to import all the sentences from Faust and put them in a spreadsheet with LibreOffice Calc. I made it separate all the sentences by dots, and added another column with translations of the file thanks to DeepL. Converted it to CSV and it worked out, sentence and translation cards done.')
