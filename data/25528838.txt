Factorio is a game that is amazing for many reasons, but to me the main one is exponential growth.<p>At a certain inflection point you can basically tear down everything you&#x27;ve ever built by hand, and have robots recreate it all in a minute or two.<p>The combination of blueprints and robots turn the game from some tedium to a game purely of mind and very little tedium.')
