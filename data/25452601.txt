Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25452797], score=None, time=1608180666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452567, text='Personally, I am shocked at how unrealistic and immature the demands of these activist employees are:<p>&gt; The demands in the letter include the removal of a Google vice president, Megan Kacholia, from the team&#x27;s management chain; for transparency surrounding Gebru&#x27;s departure; and for Google&#x27;s head of AI, Jeff Dean, and Kacholia to apologize for how Gebru was treated. It also calls for the company to offer Gebru a new, higher-level position, to commit publicly to the integrity of research conducted at Google, and to guarantee it won&#x27;t harm any workers who advocated for Gebru.<p>I sincerely hope Google’s leaders don’t cave in and instead hold firm on their prior decision. Employee activism is highly toxic and distracting, especially when activists organize like a mob to prop up someone as toxic as Timnit Gebru. Anonymous forums like Reddit ML and Blind are full of stories from victims of her aggression&#x2F;toxicity and yet the alliance of employee activists and tech journalists continue to make her out to be a victim of injustice.')
