The higher resolution the screen, the better. I have my Emacs configuration using a bunch of different fonts and sizes&#x2F;weights&#x2F;etc for my Org-mode, Terraform, TypeScript, and other editing. For example, when a todo item is put into &quot;in progress&quot; the heading is slightly larger and bolder, and when that item is complete, marking it &quot;done&quot; changes the text to italic, extra-light, and grey to reduce its visibility.<p>Time spent messing around with fonts is definitely an expression of ADHD and active procrastination, but I do get a pleasing effect from it! :)')
