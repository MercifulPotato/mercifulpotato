(I thought the graphQL parts were horribly bloated boilerplate, so I didn’t want to even touch it.)<p>It also works well with async import for runtime loading of components.<p>Other then that, I don’t use any of it’s features. (I found a markdown react on npm and manually move the images to the public folder and use normal image tags.)<p>I’m quite happy with the runtime results, and develop re-render works pretty quickly. However, the production build takes about 30 secs which is pretty slow and I also ran into “out of heap memory“ on node during build and had to increase node’s heap size.<p>So I’m sure I’ll end up needing to build my own SSR eventually, but it should be easy to do.')
