It&#x27;s not like Volkswagen sends a manual to their dealerships that says &quot;be dicks to customers&quot; and Lexus tells theirs &quot;only hire nice people and shower customers in expensive gifts&quot;.<p>Nearly all dealerships are run as franchises and there is no &quot;standard&quot; of care beyond some very basic rules. The owner of the dealership(not the manufacturer) will dictate how well the customers are treated and what kind of perks they get. You happened to find a decent Lexus dealership - maybe somewhere else there will be an equally nice Volkswagen dealership.<p>The thing that does matter is how quickly and easily the manufacturer approves repairs and warranty claims - in my experience Nissan was always dragging their feet, Mercedes was ok-ish, and Volvo was completely outstanding. But even then, it has little to do with &quot;the manufacturer&quot; and everything with their national HQ in whichever country you live in - some operate on tighter budgets so aren&#x27;t as keen to approve repairs as others. In EU a good solution sometimes is to literally just drive across the border and try to get the repair done in a neighbouring country, if you aren&#x27;t having luck getting the warranty claim approved.')
