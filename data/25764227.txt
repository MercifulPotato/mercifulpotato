I&#x27;ve been using VS Code via SSH into a WSL2 container running on my windows box and it&#x27;s been going surprisingly well.... but that was after a moderate amount of effort to get WSL2 working to begin with, which was partially complicated by my past efforts of getting WSL1 to do similar behavior. I&#x27;m also not 100% confident NewCorp&#x27;s IT would be kosher with me spooling that up. I could be wrong, but it seemed easier to go with the lower-number-of-abstractions-to-get-an-acceptable-experience via mac at the time.<p>Though who knows! Maybe I&#x27;ll change my mind and get a new machine :)')
