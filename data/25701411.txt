Personally <i>I want an AI to hoover up my data</i> and act based on anticipate my needs. However, in the current climate its just too risky letting my data leave my control.<p>So the problem is not privacy per se, but trust that my data is used in my best interests. This is my attempt at fixing the internet services trust issue: <i>Make sure the production code that runs on the data is verifiable at all times</i>.<p>It&#x27;s very half baked at the moment as the serverside runtime is not open sources, nor is there a billing system. I am acutely aware of the hypocrisy and will fix it in due time :p')
