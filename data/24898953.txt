In reality you have to work with a bureaucratic health system where there&#x27;s never enough time for each patient. Also patients might not be as willing to cooperate as you wish (as an example I recently read about cholesterol medication where many doctors advised a healthy lifestyle opposed to medication but many patients just weren&#x27;t willing or able to change theirs but prefer medication). Getting patients to smile is certainly satisfying but it&#x27;s also not that easy.')
