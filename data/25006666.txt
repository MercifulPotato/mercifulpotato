Although some in Finland tend to forget it, Sweden provided substantial amounts of men and material which helped a lot, but it wasn&#x27;t quite enough. The only other player with enough muscle was Germany, to which Finland had good historical connections traditionally, going back to the days of the Finnish Civil War.<p>Also, East Karelia as an area was Finland&#x27;s strategic target. Finland hoped to regain what the Soviets stole and to have a buffer in place for the next Soviet attack. Many Finnish people recognize the saying &quot;If the enemy does not come from the East, they have taken a detour&quot;, a reflection upon historical facts.<p>As for Leningrad, Finland didn&#x27;t really care about Leningrad, but Finland had to do something to keep Germany happy. According to Kastari, Finland made strategic errors in the East Karelia war effort, however it seems that Finland&#x27;s aim was actually to get as short a border with the least effort [1]. Hence the siege ring which didn&#x27;t really go anywhere nor do attacks against Leningrad.<p>[1] Kastari: Suomen armeijan toiminta Karjalan linnoitusaluetta vastaan syyskuussa 1941. MPKK, 2019')
