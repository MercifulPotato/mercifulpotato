The best thing I&#x27;ve seen for trivial business changes is to train two business people how to update the fields they need to. It works best with a simple UI in front of it.<p>As an example, maybe they want to change a cutoff from $100 to $50. You can provide them a standard query for modifying this field. Then they can change the cutoff value as needed. You could keep the SQL to yourself and just plug the number in that they gave you and run it yourself. Of course if you code it as an SP then it&#x27;s fairly trivial to stand up a basic service and UI in front of it for them too.')
