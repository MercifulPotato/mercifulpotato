Hence, while it&#x27;s true that trace elements didn&#x27;t come from the Sun, it&#x27;s weird to focus on that because nothing else did either.<p>EDIT: And it&#x27;s also weird to tie this to the fact that the Sun won&#x27;t produce elements heavier than iron through normal (i.e. non-nova) fusion late in its life since that has nothing to do with it.')
