Violence. Lots of it. And once it starts, it&#x27;s not easily stopped. Some welcome this because they think it can be managed for their own purposes. But once civil order breaks down, things simply accelerate with no possibility of talk being able to stop it anymore. It takes on a life of its own. Those who dream of the power they can seize once the violence starts are completely delusional. The winners and losers cannot be predicted ahead of time. There&#x27;s no good path through it but this does appear to be the path that some have decided to force society down. Doubt most of them are even aware that this is what they&#x27;re doing.')
