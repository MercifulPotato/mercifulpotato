A large portion of the genome codes for something, somewhere above 70 percent, even if most of it doesn&#x27;t create proteins directly.<p>As an analogy, a piece of well written code often has a lot of extra info not directly tied to its core function, such as logging, error handling, etc.  Much could be removed without impacting the core function, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it is junk code.')
