Not trivial. But not that hard either. There would be no need to shut down the supply chains.<p>&gt; the WHO and all the right-thinking people were insisting that border restrictions were counterproductive,<p>I&#x27;d argue that these were very much the wrong-thinking people. And that the WHO advice has been pretty terrible throughout. It seems obvious to me that closing borders is appropriate in a pandemic. The UK <i>still</i> hasn&#x27;t done this.
