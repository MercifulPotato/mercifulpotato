Even here on HN most people only upvote comments they like or otherwise agree with. Its the same everywhere. Massive massive echo chambers on the left and right with propaganda being retweeted and shared to millions.<p>&gt;We must bring the security to each individual endpoint.<p>Why? Why must we treat adults as children that we have been entrusted with, and that it is our responsibility to give them &#x27;mental medicine&#x27;? What makes our thinking superior to others&#x27; that we need to lord over them in this way?<p>&gt;Some will argue that we should shutdown the internet or censor it. But is that the world we want to live in? That would stifle economic growth and i do not believe it is compatible with the ideals of liberal democracies.<p>I believe that these ideals are bottom-up. We form governments that align with the ideals of the people, not the other way around. If the people out of choice or ignorance no longer care about the ideals of liberal democracy, who are we to force them onto others?')
