I don&#x27;t know what the right solution is to this sort of problem, at least for developers.<p>-------------------<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know how to use Excel (most popular spreadsheet program used for budgeting), thus my conclusion is that Excel is stupid, its users are stupid, while programmers are smart. Next time I will have to make a budget, instead of using Excel, I will create my own program that does the same, but better!&quot;<p>&quot;And since I will be building this from scratch, I will start with designing the universe&quot;<p>-------------------<p>And trying to be constructive: you probably mixed your calculations with data. You could calculate things separately and then just put it into one sheet: revenues with +sign and costs with -sign.')
