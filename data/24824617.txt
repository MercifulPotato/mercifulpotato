I&#x27;m very confused. This has definitely not been my experience.<p>I have a television entertainment center setup that I&#x27;ve had for about 9 years and it&#x27;s still a great piece of furniture. I have 2 kallax bookcases that are still working pretty great (though they are wobbly, but you&#x27;re supposed to put supports on the back wall, anyway); and, I have a bed that I bought from them that has been working amazingly for probably 7ish years at this point. That&#x27;s been the only real problem piece of equipment, one because a piece went missing during a move and the other because it has to be completely disassembled during a move and that tends to weaken it a bit.<p>Otherwise, my equipment from Ikea has been just fine over all. I&#x27;m even still using some of those junky $10 end tables for various things.<p>Has something more recently happened? Or have I just gotten lucky? Or?')
