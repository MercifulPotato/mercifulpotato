I would imagine that the formal education makes it a bit easier to &quot;get your foot in the door&quot; in the first place, when you&#x27;re competing &quot;on paper&quot; with others.  But once you are in the industry, <i>performance</i> and track record counts for a lot more.<p>In other words the degree probably does make it easier.  But it might be only 20% easier and perhaps not 80-90% as some might assume.<p>Depends on your chosen specialisation too of course.  I managed to pick a career in just the right area of software development where I could get away with having had a pitiful amount of education :-)')
