If he didn&#x27;t think that was a fair price he wouldn&#x27;t have agreed to the sale. <i>That</i> was when he was compensated for his creation. After that, he was compensated through salary.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your point of view here. If I sell something to someone else, I&#x27;m not expecting to get more payout for it <i>fifteen</i> years down the line unless some kind of residual was explicitly negotiated in the original sale agreement. Acquisitions would never happen at all if the acquiring company was on the hook for unbounded amounts of money decades later just because they made it successful. This point of view seems very un-businesslike. Andy Rubin was not owed that $90M, it shouldn&#x27;t have been paid to him, and Google has admitted to its mistake and will not be paying out in similar cases going forward.')
