You know he doesn&#x27;t. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it is false.<p>If his username is anything to go by, I&#x27;d say that there is probably a kernel of truth to his statement. After all, people don&#x27;t just make up stories about ketamine and nitrous addictions.<p>Especially since dying in a house fire isn&#x27;t a usual route to go. It might make sense he was on ketamine and somehow a fire started (he probably didn&#x27;t intentionally start a fire), and couldn&#x27;t get out. It&#x27;s very hard to walk straight on ketamine. You end up walking like a robot.<p>Edit: but the real reason I believe these claims is because my gut says it is true. Not the best reason, of course. But not a bad reason either.')
