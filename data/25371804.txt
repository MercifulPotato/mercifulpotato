Unpredictable prices, even if they end up being low, hurt consumers by requiring consumers to keep cash in reserve just in case the (remember, unpredictable) price swings wildly. That cash in reserve is cash that cannot be spent elsewhere, be it necessities like food or luxuries produced elsewhere in the economy.')
