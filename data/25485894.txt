Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608468536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485357, text='D has the unfortunate issue of being ahead of its time (i.e. using niche programming languages only really became a thing a few years ago), so it&#x27;s not &quot;cool&quot;. It&#x27;s a shame really, because I see a lot of languages throwing around D features like C++ interop saying theirs is the best when D&#x27;s C++ interop is both years old now and battle tested every single day.<p>D also solves a problem you can&#x27;t really know you have unless you have a deep knowledge of programming. The idea that if you want to write small code vs. fast code rather than both in the same language in very strongly ingrained because we traditionally teach people C++ and&#x2F;or Python and that&#x27;s it unless you do advanced courses (to learn something like Haskell which still doesn&#x27;t help), even though both are fairly crummy programming languages.<p>If all goes to plan I may be working to help popularise the language soon, so we&#x27;ll see about all that.')
