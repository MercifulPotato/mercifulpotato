Assuming on the timescales involved it can come into thermal contact with the top inch of soil, all the LNG from that tanker should dissipate once it spreads over a surface of 3000 m^2, or about 60% of the area a football field. It vaporizes faster when you take into account other sources of heat like the air, and way faster if you light it on fire. At most it&#x27;ll be on the ground for a few minutes, but for a real spill it could be just seconds.')
