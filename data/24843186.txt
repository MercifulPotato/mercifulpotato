I mostly agree with you that most of this should be in containers; I should have been more clear to what part of your comment I was addressing.<p>In regards to docker worldview, this project currently doesn&#x27;t follow best practices.<p>And while I agree mostly with this statement:<p>&gt; Surely all the complexity should be inside the container<p>The caveat being that complexity should be split up into separate concerns. Otherwise there&#x27;s little difference between the host and container aside from an extra layer of abstraction.<p>For example, this repo should probably be split into several containers: cert management should probably be its own container, which a shared volume for certs); php should be rolled into its own container, and php files should reside there; logging shouldn&#x27;t be handled at the container level; firewall concerns (namely fail2ban) probably should be handled at by the host, or in a container with appropriate permissions; etc')
