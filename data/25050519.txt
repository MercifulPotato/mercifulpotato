I see no one claiming that.<p>I claimed that and provided a video showing that is the case. In addition to the windows being cardboarded up.<p>I can provide examples from Philly for example as well.<p>There are many many examples like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;willchamberlain&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323615834455994373" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;willchamberlain&#x2F;status&#x2F;13236158344559943...</a> 8am Nov 3rd you can see poll watcher being denied entry.<p>Another place in Philly: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TimRunsHisMouth&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323649769135316994" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TimRunsHisMouth&#x2F;status&#x2F;13236497691353169...</a><p>Or how about when you do get inside the building: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mikeroman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323605665882013696" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mikeroman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1323605665882013696</a><p>&gt;The county officials where the 138k typo happened reported it as such.<p>Right, kind of rehashing the issue. They now claim that it was a typo. Any and all &quot;typos&quot; like this is not up to the officials to &quot;report&quot; in this case it would be the Michigan Republican party who is required to claim and acknowledge the typo. Transparency is very important.<p>&gt;Who says poll watchers weren&#x27;t present where the mail transcribing videos were recorded?<p>I do believe the answer is the Republicans?<p>&gt;Where is there no limit on the number of poll watchers allowed inside counting facilities?<p>At the end of the day we are kind of rehashing the same points. Trump is a child who incites and inflames people. He very much energized the \nDemocrats and made the situation a huge amount of frustration and desperation. Was there fraud? Let&#x27;s be realistic, there was. Will it be discovered? Almost certainly not. Will Biden be president? You betcha.<p>The problem is that the political divide over the last 10 years has been widening and it isn&#x27;t the republicans. The lack of transparency and huge number of inconsistencies that appear to be an unfair election is going to result in the republicans moving. The divide is increasing because of the perception.')
