It’s possible that just using the same policy as for the WebAssembly logo works, but I know that various organizations have grown more concerned about IP in this space since then.<p>&gt; This is in no small part because your company, Wasmer, attempted to register “WebAssembly” and “Wasm” as trademarks. The USPTO rejected the application, but I don’t think we can assume that attempts to register a brandmark for a WASI logo would be similarly rejected.<p>This doesn’t seem to be a he said she said situation; gp had the chance to defend himself and all he could come up was a very weak “The trademark requests were driven by our lawyers” (and what came after that was even more shameless if you ask me): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;WASI&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3#issuecomment-713141554" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WebAssembly&#x2F;WASI&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3#issuecomment-71...</a><p>Given that context, I’d say the gp comment (especially the “personal bias” part) is likely motivated smearing.<p>Bottom line: don’t make up your mind just because it’s the top comment of an HN thread, or because the discrimination&#x2F;racism card is played (racism card isn’t played here, it’s in the linked GH issue).
