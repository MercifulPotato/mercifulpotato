If it were true I would think the military would be more interested in using them as weapons for electronic warfare than search lights. More likely the lights were interfering with radio links like telemetry or voice. Or maybe they were just not conforming to some EMI guidelines NASA was using at the time and were modified as a safety precaution.')
