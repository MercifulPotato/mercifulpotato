European politics involved several parties, and the USA only two, so much less horse-trading involved.<p>Also, I haven&#x27;t heard anything coherent from antifa, and they&#x27;re not a political party, so not sure why or how to listen to them at all. I would just call the National Guard the next time they strike a match or throw an M80, which would prevent them from driving down the interstate to the next downtown. This is not a similar situation to Kent State at all.')
