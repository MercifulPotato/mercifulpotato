At this point I don&#x27;t think 10Gbps NICs are worth that much on the second hand market. Most of the cost will be in the wiring. In WiFi most of the cost would be in the router and APs.<p>2. Wired is far more reliable than wireless in urban settings. You just don&#x27;t have to deal with overlapping channels, physical barriers, dropped packets, concurrency between devices etc. You might get away with free real estate on 5Ghz+ nowadays but that&#x27;s going to change as the ISP-provided equipment rotates.<p>I get a lot of wireless myself because I live in the middle of nowhere, without a single other Wifi AP in detectable range and the inner walls of my house are pretty thin. In that context, with a well configured router, I get extremely stable wireless connections with low latency (&lt;1ms router&lt;-&gt;NIC).<p>But in a city apartment I&#x27;d rather have the old 10m Ethernet cable cutting across the living-room.')
