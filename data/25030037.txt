I&#x27;ve also been dismissive of greenfield phone platforms as being &#x27;not ready for daily use&#x27; without having actually trying them.<p>I&#x27;m generally more of a computer user than a &#x27;mobile&#x2F;phone&#x27; one, not spending any time scrolling in social media apps. Perhaps I could live with the sub-par experience of an open&#x2F;free phone. Good phone and plain text messaging features with a great web browser might get most of the way there. I realized that I only needed apps for work (2FA), Slack&#x2F;PagerDuty and Spotify--and now working from home don&#x27;t even need Spotify. Carrying a small old iPhone (or iPod Touch) seems acceptable for a few apps Uber&#x2F;Lyft, etc. I used to carry an iPod Touch along with my phone and using it felt so great--to have the rest of the world in my pocket rather than a tap away.')
