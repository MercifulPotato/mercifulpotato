The concepts are orthogonal and you could write microservices in PHP, if you really wanted. Like Java, the .NET runtime and platform is highly efficient. That&#x27;s what .NET has historically had over PHP&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Ruby, but I don&#x27;t keep up with the PHP and Ruby platforms these days.<p>I feel like this is another one of those discussions like the &quot;Python GIL problem.&quot; Whether it&#x27;s a really a problem depends on the circumstances, and the circumstances were it is a problem affects fewer people than the HN threads suggest.')
