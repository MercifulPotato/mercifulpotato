Its a fossil of an idea with a long track record of top-down oppression, corruption, and progression stagnation where nothing gets built in perpetuity.  You can try to make the system more fair without going full neanderthal.  The Marxist movement gets a lot of spoiled upper middle class kids who want the govt to take care of them like mommy and daddy did because they realize its going to take real work and slim odds to get the same standard of living they grew up with.  And thats just called life.  By definition not everyone can be above the average life quality.  A great way to kill the standard you have and for everyone is to kill production and attack the capital markets.<p>At the end of the day life quality is a logistical issue above all else.  Jeff Bezos is not going around the country buying up all the single family homes and hoarding all the doctors in the country for his knee injury.  If you want better medicine you need to invent more efficient technology through the capital markets to serve people.  If you want more homes you need to invent better home building techniques to cater to the masses.  Thats how increased efficiency works and its why our lives generally get better with services and quality of live each decade.  Thats not to say there are not tweaks and governing to be done to the capital markets (the govt is the conductor), but this is the general aspiration and trend.')
