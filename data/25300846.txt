I have shamelessly &quot;stolen&quot; .woff-files wherever I could find them and the license allowed it. I think Google fonts are all free to download, but don&#x27;t quote me on that.<p>I am usually inclined to vendor dependencies on the web. Not an ideal solution but I don&#x27;t like dependencies on CDNs, even if they are indeed very reliable. But apart from making sure the set has symbols for special characters you might need, it is pretty safe to do so in case of fonts and maybe even advantageous.<p>Also bought some fonts from other services as there are quite cheap compared to the huge amount of work going into their creation.')
