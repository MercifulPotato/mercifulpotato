Retain&#x2F;release being faster would just surface as regular performance improvements. It won&#x27;t change anything at all about how an existing application manages memory.<p>It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that apps have been completely overhauled for a baseline M1 experience. Extremely, extraordinarily unlikely that anything remotely of the sort has happened, though. And since M1-equipped Macs don&#x27;t have any faster IO than what they replaced (disk, network, and RAM speeds are all more or less the same), there wouldn&#x27;t be any reason for apps to have done anything substantially difference.')
