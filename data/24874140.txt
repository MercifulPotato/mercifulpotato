It is a place where you can buy and download music. Itâ€™s not the same service as Apple Music, which is a streaming music service.<p>That&#x27;s actually an interesting point that I&#x27;ve never considered before, even though I was aware of it.<p>iTunes has always been kept separate from Apple Music, with no evident plans to merge those in sight, while Google Play Music was used for both streaming and purchasing music. I don&#x27;t think it ultimately affected the demise of GPM, but it is still an interesting topic to ponder.')
