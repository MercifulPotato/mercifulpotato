This sounds like a regurgitation of an American view of international trade law and treaties therein. <i>International waters should be policed by international organisations</i> or do you find a flaw in that logic? Not the UN, not NATO, an international body independent of any single state.<p>&gt; Having a single power guarantee free navigation allows ships to cross the world while avoiding complicated jurisdiction divides<p>So the rest of us are to assume the US taxpayer and their government are acting in good faith? nothing in return for having all those ships and men out there for months at a time? Whats the cost to the US for protecting assets from Guinea-Bissau?<p>&gt; Someone needs to prevent piracy and unlawful seizure for international shipping to be possible at its current scale<p>I don&#x27;t think you get the gist of my argument. To put it simply, <i>to whom does the US account in their capacity as police of international waters?</i><p>Who said the US must be that &#x27;someone&#x27;? Even the UN - if we won&#x27;t kid ourselves is a US institution - might have been acceptable. A single power&#x27;s whims are to be trusted for what reason? How do we know they wont collaborate with Pirates and other bad actors? Who will bring them to book or answer questions?')
