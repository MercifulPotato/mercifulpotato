Kitchens and factories mostly. He changes jobs just as often as your average resume-driven-developer. Not for raises of course, those don&#x27;t really exist in menial work, he just gets sick of one place&#x27;s shit and moves on to a different place with a different set of bullshit to deal with, just for variety.')
