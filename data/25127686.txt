The third most likely as well because the EOS mount was introduced in 1987 (per a quick wikipedia). The early versions would have been breach mount, while the 1986 would have been the later bayonet style (introduced in 1981).<p>Anyway, my on-the-spectrum reaction aside, I started exploring mirrorless because it facilitated making different types of pictures. Part of that facilitation was it&#x27;s low cost. A used NEX-3, a fotodiox shift adapter (for K mount), and some old manual focus primes was all in for about $300. I got a camera with front shift that fit in a (largish) pocket. 14mp will about cover 10&quot;x15&quot; printed at 300dpi and is overkill for anything online.<p>I find manual focus with focus peaking satisfying. It&#x27;s slower but when it misses it misses because of my technique not the way the camera interprets the scene. I don&#x27;t get as many mis-focused pictures. I learn from those I get. The fixes are obvious. I don&#x27;t feel I need to make more &quot;just to be safe.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the biggest thing for me with mirrorless. My workflow has become much simpler. I don&#x27;t take extra pictures just to be sure. I can see how the shadows and highlights will render in the viewfinder. I can adjust the contrast and saturation and color profile and white balance in camera while looking at the scene.<p>But, it&#x27;s made me heretical. I no longer shoot RAW...though there are situations where I would...just JPG. My workflow is simpler because I don&#x27;t spend time trying to fix pictures. Color, shadow, and highlights were either pretty close in camera or I didn&#x27;t take it.<p>Even better for my workflow, JPG&#x27;s are tiny. Memory cards don&#x27;t fill up. Disks don&#x27;t fill up. Downloads are faster. Backups are faster. And there are fewer files because I know that I got it when I made it.<p>But...I don&#x27;t shoot sports anymore. I don&#x27;t shoot wildlife anymore either. I&#x27;m not chasing birds in flight. My pictures were shifting as my gear was. Both still are. Mirrorless changed the way I was making pictures. The more a piece of gear does that, the more interested in it I am. YMMV.')
