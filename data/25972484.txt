The account that posted it was banned. Posts by banned accounts are killed by default.<p>You&#x27;re right that the parent was a good contribution and deserved to be unkilled. That&#x27;s what vouching is for, and you made an excellent use of it.<p>Banning on HN isn&#x27;t punitive, it&#x27;s preventative. When a banned account has changed its ways and has reliably been sticking to HN&#x27;s rules for a while now, we&#x27;re happy to unban it. If people see cases like that, they should email hn@ycombinator.com so we can look into it. That&#x27;s a fine way to watch out for a fellow user.<p>When a banned account <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> been reliably sticking to HN&#x27;s rules for long enough, or hasn&#x27;t posted enough to decide that yet, it stays banned for obvious reasons. In that case their good posts can still be unkilled, just on a comment-by-comment basis. That&#x27;s why we created vouching and it works well.')
