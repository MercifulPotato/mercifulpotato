Doesn’t matter really if it’s google cloud, on prem, AWS or whatever, it is the same.<p>The idea being that it abstracts away a lot of the toil work of ops, with the very obvious caveat that you don’t know what the sausage factory is doing.<p>I’m pretty kubernetes neutral, some of the concepts are great and deserve replication. (Kube-dns + etcd!, sidecars, scheduling to a cluster)<p>Some are pitfalls that might cost a lot of people a lot of time in the future. (Networking and storage abstractions being prominent examples)<p>But as with everything, it’s pros and cons, the complexity being a pretty large con in my personal opinion. I say this as a person who is currently converting a lot of stuff to kubernetes because it solves some particular problems we have really well.')
