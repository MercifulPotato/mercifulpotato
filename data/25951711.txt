Prepare for hysterical clamouring.<p>Both the hedge funds who wrote the put contracts and RH took positions nice, high, steady returns and long tail risk. The press is reporting Melvin Capital wrote put options with a face value circa $55m, for example. The long tail risk materialized. Damage is several $bn.<p>It seems like systemic risk means risk to heads-I-win-tails-you-lose games. This is why the hysteria. This whole thing is a symbol of a rigged system, with the typical patterns of insiders. 9 times out of 10, they win. 1 time out of 10 they pull the fire alarm.<p>Insiders, from the CEO of the NASDAQ to whoever makes the clearing house rules have come out swiftly and in force to suspend norms and call a literal &quot;all bets are off.&quot; Closing buys, but not sells. Liquidating positions. How is this not a rigged game.<p>It is enraging to hear &quot;be reasonable, we all have to be responsible&quot; from these people.')
