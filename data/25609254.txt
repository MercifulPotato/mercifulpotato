Why would that be any different in code that deals with concurrency??<p>I know you&#x27;re speaking more broadly about abstraction as well as concurrency, but I share the GP&#x27;s instincts on this. Because of the limitations (or rather the lack of limitations) in languages like C++ or Java its very easy write code that undoes any useful work a concurrency abstraction might provide.<p>These abstractions are still useful! But they still require above average knowledge of their internals compared to say data-structures.<p>With concurrency, things just don&#x27;t compose that well without a ton of implicit best practices. The most trivial example is using a FooServiceClient from multiple threads and that ends up secretly holding long-lived locks internally essentially serializing your whole server. It happens accidentally <i>all the time</i>.')
