I miss those days. Everything in one application, no browser -&gt; server communication delay. You just assumed a minimum screen size of 640x480 and made sure it fit into that. No mobile responsive bullshit, no CSS malarky to deal with. What you drew in Visual Studio is exactly what the user got.<p>But there was also a lot of boilerplate involved. No handy-dandy open-source libraries sitting around on the internet that could just be pulled in to deal with a task. You could buy a COM object or a commercial visual control, but it was rare and expensive. If you were doing tricky things you had to work it out yourself the hard way, and make mistakes doing it.<p>Now... most programmers I know are plumbers wiring up different ready-made product APIs using a script language.<p>Yeah, I think jasode is right - we&#x27;re 10x as productive now, and I think that&#x27;s because of the popularity of Open Source and Stack Overflow rather than IDE&#x27;s (if anything modern IDE&#x27;s are less productive than 1990&#x27;s era Visual Studio). However the business tasks have got 10x more complex. And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s unconnected - things that were previously too complex&#x2F;difficult&#x2F;expensive are now routine, and we&#x27;re now expected to do more.')
