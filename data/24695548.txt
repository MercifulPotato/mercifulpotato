I move job and my new work place used to manage everything in excel. Something&#x27;s still are. Realising excel could not scale, and with no support for IT for a proper solution the &quot;tech&quot; guy (that is good with computers but not a developer) was tasked with creating a &quot;database&quot;. What we now have is essentially 3 excel spreadsheet tables in access that you can run SQL on and input data using access forms. No normalisation, no well anything really. We&#x27;re now coming to the point where access is creaking at the seams. I&#x27;m confident with properly designed tables and queries we wouldn&#x27;t be, and I&#x27;m no expert either, but it will have to fail before there&#x27;s a concerted effort to redesign or god forbid IT do there jobs.')
