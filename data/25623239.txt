There is a team review.  If there are strong objections (i.e beyond suggestions) a comparative doc is written with a summary from both positions and a commentary from each side on each other&#x27;s position (~1-2 pages).  Then one or more senior technical engineers make a call and document why in the document.  After this decision, the discussion is closed for a TTL agreed to in the comparative doc (i.e lets try this for six months and re-evaluate).  This is all documented in a project&#x27;s decision log.   This allows decisions to be quickly made with accountability for decision makers while giving anyone on the team an opportunity to propose an alternative approach.  Ideally, given a need&#x2F;objective you are usually considering multiple approaches which is a good opportunity for junior engineers to contribute to processes usually dominated by more senior engineers (i.e even asking a junior engineer to write a document arguing, &quot;we do nothing&quot; as an option is useful).  Basically make sure this is <i>encouraged</i> in the organization and so that culturally this is celebrated and is seen as just an important of a contribution as authoring the &#x27;winning&#x27; design.')
