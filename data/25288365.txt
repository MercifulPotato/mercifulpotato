Everyone thinks they&#x27;re special. Why does Coca Cola have a different bottle shape compared to Pepsi or to Fanta? That makes no sense.<p>We should turn the approach on its head with what is a dangerous material: you should have to prove that what you&#x27;re doing deserves being made. Have you thought about the consequences of your actions when this product is mass produced, 30 years from now? I doubt many have.<p>The standard catalog could have more axes, such as different material types, mine was just an example.<p>Get 10 world famous materials engineers and have them come out with a catalog that covers the most widespread uses.<p>This doesn&#x27;t need to be a 100% solution, it needs to cover, say, 95%. The rest of the 5% could be treated as exceptions and you&#x27;d have to get a license. Yes, some creativity would be lost. But you could for example, exempt some smaller producers (if your factory makes fewer than 10k units per year, in total, no need for approval, just show us the proof that you&#x27;re only going to produce that much).<p>But again, plastics have proven to be dangerous materials, in an insidious way. They&#x27;re not explosives but they do a lot of damage.')
