The initial version is basically an inventory system that people can use to track inter-species breeding using QR codes on the plant. Probably the coolest bit about Haworthias is the different colours and shades you get by combining them. However, the interesting part to me is the family tree of a particular plant. How cool would it be if you can see the ancestors for each Haworthia plant and then whey you buy from a breeder you not only get a good looking plant but almost a bit of history as well?')
