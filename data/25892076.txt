You can display the counter on any device which has access to the web and you can update the counter value using UI or programmatically with a HTTP GET request. The counter can be used for anything you imagine, as long as it&#x27;s a number - e.g. the number of pushups you have done this year, the number of days you have worked remotely, the current value of your investment portfolio.\nHopefully you will find it useful! All feedback and ideas are welcome!')
