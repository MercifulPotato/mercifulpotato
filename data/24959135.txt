The way you make it in the towing industry (in cities) is to make friends with the police.  It&#x27;s no surprise that people with those friends feel emboldened to do things normal people can&#x27;t get away with.<p>This dynamic is the fault of the government for creating a captive market and secondarily the fault of insurance for divorcing many consumers from the costs of that captive market.<p>In rural areas where there&#x27;s not much money to be made towing the tow operators don&#x27;t do bad business to make a buck.  They use their capital investment to haul things other than cars to make their gravy money.')
