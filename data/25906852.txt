It&#x27;s awesome. Basically tweaking geometry and physics and colour to makes stuff look like the client wants it to look like.<p>I love the familiarity with the tools in my speciality. Been doing it for 20 years. Graduated from University with a bachelors in it.<p>There is stress available for the hungry. I&#x27;ve happily weaseled my way into a tiny boutique (30 people) studio with experienced and lovely owners that prioritize the crew (80% senior artists). Basically no OT, 100K$+ year, excellent health coverage (not in the USA), healthy relaxed and skilful coworkers. Dunno what could be better. And no, I have no entrepreneurial drive, happy to work for someone else.')
