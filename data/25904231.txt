They are buying Samsung&#x27;s phone or Google&#x27;s phone the hardware and it comes preinstalled with Android but that&#x27;s not part of what you are paying for. Whereas, with Apple they are throttling the performance of the phone you paid for with software you cannot remove or swap out or opt out of (since you didn&#x27;t know the software update comes with degraded performance).<p>I also think this way of thinking is shortsighted and missing the big picture, but it&#x27;s probably the thought process here.')
