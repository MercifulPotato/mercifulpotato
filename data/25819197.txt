Well, it&#x27;s all about how valuable your skills are. Make sure you can do things that other people can&#x27;t, and you put yourself in a position where you always have the option to go work for another company.<p>I think GP was talking about workers in general, not just software developers. Software developers are in a super entitled position when it comes to this. Not every grocery store cashier, McDonald&#x27;s worker, taxi driver, etc. can be expected to &quot;do things other people can&#x27;t&quot;.')
