If I open 10k TCP connections to your server and drip feed http requests 1 byte at a time on each connection, what happens?<p>You used to be able to easily DOS apache servers this way, because you just needed enough concurrent connections to exhaust its thread pool and then it wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle any more requests. And then you need a bit rate on each connection just high enough not to trip apache&#x27;s connection timeout. (So like, 20 TCP connections each sending 1 byte every 20 seconds would do it. Not sure about today but Apache used to be brought to its knees with 1 bps of bandwidth.)<p>You could probably mitigate this by putting nginx in front of your server, but this works because nginx uses async internally to handle requests. And that won&#x27;t work if you ever do proxy passthrough (for SSE, websockets, etc).')
