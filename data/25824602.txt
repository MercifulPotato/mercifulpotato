I hope this will make asking about costs at the hospital more normal!<p>I once went to a doctor for vaccinations before traveling.  The nurse said &quot;You need X, I recommend Y, and the CDC recommends Z.&quot;  I responded &quot;great, let&#x27;s get X right now.  Not sure about Y or Z - how much do they cost?&quot;<p>The question just didn&#x27;t compute.  No matter how I phrased it (&quot;just want to price compare&quot; ... &quot;there&#x27;s a bunch of travel clinics and I&#x27;m trying to get this cheaply&quot; etc), I couldn&#x27;t make myself understood.<p>The NP ended up coming in to give me their &quot;anti-vax&quot; spiel. I had walked in to a hospital wanting a vaccine, and asking about costs was so foreign to them that they thought the only reason I could hesitate to get a vaccine was anti-vax sentiment.<p>All this to say - this tool is very much needed, and has the potential to do a lot of good!')
