In my own experience, I&#x27;ve found that &quot;I&#x27;ll just do pushups and stuff&quot; means I won&#x27;t stick with it, because it&#x27;s difficult for me to really measure progress and I get easily discouraged without a training plan.<p>What sports or fitness celebrities inspire you? Have you ever watched American Ninja Warrior or anything like that? That&#x27;s one of the things that inspires me on my fitness journey. I&#x27;m primarily a runner, but I cross train with strength and climbing as much as I can. I still can&#x27;t do more than two pull-ups, but someday...<p>As for resources, &#x2F;r&#x2F;fitness and &#x2F;r&#x2F;bodyweight on Reddit have a bunch of decent resources. The latter is especially useful because they can provide some really good routines that incorporate only yourself, so you won&#x27;t need equipment or anything else. If all else fails, hire a personal trainer. Even in this COVID era, they can coach you over video call, and if you do that for a few weeks, you should have enough workouts to keep yourself busy on your own for a while.<p>My final tip is to do at least 10 minutes of exercise per day. You can do <i>anything</i> for 10 minutes a day. If after 10 minutes I&#x27;m bored or I&#x27;m tired or I just plain don&#x27;t want to continue, then I give myself permission to quit. (I&#x27;ve been doing this for years and i&#x27;ve never actually stopped after 10 minutes... the hardest part about working out is STARTING!)<p>Anyway, good luck!')
