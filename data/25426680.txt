A DSL at the end of the day is just a specialized, idealized schema for data representation. Most of its advantages would also apply (in varying degrees) to storing business information as JSON, or in SQL tables, or as s-expressions for that matter. In any of these cases we get the same benefits of portability, introspectability, automation, etc.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that DSLs are useless. In many cases they have advantages against the above formats in terms of both what they can, and (just as important) can&#x27;t, express. I just think they&#x27;re part of a bigger conversation.')
