Why can&#x27;t they buy &gt;100% of the shares in exactly the same way they were able to sell &gt;100% of the shares? They buy some shares, return them to their owners, and then buy them up again?<p>They don&#x27;t even need to buy up 100%. They only need to buy up 20%. Then they&#x27;re back in the situation of being under 100% shorted, and problem no longer applies.<p>With such a large short interest it means that a motivated or coordinated buyer can force them to cover it at highly inflated prices, and that&#x27;s their fault. But doesn&#x27;t seem to be impossible just because the interest is &gt;100%, merely very expensive (perhaps bankruptcy expensive).<p>Am I missing something?')
