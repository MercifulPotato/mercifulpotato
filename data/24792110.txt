Or was more complicated than that, and the UN could do much as the veto powers blocked or delayed things? I&#x27;d say it is rather the latter.<p>There were UN troops in Srebrenica, and their failure is a well covered topic. There are multiple resolutions against Israel, the first from the Suez crisis. Most just get ignored, not the least due to US vetos. The Iraq invasion was a purely US thing that had nothing to do with the UN, some NATO members supported it but not all.<p>There is a difference between causing disaster, which the UN didn&#x27;t, and failing to prevent it, which the UN does. Expecting perfect results from one side and no results at all, or close to jone, from the other is just disengnious.')
