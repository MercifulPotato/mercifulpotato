Someone is going to spend all that money and then need a second speaker because of the missing jack. The smart features should add to the device without taking away IMO. I mean it’s just crazy to me. She had $600 worth of speakers with great sound and we could not hook up our own source. It meant that they couldn’t actually be the only speakers she had and significantly reduced their overall value to us. Apple loves to do that I know, but it is a very opinionated design choice and it’s not for me.')
