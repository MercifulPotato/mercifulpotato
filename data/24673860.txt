This particular request is likely to face counter from the American companies.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<p>THIS is the only time, I am more inclined to side with Chinese style of control. Sovereign nation out to decide what is good for their people. India is a chaotic democracy, but  a function one. I will rather support my government&#x27;s way of ensuring &quot;Privacy and Security&quot; than Apple&#x27;s. We do have equally capable people over here. Slowly but surely, things move in positive direction. No need of dictation by any foreign multi-national.<p>The way Google banned PayTM for few hours, until they removed some of the features from the App, come-on, Indian Laws are good enough to decide what is legal &#x2F; correct &#x2F; etc. etc. This was a very visible case of an American company imposing &quot;Their Policy&quot; on things which only court &#x2F; government should get to decide.<p>I am mostly IN with this proposal.<p>EDIT: I guess I used harsh words, but something definitely needs to be done with the current duopoly.')
