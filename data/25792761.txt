Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25793026, 25793019], score=None, time=1610728830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25792566, text='2160×1440 (185ppi) is a touch on the low side, though admittedly very close to 2560×1440 on a 15.6″ display (188ppi; I confess I had that resolution more in mind for a 13″ or 14″ chassis). But definitely far less than the ~275ppi of my Surface Book’s 3000×2000!<p>This definitely looks an interesting machine, but it seems they’re not selling it in Australia, so alas, <i>I</i> can’t get it. Otherwise I’d be very strongly considering it.')
