As has happened to two of my friends.<p>This is something motorcyclists need to be hyper-aware of too. Same idea approaching yellow lights. Here’s a scenario that happens <i>all the time</i>: you’re coming up on a yellow. There’s a car in the intersection ahead waiting to make a left into your path. The car behind you isn’t slowing down, he either isn’t paying attention or wants to run the yellow. What do you do to stay alive?<p>The right answer is to act earlier to avoid that situation in the first place, but there <i>will</i> be times when you find yourself in a bad spot.')
