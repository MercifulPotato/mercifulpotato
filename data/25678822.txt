What does this story tell us about what rioters did or didn&#x27;t do while tearing up the capital building?<p>1 minute of Googling tells me that Colorado is an open-carry state, and there is no specific exclusion for county offices, so unless this was in Denver or another municipality that prohibits open carry I don&#x27;t see the relevance of your story to what happened in the Capitol.')
