Is that true?<p>I don&#x27;t think the cars have the bandwidth to stream it in realtime, but they do upload bits of camera and telemetry data to help train Tesla&#x27;s self-driving software. The car has settings that let you opt out of this data sharing.<p>Regarding location data: That&#x27;s true for most cars sold today and it isn&#x27;t particularly new. How else would cars have turn-by-turn directions? I think it was 2011 when GM began storing GPS data from cars with OnStar. Even if you avoided owning a car with GPS, there&#x27;s still the issue of automatic license plate readers. These days, the only way to guarantee that your drive won&#x27;t be tracked is to steal someone else&#x27;s car.<p>If you&#x27;re like most people, you carry your phone with you. That means that Apple&#x2F;Google knows where you are. Ditto for your phone company and probably quite a few other companies that have apps on your phone. And if you don&#x27;t have a phone or a car, you probably walk past a bunch of cameras every day (including cameras on self-driving vehicles). These cameras will only get smarter and more numerous.<p>Privacy is dead. Most people just don&#x27;t know it yet.')
