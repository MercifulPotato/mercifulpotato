On modern GPUs your example is &quot;scalarized&quot; and results in separate instructions for each vector component. Of course execution is still &quot;vectorized&quot;, but only in the sense of operating on the data for 16&#x2F;32&#x2F;64 threads at once.<p>The reason for this design is that while vec3 and vec4 are common, they are by no means universal in modern shader code. A micro-architecture built on vec3 or vec4 would be under-utilized in the large amounts of shader code that are scalar in the source language.<p>There are <i>some</i> exceptions, e.g. native support for 16-bit vec2 comes naturally on architectures with 32-bit registers. But those are exceptions.')
