Thus, decentralized protocols will ultimately not be able to keep up with the demands of the users.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Nj3YFprqAr8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Nj3YFprqAr8</a><p>Lots of people point to email as an example. I&#x27;d like to also point out the phone system and its codecs as another example. Most phone calls behind the scenes are using SIP to handle connectivity. SIP is codec agnostic, you could technically use any kind of codec in the RTSP stream. Its a very decentralized protocol, and highly extensible. And yet it seems like almost every time you try and place a call, the only codec anyone else supports is G.711, a codec released in 1972 and hasn&#x27;t had a major update since 2000. We&#x27;re slowly seeing G.722 adoption now that the patents have run out (HD voice on cell phones) but even then this is spotty. Meanwhile every other chat platform out there has moved on to more efficient and higher quality codecs because all it took was the chat platform owner to push one version update out.<p>The decentralized communications network is only just now finally adopting and rolling out a _33 year old_ codec. Sure sounds like a win for decentralized systems!')
