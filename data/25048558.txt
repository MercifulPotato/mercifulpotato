Isn&#x27;t that a bit low for SaaS at 7 years? Then there is the mention of running at breakeven most of that time. There are solo founder SaaS businesses making more than that with 80%+ margins. As others have mentioned, you&#x27;d be better off working at a FAANG.<p>So, did something go wrong here? What is it about this analytics business that makes it so expensive to operate? Were all the employees necessary? Was the pricing or marketing wrong? Or is this just the reality of most SaaS?<p>I gotta say, this really puts a damper on what I always thought was a fairly lucrative business model, if you could make it past the early bootstrap&#x2F;product-market-fit period.')
