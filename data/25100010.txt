I think I&#x27;m actually out of it. I once read a HN comment that depression is that your mental model of how you think the world works is severly different to how it actually works. For me, that description was a lot better than anything I&#x27;ve heard in my psychology classes [1].<p>That&#x27;s why I got a mild depression, my view of the world was not suited for the switch from fresh EU grad to working person (long story short: no FAANG interviews, and the one that I did clear at an SF startup later said &quot;not enough experience, good problem solving skills though&quot;).<p>So I got a lot of jealousy&#x2F;envy to my American counter parts when looking for a job. Combine that with not finding a job for 12 months, because of FAANG expectations (I just wanted a shot, never got one at FAANG, it used to feel really painful as I worked 8 years to get all qualifications -- CS bachelor&#x2F;master, TA stuff, professional software dev stuff -- but now I&#x27;m fine with it). It weighed me down. Some people on HN offered referrals, but I always doubted on cashing them in, because I want to feel super certain, which I never do.<p>Ironically, I got a job during COVID (May 2020). The job offer was a mediocre one, but a job is a job, especially after a 12 month search. My contract didn&#x27;t get extended though (I was offered a demotion to a junior role, I didn&#x27;t take it, IMO I&#x27;m not a culture fit), but it doesn&#x27;t matter. The job gave me perspective, it pulled me out of my mild depression (along with some self-applied CBT, meditation, identifying my cognitive distortions, etc.).<p>I have an amazing runway, so I&#x27;m probably going to do a lot of side projects. I&#x27;ve always wanted to do it and it&#x27;s hard to give yourself permission for it, because the risk is insane. Or at least, that&#x27;s how it feels now. Survivorship bias, or lack of it, will tell whether it was insane ;-)<p>I&#x27;m not cut out to be an employee. I&#x27;m too interdisciplinary and want to stay that way (otherwise I&#x27;m going to have some psychological&#x2F;emotional issues). I might be an amazing early employee fit for certain companies, but Dutch startups aren&#x27;t really that entrepreneurial. Which is another part how my mental model doesn&#x27;t fit the real world. As a Dutchie, I&#x27;m too Americanized while not being an American citizen. And I&#x27;m noticing some strong psychological issues (and benefits) with that.<p>So yea, this story goes to show that <i>in my case</i> it was a mix of having a wrong view of the world, checking expectations and learning to not compare myself to others as that gave me chronic stress.<p>I hope it helps someone.
