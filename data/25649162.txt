If you choose the overly conservative choice on dosage you might possibly end up with not meeting your efficacy goals and end up either having to rerun phase III.<p>The duration between doses was chosen because it was the minimum plausible time that the second dose was likely to provide significant additional benefit, and therefore the fastest to test. It&#x27;s entirely plausible given what we know about other vaccines, that delaying the second dose 8-12 weeks may actually have been more effective long-term, but if they&#x27;d done that the end of the testing (and therefore approval) would have been delayed another 4-8 weeks.')
