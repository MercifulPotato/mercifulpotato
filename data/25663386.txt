All the congresspeople were evacuated safely, I expect that if they had any chance of causing harm there the police response would have skyrocketed.<p>What you had after the evacuation was complete was just a few fools breaking some windows, posing on the dias for Twitter likes, and wandering the hallways. I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t spray painted their message on the walls yet.<p>Government property gets vandalized all the time, and can be replaced. The last thing you want to do is to kill these people who have been trapped in a cult of disinformation and turn them into martyrs, possibly building into a civil war. Currently, the response makes them look weak, but at the end of the day they&#x27;ll all just leave, hopefully without loss of life.<p>That civil war must be avoided at all costs, and if a tepid-looking response, a few of them getting away without being arrested, a few panes of glass, and some carpet cleaning are what that costs, then I&#x27;m more than happy to pay it.<p>I&#x27;m less enthusiastic about the criminals at the top escaping prison time, as Joe Biden seems intent on allowing per his messaging, but again, if prosecuting everyone complicit in the previous administration&#x27;s crimes has a 1% chance of inciting civil war, well, it&#x27;s just not worth it.')
