It’s really hard to get something working well at scale:<p>- REST is simple, but you end up with serial waterfalls for complex fetches.<p>- GraphQL avoids these waterfalls and lets you collocate declarative data with your components. This is great if your server layer supports it well.<p>- You also need a way to fetch all descendants’ data high up the tree (to avoid serial fetches). Relay does this with a compilation step, and requires passing pointers back down the tree for runtime use.<p>- Updating data (POST, PUT, Mutations) is super tricky to do in a way that keeps data consistent, avoids over-fetching, handles exceptions and idempotence and retries right, etc.<p>I wish there was a standard here, but I think we’re still pretty far from it.')
