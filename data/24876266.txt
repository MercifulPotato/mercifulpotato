You have to give up the &#x27;easy&#x27; way of life you currently have to trade for <i>some</i> success rate for your own goal.<p>To practice this and it makes more sense. I recently quit my decent job despite I was doing great. I spent a while to fully-convince myself, and I realize I don&#x27;t really care about status, and wasn&#x27;t feeling I was achieving anything. But I live in a relatively judgemental country. When I communicate this idea with my collegues many wouldn&#x27;t understand it. When I communicate with my parent I recieve immediate objection, then I receive quit some interruptive phone calls from them telling me go back to work. In practice it take more to be low-status.')
