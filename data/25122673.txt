We previously did our server setup manually, but we could automate the whole process pretty quickly (I would say 2-3 times the time it costs to set up one deployment manually). The YAML is a bit limiting, as others mention, but to be honest for our use case I&#x27;m not sure that we would want to use a more complicated tool instead - there are already more than enough different components and languages in our stack.')
