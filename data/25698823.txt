I call my mom on Whatsapp and there is not way this can change. Both of us are going to use Whatsapp. This is just an anecdotal example of network effects.<p>But this is also not a winner take all market as I think of it. I am a heavy user of telegram and massive broadcasts happen on Telegram. College students, Twitter handles banned on Twitter etc. have switched to telegram. You subscribe to a channel of a banned user and there is nothing Telegram can do about it.<p>Signal is especially popular among my political activist friends and few other friends.<p>Kik remains popular for some narrow cases I will not mention here.')
