Item(by='SV_BubbleTime', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610656358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25780633, text='&gt; when we’re talking about one specific group of crazies that just attempted an insurrection and got 5 people killed in the Capitol.<p>Thats only because you are choosing to talk about that exclusively. You aren’t taking into account the violence and destruction about BLM.<p>I mean, a known BLM voice&#x2F;advocate went and murdered 5 cops, and not one bit of that blew back at BLM the Org, because no one forced them to own their crazies. None of the destruction, murder and lawlessness over the summer blew back on BLM, Dems, Antifa.<p>It’s not whataboutism when it’s similar events. A whataboutism would be if someone said “the left doesn’t need to own their crazies because Obama faced criticism for Benghazi”.')
