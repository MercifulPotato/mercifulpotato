There were a lot I was missing out on I found, also, at the same time I was trying to move to a Mediterranean diet.<p>A diet of a lot more plants like the Mediterranean diet meant I met all my RDI&#x27;s, whereas a normal meat and 3 veg, cereal for breakfast western diet didn&#x27;t - things like vitamin E and so on were a lot easier to get with the Mediterranean diet, though for things like Zinc I had to start eating nuts and so on - something I&#x27;d never done much.<p>It surprised me that the things that seem to stop cancer (according to some studies) were exactly the same things that are more prevalent in the Mediterranean diet, it became a bit of a no brainer. Give it a go (I&#x27;m just a happy customer - its free any way with a paid tier)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cronometer.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cronometer.com</a>')
