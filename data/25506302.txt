Item(by='garphunkle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608645552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505418, text='My attempt at a summary:<p>Ripple refers to &quot;spatial-reuse&quot;: a phenomenon where a train of packets spread from an originator uninterrupted.<p>With Ripple, nodes can only transmit DATA when they have received the &quot;talking stick&quot; (token) from the upstream originator. A downstream node can request a token with the new MAC frame: ready-to-receive. With their simulation, a node is always in either a TX, RX, or Listen state with equal proportions, so you have 1&#x2F;3rd spatial-reuse.<p>This solves a problem in 802.11 where physical layer collision avoidance is sub-optimal for link utilization. Other protocols I am familiar with solve this with beacons to synchronize guaranteed time slots (a mode of IEEE 802.15.4), or they adopt a similar RTS&#x2F;CTS scheme which can suffer from the hidden node problem.<p>What I cannot picture in my own head is how a packet can swim upstream: this protocol has a strong notion of upstream&#x2F;downstream.')
