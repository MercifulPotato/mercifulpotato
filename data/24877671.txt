The exporting of originals is always somehow difficult due to random bugs. Lately I&#x27;ve had to resort to Takeout with some relatives to migrate them to Dropbox where they&#x27;re not locked in, and about 20% of the photos don&#x27;t contain any exported metadata. It&#x27;s ridiculous since Google Photos shows those same pictures clearly on the timeline, indicating it does know when they were take, it just excludes that information from the Takeout.')
