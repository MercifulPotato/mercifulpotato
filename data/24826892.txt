Item(by='stinos', descendants=None, kids=[24831164], score=None, time=1603119156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826338, text='<i>Ikea said that anything that cannot be resold will be recycled.</i><p>Is that even technically possible? &#x27;Most of it&#x27;, perhaps, though for some of the materials they use I&#x27;d really like to see the technical side of how they o it, but &#x27;anything&#x27; seems far fetched.<p><i>This move is primarily meant to counter people throwing away furniture prematurely when moving</i><p>Yes, I&#x27;m not denying that. This is what they are doing, but at the same time they are saying <i>hopes that the initiative will help its customers take a stand against excessive consumption</i>. My point being: where is the link between those 2?<p>So just to be clear: I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good idea or not, probably leaning towards good, but with a bunch of considerations in mind: selling their things second hand or even giving away is what people also have been doing already. In case of selling they get back money, with IKEA they&#x27;ll get back vouchers, limited to 50%. Imo it adds to the idea that recycling is good. It is, but only if there really is recycling (for some products it&#x27;s a complete myth pushed by the industry) and even then, not having to recycle in the first place is better. From the article: <i>should then return them - fully assembled - to the returns desk</i> - this sounds like they&#x27;re expecting people to transport complete things (or disassmble&#x2F;reassemble on the spot). That&#x27;s kind of a showstopper.<p><i>This seems like it would be better for the environment than everybody logging around heavy furniture cross-country (or cross-continent), because unnecessary transport costs are avoided</i><p>This is tricky. Current system: buy X, transport X home, transport X to landfill. Or with second hand: buy X, transport X home, transport X to new home. New system: buy X, transport X home, transport X back to IKEA, transport X to new home or landfill. So there are a lot of variables to consider here so I wouldn&#x27;t be suprised if ot turns out to be sometimes better and sometimes worse, i.e. really hard to use it in an argument of it being better overall.<p><i>good luck convincing people not to use a bed, a desk or a dining room table.</i><p>To state the obvious: that is not at all what this is about and as far as I can tell I also never gave that impression in my comment. It&#x27;s about teaching people about the value of durability, i.e. convincing people they do not have to buy a new bed or desk every x years. Now how do you achive that? I honestly don&#x27;t know for sure. But seeing that previous generations had no (or much less) problems with that, it means it&#x27;s something which is teacheable, so I&#x27;d start with that. As a push back agains consumerism, educate the young ones and explain them there are cases where it is possible to buy one thing for a lifetime (or so), that there is nothing wrong with buying second had goods, etc.')
