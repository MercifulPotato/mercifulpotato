The original left-pad problem was due to it being deleted from NPM itself. It wasn&#x27;t a package served by a CDN like jQuery. Its deletion from NPM prevented people from starting new projects or re-fetching dependencies, not websites from working.<p>And the issue of CDNs being offline or deleting packages can be solved by vendoring dependencies, which is possible without Webpack and was already the common practice for more than a decade before using CDNs for dependencies became super popular.')
