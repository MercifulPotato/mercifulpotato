Like the 8 core GPU, the Icestorm cores, the neural engine cores.<p>Or is the fact that the physical distance is so close with the newer process that a small timing delay doesn&#x27;t matter any more.<p>If the firestorm cores are laid out correctly, those make sense to be symmetrical.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16226&#x2F;M1.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16226&#x2F;M1.png</a>')
