What matters the most is your current company - and by that I mean the name of your current company.<p>He is so much right here. Recruiters don&#x27;t have the time to go through and understand your side projects, for that matter even engineers don&#x27;t. Most interviews are 45-60 mins, you need to scope your interview such that the process remains same for all candidates. If someone is just beginning out then side projects matter a lot but for hiring experienced people, most won&#x27;t care about side projects unless they got significant traction.<p>Also, it is incredibly hard to judge side projects. Sure, I can go through your Github repo if it is open source, open 2-3 files to see code structure, see the automation suite you have setup but unless the project was complex there is not much to talk about. For experienced folks, there are other metrics you need to gauge them on which are absent in hobby projects.')
