I&#x27;ve spent the past year with Rider as my main IDE, and surprisingly there have been very few things that I miss from Visual Studio (mostly related to profiling tools).  On the other hand, there are several irritations in VS that make it feel decidedly not best in class, for me at least (extreme slowness on startup, but also on a variety of frequent tasks such as switching between files, compiler getting out of sync with reality and listing errors that have been fixed minutes ago, the WinForms editor refusing to open a screen for whatever reason, etc).  While it&#x27;s a decent IDE for sure, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d rate it all that high, and would argue that at least the JetBrains family are on par in most cases.<p>So an honest question: what exactly do people see in VS as being so outstanding, that other IDEs lack?')
