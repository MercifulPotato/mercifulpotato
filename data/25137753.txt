Ultimately a water tight productivity system, like GTD, allows one to choose for oneself what one considers the most important to work on. If you decide that the most important thing in your job is to always answer every email, that is great. You can create yourself a schedule with lots of room for answering email and move all other tasks to left over time slots. If you decide, on the other hand, that working in deep concentration on hard programming tasks is the main thing of your job you can do that too and reserve only half an hour a day for answering as much email as can be done in half an hour or for other adminstrative tasks. In all jobs there are usually more things that could be done than things  that actually get done and a water tight productivity system, like GTD makes sure one can focus on what one considers important.')
