Item(by='vanattab', descendants=None, kids=[24971948, 24974149, 24974652, 24972734], score=None, time=1604343379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971323, text='I recently had my phone fixed at a uBreakiFix location and at and on the bottom of the credit card receipt it has a contract written at the bottom that among other things says your waving privacy rights, property rights to your old parts, swear you have read some link to a TOS. When checking out they never mentioned any of that when signing the receipt (with the exception of the not returning the parts when I told them I would like them back).  In my option any contractual language should have to me signed for separately then a CC receipt.<p>EDIT: with that said they did a great job fixing my phone with an hour or two.')
