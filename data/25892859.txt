You should be ashamed.</i><p>This is hollier than thou virtue signalling on your part. You should be shunned.<p>Also, hypocritical. You&#x27;re against &quot;frail little minds&quot; but are OK with yourself using &quot;disgusting behavior&quot; and &quot;you should be ashamed&quot;, like some tv-evangelist...<p>&gt;<i>Even more so for the mental gymnastics youâ€™ve written in this spastic and bizarre comment to defend and endorse using flippantly insulting language.</i><p>No mental gymanstics required. Devs are adults. The &quot;ocassional flippantly insulting language&quot; if fine and has been part of team work since forever.<p>Not to mention TFA author didn&#x27;t target anyone in particular, but a category of people with zealotic behavior.<p>If you can&#x27;t call out stupid ideas as stupid, and zealots as such, then we&#x27;ve regressed at childish levels of protection from the real world (which perhaps is all the rage in some rapidly infantilizing areas of the world, enabled early by helicopter parents).')
