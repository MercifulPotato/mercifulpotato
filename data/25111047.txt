Some people can work on simpler desktops like XFCE and GNOME faster.<p>I just had to reboot my Linux workstation because building&#x27;s UPS batteries had to be exchanged. Otherwise it runs for years unless I reboot.<p>That half-baked desktop operating system is way more flexible and faster in some tasks when compared to macOS. Vice versa is also equally valid.<p>Currently I use Linux and macOS daily. I&#x27;d never buy an apple Desktop while I&#x27;d never buy a non-apple laptop (because of hardware, mainly).<p>Moreover, if Debian can achieve 7+ hours of battery life on an old EliteBook 850G2 with onboard graphics, it&#x27;s possible to use apple hardware as power efficient with Linux.')
