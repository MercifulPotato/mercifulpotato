Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612208329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25991812, text='&gt; Why is it so unreasonable to suggest that professors might create their own problem sets and tests?<p>Because creating a problem set or test that 1) is pedagogically useful and 2) solvable in a defined amount of time is a <i>very difficult problem</i> and certainly takes up a lot of time.<p>My solution to Chegg is to make assignments and tests that you don&#x27;t need to answer every question for and put a couple <i>REALLY</i> difficult problems on things--technically solvable by the class by effectively not due to complexity&#x2F;time.  In a CS class, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy to create simple looking problems that spiral out of control.  I&#x27;ve occasionally done it even when I didn&#x27;t mean to.  :(<p>Anyone submitting a correct answer to it gets my <i>detailed</i> attention for cheating.<p>In addition, in a technical track, I do point out that not learning my class, which is a prerequisite, will absolutely kill you in the next class.<p>Between the fact that the universities that I have worked with <i>will and have</i> expelled people for cheating and the fact that my course is a prerequisite, I seem to have dissuaded the cheaters to take other professors.  :)<p>Alternatively, they&#x27;re just that good at cheating.  Fortunately, the students who need to cheat are generally not smart enough to cheat well, either.')
