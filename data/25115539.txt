I wonder if firms are just trying to find the right post to take advantage of this.<p>I think the good lawsuit elements are:\n-incorrect statement about some big group with defined membership. Maybe a Facebook group with 500k+\n-harm as a result of the statement, preferably with something that is made better with like 20 counseling sessions at $200 a pop\n-lots of shares of the incorrect statement<p>So it could end up as something simple as a form where group members can choose to get cash as some percentage of 20x$200 unless they opt out.<p>Facebook would pay $2B (500000x20x200) with the law firm taking 30%.<p>This should be repeatable and will turn Facebook&#x2F;Google (through YouTube)&#x2F;Twitter into the new mesothelioma&#x2F;lung cancer cash cow (see Owens Corning and Phillip Morris).')
