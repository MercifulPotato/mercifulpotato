The missing component to Substack was the discovery&#x2F;social mechanism. From a strategic perspective, it&#x27;s easier to bolt on newsletter sending than it is to build a new social network.<p>So this was always a huge risk for Substack as a platform. But hey, there&#x27;s also an alternate universe where Twitter stays dumb and lazy and never crushes Substack. So I see why investors took the risk.<p>But I see no path forward for Substack if Twitter manages to not completely botch this.')
