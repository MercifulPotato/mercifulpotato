This is referring to construction, not operation. But a critical mind will obviously come to the conclusion that a higher number of reactors in operation will also increase the risk of failures during operation, unless the risk per reactor is reduced at the same time. And since all big accidents were &#x27;exceptional&#x27; in some sense anyway, more &#x27;moving parts&#x27; mean more chance for exceptional circumstances. There is no need to hide that fact.<p>The reason small reactors are in fashion is that (like renewables) they decrease the risk for investors, not the population at large.')
