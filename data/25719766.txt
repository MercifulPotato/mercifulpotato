DWORD is a macro for an unsigned 32-bit integer. It has been around since the first version of Windows.h, along with BYTE and WORD for unsigned 8-bit and 16-bit integers.<p>Any old-time Win16 or Win32 programmer like Joel or me would know the term and be likely to use it in the context of Windows programming.<p>Keep in mind that Windows.h predated the modern definitions like uint32_t by many years. The original Windows developers had to come up with <i>some</i> names for these data types. It doesn&#x27;t mean they weren&#x27;t &quot;real&quot; programmers.<p>Although I suppose, given that floating point processors were far from being standard equipment at the time, you could argue that they were <i>integer</i> programmers...')
