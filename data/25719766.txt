DWORD is a macro for an unsigned 32-bit integer. It has been around since the first version of Windows.h, along with BYTE for an unsigned 8-bit value and WORD for an unsigned 16-bit value.<p>Any old-time Win16 or Win32 programmer like Joel or me would know the term and be likely to use it.<p>Keep in mind that Windows.h predated the modern definitions like uint32_t by many years. The original Windows developers had to come up with <i>some</i> names for these data types.')
