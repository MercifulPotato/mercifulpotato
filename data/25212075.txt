I also deeply miss the easy chats we used to have in the office, when we didn&#x27;t have to schedule meetings just to talk. But I don&#x27;t want to dedicate my time to sitting in a discord-like audio channel while I&#x27;m doing work.<p>So, heysync is the answer to my own problems. It has a similar feature set to IRC or to Slack, because I love those products, but it&#x27;s built with asynchronous audio communication in mind, in a way a Slack app just couldn&#x27;t provide.<p>You just talk, and heysync transcribes the message and stores the audio for easy playback. Your colleagues can either read or listen to what you just said. They can listen live, or later, so you can seamlessly talk even if the person you&#x27;re talking to isn&#x27;t there, or is multitasking.<p>0 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heysync.chat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heysync.chat</a><p>(edit: I was downvoted pretty hard for contributing this -- if anyone wants to share why, here or via email at carss.w@gmail.com, I would love to learn how to do so better.)')
