Item(by='Tor3', descendants=None, kids=[25121742, 25121708], score=None, time=1605605292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121558, text='Agreed - I started to use version control back with SCCS somewhen in the early nineties, and RCS, CVS, Subversion, ClearCase, some Microsoft horror with a name I can&#x27;t recall, and a few others. My conclusion is exactly the same as yours: &quot;<i>Git is the simplest version control system I&#x27;ve ever used.</i>&quot; And it also improved my overview over what happens and has happened in the past - I can jump back in for stuff I haven&#x27;t touched for many years.  So I now think of the older version control systems I used over the years as simple &quot;snapshot backup&quot; systems, not real version control.\n(NB: I&#x27;ve never actively used Mercurial, other than because some projects use it, so I&#x27;m not comparing Git and Mercurial, or the other one or two systems with similarities.)')
