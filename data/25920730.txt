The question is what value is there to setting this up? Especially the way that HIV&#x2F;AIDS was originally and to a certain extent still is stigmatized.  Many people have had friends or family die of AIDS and still refuse to acknowledge that was the reason for their death.<p>The end result is that not only is this type of project more valuable for a new and rapidly spreading disease like COVID, the bar that the value needs to clear to justify this system is also higher because an HIV&#x2F;AIDS status is considered more private from a societal standpoint (not necessarily a legal one).')
