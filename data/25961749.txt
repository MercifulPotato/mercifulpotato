Item(by='tonfa', descendants=None, kids=[25963098, 25961819, 25961880], score=None, time=1611950980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961550, text='&gt; So my next question is, why is that?<p>Don&#x27;t most brokers allow you to continue trading before settlement? (so someone has to put collateral for that)<p>I guess most traders would complain if they had to wait two days after every trade :)<p>Edit, maybe best is to look at the explanation from Money Stuff:<p>&gt; But at some level of volatility things break down. If a stock is really worth $400 on Monday and $20 on Wednesday, there is a risk that a lot of the people who bought it on Monday wonâ€™t show up with cash on Wednesday. Something very bad happened to them between Monday and Wednesday; some of them might not have made it. You need to make sure the collateral is sufficient to cover that risk.')
