It isn&#x27;t new data though, just different variations of the same data. You also tend to do multiple training passes over the data, even after augmentation.<p>None of that is the point though: a child can look at a single static image (not 100 different perspectives - just one perspective) of a horse, and learn to recognize a horse. A standard machine learning model cannot, no matter how much you augment the image.')
