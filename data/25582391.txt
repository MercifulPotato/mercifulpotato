Item(by='lmilcin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609341738, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582250, text='I have a bunch of STM32 Nucleo and Discovery boards that I use and which one I use will depend on circumstances.<p>For prototyping I use both breadboards and perfboards. I use breadboards for small fast prototypes and perfboards when I know I am going to develop it over a longer time or when I have some special requirements (like AC power on board or a component that has 2.54mm pitch but is not breadboardable) that exclude or make it more difficult to use on a breadboard.<p>For breadboard I would default to use STM32L432 Nucleo-32 which is breadboardable and doesn&#x27;t use much space.<p>For perfboard I default on either STM32L452 Nucleo-64 or STM32F303 Discovery. I don&#x27;t solder them to board but instead just insert it in the board and then put couple of pieces of plastic from 2.54mm pitch header with the metal pins removed. This mounts the board securely in place without having to solder it. I use dupont jumper wires to connect it to the rest of the board where I would typically solder the rest of components (unless I also don&#x27;t want to solder them in for some reason).<p>I would typically solder in things that are disposable to me that I don&#x27;t want to flap around.')
