Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25336136], score=None, time=1607360585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332688, text='The economic disadvantage of slavery is the same one as that of communism -- people don&#x27;t work as hard or as smart when they don&#x27;t receive the fruits of their labor.<p>So now someone has a factory. They could, in theory, buy slaves and try to get them to work in the factory. But you would run away or, if you stayed, have no desire to work hard because you&#x27;re not getting paid.<p>Or, the factory could &quot;buy&quot; slaves and offer them a buy-out mechanism. The factory pays $500, but after you make 1000 widgets, you get your freedom. The factory earns $800 from 1000 widgets, so that&#x27;s a profitable deal for them. The former slave gets out of slavery as soon as they make 1000 widgets, so they have the incentive to make widgets. Try to get someone to make widgets as a slave without any reward and they only make 500 widgets, and then the factory would have to pay $500 to get $400. So the factory that ultimately frees the slaves out-competes the one that doesn&#x27;t, and the slaves get freed.')
