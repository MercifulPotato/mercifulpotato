In that case the browser will make a preflight options request (without any data) to check the CORS response headers configured by the server.  Only then, if allowed by the response headers, will the browser actually make the POST.<p>---<p>Ok, I went and looked, apparently you can send POSTS, you just can&#x27;t send application&#x2F;json, only one of the default form content types (text&#x2F;plain is one, though).<p>So I&#x27;m wrong - At least for Firefox, this would likely be the same request with the same behavior.')
