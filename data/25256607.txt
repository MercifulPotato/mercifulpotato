I think that&#x27;s not a real solution because that can change at any time. A request sent is a request sent, relying on the server to block it is the opposite of what TOR initially stood for.<p>I witnessed at least the Leanplum SDK taking action, and I thought I broke the App tbh. After a restart of the phone and clearing all caches via the Settings App I could verify that it happened a second time.<p>But I have no idea whether it was a &quot;chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot; Page with an externally included JS - or triggered by the underlying SDK directly. In Firefox pre-quantum (pre fenix 9.5), the Extensions Page included Google Analytics for a while, so I was assuming that my installation process of uBlock Origin and uMatrix triggered it somehow down the line.<p>I decided to roll back to TOR 9.5 after it happened the second time on the same day and now I&#x27;m building my own Browser (Tholian Stealth) anyways... so I didn&#x27;t decide to investigate further than a casual look at the codebase where LeanPlum still seems to be littered all over the place.
