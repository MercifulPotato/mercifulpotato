( Which means it will cost a lot more for a relatively niche volume.)<p>&gt;I wonder if they can make a 4xGPU<p>GPU increase should be given, and die size &#x2F; yield would not be a concern &#x2F; problem. The question is how will they handle the additional memory bandwidth requirement? As you can see in the Die-Shots those DDR I&#x2F;O side are already take up much of the side space. Going with HBM2? Or LPDDR5?<p>&gt;32xcore M1-family CPU, but I imagine the yield of such a beast would be horrible,<p>A 32x CPU &#x2F; GPU Core M1 will only be 4x increase from its current form. If you exclude I&#x2F;O part, the CPU + GPU + Cache is only a little more than 50% of die size, or ~60mm2. 4x That is only 240mm2+. The final product would be a sub 350mm2 if you include all the additional. Which is roughly inline with the current estimate of AWS Graviton 2 die size ( ~400mm2).<p>But yes, M1 ( A14X ) isn&#x27;t really that interesting. The most exciting part is how they will go about doing high performance chip. Especially on iMac and Mac Pro.')
