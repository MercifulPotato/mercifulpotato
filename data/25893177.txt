If an average man didn’t work out at all (no muscle) and had low body fat, he would probably weigh around 130lbs. A 5’10” 180lbs man that lifts weights regularly could easily lose 30lbs of fat, so the typical 180lb sedentary office worker is actually enormous. The idea that BMI doesnt count is almost always just a coping strategy.')
