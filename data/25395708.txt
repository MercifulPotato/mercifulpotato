But services like YouTube and Facebook have no real historical precedents in terms of audience reach, and it&#x27;s hard to think of a more rock-and-a-hard-place situation than choosing between &quot;force a private company to treat their property like a public square no matter the cost to society&quot; and &quot;allow a private company to dictate what&#x27;s allowed in a de facto public square.&quot;<p>So, yes, of <i>course</i> it&#x27;s possible a gatekeeper would find it easier to misinform the populace. Over the long term, it&#x27;s almost guaranteed. Yet it&#x27;s also possible -- in fact, one can argue the probability is essentially 1.0 -- that refusing to have any gates will <i>also</i> misinform the populace. If we&#x27;re looking for a blanket rule that will cover all possible situations in this new information reality, we&#x27;re probably looking in vain.')
