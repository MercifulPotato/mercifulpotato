Reminds me of a cross between Opera and Firefox.<p>It&#x27;s run by one of the principle Firefox devs (Eich) and none of the stories about it ripping people off or being insecure appear to have been well founded.<p>I&#x27;ve used all the major browsers, starting with Mosaic and Netscape, was there when FF was phoenix, have been writing websites for 20 years (only a small amount of that time commercially). YMMV but it seems trustworthy, privacy focused, fast enough (ie I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s different in performance terms).<p>It&#x27;s just reskinned Chrome with privacy extensions built in and a system to enable people to try and send  micropayments to sites if the sites are signed up.<p>It&#x27;s not reminiscent of Eclipse in anyway for me (mind Eclipse to me most evokes poor DE integration, I&#x27;m a long time KDE user, and having a billion settings).<p>Use the browser that pleases you most though.')
