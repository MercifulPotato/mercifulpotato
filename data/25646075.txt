Too bad many commenters won&#x27;t have read it ;)<p>The most interesting part to me wasn&#x27;t actually the lab leak part. That&#x27;s been widely discussed for some time. The more interesting bit was how the anthrax scare turned out to be a lab worker who had a financial stake in vaccine research and apparently wanted funding to be increased ... and how that scare was used by the USG to justify drastic increases in funding towards bio-defence. If anyone has ever managed to more successfully or more cheaply achieve their goals through terrorism it&#x27;s hard to think of an example!')
