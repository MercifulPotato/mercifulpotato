If it&#x27;s not derivative, then you have no copyright claim that requires the license to permit you to use it.<p>While the exact nature of when a software project is a &quot;derivative work&quot; of the libraries it depends on is still somewhat of an open legal question, I would be very surprised if anyone were to find that a computer application were a derivative of the OS it runs on. The typical understanding of the industry is essentially a process boundary, and the boundary a system call represents is closer to a process boundary than it is to a library call.')
