But is that because programmers have some wildly special form of intelligence that most people don&#x27;t have, or is it because our tools suck?<p>Every time I used a &quot;No-Code&quot; solution it got me 95% where I wanted to be. The remaining 5% took twice as long as the first 95% because now I had to &quot;go behind the scenes&quot; and figure out the custom API exposed by whatever tool I was using. And then figure out a workaround that would inevitably break with the next version of the tool.<p>And even with the No-Code, it&#x27;s still being able to decompose a problem into smaller sub-problems, find the similarities and make sure they are well defined. I think there are a lot more folks with these abilities but you&#x27;ll find them in math and engineering departments mostly.')
