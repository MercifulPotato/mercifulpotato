A pure cold brew process (use frigid water, and then move the brew cask directly into a refrigerator) eliminates the bitterness of a traditional brew, leaving a cleaner, almost sweet taste. For a pure cold brew process I would suggest an 18-24 hour brew. Be careful though, even though it goes down easy it still packs a punch!<p>Edit: And if you really want to get it proper, rough grind the beans. Don&#x27;t grind them into a fine grain, make sure you see plenty of half chopped beans in there.')
