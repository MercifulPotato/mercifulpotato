I like the desk. I could probably live without the chair, but I also probably have really unreasonable expectations for what an office chair should be. I really want to be comfortable and just not notice it and every chair I&#x27;ve ever used has failed one of those criteria.<p>My wife uses a Geekdesk with a table top from uline (the maple kind) and some random Serta chair from Staples. She really likes it.<p>IMO: the specific standing desk doesn&#x27;t much matter as long as they support the weight of your desk and equipment. Also look for one that mechanically locks in place when the motors disengage. You really don&#x27;t want a power outage to cause your desk to fall to its lowest height.<p>The chair is more of a personal taste kind of thing. If you&#x27;re using it for long periods of time, I highly recommend going somewhere local that sells commercial office furniture (look for local Herman Miller or Steelcase dealers) to try out various models and sizes (the Aeron, for instance, comes in three sizes and lots of different configurations). When you find one you like, buy a used one from ebay or craigslist or whatever.')
