One time had a guy come in who worked with Kyronics. We all made jokes about freezing dead people - but he said you can apply Kryonics to a wide array of stuff not just dead people.<p>One of the many things some of the team riders were seriously considering was having their cranks, chains and frames frozen since its supposed to alter the molecular structure to make them stiffer and more durable.<p>I&#x27;m not sure they did it, but it was a topic of constant conversation for weeks afterwards.')
