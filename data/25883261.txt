Things I can&#x27;t stand:<p>1. Multiple (often unnecessary) layers of abstraction that end up being much more complicated than the thing they were intended to simplify through abstraction.  There is no concept too simple to abstract it seems<p>2. Verbose and hard to follow &quot;builder&quot; patterns<p>3. The extreme proliferation of design patterns.  I have literally seen hundreds in various Java codebases.<p>4. Gradle is great but requires memorizing a non-trivial API and learning a whole new (awesome, but still) language (Groovy).<p>5. There&#x27;s always a &quot;Java&quot; way of doing stuff that is different (often because of abstractions, see #1) so you have to re-learn everything that way.  Example:  Managing TLS certificates<p>5. Legacy code is everywhere, and can be really painful.<p>So much of it was hacked together and became critical and can never be re-written and never retired<p>There are more, but I weary of this discussion :-)')
