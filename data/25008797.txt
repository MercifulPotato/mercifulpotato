Given concerns outside of China about a loose oversight &amp; regulatory process amidst an economic crisis, Ma&#x27;s remarks played right into those criticisms. Not a smart move with an over-sensitive &amp; censor-happy regime. Which isn&#x27;t meant to justify China&#x27;s actions, only to observe that the consequences of Ma&#x27;s remarks weren&#x27;t exactly unforeseeable.')
