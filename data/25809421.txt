This argument makes sense to me in theory but in practice I find it hard to implement successfully, as someone who manages a medium-sized online community. It reminds me of the &quot;You only need 1000 good customers&quot; article. Sure, but unless you bring in 100K you&#x27;re not going to find those 1000.<p>So then we implement artificial barriers to entry but at the cost of destroying all the diversity in your community which I think is also essential, and instead of the 1000 good members you have 100 and they&#x27;re all clones.<p>As a result I&#x27;ve opted for the opposite approach where I&#x27;m very welcoming to everyone and try to only get rid of the worst of the worst, and we have a great, diverse set of very skilled and interesting people but a lot of them leave rather quickly because they don&#x27;t want to deal with the 90k less well-behaved members.')
