For them, the best UX is the one that gets them to their breakpoint as quickly as possible and reveals as much as the internal state of the program as possible. If you are doing coverage analysis, expect to see elements that serve no other purpose than to reach 100%. Of course, it is not a use case for the end user.<p>Even when they are also users, they know what their code is capable of, and will sneak in plenty of ways of accessing every function, that&#x27;s extra features for cheap, but ones that require a level of understanding of the inner workings that regular users won&#x27;t have.')
