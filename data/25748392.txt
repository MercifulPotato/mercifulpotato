Wine and airplanes? Hey, I think you guys forgot to tax cheese and sarcasm while you&#x27;re at it!<p>Let&#x27;s hope that a new US administration will figure out healthier ways to trade with the EU, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath since these petty fights have been going on for more than a decade and more than a US president anyway.<p>edit: Funnily enough, there are some pretty bitter replies to my message. I&#x27;ll remind all the preemptively angry commentators that I called the whole process &quot;these petty fights&quot; because it&#x27;s not unilateral (not just the US taxing stuff but the EU too, as is literally pointed out in the article).')
