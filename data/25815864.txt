If it’s more than a tiny minority, I’d do something.</i><p>You can&#x27;t expect normal people to browse with JS disabled, because by definition of &quot;normal&quot; they have not enough technical knowledge to do it, and to deal with the issues it causes on the modern web.<p>&gt; <i>I have plenty of things to talk to users about without getting them into whatever this is</i><p><i>This</i> is the real answer to the question, &quot;why is my computer so slow&quot;? Regular people still mostly think &quot;it&#x27;s viruses&quot;, but it&#x27;s not viruses - just web developers making websites with no consideration of end-user performance.<p>&gt; <i>If you want to persuade developers to do things differently, bad mouthing their tech choices is a really bad strategy.</i><p>I think this is a viable (even if not most efficient) strategy, because the current standard practice came from praising these choices.
