Item(by='michaniskin', descendants=None, kids=[25215693], score=None, time=1606348368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25214493, text='&gt; COVID19&#x27;s job is closer to shoving catheters into people while you put them under a ventilator, setting up IV drips, etc. etc.<p>OK, so how many years of training is required to learn how to insert catheters and IVs and all that? The army demonstrates that anyone can learn these skills in a few days. I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s just not some kind of unique magical skill set that only special people can learn.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure if you realize how dire the situation is right now.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you do. There is no crisis, hospitals are not near capacity, there are plenty of empty beds. (Oklahoma, for example, is at 66% capacity, nothing to get hysterical about.) There is no huge difference in hospital bed utilization between today, last week, last month. Remember that giant hospital ship? The one that sat empty in NY harbor and then quietly left without treating a single patient? Excuse me for being desensitized to chicken little&#x27;s alarming news.<p>&gt; Nurses who test positive for COVID19 are being kept on the job because there&#x27;s literally too many patients and not enough nurses.<p>Nobody is being &quot;kept on the job&quot;. Nobody is being forced to work. Those nurses are volunteering to stay on the job.')
