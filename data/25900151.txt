Item(by='foepys', descendants=None, kids=[25900183], score=None, time=1611557840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25900056, text='&gt; Tesla has offered access to their superchargers, but legacy car companies havenâ€™t taken them up on the offer<p>Probably because Tesla demanded something that they knew other manufacturers won&#x27;t give them.<p>They pulled the same PR stunt when they offered their pretty limited patent pool in exchange for all patents of the partaking manufacturers. Nobody wanted to take part because as a result Tesla would have had access to all patents while the others would only have had access to Tesla&#x27;s patents. A pretty bad deal for everybody except Tesla.')
