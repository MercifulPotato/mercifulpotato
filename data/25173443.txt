(sci hub link in this thread) -- for any fans of the platonic solids check out the wiki on these [0] -- cubes are the only platonic solid (1 of 5) that tesselate 3D space but if you loosen the constraints to convex polyhedra (any polyhedra where every vertex lies on the surface of a sphere) you get a huge diversity of &#x27;packing&#x27; patterns with interesting symmetries -- if you take cross-sections of any of these honeycombs you&#x27;ll find 2D tesselations, many of which correspond to mosaic patterns used in indo-islamic architecture -- I find it fascinating that a thousand years later we started to find the molecular structure of crystals lined up with these old tessellations which explored all the available symmetry groups. Atoms can only arrange themselves in so many ways if they want to be free of any entropy-induced gaps in their structure.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Convex_uniform_honeycomb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Convex_uniform_honeycomb</a>')
