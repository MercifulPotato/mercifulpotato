Whereas that would be perceived as failure by family and friends in Europe.<p>I guess that&#x27;s related to the US dept culture too.  \nNot having money but borrowing it for all kinds of things and with that stacking dept upon dept is quite normal in the US while over here at the continent you usually want to pay it back asap.<p>So not having money or working for a company which doesn&#x27;t generate any must feel much better in the US.<p>I would be terrified. I also wouldn&#x27;t work for some startup which won&#x27;t pay be but instead preach something about family values for example.  \nEarning money and owning stuff that I buy feels great. Wouldn&#x27;t want to miss it.')
