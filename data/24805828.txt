We should go back to embracing HTML. Have HTML at the center of what we do, send HTML over the wire so weâ€™re returning fully formed web documents on the first load, and then do subsequent hydration or updates through HTML as well.<p>This is such a crazy statement that I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not a joke. JSON APIs are the clear winner here. Separating web and native UI from data is a clean and practical separation of concerns. It&#x27;s easy to understand and can be opened up to third parties.
