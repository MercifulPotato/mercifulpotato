They seem to have fallen for the classic trap of vendors selling hardware without fully factoring in the cost of maintaining software and “cloud” infrastructure. So now their “growth hackers” have to keep coming up with things that should just be add-ons or bug fixes but instead they sell them as a premium feature or new product to make up for a lack of recurring revenue.<p>Basically they are alienating their existing customer base (who have already paid a premium price for the prosumer product upfront and expect things to Just Work for the price) in favour of convincing the next idiot to\nfund their OPEX with shiny new features and toys that are a quick sell. Not realising (or unwilling to realise) that this strategy is completely in contradiction with their reputation and brand image as trustworthy prosumer hardware vendor, and just adds to the underlying issue.<p>I predict that it won’t be long before they run out of cash or investor confidence and have to sell out to a large consumer hardware vendor with deep pockets that will try to capture the Ubiquiti premium margins by selling their lower-value existing consumer gear under the Ubiquiti brand. I applaud them for having come this far while maintaining most of their integrity and reputation, but I’m afraid their strategy is doomed to fail and it’s starting to show.')
