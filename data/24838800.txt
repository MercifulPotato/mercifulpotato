Their drive conditions are also unlikely to match yours.<p>They have a solid system set up for the installation and replacement of large numbers of drives on a regular schedule and the way they segment data would require multiple drive failures to cause data loss (I think it used to be 3 drives out of 20, but don&#x27;t quote me on that). A slightly higher failure rate on a noticeably cheaper drive still works out in their favor financially without adding significant extra risk.')
