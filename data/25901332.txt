Prior to that, z&#x2F;OS had no built-in support for running Linux binaries in any form. Microsoft released WSL1 in August 2016. So z&#x2F;OS got this feature 3 years after Windows did.<p>You might be thinking of z&#x2F;VM or PR&#x2F;SM, both of which support running z&#x2F;Linux virtual machines (but neither of which is z&#x2F;OS); or of z&#x2F;OS Unix System Services, which offers some degree of source compatibility with Linux (through its implementation of the UNIX 95 standard), but doesn&#x27;t have any Linux binary compatibility.')
