Not at all.<p>I live in the UK and we have the NHS so their job is to look after people when they get sick (and, to a certain extent, use preventative measure like education where appropriate).<p>But the UK governments largest spend is the NHS. We pay a fortune every year for it. So if they can&#x27;t do their job then heads should roll among politicians and NHS brass.<p>My argument is that the death rate does not justify the measures that are being taken: by all means protect the vulnerable (my parents are in that class) but the rest of us have been locked down when the stats absolutely do not justify it.<p>I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the economic cataclysm we are facing... that&#x27;s another story!')
