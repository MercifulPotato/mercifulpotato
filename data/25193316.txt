They are pretty awesome. One car was a full battery EV which they were testing out. We were instructed that if it crashed and caught fire were were NOT to assist ourself but to wait for the main team to arrive.<p>As an aside, the eRadical was some 300kg heavier than the ICE version but otherwise identical. As for competition: there wasn&#x27;t any. From the flag drop at the start the eRadical jumped ahead (thanks to electric engines offering 100% torque at 0 rpm) and held that lead throughout the race. The only time it didn&#x27;t;t finish first was the last race of the day which was double length: it DNF due to exhausted battery.')
