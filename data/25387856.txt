This idea is the basis of all democracies, generally....<p>&gt; I’ve come to know many politicians in the past few years, some of them nationally prominent. And I can say without hesitation that the average person is as qualified to make decisions about governance as the average professional politician.<p>The idea that Facebook is bad for democracy doesn&#x27;t contradict that idea. For <i>anyone</i> to make good decisions, they need good information, and the problem with Facebook is that it amplifies lies and disinformation.<p>&gt; I notice that there is, and maybe always has been, a vocal group of people who believe that we should only elect and appoint experts, highly-trained specialists in their area of government. Heinlein reminds us that “specialization is for insects”.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what being advocated for.  What specialists are good at is providing accurate information in their specialty.  Often different specialists will disagree.<p>In many cases, democracy should be about the people choosing which specialists to listen to and where the balance will be between them when they conflict.  It shouldn&#x27;t be about ordinary people trying to replace specialists (e.g. lets have a vote of non-engineers to determine how big the support beams for the new bridge should be).')
