I disagree with Dr. Devereaux in his take, but agree with his proscriptions.<p>His analogy has strengths and weaknesses. Dealing with the main weaknesses: ancient Athens is not modern America. In a Greek city state, most of  everyone would have in the city so having the power to size the public spaces while your opposition was in them would have been equivalent to breaking their military - citizens and military were largely equivalent. A modern insurrection and and ancient insurrection play out very differently.<p>Dealing with the main strength - yeah, the animating spirit of the mob and the ancient insurrections would have been somewhere between similar and identical. A large mob of people will sometimes attempt to do something and will try to make it happen until they meet resistance or go to bed. That is a general risk that large groups of people transition to mobs, and that is why modern states, by and large, need some sort of military and policing power.<p>But the issue here is that the punitive measures are being escalated to right-wing political leadership without any sense of perspective to (1) a rather extended series of &quot;peaceful&quot; left-wing protest in 2020 that went violent in 5-10% of cases with enormous community costs and (2) Republican leadership, including Trump, are fighting ... using the court, which is a perfectly acceptable avenue and the three tries of &quot;Peisistratos&quot; is now called &quot;having an election every couple of years&quot; - also an accepted avenue. There is manifest evidence that most of the mob did not intended to be violent the morning of - violent protestors would come prepared with guns. It escalated on the day as protests are known to do sometimes. The police were underprepared.<p>It isn&#x27;t acceptable, a lot of people need to be arrested, changes are needed to police tactics if nothing else. But the retaliation including an internet purge of right-wing aligned personalities and businesses (and impeaching Trump without taking the time to draw breath) is much more damaging than the ghostly ember of a mob. The knee-jerk overreaction is a low-thought decision making response that has far more in common with mob mentality than the thoughtful approach to governance and discourse which work in the long-term. The hazard posed by this mob - as in, the part inherent to it without considering the government response - was arguably not worst the States has seen in this decade. Even if it got further into the Capitol than most.')
