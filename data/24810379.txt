All Twitch streamers are required by the Twitch ToS to moderate their chats and the streamers face bans if they fail to do so.<p>Everyone keeps talking about &quot;breaking&quot; the Internet but let&#x27;s consider what would actually change. Let&#x27;s say that I am unable to moderate my chat because it is overrun with malicious actors. What are my options? I can completely turn off chat for one. I could restrict chat to a manageable vetted subset of chatters that I am comfortable allowing to post with minimal moderation.<p>In fact, as a streamer I cannot possibly read hundreds or thousands of messages per second. At that point the very idea there is &quot;real time communication&quot; going on is a myth anyway. Every streamer has a way of limiting this deluge of input and moderation is how they are handling it.<p>&gt; Loosing most, one to many, real time communication would be throwing out a considerable amount of value.<p>This is where I feel everyone here is taking things too far. You don&#x27;t lose communication - you become responsible for the communication you allow to be made pubic.')
