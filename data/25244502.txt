No one thinks that the gender pay gap is an actually motivated effort by men against women... it&#x27;s purely the observation that there is a wage gap (perhaps due to historical gender roles?). So it does not involve a &quot;conspirator&quot;, that is a big difference.<p>The same goes for the second one. It&#x27;s not the belief that wealthier people are this evil group which acts against the lower class people, moreso a critique of the system that allowed them to rise into the position and situation they are in. They are not believed to be &quot;conspiring&quot; though.<p>You have to understand that one of the core beliefs of the left is that inequality is bad. The political goal is to create a situation&#x2F;system where humans all have the same opportunities. It&#x27;s not about punishing one group of people but instead about leveling out the playing field, making the game &quot;fairer&quot; in general.<p>That is at least how I understand it but I am sure there are also extremists with irrational ideas.')
