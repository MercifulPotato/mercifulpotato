I&#x27;m pointing out that there is a broader debate here, which has value but is misunderstood by many. Freedom of speech as a philosophical concept spans wider than its codification in law, and probably requires adaption or extension in response to changing circumstances.<p>The &quot;twitter mob&quot; argument was really an ancillary point to show where one ends up if enough unpopular opinions are silenced. But it&#x27;s interesting in itself. I don&#x27;t think a participant in public debate in the 1700s would have reason to fear a crowd of tens of thousands stapling angry and occasionally violent rebuttals to their front door.<p>Okay, calling someone a fucking moron is protected speech. It would be problematic to censor it. But there <i>is</i> a problem if a crowd screams at someone who has valid (if controversial) points, if this happens to such a degree that they will self-censor or withdraw from the debate entirely, perhaps (rightfully) fearing for their livelihoods and personal safety. My example was a concrete instance of this.<p>Solution? Hell if I know. There&#x27;s certainly a problem; a situation that has negative consequences. There&#x27;s something to the viewpoint that cancelling someone is approaching an act of violence, where it affects a person&#x27;s ability to earn a living and survive. But this is obviously not the last or only important point in such a debate. It&#x27;s something that should be discussed widely.')
