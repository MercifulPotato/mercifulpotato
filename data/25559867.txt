It was built on the scholarship of the usual conservative&#x2F;libertarian set, but also liberal professors like Sunstein, Tribe, and Amar: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;us&#x2F;06firearms.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;us&#x2F;06firearms.html</a><p>&gt; There used to be an almost complete scholarly and judicial consensus that the Second Amendment protects only a collective right of the states to maintain militias. That consensus no longer exists â€” thanks largely to the work over the last 20 years of several leading liberal law professors, who have come to embrace the view that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns.<p><i>Heller</i> also shows that, even if the court is &quot;politically polarized in both directions&quot; that polarization runs strongly in one particular direction. Deciding that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to bear arms, a position amply supported by the text and history (see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.law.ucla.edu&#x2F;volokh&#x2F;common.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.law.ucla.edu&#x2F;volokh&#x2F;common.htm</a>), requires a conservative majority plus buy-in from leading liberal academics.<p>Yet the decision that the Constitution protects a right to abortion, which concededly has no basis in the text or history of the document, survives despite decades of a conservative Supreme Court majority.')
