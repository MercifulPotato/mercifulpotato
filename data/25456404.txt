Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608218939, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450069, text='&gt; I am seriously suggesting that if states want to pay people to stay home they should find the money by cutting other spending, selling assets, raising taxes on the wealthy (households with an income over about $200K who didn&#x27;t receive a stimulus payment in the first place), and issuing general obligation bonds.<p>So, basically, you think they should do things like finance their house with their credit card (general obligation bonds) instead of taking out a mortgage (federal deficit spending)?  And what&#x27;s your reason for that?<p>Honestly, this seems more like you&#x27;re opposed to stay at home orders directly, but expressing that opposition indirectly by demanding arbitrary (unreasonable) policy restrictions to make them seems less desirable by making their implementation unnecessarily painful and difficult.')
