And avoiding endgames because those are just logical grinds.<p>2) playing with an analysis engine like stockfish.<p>For me, memorizing defenses was not feasible because it is so broad, but I learned two openings (scotch and queens pawn) and at least know the defenses there because i know the openings. a little bit.<p>I&#x27;ll keep at it, memorizing defenses, but I&#x27;m old and probably won&#x27;t cram more into my brain.<p>EDIT: I used to go to a sunday-night chess meetup before COVID. 1700 on Lichess is nowhere near 1700 FIDE rating (of course, it was at a bar, so I&#x27;m usually a few pints in). I stopped going because I got tired of getting my ass kicked, there weren&#x27;t enough mediocre players there.')
