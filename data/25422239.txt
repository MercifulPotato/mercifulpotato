Item(by='antisthenes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607975138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419669, text='&gt; It has become clear to me that for young men of my generation that this type of video-gaming is very much the equivalent of &#x27;doomscrolling&#x27; as mentioned in other comments, and is generally pretty harmful.<p>Eh? I mean maybe for the vast majority too much of one thing is bad. For me, personally, almost all of my friendships came from bonding experience over playing video games together (or board games, or card games) and other semi-intellectual hobbies.<p>Did any of those games or pursuits give me deep marketable skills? Not really. But the friendships gained were invaluable as far as diversity of thought, advice and help given in times of need. I don&#x27;t regret any of that time spent.<p>But those were games of a bygone era. Later games (like WoW&#x2F;Fortine and whatever garbage kids play these days) probably would not have had the same effect.<p>&gt; The truth is in the nuance<p>Yep. Gaming is a pretty neutral activity. When done right (challenging games played with the right people) can be extremely rewarding. When overdone, probably worse than watching tons of TV&#x2F;politics.')
