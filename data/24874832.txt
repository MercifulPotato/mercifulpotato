As development stops, youtube-dl will stop being able to download videos in a matter of months (at best). This is an extremely brittle system that relies on youtube-dl being one step ahead of Youtube at all times. Without further development, the next update to Youtube&#x27;s site will break the tool.<p>It was really a matter of time. I&#x27;m sure most of us were already amazed it lasted this long - and it did because it remained a relatively obscure tool for years.<p>It&#x27;s also the case that the development of subversive&#x2F;illegal tools requires a certain amount of subterfuge and sneakiness that the youtube-dl developers apparently weren&#x27;t ready to engage in. While this is understandable, it also underscores the fact that such tools live on borrowed time (as does, I would argue, general-purpose computing itself).')
