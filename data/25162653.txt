You probably know it&#x27;s name. During the interview I was asked what my impression was of what they did. &quot;Allow people to sign PDFs online&quot; was my reply. &quot;No, no, it&#x27;s so much more&quot; was the reply. That&#x27;s when I realised it was just a cultish hype machine that I didn&#x27;t really want anything to do it. This is what I want: 1. Go to work 2. Solve cool problems 3. Go home and enjoy the money I&#x27;ve earned. Companies (US in particular) really need to understand.')
