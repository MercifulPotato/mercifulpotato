While I certainly wouldn’t want to bean-count my time <i>forever</i>, I imagine that performing this exercise for some period of time would make one more thoughtful &amp; intentional about how one spends their time. Sometimes you need the data to see that you’re spending way more time than you’d desire on social media, or not enough time with your friends, etc. I equate it to counting calories while dieting; doing it forever leads to horrible quality of life (imo), doing it for a month or two teaches you how much food you actually need and makes you more mindful about your consumption.<p>EDIT: Also, the point of this sort of exercise isn’t merely to ‘become more productive’ - it’s to gather data to help achieve whatever outcome you find valuable in your life. Maybe it’s studying more for his exams (certainly different than working more at your 9 to 5 bigco job fwiw), maybe it’s spending more quality time with family, etc. The point is collecting this sort of data doesn’t necessarily lead solely to optimizing your output under capitalism, it can be a tool for better living.
