The primary safety benefit of newtypes is derived from abstraction boundaries. If a newtype’s constructor is not exported, it becomes opaque to other modules. The module that defines the newtype—its “home module”—can take advantage of this to create a trust boundary where internal invariants are enforced by restricting clients to a safe API.&quot;<p>From an outside perspective, you seem to be arguing the same things the author has already stated in the article, which is why he&#x27;s asking you to read the article more carefully.')
