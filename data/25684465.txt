But they can&#x27;t make up the stack for tail calls because the information is simply gone. If you&#x27;ve got a set of mutually functions that are tail calling, and you suddenly need to generate a stack trace, how do you know how many times the functions have been called and which order they were called? That info was never recorded - it&#x27;s just done. Inlining is static info and much simpler - it is recorded and isn&#x27;t gone.')
