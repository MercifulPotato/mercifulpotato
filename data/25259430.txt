Item(by='mrlala', descendants=None, kids=[25260223], score=None, time=1606772714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257493, text='&gt;In my experience the spread is usually under 1% of the 24 avg.<p>And how does that work?  For example, the last 24hr bitcoin is up like 10%.. Let&#x27;s call 5% below the current price the 24hr average.. are you suggesting that the exchange rate is 1% above the 24avg, or 4% below the current price, meaning the seller is eating 4% of the current price?  That certainly does not make any sense.<p>&gt;But how are you going to get scammed accepting bitcoin? It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s easy to forge a bitcoin.<p>I agree the seller can&#x27;t really get scammed, but the buyer has --zero-- recourse.  So sure the seller loves it because there is no recourse and they can add a nice spread (my first point).  But the buyer does not.<p>Whereas credit cards- both parties get benefits (even if it skews toward the buyer, however that is a good thing, it shouldn&#x27;t be equal.. the seller has more information about the transaction thus the buyer should have more recourse).')
