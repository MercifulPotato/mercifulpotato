Got anymore glib, smug responses to things that nobody said?<p>[0] I don&#x27;t actually mean &quot;thanks&quot;. That&#x27;s childish and passive-aggressive of me, and I shouldn&#x27;t do it. What I really mean is to suggest that I think you&#x27;ve added nothing to this and that you&#x27;re addressing a point that nobody made, for reasons only you know. I would <i>guess</i> that it&#x27;s some kind of hyperbole, and that what you kind of mean is &quot;oh, for something as important as this, someone will do a proper job&quot; which is at least a meaningful statement (if perhaps something of a triumph of hope over experience), but if I have to pick apart your snark to get the actual meaning, I&#x27;m doing your job for you. Can you not just write clearly, and state what you mean?<p>Both of the massive fuckups I listed were highly unlikely, but they still happened.')
