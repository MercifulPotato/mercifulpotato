Good intentions with bad results are nice in that you meant well, but good intentions don&#x27;t make us virtuous on their own.<p>At that point doesn&#x27;t the whole stoic idea just become circular? The wisdom to act virtuously seems to be no simpler than a complete philosophy. And all of the rest of stoicism seems to depend on being able to know whether your acts were virtuous - e.g. if I acted virtuously but had poor results because of things outside my control, I shouldn&#x27;t be saddened - but that advice is no use if I don&#x27;t know whether I acted virtuously.')
