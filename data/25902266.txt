The whole point here is that the Tier 1s price-gouge everyone else, and from there everything is far more expensive than it needs to be.<p>Prices only go up from there.<p>Cheaper plans sold by smaller outfits are likely being sold to end users through 2-3 layers of resellers. This creates a tug-of-war between multiple resale overheads and customer interest in something at a low price point, so the baseline of what is being offered (CPU, RAM, speed, monthly transfer) can get fairly wobbly.<p>For larger companies, to take Contabo as an example, they basically get to dictate whatever performance metrics they want, because they own the entire stack. So I might have more-or-less-unlimited 100Mbps and 6GB RAM, but CPU performance is... not great, I&#x27;m pretty sure my KVM instance winds up almost entirely swapped onto an HDD occasionally, and there are some really harsh QEMU disk I&#x2F;O quotas.')
