Item(by='smabie', descendants=None, kids=[24899520], score=None, time=1603736607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899077, text='It&#x27;s stressful in the sense that the amount you earn is a linear function on the performance of the strategy. Unlike at other firms, bonus isn&#x27;t discretionary: its a pure function of strategy performance. When the company loses money, you lose money. This incentivizes everyone to work together and solve problems.<p>Also working with some of the smartest people in the industry can be intimidating: if you&#x27;re used to being the smartest guy in the room, it&#x27;s very unlikely you will be anymore at a top notch firm. This is a form of stress in itself.<p>It&#x27;s not stressful in the sense of shitty clueless bosses, long unpaid hours (people work long hours, but that work is often highly compensated for through pnl improvements).<p>Everyone I know feels extremely lucky that by just putting our heads together, we can mint money out of thin air. I don&#x27;t think anyone I work with would rather be doing anything else. Trying to make money out of nothing certainly humbles you, but when something works, its the best feeling in the world.<p>Keep in mind that things might be different at a larger firm: lower compensation and upside, more hierarchy, etc.')
