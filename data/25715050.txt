I am not paid to devise such universal tooling. It&#x27;s also a huge undertaking and much harder than all of my everyday&#x27;s work. It&#x27;s exploratory work that has the potential to revolutionize huge chunks of the programming area.<p>And I don&#x27;t want to only be paid an average salary for it.<p>But... an excellent salary (above-average, maybe even above-high) would motivate me and no, I won&#x27;t try to copyright that work and mooch off it for billions until I hit 80.<p>As I said: incentives. Many companies expect programming to be like installing a kitchen sink yet are unwilling to pay to commoditize the activity.')
