At that scale, you can more or less exhaustively test every code path and input to prove correctness.<p>You don&#x27;t have to go too far from there to benefit from a debugging console, though. There&#x27;s tons of design space between 8-bit 8-pin MCUs and full featured processors with MMUs and megabytes of memory. You don&#x27;t even have to leave 8-bit to benefit from a &quot;printf&quot; mechanism.<p>Tangentially, you don&#x27;t necessarily need to implement &quot;printf&quot; within an embedded firmware to benefit from it. It&#x27;s entirely possible to offload the fmt string expansion, instead capturing the raw fmt string and arguments as data and expanding it at point of consumption.')
