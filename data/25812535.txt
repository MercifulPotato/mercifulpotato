I can&#x27;t overstate how annoying someone who <i>never</i> has to look at the keyboard might find this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robservatory.com&#x2F;the-fundamental-problem-with-the-touch-bar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robservatory.com&#x2F;the-fundamental-problem-with-the-to...</a><p>&quot;The Touch Bar, despite its name, is actually an Eye Bar: It forces your eyes off the screen, down to the Touch Bar, back up to the screen, repeat ad infinitum. There&#x27;s nothing physical about interacting with the Touch Bar, aside from using your finger: There are no defined button areas, and there&#x27;s no haptic feedback when you tap something. So you absolutely must look at the Touch Bar to interact with it.<p>When the new MacBooks were released, I spent about 30 minutes testing a Touch Bar-equipped version in an Apple Store, and this constant moving of my eyes&#x27; focus from keyboard to screen to keyboard to screen to…well, you get the idea…was incredibly disruptive. To use the Touch Bar, I&#x27;d have to change my focus to the keyboard, then refocus on the screen, taking time to find my active window and locate the mouse cursor. This did not make for a pleasant user experience.&quot;')
