Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25685395], score=None, time=1610106083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25681321, text='<i>How do we improve on the situation?</i><p>Given economic realities and racist history (consider what happened in Tuskegee as one example), in the US you would need to provide free screenings to poor people under circumstances that convinced people of color they can trust you while signing the documents to let you have their data.<p>This is a fairly high bar to meet and one most studies are probably making zero effort to really meet.<p>I&#x27;m part Cherokee and I follow a lot of Natives on Twitter due to sincere and legitimate interest in my Native heritage, but the world deems me to be a White woman so I am sometimes met with hostility simply for trying to talk with Native people while looking too White to be trustworthy. Prior positive engagement with specific individuals seems to carry little weight and be rapidly forgotten. The slightest misstep and, welp, &quot;she&#x27;s an evil White bitch, here to fuck over the Natives -- like they always are!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not blaming people of color for feeling that way. I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s the reality you are up against.<p>As someone who spent some years homeless and got a fair amount of &quot;help&quot; offered of the &quot;God, you clearly are an idiot causing your own problems and need a swift kick in the teeth as part of my so-called help&quot; variety, I really sympathize with such reactions.<p>White people often have little to no understanding of the lives of people of color and little to no desire to try to really understand because really understanding it involves understanding systemic racism in a way that tends to make Whites very uncomfortable. It veers uncomfortably close to self-accusation to honestly try to see how the world is experienced by such people.')
