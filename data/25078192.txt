Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.</i><p>The reason why people look to the founding papers and value them is because they are breaking away from tyranny, greed, monarchy, almost mafia state like control. They have interesting takes that are true in any power grab and warnings.<p>You can&#x27;t write a Constitution as good as when you just went through revolution from tyranny.  That is what changing it like the push for a Convention of States is trying to do is a dangerous thing while so divided.  We are in a state of uncivil war, not unity over an external enemy, though maybe we should be.<p>The United States has the longest running form of government, I&#x27;d say it was architected pretty well. The Constitution is a good guide for setting up a system that allows depressurization. Western liberalized democratic republics allow for depressurization and waves and cycles to flow, some intense, some wonderful, some problematic, but return or escape from those eras. Authoritarianism does not, eventually authoritarianism blows up when the loyalty and leverage break down, there is no pressure release.')
