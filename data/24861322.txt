There&#x27;s a few well-known cases of section 203 being used to claw back copyright decades down the line. (Note: I&#x27;m am very much not a lawyer)<p>In 1938, John Steinbeck granted Viking Press rights to publish 13 of his works, including <i>Of Mice And Men</i>, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, and <i>Tortilla Flats</i>, as long as they were kept in print and for sale. In 2005, John Steinbeck&#x27;s son and granddaughter served notice to Penguin Publishing, who were the interested party at the time, that they were terminating the agreement.^2<p>This section was originally designed to give artists who may have essentially (or even literally) given away their rights due to inequitable bargaining power a chance to recoup their property down the line with at least several years notice that they are planning on terminating the agreement.^3 In practice, however, it&#x27;s kind of a mess, and to say that it would allow an artist or their heirs to terminate a grant to the public domain is dubious. It&#x27;s something that would likely see its way to the supreme court should it ever come to pass.<p>I&#x27;ve included a couple other articles here just in the general interest of providing more info.^4^5<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;docs&#x2F;203.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;docs&#x2F;203.html</a><p>[2]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;billgablelaw.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;law&#x2F;files&#x2F;TakingItBack.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;billgablelaw.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;law&#x2F;files&#x2F;TakingItBack.pdf</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abovethelaw.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;terminators-mount-up-section-203-and-copyright-recovery-part-i&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abovethelaw.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;terminators-mount-up-section...</a><p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media2.mofo.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;190700-all-shook-up.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media2.mofo.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;190700-all-shook-up.pdf</a><p>[5]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Case_Law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.creativecommons.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Case_Law</a>')
