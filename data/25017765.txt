Double-blind is great when you can pull it off, but it&#x27;s fallacious to dismiss control groups just because they can&#x27;t be perfectly blinded.<p>Active control groups and non-blinded studies are still used frequently in these situations. There&#x27;s no excuse for discarding control groups completely.')
