It should be opt in.  Many people might not want every contact they&#x27;ve put into their phone over the last decade to know that they got or have signal.  It&#x27;s a nice idea to think that everyone has only contacts they would want to share signal with bit that&#x27;s not the reality on the ground.<p>Aside from that, it&#x27;s really gotten pretty good.  I&#x27;ve been running it since the red phone days or what ever that app was called before signal.')
