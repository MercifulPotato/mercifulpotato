The reason there are so few competing high performance chips on the market is, that it is extremely expensive to design one. And you need a fab with a current process. \nFor many years Intel beat all other companies, because they had the best fabs ans could affort the most R&amp;D. Now Apple has the best fab - TSMCs 5nm - and certainly gigantic developer resources they can afford to spend as the chip design is pretty similar between the iPhones iPads and the Macs.<p>And of course, as mentioned in the article, any feature in the Apple Silicon will be supported by MacOS. Getting OS support for your new SOC features in other OSes is not a given.')
