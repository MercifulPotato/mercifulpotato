Windows and Linux are installed on my laptop in dualboot mode.  Linux goes to sleep and wakes up just fine 100% reliably.  Windows, however, uses this &quot;connected standby&quot; or &quot;modern sleep&quot; mode by default that on multiple occasions lead to waking up while the laptop was in my backpack and then draining the battery to zero.  I got fed up with this and decided to disable this shitty sleep and go back to normal S3 sleep mode.  It&#x27;s not so easy on Windows 10 anymore!  It took me a couple of hours but I finally found a solution.  And S3 is now the default sleep mode instead of the modern sleep.  Looks like the sleep mode is fixed.  However!  My laptop began to go to sleep as soon as I activated the lock screen even if it was connected to power.  Wtf!  More hours spent on searching for solution (other people experience this issue as well).  It turns out there is a hidden (!) power option.  You need to unhide it by changing the registry and then disable it.  Now my laptop when connected to power still spontaneously goes to sleep, but it happens after 20 minutes or so.  I don&#x27;t know what other option I need to change.  I just can&#x27;t spend any more time researching this crap.')
