It says nothing about government as a concept and everything about “incumbent parties”.<p>In other words, people from another generation, with ideas that don’t align with modern life aren’t trusted by the remaining population.<p>For years, prior to mobile gadgets, one incumbent party has failed to expand its base as it dies, the other has absorbed it, while pushing away progressive voices.<p>That has little to do with mobile internet, and the entire premise that a new technology has done what humans have been doing for generations is nonsense.<p>Maybe the technology kicked it into overdrive but the historical record shows it’s been held to an arbitrary check based upon flimsy rhetoric, delusions of grandeur, mass indoctrination behaviors.<p>The need for governance isn’t in question. That isn’t going anywhere. It’s the benchmark for what that governance should look like that’s being challenged.')
