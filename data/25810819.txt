In my view, big banks and private capital firms have a much bigger impact than Big Tech on the average American&#x27;s ability to find work and afford housing. My impression is that American press attention shifted to Big Tech around 2012, coinciding with the end of the Occupy movement. I&#x27;d be curious to see whether anyone has quantified this shift, such as with NLP analysis of news articles.')
