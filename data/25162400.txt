The world has changed.  Even in the backwards semi-rural area where I live there is enough diversity to beat it into my head that &quot;people are just people&quot;.  Let alone connecting to the internet, where you have no idea what another commenter looks like.  So, it boggles my mind that people still care about this so much.  It&#x27;s self evident to me that people need to be treated based on what they do or say and not oddities of their genetic structures.  I tend to think that if people stopped pointing out those differences, the problem would eventually grow much smaller.  Some people are always going to not like each other for trivial reasons at some level, but why point out such differences to them?')
