I&#x27;m currently working on an Agile engineering team, due to it being a startup, so they like to group people together.  (We got a data engineer, an infrastructure engineer, a consultant of all things, a firmware engineer, a hardware engineer, and a jack of all trades.)<p>This at first bothered me a lot, due to Agile micromanagement, but after a few months the company realized my work load is nothing like engineering, and because I have to become the domain expert on a topic to solve the challenges at hand, I end up knowing best what the next steps should be.  After realizing this the company has since put me in the team lead meetings (which is excessive imo) and has personally requested that I make my own epics, issues&#x2F;pbis, and do my own refinement.  The only downside remaining is the company wants presentations every two weeks, but now I&#x27;m in control to slowly grow my pbis into whatever time span I want (within reason), allowing me to present as often as I want.  Responsibility comes with rapport.')
