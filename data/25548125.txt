However, I think we need periodic reminders that the structure we&#x27;re building on isn&#x27;t made of magic, but accumulated hard work and delicate knowledge and technological chains. If we stop valuing education, if we stop valuing culturally scientific truth and knowledge, if we rest on our laurels disinformation grows and knowledge decays: it was a good reminder after recent political climate in the US, UK and Brazil for example in which disinformation (poor access to reliable sources) played a large role. In those cases populism exploiting misinformation. I think if nothing else we need it for democracy, otherwise the people can be manipulated and those in power are sure to serve mostly themselves[0]. Flat Earth is so absurd that it&#x27;s a good example most people can call out.<p>[0] Also, our problems, and its solutions as well, are becoming more complex. Climate change is the great example: we are fighting a costly problem brought by technology, that most people can&#x27;t see, and you can&#x27;t readily verify themselves.

Faith in science and ability to evaluate claims for themselves is critical.')
