I wouldn&#x27;t know how to write a cheque these days if I wanted to,  and the only cheque I&#x27;ve seen in the last 10 years or so is from my (now deceased) grandmother in-law sending birthday money to my wife.<p>I&#x27;m guessing this is why several US payment companys and start-ups just don&#x27;t make any sense to me: &quot;make payments easier!&quot;<p>but it&#x27;s hard for me to understand how to make it easier than just typing in someone&#x27;s phone number or email and sending them money, or purchasing via tap and go with your card&#x2F; phone. Don&#x27;t you at least have electronic transfers if not those other newfangled technologies? are you (seriously) suggesting you can&#x27;t transfer money between your accounts?')
