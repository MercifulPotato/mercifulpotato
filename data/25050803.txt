It is cruel to subject someone only to plant medicine, doubly so if it hasn&#x27;t been rigorously tested: Give folks actual, up to date medicine instead. You know, the same quality that everyone on the planet should have. There is no reason someone should have to suffer more than they should. If you need anti-depressants, by all means, please have access. And to drugs that alter the course of auto-immune diseases to make them less of an impact on quality of life: Please give high blood pressure meds and insulin if needed.<p>Farming and nature isn&#x27;t a cure, and does nothing to help someone adapt to the city they will likely be living in upon release.')
