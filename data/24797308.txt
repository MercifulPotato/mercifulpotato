How does the workflow look like? UI? UX?<p>There are probably thousands of other products that have built and implemented the same feature, so seems kind of inefficient that I have to reinvent the wheel every time.<p>Do you know if there is an existing product or service that already does that?<p>If not, and I built it - would you pay for it? How much per month?')
