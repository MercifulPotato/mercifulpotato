When you do this kind of analysis and arrive at this kind of absurdity, more often than not, courts will find that the law actually doesn&#x27;t permit this absurdity.<p>In this specific case, it&#x27;s already possible to move jury trials to other districts for difficulty of finding impartial jurors, so it&#x27;s almost certain that the courts would similarly rule that doing a similar change of venue poses no constitutional issue whatsoever.')
