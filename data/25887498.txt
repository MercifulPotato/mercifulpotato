They purposely made it so you couldn&#x27;t set up automatic payments, so you had to do it manually every month.  One month I was a day late, so they changed the interest to 19%, and charged me interest for all the past payments too.<p>Luckily I was able to get them to reverse it and then I just paid it off, but had I not noticed, I would have owed them a ridiculous amount of money.')
