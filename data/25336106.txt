I did find this article that says they measured 80-95% reduction of pollutants which seems pretty good with 108 L&#x2F;s airflow which is achievable:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osti.gov&#x2F;servlets&#x2F;purl&#x2F;1420274" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osti.gov&#x2F;servlets&#x2F;purl&#x2F;1420274</a><p>It&#x27;s possible that what I was reading before was discussing direct capture of the combustion products, but it stands to reason that if you&#x27;re exhausting a lot of air with the range hood it&#x27;s going to limit the concentration of pollutants by cycling the air in the entire kitchen. Alternatively I could just be remembering incorrectly!<p>My range hood is unfortunately configured to recirculate, and it&#x27;s not in a convenient location to duct to the outside. If I change entirely over to electric I&#x27;ll likely keep the range hood recirculating and install a central ERV or HRV that pulls air from the kitchen to manage winter time air pollution throughout the house.')
