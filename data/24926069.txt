MS wanted to use SQL Compact, but it&#x27;s mainly Mozilla&#x27;s fault if the spec was dropped. The same Mozilla that dragged its feet for years when it comes to implementing some aspects of web components...<p>But it was a terrible decision IMHO because indexedDB doesn&#x27;t do what a relational database does and it considerably hurt the development of complex mobile web apps, and now Safari on IOS AFAIK removed support for WebSQL. WebSQL was a fantastic tool for web apps that could be entirely cached on a mobile device (SQL can do a lot).<p>There is no realistic replacement. Even using Sqlite compiled to WASM has a lot of issues (mainly performances and data persistence).<p>To this day I don&#x27;t know a single efficient and performance RDBMS equivalent to Sqlite built on top of IndexedDB. Mozilla certainly didn&#x27;t build one.')
