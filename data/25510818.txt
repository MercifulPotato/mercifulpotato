It has made it a cinch to templatize a full manifest and pass data to the template for a deploy. We now have a fully reproducible base EKS cluster deploy done with working cert-manager&#x2F;letsencrypt, nginx ingress, weave-net, fluentd logging to elasticsearch service, etc. Our application-specific code lives in a different repo and deploys things using YTT. It&#x27;s so much more elegant than our old method of copying and pasting manifests and crossing our fingers and hoping the cluster didn&#x27;t fall down. A full migration to a new cluster and deploy of a whole new application stack takes under an hour now.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gavinbunney&#x2F;terraform-provider-kubectl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gavinbunney&#x2F;terraform-provider-kubectl</a>')
