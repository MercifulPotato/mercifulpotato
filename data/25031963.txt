I&#x27;ve likely only been to a handful of powerlifting meets and they only were for benchpressing.<p>Deadlifting as an exercise is actually one of the three main lifts in powerlifting. What makes the best powerlifters is a high total weight combination of Bench&#x2F;Squat&#x2F;Deadlift which is generally how it&#x27;s judged in most competitions these days.<p>I think there&#x27;s a small line between deadlifting and what weightlifters like us would call cleaning. \nA deadlift is a lower-back dominant exercise, to build power and strength there. \nA clean is a similar movement of getting weight off the ground and into the air, but is completely leg and upper-body dominant, with many, many other accessory movements in-between. This is why we see Crossfit athletes implement weightlifting into their training and why it is so popular today- because of the rewarding &quot;total body&quot; strength gains and cardiovascular fitness.')
