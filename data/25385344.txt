My pitch is more depth and skill with ability to execute than a big-5 team, at half the price. I focus on a skill mix that is sufficiently rare that I can leverage it for a small premium. Other thing is strategically, I need to charge enough that the clients will actually listen, as if they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s going to cost me long term, and if they can afford to ignore me, they aren&#x27;t paying enough.<p>It&#x27;s a niche where I can legitimately say if you can afford less you don&#x27;t need the value multiple I bring, and it&#x27;s just straight contract labor, not consulting.<p>When the chips are down, sure, I absolutely do market work to survive, but when they&#x27;re good, I can afford to do a value based pitch. Certainly a dynamic. :)')
