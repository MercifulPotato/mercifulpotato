I am pretty sure that in a free society one or many others would have achieved similar things. For example the computer industry would have been fine without Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. Or it may have been even better off without them overshadowing others? Same for eCommerce. Maybe things would be better without Amazon domination. Who knows?')
