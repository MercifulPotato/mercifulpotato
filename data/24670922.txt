For a very quick approximation:\n - Speed of speech ~ 120 wpm. \n - So 1.5 hours constant talking would mean roughly 10&#x27;0000 words. Keep in mind that that is without all the pauses and dramatic music. \n - An A4 page would roughly come out at 500 words. \n - Which means that you could fit 1.5 hours of _constant_ speech in 20 A4 pages.<p>Since this is infotainment I bet that it&#x27;s way less than that. Another advantage when trying to get an objective perspective from reading, is that there is no dramatic or eerie music in the background giving you queues on how to interpret the contents on an nearly subliminal level. Furthermore there would not be any faces that your less advanced parts of the brain would attach feelings to.<p>The social dilemma might probably have been condensed down to a 5 page PDF. All these dramatizations are maybe good if you want to discuss this with 5 year olds, but it&#x27;s not dense with fact in any sense.')
