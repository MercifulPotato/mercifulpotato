We don&#x27;t want to be another politically biased or polluted forum. We have blocking for users and will be extending that to Channels and our upcoming Groups next week.<p>As for API&#x27;s and scheduled posts, there aren&#x27;t immediate plans for that until we nail down a proper OAuth implementation to roll out with the officially supported API&#x27;s. Though there are 4 of us all together, I&#x27;m the only engineer of any kind working on it, with potentially some more help on the way here shortly.<p>Your questions are good ones. We asked ourselves very specifically how would we avoid being another parler yet at the same time not alienate one political crowd over another? Was a difficult question. The 4 of us span the political spectrum and I think that has helped keep us centered so far.')
