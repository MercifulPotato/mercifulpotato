Before that, it was the norm to have full-service which also included washing your windshield and offering to check your oil (which needed to be done more frequently early-on). You were also often paying cash although oil company cards were definitely getting more common at that point.<p>(But as something of an aside, I recall getting turned down for a gas card in the early 80s because I didn&#x27;t have a credit history but was able to get an AMEX or something along those lines which helped me establish credit.)')
