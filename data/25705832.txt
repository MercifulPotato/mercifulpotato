Surely, out of all the possible traits to point out here, being &quot;disgruntled&quot; isn&#x27;t the defining factor.<p>So let&#x27;s not mince words and false pretenses here. Here is a fair definition of terrorism:<p>&quot;the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims&quot;<p>Now, let&#x27;s go through the list. Was there violence involved? Yes. Was there intimidation. Yes. Was this against civilians and politically motivated.. well yes.<p>Then it begs the question, is this wilful ignorance, or is there some malice involved. I suppose that is for you to know. But I find it annoying that it&#x27;s so prevalent. Whichever it is.')
