There are a huge number of examples of successful internet infrastructure projects that are non-commercial, perhaps with commercial participants or sponsors but not commercial themselves. (The IETF, Let&#x27;s Encrypt, and Linux all come to mind.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.potaroo.net&#x2F;ispcol&#x2F;2020-09&#x2F;root.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.potaroo.net&#x2F;ispcol&#x2F;2020-09&#x2F;root.html</a> (posted on HN a while ago) says that the DNS root servers get about 10^11 queries per day, or one million queries per second. Hitting 10K queries per second on a single server is entirely doable, so you would just need 100 cloud VMs to handle the entire root DNS load.<p>I realize the TLD servers are more loaded than the roots, but it&#x27;s still not so much traffic that it&#x27;s entirely out of the question to make it a community-run service on the basis of traffic &#x2F; engineering effort. So what other reason is there that it must be commercial?<p>(Note that there are over 10 million .org domain names, and they charge fees of about $9. Even if you cut fees to $1, that&#x27;s still plenty of money for both infrastructure and labor. You could hire a team of ten SREs at very-senior-FAANG salaries and still have a bunch of money left over.)')
