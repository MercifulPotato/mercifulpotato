I’m genuinely curious as to maybe you think corporations censoring speech is appropriate. And I like this forum to be able to ask.<p>In my mind, I don’t want the phone company bleeping me out when I curse. Or disconnecting my service because they think I might be buying drugs. Phone companies are regulated by government to legally require these kinds of free speech requirements. But that doesn’t mean I can crank call people, or spam people, there’s still rules.<p>I think my problem with these companies is that they are arbitrary in their restrictions. And they seem biased politically.<p>Perhaps they aren’t biased. But similarly, while being required to show ID to vote may seem reasonable, in practice it discriminated against certain political parties.')
