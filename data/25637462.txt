Good thing restaurants don&#x27;t count on alcohol sales to stay afloat.<p>* Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such as Premier League football can continue<p>__ &#x27;Elite&#x27; athletes, as is the case for the rest of the &#x27;elites&#x27;, should not have to follow the same rules as the plebs.<p>* Outdoor sports venues - such as golf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close<p>__ Yeah - let&#x27;s take a game (golf) that&#x27;s done outdoors, in groups of 4 or less, and ban it. Don&#x27;t worry - you&#x27;re allowed to walk around the exact same golf course for excercise (as that&#x27;s one of the only reasons you can leave your home), but if you have to swing a club you&#x27;ll catch COVID.')
