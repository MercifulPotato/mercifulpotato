Until one time my brother in law was on non-paid leave for two weeks and he was looking for anything to do. We decided to give it a go. Everyday he would sit beside me, watch Netflix for all day and just look at my screen from time to time. Productivity rose _instantly_. After a single day I was thrilled, after a week I was absolutely sure that I need to hire someone after he gets back to his old job.<p>Some tips: the person you&#x27;re going to hire must be somewhat cheeky. They must cut through your bs, force you to explain why you&#x27;re on youtube, ask you if you really need that for your work etc. Furthermore, working side by side works better than through Hangouts, Skype and others. I have multiple displays and I&#x27;ve started to cheat the system as vast majority of screen share apps allow you to share single screen only. We&#x27;re in process on finding an app that allows one to share all displays (you might need couple extra CPU cores if you have 4-5 displays).')
