I work for a large company and the salary bands are defined by the HR, so we don’t much “wiggle room.” I personally don’t have any issue with hiring folks who are overqualified. But when I say overqualified I mean I’m seeing guys with phd in computer science and guys with experience leading large engineering teams that apply for jr roles. These people deserve much more compensation than HR will let us give them. And most of the time comp isn’t given on the job posts (I’m trying to change that) so they don’t find out until they go to the first screen.')
