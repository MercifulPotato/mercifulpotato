Not 100% able to transfer the entire library, but always in the 90% range.<p>Overall I think that music streaming services were probably the best services for switching platforms, and this is a blow that is surely gonna damage that reputation for me. Compare that to other markets that offer something similar (like ebooks or video streaming) where there&#x27;s absolutely no chance for you to retain even 10% of your library if you decide to switch, so services like Songshift make no sense in those fields.<p>Having just three major music publishing conglomerates is both a blessing and a curse.')
