They&#x27;re effective, not because they are clearly correct, but because a good counter to them requires answers to many difficult-to-answer questions:<p>How does a large population affect policy? How much do economies of scale make things easier? How much does bureaucracy make things harder?<p>What does diversity mean? How much is in the eye of the beholder?<p>To what extent does diversity cause division? To what extent does diversity spark innovation?<p>In addition to these questions, the debate entails comparisons and contrasts of nations, most of which you hasn&#x27;t visited. You end up trading pairs of statistics, without intimate knowledge of their correctness and equivalence.<p>For such reasons, I just avoid arguing about size and diversity. I&#x27;d have to write a book to provide a solid answer.')
