I use Avocado a lot for cooking but not on a brand new pan.  I&#x27;ve certainly tried to season with it specifically when I was new, but find it flaky and cumbersome.<p>I find fatty meats(bacon, sausage) or just canned lard to work absolutely best for seasoning.  It&#x27;s also what our ancestors used before they probably even knew what an avocado was.  For a vegan, I&#x27;d assume shortening is ok as well, but I&#x27;ve never actually tested that.')
