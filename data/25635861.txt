We wanted a large TV for home theatre, but couldn&#x27;t find anything over 65&quot; that wasn&#x27;t &quot;smart&quot;.<p>It takes 3-5 seconds to turn on, then another 10-20 seconds to react to input from the remote (at which time it will rapidly replay all input provided that it didn&#x27;t react to in this time, sometimes turning itself back off for no reason).<p>All of the &quot;apps&quot; are barely responsive and crash regularly. Hulu, particularly will crash at the end of every episode.<p>I&#x27;ve tried factory resets, and was hopeful about an open source mod until I discovered my firmware version is &quot;unpatchable&quot; as of yet.<p>The Internet of Shit is alive and well.')
