Can you imagine how inconvenient it would be if Ford&#x27;s gas vehicles could only be refuelled at Ford gas stations?<p>Charging networks that are as extensive as Teslas will be built much faster if they&#x27;re shared by all brands of vehicles. Manufacturers seem to understand this, and that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re doing - investing in networks like Ionity (Europe) and EA (USA).<p>As for ease of use, yes, Tesla sets the standard here. But other manufacturers will eventually catch up, with technology like CCS Plug &amp; Charge.')
