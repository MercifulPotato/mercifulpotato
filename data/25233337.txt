For example you make at least $15 an hour at McDonalds in Sweden since that is what the union agreement is for that sector. McDonalds isn&#x27;t forced to sign it, but if they do they are protected against strikes. However you can have a small company without union agreement and pay whatever you like, but if your employees are in a union they might use it to start a strike action if your conditions are too bad.<p>Note that in Sweden unions aren&#x27;t company specific so there is no way to prevent people from joining one.')
