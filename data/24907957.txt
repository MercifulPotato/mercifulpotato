I&#x27;m not handwaving away what they say as brainwashing.  I&#x27;m just saying that the gov&#x27;t has an inordinate effect of influence on their population. I don&#x27;t view propaganda as a gov&#x27;t drone on the TV telling you what to do ala NK, but just like the US, it&#x27;s this permeating effect in the media and culture.<p>I don&#x27;t think every Chinese person thinks exactly the same way.  But if you just look at the effects, they have a way of stirring nationalism that we do not have.  Trump tried so hard to do the &quot;China Virus&quot; thing and look where that got him.  And it&#x27;s disingenuous to suggest because they can&#x27;t hand wave away social problems inside the country that they somehow have &quot;weak&quot; influence.  It&#x27;s not an all or nothing.<p>I&#x27;m curious what you&#x27;re readings are on things softer things like the NBA ban over the tweet, things like ban on Korea products over THAAD (less off an over-reaction, but still), arm twisting Chinese&#x2F;Korean actors&#x2F;stars to support their worldview (see BTS stuff going on), Blizzard, etc.  I can point to l0s of other examples where it is indeed an &quot;over-reaction&quot; on their part.  This isn&#x27;t even scratching the surface of their harder initiatives like in Africa.<p>The &quot;trajectory changing&quot; as you mention is basically the rest of the world submitting to how China sees the world.  And to be honest, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s &quot;unfair&quot; or anything, it&#x27;s what they do as a country in position of power.  It&#x27;s also a cultural thing, pride, etc. (my personal opinion on this as well).  I&#x27;m ethnically Chinese so yeah, I understand the mindset to some extent.')
