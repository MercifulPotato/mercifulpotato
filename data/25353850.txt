I don&#x27;t like tipping and so I do not eat out usually because of this.<p>Right now I understand that we need to do our part to help small businesses, so I&#x27;m making an effort and tricking my brain into eating out by not tipping. This is where I want to put my money: I think it&#x27;s my responsibility if small businesses are going to survive, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my responsibility if workers are not paid well.')
