After stating that most of the dealers who took the buyout only sold a few Cadillacs a month, the article goes on to say that they took the buyout because of skepticism about the prospect electric cars. I don&#x27;t see how they draw that connection instead of the more obvious conclusion that making a massive investment to support a brand that you don&#x27;t sell a lot of is not financially feasible.')
