You would typically only use a newtype when you&#x27;re just giving a new name to the same type.<p>Having a Magnitude newtype over Int doesn&#x27;t change the range of permissible values but does prevent using a Length where a Magnitude was expected, for example.<p>In all typed languages you&#x27;ll eventually see a function with multiple arguments of the same type and have to check the documentation (or worse, implementation) to know what each is for. Having a zero cost type alias to make it clear is an improvement and IMO is a form of type safety.<p>Having a data type that can hold illegal values is a bad idea. Using an Int for Length implies you know what to do with negative lengths, for example. A newtype won&#x27;t help there.')
