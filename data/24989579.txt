We can get to 80% renewables cheaply. And as the modelers update their cost curves to adapt to the pace of storage&#x27;s learning curve, we will be able to get to 90% renewables cheaply, then 95%, then 100% as we start to decarbonize the non-electrical parts of our economy.<p>And though there were tax incentives that helped build the industry, and help from countries like Germany that decided to start buying the expensive first generation products in order to drive down prices, the end result is that we are now living in a world where tech has changed the economic landscape.<p>The cheapest grids to be build will not be based on fossil fuels. Developing countries will be able to build renewables+storage based micro grids far more cheaply than they will build traditional wires + thermal heat engines. And places with the wealth to do long term investing will be able to build long distance transmission to distribute cheap renewables with less storage.')
