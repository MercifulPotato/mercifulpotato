Sometimes you have an endpoint that needs that due to resource usage, but the number of users is so low that setting up a complicated auth system isn’t worth it.<p>Minimalist frameworks are great for either very small (since they don’t need much of anything) or very large projects (since they will need a bunch of customization regardless).<p>In that regard, I think Django is kind of like the Wordpress of Python.')
