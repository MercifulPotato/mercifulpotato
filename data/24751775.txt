Eliminating cash bail doesn&#x27;t mean eliminating the ability to hold people who are an extreme flight risk or who are likely a danger to others.<p>&quot;Sit around for a few days&quot; has more consequences than your dismissive attitude implies.  Many people who land in jail like this will lose their job if they &quot;sit around for a few days&quot;.  If they&#x27;re people who are already living on the margins of society, it&#x27;s pretty likely that losing their job might, just might, make them turn to crime to make ends meet, even if they hadn&#x27;t committed one in the first place.')
