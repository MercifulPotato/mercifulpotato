Shootings are very, very rare. And they are concentrated in certain types of places (e.g., poor urban ghetto) such that the parts of the country that aren&#x27;t these places have vanishingly small probabilities of being hurt by a shooting.<p>Gun murders in the U.S. are a very low percentage of deaths (0.39%) and preventable deaths (~1.1%, there&#x27;s some disagreement about what&#x27;s &quot;preventable&quot;). That&#x27;s 0.0036% of the population per year gun-murdered. That this statistic is 3x some other country&#x27;s is irrelevant because 3x a small number is still a small number. If your goal is to prevent untimely deaths, focus on boring things like falls, car accidents, and diabetes.')
