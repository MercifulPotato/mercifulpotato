I&#x27;d go so far as to say that most athletes will deal with both during their career.<p>Learning to manage it is truly an art.  If you&#x27;re too conservative you leave a lot on the table.  Being too aggressive absolutely will get you injured.<p>The one consistent thing though that research shows is that if you are considtently doing workouts that you would rate as a 10&#x2F;10 on your own internal uncalibrated scale, you are at much higher risk for injury.<p>The art of knowing how hard to push yourself isn&#x27;t something that people just intuitively know.  It takes experience of failing in both directions to nail the sweet spot.  It&#x27;s not impossible to learn, but I agree that most athletes don&#x27;t even have it nailed.  Thats one of the things a good coach is for.')
