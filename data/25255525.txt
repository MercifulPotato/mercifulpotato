Knowing how to create a protein with the precise shape to become biologically active has soaked up a lot of R&amp;D funding toward pie-in-the-sky techniques that promise to advance that agenda (like quantum or DNA computing).<p>If this method works as DeepMind says, it will immediately be adopted by every pharma to assess and tweak the shape of candidate proteins.')
