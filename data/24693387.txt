Trees are often (though not always, and increasingly less so) largely untouched by grass fire.  Back-burning is highly effective on grassfire.<p><i>Scrub</i> burns ferociously, far more violently than one might expect, thanks to the volatile oils.  For much of Southern California, this is a poorly-manageable threat.<p>An entrenched crown fire is a true fury, not to be trifled with.  The main fire can burn in a location for hours (rather than minutes), and individual trees or roots for days, even  months.<p>The heat from even a modest forest fire is ferocious.  I found myself a 1&#x2F;2--1&#x2F;4 mile or so from a relatively small burn (an acre or so), and could feel the radiant heat from inside a car.<p>A hillside on fire, or a fire-front overtaking a position, is like a blast furnace, with temps over 1,500Â°F.  Plus choking, blinding smoke, poisonous fumes, low oxygen, and flying and falling flaming debris.<p>A 1km deforested buffer might help, along with building codes.')
