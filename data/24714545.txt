(1h transit to airport, 2h at airport, 3h flight, 1h transit to London)<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean - that gets you into London at 2pm  not 9am (2am + 1 + 2 + 3 = 9am New York = 2pm London.)<p>To get into London at 9am you&#x27;d need to leave New York City at 10pm (9am - 1 - 3 - 2 = 3am London = 10pm New York. Which seems fine you&#x27;re doing it overnight no days lost? You&#x27;d not get tons of sleep that night but you&#x27;re not wasting a day either way. Could leave at 8pm and get two hours&#x27;s sleep in the arrivals lounge!<p>And leaving at 10pm instead of 5pm as you have to now makes all the difference because it now isn&#x27;t interfering with your day at all! That was the goal wasn&#x27;t it? Makes it worth it?')
