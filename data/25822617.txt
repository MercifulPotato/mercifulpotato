And yes of course in the age of high level frameworks and glued CRUD pruducts, some programming jobs are more social than technical. But not necessarily all.<p>And I&#x27;m seeing lots of this sentiment nowadays on social media, that all &quot;allegedly&quot; merit based nerdy &quot;gatekeeping&quot; is merely about white male privilege and hence not inclusive.')
