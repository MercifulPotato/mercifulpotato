There&#x27;s no reason to assume that there will be new jobs to replace old jobs next time. Because this time it&#x27;s going to descend on us a lot faster.<p>This is not a &quot;simple&quot; perspective, and if I&#x27;m permitted to be equally offensive, I suggest yours is a naive perspective. After all, this is already beginning to play out in our economies today.<p>It used to be that being successful meant that you owned the most successful store in your town, and maybe also the three other closest towns. Now, success is judged on a national or even international level. Success is achieved by fewer people at bigger scales. Success then looked like Wal-Mart. And now it looks like Amazon.<p>Success used to look like a dozen taxi medallions in NYC. Now it looks like Uber.<p>Do you really think that the &quot;American Dream&quot; will withstand a large fraction of truck drivers, taxi drivers, manufacturing line workers and clerical workers being made forcefully unemployed?
