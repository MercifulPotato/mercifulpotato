I had no clue that there were these interesting effects from the development process, it&#x27;s a great write up you have in the wiki.<p>I ran through the docs but haven&#x27;t tried it yet. One question&#x2F;feature request, is there a cli mode available? I&#x27;d love to be able to set up some automatic pipelines to develop my photos, using a couple of pre-configured settings. If I could save some settings &amp; then run those settings from the cli on a photo, that would be most excellent.<p>Edit: existing issue for a cli-driven interface exists at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CarVac&#x2F;filmulator-gui&#x2F;issues&#x2F;119" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CarVac&#x2F;filmulator-gui&#x2F;issues&#x2F;119</a>')
