The filming and scenery is very impressive, but the story  - not so much. Here are some German reviews from 1927:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Thea von Harbou invents an impossible plot that is crammed with motifs. Nothing but emotional phrases. Dreadful. A serious topic cruelly kitsched up. Effects not because the story demands them, but because the film wants to show its tricks. The end, the tearful reconciliation between employer and employee - awful.&quot;\n\n  &quot;Take ten tons of horror, pour a tenth of sentimentality over it, cook it up with social sensitivity and spice it up with mysticism as needed, stir it up with marks (seven million) and you get a topnotch colossal film.&quot;\n\n   &quot;The director apparently had an utopian film in mind that should contain the major contemporary currents. Something for everyone: the &quot;Metropolis&quot; for the bourgeoisie, the assault on the machines for the workers, the collective for the Social Democrats, a good heart and the spirit of the savior for the Christians. Apart from the kitschy content, the film&#x27;s technical performance is undoubtedly excellent and unmatched to date.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to see a great Fritz Lang movie, watch &quot;M&quot; (1931). It&#x27;s much, much better [0].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d_I2akJ0k2w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d_I2akJ0k2w</a>')
