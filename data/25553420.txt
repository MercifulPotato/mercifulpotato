Because plenty of people do it with drones. A better comparison would have been with laser pointers, another thing many people think is just a harmless toy.<p>&gt; Of course for the latter [cars] we even have demonstrable harm, not only aggressive overregulation<p>This goes way beyond disingenuous. Do we <i>have</i> to wait for the harm to happen before considering regulation? There&#x27;s a lot of truth in the popular wisdom that &quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot; so I&#x27;m curious what&#x27;s a solid argument to suddenly demand being reactive rather than proactive especially when it comes to lives. I mean other than the one making my point above, that people want to play with &quot;the toy&quot;.')
