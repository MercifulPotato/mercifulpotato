Is a special education teacher faculty?  What about learning center, where students who need extra help in a specific subject go while the rest of the class continues regular learning?  What about specialists who teach computer, science, garden, art, music?  (And who give the teachers a break during the school day.)<p>As for administrators, the ones I see at schools are usually needed: a nurse or medical aide, a psychologist, a librarian, two front desk people (both so you have backup if someone is sick, and so you aren&#x27;t without someone if a student&#x2F;parent needs assistance out of the office), custodians are important (you need two, one for daytime, and one for nighttime.  Yes, students can do cleanup at some point, but not K-3 at least), etc.<p>Here&#x27;s the staff directory of an elementary school near me.
