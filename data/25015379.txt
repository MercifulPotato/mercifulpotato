If the shared filter learned that all mails from that provider are junk, then gmail may not accept any more mails from that provider.<p>But the provider is interested in his ability to send mails to gmail customers - because his own customers demand it.\nSo, a good provider would just kick out that rouge customer who sends junk.<p>And that&#x27;s where the fun begins: A big provider can deliver spam, if it&#x27;s only a small percentage of his usual volume (too big to fail). And not every provider is cooperative.\nAnd the process is slow - some filter has to be fed a large amount of junk, so it finally rejects a large portion of of the valid mail.<p>A better way is: Get your provider to send an abuse mail to the origin. In my experience, it&#x27;s still a fight against windmills, but every bit helps.')
