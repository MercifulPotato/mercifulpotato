By definition, you hear from the talkers more, perhaps because the doers are too busy actually doing things, and to your point there are times when the talkers can sound dismissive of the doers, for whatever reason. But in HN&#x27;s defence, you do hear more from actual doers here than perhaps anywhere else.')
