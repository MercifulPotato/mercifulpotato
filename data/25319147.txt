I hate to talk with people who quote Hegel or Kant all the time, using them as natural laws. Even I agree with some of it and respect them a lot, I don&#x27;t think in essence they&#x27;re more valuable than any random homeless people say. There are people who read a ton but have the poorest mind. The same goes to artists, there&#x27;re a ton of artists who read a lot, watched a lot and listened to a lot but still make absolute crap.<p>I think getting into the field of philosophy is very different from developing a personal philosophy. The &quot;field&quot; sounds to me like you&#x27;ll be talking to other people who study philosophy, and you&#x27;re expected to read certain materials to stay literal. But to develop your own personal philosophy there&#x27;s no requirements about what you need to read. I consider myself to have strong personal philosophy, where I have a general rule &#x2F; ideal mindset that explains everything (ideal meaning I might not act to what I believe in), and my philosophies are the direct reason that I&#x27;m always very happy in life (which is my primary goal). I rarely talk to other people about these, so I consider myself not in the field of philosophy.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a general clear path to develop a personal philosophy. What is personal philosophy? It&#x27;s your own personal way of living. I would say it&#x27;s a lot luck, either you found it or not. It&#x27;s possible to read something, or watched something that coincidentally matched very well with your underlying personal philosophy that you haven&#x27;t discovered yourself yet, and discovered a bit after experiencing those, so my only advise would be stay honest with yourself, keep reading &#x2F; watching &#x2F; listening to whatevery you&#x27;re most interested in. Personally I think the film <i>First Love: The Litter on the Breeze (1998)</i>, <i>20th Century Nostalgia (1997)</i> and <i>The Troubleshooters (1988)</i> helped me discover my personal philosophy, but that&#x27;s highly personal, just written here for reference (also recommend to everyone because they&#x27;re good).')
