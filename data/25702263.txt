Fluvoxamine is very different than other SSRIs because it has significant effects at the sigma-1 receptor. The only other SSRI with significant sigma-1 activity is Sertraline, but it has the opposite effect at sigma-1.<p>However, it&#x27;s possible that the anti-COVID properties are unrelated to Fluvoxamine&#x27;s actions at the serotonin transporter or the sigma-1 receptor. We just don&#x27;t know.')
