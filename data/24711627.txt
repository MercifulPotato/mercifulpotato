I work in a field very closely aligned with electric aircraft, and people who say &quot;electric planes&quot; without further qualification virtually always mean &quot;electric 737s&quot;.<p>I also strongly question your assertion that viable light electric aircraft could &quot;revolutionize flight&quot;. What exactly would the revolutionize? 2 seat electric trainers already exist, but the niche they fill is tiny. You&#x27;re not going to move the needle on aircraft emissions with anything short of electric airliners. The rest of it is just a way to keep the research funded until we get there.')
