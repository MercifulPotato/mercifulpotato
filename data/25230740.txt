There should be a write up somewhere that people can link to instead of having to explain it all again to a new crowd. You could even link all of the research and research opportunities into ways of mitigating those problems, which would just make the point all the better.<p>When you solve those n problems we can talk about whether you can solve them at a price point that makes commercial hydrogen viable. Until then we can use it for space ships, which by design spend their entire life outdoors and far away from any structure or worker that isnâ€™t there to directly or indirectly support the fuel delivery system, and is nowhere near civilians.')
