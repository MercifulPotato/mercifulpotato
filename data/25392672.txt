Potentially enough legitimacy to win.  I&#x27;m not saying there is enough to win, but the potential is there and it should be given a fair hearing by the media &amp; judges.<p>From day 1 of this election, the media has 50% of this country <i>convinced</i> that everything Trump&#x27;s lawsuits are nothing except outlandish lies &amp; conspiracies.  Judges included.<p>But it started many years ago.<p>The media lies, spins, and omits.  They do not report.  Yet this is the information most people rely on.<p>There is an <i>incredible</i> amount of bias in the media against Trump.  People who say otherwise are likely enured to it because its been this way for many years.  The media has always been biased but it&#x27;s been taken to a whole new level over the past 4 years.<p>When people dismiss Trump&#x27;s lawsuits, it&#x27;s done with absolute prejudice.  Judges included.  &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot;.  &quot;Baseless accusations&quot;.  Such words can be found in mainstream media all over the place.<p>Say what you want about Trump as a person, but many of the legal complaints are legitimate (not all).  .The only claims that the media airs are the clearly outlandish ones (of which there are a few.)<p>Many of the claims <i>are</i> valid and <i>are</i> significant.  Election laws have been ignored - on a large scale.  One can speculate that the laws were broken with the intent to elect Biden, but its very difficult to prove intent.<p>But it&#x27;s not very difficult to prove that election laws were broken.  There is quite a lot of evidence.  Hundreds of affidavits&#x2F;testimonies of evidence.  Is it enough to turn the election?  It&#x27;s a legitimate question with a legitimate basis.<p>Most judges have elected to casually dismiss these affidavits.  Many of their judgements are loaded with clearly biased partisan editorialization.  Noone calls them on their partisan BS.  Yes, Republican appointed judges have dismissed cases.  This does not make it OK for partisan judges to dismiss cases for partisan reasons.<p>And Trump hasn&#x27;t lost 50 lawsuits.  It&#x27;s closer to 5-6.  I&#x27;m sure random people have filed lawsuits and lost their cases, but these are not cases that Trump&#x27;s campaign filed, promoted, or even discussed.<p>When I have tried to very specifically point out in great detail how the judges have effectively ignored dozens of affidavits, I have been called names, dismissed, and downvoted.<p>When I have tried to very specifically point out the legitimacy of some of the claims that Trump&#x27;s legal team have made, I have been called names, dismissed, and downvoted.<p>I expect I will be downvoted and ridiculed on this post as well.<p>But this is what&#x27;s wrong with America.  It&#x27;s impossible to have a substantive discussion on any topic related to Trump, and it&#x27;s been that way for 4 years.<p>In recent years the media has focused their weapons of censor against Trump.  Tomorrow it could be Bernie Sanders.  And I would be defending his right to be heard as vigorously as I am now.<p>I understand a lot of people do not want Trump to win.  But to dismiss his claims as baseless and wild speculation is doing a disservice to the truth.  Regardless of what you think of him as a person, the truth should still be important.<p>Ok, I am done ranting.  You can start the ridicule&#x2F;downvoting.
