The legislative side looked doomed to fail so Trump rallied his peers and incited them with words like trial by combat via Rudy Giuliani.<p>1. Pence was pressured before and DURING the siege. Trump called once his followers were besieging the building to pressure Pence to overthrow the certified votes of this nation. His rhetoric was 100% responsible for the crowd&#x27;s focus on Pence.<p>2. Trump directly pointed at the media at the rally and labeled them again as the enemy. During the siege all sorts of media members were violently assaulted. With the mob labeling them antifa as a means to rationalize mob violence against them. An AP reporter sustained a beating for several minutes as the crowd shouted for his death.<p>The doors on the Capitol building had &quot;murder the media&quot; scrawled on it by Trump&#x2F;GOP&#x27;s supporters. They chanted for Pence&#x27;s hanging at the same doors.<p>This was a coup attempt coordinated and driven by sitting Republicans and the President of the USA. There is a direct line to be drawn from their actions to the results seen in the Capitol. The coup barely failed.')
