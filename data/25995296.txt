They&#x27;re lazy, and you can do things with them that you can&#x27;t do with &quot;strict&quot; collections. In some ways they are faster than strict collections, in others they are slower. If you plan to be iterating over a Seq multiple times, you should probably turn it into a list or array first, just like in C#.<p>That example without pipes is<p><pre><code>  List.reduce (+) (List.map ((*) 2) [1;2;3;4])\n</code></pre>\nLinked lists are common in any functional programming language, the performance is bad but that only matters if you&#x27;re writing something performance-critical. Otherwise, the ergonomics dominate: lists are very easy to work with.')
