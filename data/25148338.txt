Still, it must be half-decent or countries would not buy it. e.g. Australia is licensing its recent sub design from France. But, it is buying the F-35, despite the lock-in problems. Israel produces an astonishing amount of its own tech but, likewise, is buying the F-35.<p><pre><code>    &gt; I notice that you don&#x27;t address the question\n    &gt; that Europe already spend more than Russia.\n</code></pre>\nI thought my comments about the relevance of NATO to be a response to this. It is or it isn&#x27;t, countries should decide. There are non-NATO European countries that spend less than 2%.<p>My themes in the original comment was the notion of the European military on two grounds. (1) If military goals were important, nations would&#x2F;should have been lifting their weight in NATO. (2) There are obstacles to creating a command structure for a European military, which is a very weak federation.')
