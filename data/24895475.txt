Typically you punish when AN EXISTING law is broken. In this case, OP is arguing for new punishment based on new laws that were broken in the past.<p>&gt;My guess, it was already illegal to poison the environment<p>No. The devil is in the definition of &#x27;poison the environment&#x27;. We have coal plants that &#x27;poison the environment&#x27;. We have solar panels, that through manufacturing, maintenance and decommissioning, &#x27;poison the environment&#x27;.<p>&gt;Corporations are not people. You can punish a corporation without any of that considerations.<p>Who owns corporations? This &quot;corporations are not people&quot; is such a clich√©. All the rights that corporations have stem from the rights of the owners. Corporations have rights, because the owners have rights.<p>And who says the corporations are solely responsible? An unincorporated contractor may be responsible as well.')
