Ohio in 1969, limited the scope of banned speech to that which would be directed to and likely to incite imminent lawless action. That is where the line in free speech ends.<p>The notion that the purveyor of technologies used to distribute speech that are incitements to imminent lawless action has no legal obligation in regards to the consequences is akin to saying a theater owner has no obligation to make sure a person who&#x27;s repeatedly screamed &quot;Fire!&quot; and caused a stampede that injures people isn&#x27;t allowed in their theater doesn&#x27;t hold up. And it has ground at all to stand on if the theater owner actively pursues them and promotes they can do that in their theater.<p>In this case, Parlor has essentially pursued and invited those who love to scream &quot;Fire&quot; and actively encourage them to use their service to do that. And in fact they used it to organize a mob and help plan a insurrection.<p>And it did not matter to them that lies were being spread to fan the flames of hate, or who or how many might lose their lives as a result.<p>Parlor is a prime example of the lowest form of capitalism. Little different than crack dealers. We cannot let them hide behind the noble goals of &quot;Free Speech&quot;.')
