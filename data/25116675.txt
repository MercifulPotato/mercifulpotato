These facilities are not cost competitive without state sponsored subsidies (whereas renewables are the cheapest generation technology without subsidies). France is exporting nuclear power with aging reactors they could not afford to replace with new reactors today, and these reactors run at a lower capacity factor due to their load following configuration.<p>Nuclear proponents keep advocating for an overly expensive technology that, in recent decades, never arrives on time or within budget. This is unnecessary with Europe&#x27;s solar, wind, and hydro potential. Even more expensive offshore wind is cheaper than the cheapest nuclear generator.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;france-nuclearpower&#x2F;building-new-nuclear-plants-in-france-uneconomical-environment-agency-idUSL8N1YF5HC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;france-nuclearpower&#x2F;building...</a> (Building new nuclear plants in France uneconomical -environment agency)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451419&#x2F;lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-140.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451419&#x2F;lazards-levelized-cost-o...</a> (Lazard Levelized Cost of Energy Comparison 2020, slide 3)')
