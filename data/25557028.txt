Item(by='amalantony06', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609134429, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25553993, text='&gt; The failings of The Church are well documented and don&#x27;t need to be repeated here.<p>The failings of the Church does not make it questionable. Like with any endeavour of man, there are bound to be failings. Heck, the first Pope, Peter, chosen by Christ himself denied him thrice. So, why should the failings of the subsequent members of the clergy be of any surprise to anyone? The epistles in the New Testament talks about false teachers and immoral people within the early Church. So this is nothing new under the sun.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m more interested in what doesn&#x27;t get talked about: the crowding of the marketplace of ideas.<p>Not sure what century you live in, but in the 21st century, the Church and the ideas that it espouses are mostly rejected, esp of, but not limited to matters of chastity, teachings on what constitutes a valid marriage, divorce, religious piety etc. Your claim might have been valid in the 13th century, but we don&#x27;t live in the middle ages any more.<p>&gt; The belief system promulgated by it is antiquated and does not serve society well.<p>That is an opinion, and cannot be philosophically or scientifically proven.')
