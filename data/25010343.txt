Item(by='neya', descendants=None, kids=[25011941, 25012085], score=None, time=1604690735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008894, text='I properly got a genuine HP printer and cartridge combo for what seemed like a good deal ($70) in Singapore.\nIt worked fine for about 6 months until when the cartridges had run out of ink. So, I went to a store and bought a pair of genuine HP ink which was crazy expensive (combined with black and white, it almost amounted to 80% of the printer cost for the XL size at the time).\nStill, I wanted to be a genuine user and I paid for it.<p>When I replaced the new cartridges in the tray, the printer insisted that I connect to the internet and I refused to connect it because it wasn&#x27;t necessary I thought. It wouldn&#x27;t let me even print a single paper despite the tray being fully loaded.<p>So, fine with it, I connected the damn thing to the internet. Suddenly, I got a notice saying the ink cartridges aren&#x27;t genuine. I was puzzled, went back and fought with the store manager and got a replacement and they made sure it was 100% genuine this time.<p>So, I went back, set it up and nope. Still the same issue. The cartridges were full and brand new, and I really wanted to print some flyers for a business convention, which is why I was willing to invest the money because of the shortage of time I had.<p>The printer absolutely refused to print anything at all. HP support left me running around in circles like a headless chicken. I had to take a lot of heat because of this stupid printer for no fault of mine, simply because it was &quot;smart&quot; and needed an internet connection to do an offline job.<p>I was so mad that day that the first thing I did after I came from the business convention was took the damn thing apart and remove all the parts for arduino projects (motors, rollers, display, PSU, etc) and threw everything else away. I wrote a very rude note to their unhelpful customer support and went back and even apologized to the store manager who replaced my genuine cartridges.<p>It was an expensive lesson for me to learn not to trust any printing company, especially HP that relies on the internet to do an offline job. I follow this rule of thumb for coffee makers and every other hardware that shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;smart&quot; and should be dumb. I&#x27;m even ready to pay the premium these days for the dumb version of a product offering simply because..it is so much simpler.')
