That shows up on the curriculum in kindergarten. Would you have five year olds debating the merits of segregation?<p>Consider that people were having debates about whether things like democracy and slavery and caste systems were good for <i>centuries</i> before people got on board. And plenty of people still aren’t! What should the teacher do if the kids on Debate Team Jim Crow actually win the debate? Step in and say “actually, equality is better, let me show you why”? Or do we now have a bunch of kids who go through life thinking that we actually <i>should</i> make Black people drinking from different water fountains?<p>I also suspect that plenty of teachers themselves are not quite as bought in on racial equality as we’d hope.<p>Because problem is that segregation, fascism, etc aren’t “bad” per se. We don’t reject them because there’s some inherent logical fallacy — we do it because they’re <i>morally wrong</i>. It took us hundreds of years to get here, and if we’re going to get further it will be because we drew a line in the sand and said “hey, treating people in this particular way is just better than doing it this other way”.')
