In other words:<p>- How does the program making use of it make sure it&#x27;s not been patched so the code that&#x27;s supposed to run in the enclave runs without one?<p>- How does it know it&#x27;s not being run on an emulated CPU or in a VM? And that those checks haven&#x27;t been patched out, too?<p>- How does it make sure the OS is cooperating? I assume there is some cooperation required from the kernel at least.')
