Johnny Depp getting acused by Amber Heard, losing his upcoming acting roles, and after a time (and 87 cctv videos), she&#x27;s found to be the crazy&#x2F;violent one.<p>You have people like Pewdiepie getting accused of being a racist many times:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;18136253&#x2F;pewdiepie-vs-tseries-links-to-white-supremacist-alt-right-redpill" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;18136253&#x2F;pewdiepie-vs-tseries...</a><p>Pewdiepie has a special &#x27;power&#x27;, that he gets more views than Vox does, so he can atleast present his side of the story ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hjCsOmDmjEU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hjCsOmDmjEU</a> ).<p>Some people don&#x27;t have that media presence, but the media atleast scewed up enough, so they&#x27;re no settling multimillion dollar lawsuits (Nick Sandmann, the &#x27;smirking guy&#x27;).<p>Now imagine, you&#x27;re not a famous person, and you&#x27;re not in a position of being able to sue CNN. Just one mere accusation (whout proof, without anything), can totally destroy your life, and you have no way to fight back. No police report, no judge, no jury, just one &quot;he said, she said&quot;, one complaint, and there&#x27;s nothing you can do... you lose your job, maybe even your carreer, you might get thrown out of your college, or worse. The accuser can lie to the media, say you said something -ist, or -phobic, and there&#x27;s literally nothing you can do.<p>Now combine the &quot;nutcases&quot; with accusations, and your code using master&#x2F;slave terminology is racist (as a slav, i have no idea why &#x27;slave&#x27; is considered racist), boy&#x2F;girl in character selection screen and never after is transphobic, and i have no idea what &quot;not implementing all the pronouns&quot; is.<p>Now, we have two options... either we become sensitive to everytihing, and destroy normal human relations and comedy (although, we&#x27;ve gone most of the way there, because of so many protected groups and actions, not allowed to be joked about, the only group you can target your jokes at are white men (with movies like 40 days and 40 nights, where a rape of a man is a comedic high point, and many other examples)), or we can just grow up, not get offended by something someone somewhere said or did (especially if it was a joke), and not &quot;cancel&quot; people because of that.')
