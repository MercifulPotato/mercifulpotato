Sometimes the two systems cannot share a database, or a cookie.<p>Like everything else, JWT is sometimes used inappropriately.<p>And of course it&#x27;s not the only way to pass signed data between two systems. Sometimes it makes sense to create your own equivalent that supports only the pieces you need.<p>One popular criticism (and historical security risk) of JWT is that the spec allows signing algorithm flexibility. This is easily mitigated, but of course any tool that can be used improperly, will be, by someone.<p>But honestly, JWT is straightforward, simple, and has good library support across all popular languages. It&#x27;s a good choice for an API that you expose to groups outside your organization.')
