Nothing exotic. Output is around a gigawatt. Fuel loading on the first one started last month. Full power this year, if things go well. The second one is already under construction. More are planned.<p>China now gets 5% of its power from nuclear, up from half that five years ago.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prod-ng.sandia.gov&#x2F;techlib-noauth&#x2F;access-control.cgi&#x2F;2007&#x2F;076332.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prod-ng.sandia.gov&#x2F;techlib-noauth&#x2F;access-control.cgi...</a>')
