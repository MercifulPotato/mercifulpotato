I&#x27;m not on Ubuntu, so I don&#x27;t know if the Chromium package they ship has Pipewire enabled by default, but my guess is that they do.<p>I use a small extension to automatically default Zoom to opening calls in the browser (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;zoom-redirector&#x2F;fmaeeiocbalinknpdkjjfogehkdcbkcd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;zoom-redirector&#x2F;fm...</a>) and there I can share screens just fine (Full desktop, application window only, etc - For the most part, things work fine).<p>I&#x27;d give it another 12 months if you don&#x27;t want to have to think about it at all, but I&#x27;ll be honest, Arch&#x2F;Gnome&#x2F;Wayland is the happiest I&#x27;ve <i>EVER</i> been on desktop linux.')
