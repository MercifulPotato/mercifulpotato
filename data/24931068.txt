Trump, and the Senate, are doing everything they can to tank the economy ahead of a Biden victory, so it can be blamed on the democrats\n2. Covid\n3. When a republican is president, more money can be extracted from our economy, which is what the stock market represents. When a democrat is president, more money is invested in our economy, which is not necessarily the best for the stock market. \n4. When a republican is president, they bailout failing companies. Whenever a bailout is imminent, stocks go up. This is because risks have been socialized, meaning that they are no risks. \n5. When a republican is president, they lower taxes and pay off corporations more. This results in stock buy-backs. Instead of reinvesting in their company, owners use the money to buy back stock and consolidate power. This buy-back causes prices to spike, due to increased demand and decreased supply. The spike is temporary, because it does not represent an improvement in the company&#x27;s prospects, just a consolidation of power that benefits no one except the powerful.\n6. When Biden wins, all the countries that have been sinking their tentacles into our system to keep a puppet president in power are going to pull back, and do everything they can to make Biden look bad, so that another puppet will get elected that benefits them and harms US interests. We will no longer be slitting our own throats, so the aggression will pick back up. More terrorist attacks, and more clashes with other powers around the globe.')
