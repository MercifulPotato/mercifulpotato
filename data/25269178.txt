We&#x27;d have to chop our app up and that would introduce too much risk but we are suddenly capable of migrating the core to lambda with 6GB+ of RAM needed for our ETL. Image sizes were really small and we&#x27;d have to bundle in Puppeteer and other large libs so it&#x27;s tough to build a bundle that fits on lambda.')
