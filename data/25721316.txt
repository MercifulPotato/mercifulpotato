What we should have are election <i>workers</i> from each party, paired up, with transparently verifiable means of confirming that they <i>both</i> agree on every action taken.<p><i>&gt; The rules are decided ahead of time</i><p>And then those rules, established by the State legislatures ahead of time in accordance with the Constitution and Federal election law, are <i>changed</i> by State executive branch officials and judges. That is clearly unconstitutional.<p><i>&gt; With the &#x27;Dominion&#x27; system there is literally a paper record of each ballot</i><p>Printed out by a computer system with known vulnerabilities and laughable &quot;security&quot; precautions.<p><i>&gt; there were recounts that validated the electronic counts perfectly</i><p>By counting ballots which were printed by the same machines that gave the electronic counts, so this so-called &quot;check&quot; is meaningless.<p><i>&gt; If there is an issue with the elections, it&#x27;s related to &#x27;who can vote&#x27;.</i><p>Yep. The way to solve that is obvious: voter IDs with simple, objectively verifiable rules for eligibility and a requirement that every eligible voter must be issued one. Other countries have this. <i>Mexico</i> has this. Why can&#x27;t we?<p><i>&gt; If Trump had won the election, there would be zero concern over election integrity because it&#x27;s entirely derided from his populist narrative.</i><p>Excuse me? Trump won the 2016 election and for four years we&#x27;ve been hearing concerns over election integrity from the side that lost that one. Sure, those concerns weren&#x27;t coming from Trump supporters, because Trump won. And now, as you yourself illustrate, Trump <i>opponents</i> have no concerns whatever despite multiple issues at least as blatant as any of the ones Trump opponents complained about in 2016, because Trump lost. In other words, the winning side will never complain and the losing side always will, because the system is broken.')
