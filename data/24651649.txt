Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still that bad. But in the past it cost a factor of two or so, whenever I tried to get fancy.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much back in the past it is, but pretty much every time in the last ten years I tried to beat a C++ abstraction, I almost never managed to substantially improve (and since gcc.godbolt.org exists it made it much easier to witness that most of the abstraction layers entirely disappear at -O2)')
