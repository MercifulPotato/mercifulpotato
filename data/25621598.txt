It’s pretty nice as you can do things like having 3 x 1TB drives + 1 x 3TB drive and it Just Works to give 3TB of usable space.<p>&gt; Staying away from unstable features: Is RAID 5 &amp; 6 really considered unstable still?<p>Yup :(<p>Also last time I checked (I’d love to be corrected about this) even RAID1 still isn’t ideal (in particular, when a drive fails in a RAID1 array, you only get one chance to mount it r&#x2F;w and rebalance your data - after that, the array is read-only, and you need to recover by creating a new array on new disks and copy all the data across)')
