Get to the SpaceX terminal somewhere (maybe a major airport because of connecting flights), security checks, check in luggage and board an helicopter.<p>2. Fly to the launch platform.<p>3. Disembark, get up to Starship.<p>4. Many Gs of acceleration.<p>5. Fall to destination.<p>6. Many Gs of deceleration.<p>7. Disembark, board the helicopter.<p>8. Fly to the airport, immigration checks, collect luggage.<p>9. Leave the airport.<p>The two helicopter hops cost time, maybe not much more than some long rides on airport buses. The acceleration and deceleration will be exciting but maybe not everybody fit to fly can withstand them. I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody.')
