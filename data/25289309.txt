We have gigantic gaps in basic nutrition knowledge, and the idea that we have a strong idea of all existing important correlations is similarly completely and utterly incorrect.<p>The idea that flip-flopping is due to a &quot;vast marketing machine&quot; is also completely disingenuous. I&#x27;m not talking about pop science articles, I&#x27;m talking about disagreement between scientists.<p>I seriously don&#x27;t know where people get this idea that human nutrition is this advanced science where we know most of the answers. I can only assume it&#x27;s wishful thinking? It would be nice if we did... but we really don&#x27;t. And there&#x27;s a good reason for it, which is that it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to ethically perform decades-long controlled experiments with nutrition in people to provide definitive scientific answers, for the obvious reasons.')
