The intro to gamelisp reads like so:<p>&gt; Rust is my favourite programming language. It has impeccable performance, an expressive and powerful type system, and a great community.<p>&gt; However, when it comes to game development, Rust has a few well-known problems. Compile times are painfully slow, and the type system can sometimes feel rigid or bureaucratic. When adding a new feature to a game, you&#x27;ll often need to write code in a messy, fast, exploratory fashion - and in those cases, Rust can be a hindrance rather than a help.<p>Having to bolt a programming language from 1958 to your hip new language du jore to make it easier to use doesn&#x27;t exactly make a good case for using it.')
