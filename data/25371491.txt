It&#x27;s fascinating that several projects try to build a new framework to achieve multi-room streaming capable systems, while ignoring the existing, well working open source solution and building on that (I&#x27;m aware that several of these projects do allow to install LMS, but it&#x27;s often a somewhat of an afterthought and not well integrated).<p>If the effort for integrating the different components (MPD etc.), which still is not close to the capabilities of LMS would go instead into improving the front-ends for LMS (which do need an overhaul IMO), we would be so much further.')
