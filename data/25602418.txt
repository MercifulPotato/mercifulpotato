Galoob or whoever marketed the Game Genie did make a top-loading model, but as I recall, they are very rare.<p>I got an NES in 1988 when I was 4 or 5 and it died in 1993 and I got the new design for my birthday (a month before I got an SNES for Christmas, so it didn’t get a ton of use). I stupidly sold it at a garage sale for $20 in 1995, not realizing it would be worth a ton later on. But in 2001 or 2002, I actually took that original NES to an authorized repair center, they shipped it off and it returned, essentially brand new. It still works today. As I recall, I paid less than $50 for the repair, which was less than a front-loading NES was going for at the time on eBay. The fact that Nintendo would service a system that was 16 or 17 years old always stuck with me, especially since Sony disavowed working on a 1996 or 1997-era PSX at that same time (I managed to fix it myself, but Sony was utterly disinterested in even allowing me to pay to repair a misaligned laser and just wanted me to buy the redesigned PS One). It’s part of why I’ve continued to be a loyal Nintendo customer for more than 30 years.')
