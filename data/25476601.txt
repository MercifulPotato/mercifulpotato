Doing all of this actually takes a significant proportion of available CPU time per frame in C64 games. And that&#x27;s just for the character-based graphics mode, not the bitmap graphics mode — which you simply have not got a chance in hell at scrolling on the C64, because the VIC offers no assistance here and the CPU is nowhere near fast enough to do it.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on drawing more than 8 sprites!<p>(Ex C64 games programmer here)')
