Only exception is the pro&#x2F;anti-Chinese stuff, which is definitely a mix of real people and bots.<p>I keep pretty good tabs on the accounts I follow and I think I&#x27;m pretty good at determining who is &quot;a real person with real feelings saying real things they really think&quot; and bots, and from this analysis, I have zero faith that this tool has any modicum of reliability in a research setting.<p>I think it&#x27;s possibly accurate enough to say &quot;yes, this is <i>definitely</i> a human&quot;, but totally fails to identify bots. Thus, any research that uses this tool as a measure of bot influence is way off, because there are way too many false positives. Which I guess is a good thing for anyone who wants to say, &quot;look at all these people being suckered by all these bots!&quot; which is pretty unscrupulous.<p>YMMV')
