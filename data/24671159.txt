Epic alleges anticompetitive behavior on Apple&#x27;s part. Sure, fine, there will eventually be a trial. Epic will probably lose because their arguments are ridiculous, but juries have been convinced by stupider arguments, so who knows how it will play out? In the meantime, Epic has deliberately violated a contractual agreement and has been treated exactly in accordance with that contractual agreement. Epic would like a court injunction to force Apple to pretend like Epic has already won the case in the meantime, alleging that Fortnite and Unreal Engine being banned from iOS is causing irreparable harm to Epic in the meantime.<p>Apple&#x27;s point, that the judge seems to agree with is &quot;How can we be causing you harm when you <i>did this to yourself</i>?&quot;')
