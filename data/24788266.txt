Item(by='o_class_star', descendants=None, kids=[24790852, 24793694, 24801249], score=None, time=1602767761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24773330, text='As I get older, my theory of charisma is that it&#x27;s a product, more than it is an innate trait, and that anyone can &quot;become charismatic&quot;, although 99.9 percent of people never will, and the worst thing you can do for yourself is try. People seem superhuman-- energetic, brilliant, capable-- when surrounded by people who invest themselves entirely in making them seem so. Steve Jobs had no special social acumen, above-average but not genius-level intelligence, and no more hours in his day than the 24 we all have, but he managed to surround himself with the right people and, for a period of about 20 years, managed to convince the world that he had superhuman powers and a &quot;reality distortion field&quot; when in reality he was just a capitalist who dropped acid once.<p>Plenty of charismatic people are socially inept, charmless, and unpleasant in close interpersonal relationships, but this doesn&#x27;t make them any less charismatic on a stage. They often have no genuine friends, but tens or hundreds or thousands of people who will put aside their own concerns to do things for the charismatic individual.<p>Charisma is a pattern by which other people, for reasons that are hard to parse, and through mechanisms that are invisible, do things for the charismatic person. A charismatic person is threatening because others will kill for him, and he&#x27;s a desirable benefactor because others will commit resources to his causes, but it seems to be a self-perpetuating phenomenon that snowballs and can carry on for most of a lifetime. It does seem to collapse in old age. This is why charismatic but hideous people like Harvey Weinstein, Donald Trump, and Bill Cosby meet such ignominious ends. They&#x27;re invincible, until they&#x27;re not.<p>There are skills that enhance a person&#x27;s charisma. You can learn rhetoric, public speaking, and the norms of social interaction. But that&#x27;s all they are: skills. Nothing can guarantee charisma. Nothing can guarantee that you&#x27;ll get that core set of people to follow you that will produce a snowball effect. On that, it seems to be pretty random who wins and who doesn&#x27;t.<p>Charisma exists because people want to be the charismatic person. They want to be someone who can wave a hand and bring ruin to their enemies. What they don&#x27;t realize is that by following the charismatic, they&#x27;re defeating their own purpose. It is not traits of the charismatic that generate this feedback loop. It is mostly just luck. That said, the way to improve one&#x27;s odds to find people who are looking for a charismatic to follow, which means finding new territory, rather than hanging around an existing charismatic in a space where such people are already spoken-for.')
