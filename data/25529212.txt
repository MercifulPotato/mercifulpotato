Item(by='breck', descendants=None, kids=[25532246], score=None, time=1608829409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25529071, text='&gt; How is a domain imaginary property?<p>You are right about this one, the &quot;.org&quot; registry is orthogonal to IP laws and in fact, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with having centralized registries (which trademarks sort of are) as long as anyone can start one, which anyone can here. I would say the only connection to this specific issue is that I believe we&#x27;ve stagnated in protocols the past 30 years since the Web and EFF both came out due to copyright laws. We&#x27;re stuck in a more centralized place, and less decentralized where we could move to if information could move freely.<p>Internet censorship is handsdown completely dominated by having copyright laws. If you abolish copyright laws, you&#x27;d open the flood gates of peer 2 peer information sharing. those p2p connections would grow very, very strong (what fires together wires together), and it would become near impossible for centralized censorship orgs to work.<p>Very fair points! Hope that clarifies my stance a bit. People say &quot;the world is not black and white.&quot; I say &quot;no, it&#x27;s black and black^2&quot;. Abolishing #ImaginaryProperty in my mind is black^2, the current status quo is far inferior from every angle (except for people whose most important metric is to be in the .1%).')
