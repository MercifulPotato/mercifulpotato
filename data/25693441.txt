Their conclusions, including a finding that “current diversity policies promoting female-female mentorships, as well-intended as they may be, could hinder the careers of women,” angered many researchers. Critics attacked both the study’s conclusions and the methods used to reach them.<p>In a retraction notice published today, the authors wrote that they recognized the validity of some of the complaints, including concerns about “the use of co-authorship as a measure of mentorship.” &quot;<p>Wow, they used co-authorship == mentorship and from that assumption concluded that women-women mentor-mentee relationships result in worse outcomes? That&#x27;s one hell of a reach. How did this make it past peer review?')
