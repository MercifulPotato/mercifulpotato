Item(by='vitus', descendants=None, kids=[25239236], score=None, time=1606584535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238692, text='&gt; I&#x27;m pretty surprised that BBR has such rapid uptake - the technical situation remains a little unclear.<p>As I mentioned in a sibling comment, BBR has high uptake among Google properties, but not necessarily much outside; many of the other big players are still using CUBIC, since it&#x27;s tried and tested. Raw counts aren&#x27;t a super useful metric, especially if many sibling domains (e.g. google.com, google.com.hk) can count toward that same number. That said, BBR is available as an option in the mainline Linux kernel, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see at least a bit of cargo culting explaining its popularity (&quot;it works for Google, so...&quot;).<p>(Alexa top 250 sites are no longer free to view, apparently, but the top 50 contain at least four google properties. Other website rankings: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moz.com&#x2F;top500" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moz.com&#x2F;top500</a> shows no fewer than 45 hits for &quot;google&quot;, not to mention other properties such as Youtube or Blogger; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.netcraft.com&#x2F;topsites" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.netcraft.com&#x2F;topsites</a> has 33 hits for &quot;Google LLC&quot; out of their top 100.)<p>I&#x27;m personally surprised by the widespread use of algorithms outside of Cubic, personally. Some of these are obviously in-house, e.g. Akamai CC, and there are some cases of, say, CTCP from Windows Server 2008 machines, but Cubic is the default on Linux, newer versions of Windows, and even macOS, which I assume covers a large majority of servers.')
