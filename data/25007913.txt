There is no notion of time or sequencing: everything we write is a <i>definition</i>. If we don&#x27;t call another function, then our program will finish; if we don&#x27;t use recursion (either directly, indirectly via functions like `map`, or via a chain of mutually-recursive definitions) then our program&#x27;s behaviour will be fixed by the structure of our <i>code</i> (e.g. the number of calls we write). That&#x27;s fine for simple calculations, but most useful programs depend on the structure of their <i>data</i> (e.g. processing lines in a file, etc.); that requires recursion, since we can&#x27;t hard-code the right number of calls ahead of time.')
