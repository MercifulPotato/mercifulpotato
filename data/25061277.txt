Item(by='speedgoose', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605119725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057453, text='16GB is fine in my opinion. I have that amount with Microsoft Edge, VS Code, Microsoft Teams, and 20 Docker containers and it fits (Windows and WSL2).<p>However I need to be careful, For example I started using Tabnine recently and the memory usage per instance of vscode is way too high and I need to think about closing unused instances of vscode.<p>I&#x27;m considering to test  Github Codespaces so I get a fast environment in the cloud. But the ram amount is only 8GB max and since it probably runs on Azure the IOs performances will likely be awful. But it may be great and then 16GB on a laptop to run many instances of Electron is a lot more than enough.<p>But if I were to buy a new laptop tomorrow, I would like to get at least 32GB and a touchscreen. So no MacBook pro for me.')
