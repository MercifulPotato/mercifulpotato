Delete social media apps and use web version instead. (like twitter, facebook, linkedin.)<p>2. By doing step 1, you may overuse web version of social media platforms also. To prevent this, use a website blocking application. I use BlockSite. Make BlockSite password protected, so you cannot update&#x2F;remove blocked sites easily.<p>3. Use a long password to unlock your phone.<p>Today, I do not use social media at all. I just check once a week wikipedia&#x27;s main to page for the latest news. Entering a long password introduces a 5-7 seconds delay to open your phone and to surf on internet. So because of this 5-7 seconds overhead, i usually decide not to touch my phone if it is really not required.

Then i have developed, www.hntoplinks.com (hacker news aggregator daily&#x2F;weekly&#x2F;montly...) 7 years ago, but eventually started to spend too much time on my own web page and finally added subscription feature.\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hntoplinks.com&#x2F;subscribe" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hntoplinks.com&#x2F;subscribe</a>\nSo I have subscribed for weekly and monthly and annual top news. I receive an email on Monday morning 7AM, before starting the week. I just go through links and it gives me a good overview of the week. I do not use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;</a> and www.hntoplinks.com directly anymore.')
