Twitter is not in public. Twitter is the equivalent to you coming into my house.</i><p>You too are muddling things a bit, and this is important and goes to the core of the point of what US 1A &quot;rights&quot; actually are. A person&#x27;s <i>right</i> here encompasses not having force used against them, directly or by proxy. If you have someone as a guest in your house, they still have &quot;the right to generally say what they wish&quot;, they cannot be criminally prosecuted, fined, and you may not just shoot them or punch them in the face or the like either. But of course you absolutely may say as you wish right back, give them the boot, refuse to help out with a cab fare (you didn&#x27;t previously contract too), tell other people about it, never voluntarily associated with them ever again, etc. You may freely discriminate based on ideology. Their 1A rights don&#x27;t go away in your house, and neither do yours.<p>And all that is &quot;Free Speech&quot; as well, because it&#x27;s not a single solitary thing, it&#x27;s a system. It&#x27;s not that ideas are all equal and deserving of &quot;fair treatment&quot; or the like, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re <i>not</i>, but we don&#x27;t have an oracle to tell us which is which. Keeping consequences to social and economic balances some level of stability and pushing people towards what many&#x2F;most consider to be good ideas while allowing room for those dedicated enough to try to go against the current accepted wisdom and convince others. A process which may well take years, decades, even centuries, but the hope is that with enough time good ideas and information will tend to succeed better then false, so long as the system remains dynamic.')
