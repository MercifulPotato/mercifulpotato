They care about it only insofar as it gets you to use a Facebook account.<p>Not only to use a Facebook account, but to have access to even more intensive and intrusive monitoring and information harvesting from users.  All sorts of biometric and behavioral activity that is integral to using VR will now all be available to Facebook to integrate into customer profiles.  Then there is the possibility of behavioral influence through the use of AI.  Just like Facebook can influence behavior and choices by tailoring news feeds and ads to users, they will be able to mold the user&#x27;s VR experience with behavioral cues and advertisements (both subtle and integrated).<p>Think about the effort they go through in order to track all of your digital movements now, and how valuable that is to them, and then consider how much more fruitful their efforts would be if you literally wore a headset that allowed them to monitor and influence your every perception in real time.')
