For decades, consumers have bought TV, music, toothbrushes, video games, dog food, cars and Microsoft Office. What’s new is that they all have similar models – digitally-based, predominantly D2C subscriptions. This changes nothing about the individual value or baseline need for them.</i><p>This makes absolutely no sense to me. The point is that many of those were one-time purchases - or lasted long enough that they could be considered one-time purchases for practical purposes (yes, this includes software, no matter how much the business side of software developement hates to hear that).<p>One-time purchases compete with each other for the budget I have available for those purchases - which may include money I have saved, loaned or have momentarily available for other reasons. So you could say, they compete with each other for my <i>wealth</i>.<p>In contrast, I need to pay a subscription every month, so they compete with each other for a part of my monthly <i>income</i> - which in a typical middle class scenario is something I can allocate with far less flexibility than my savings.<p>&gt; <i>To this end, it’s important to highlight subscriptions are often a preferred buying path for consumers. Most would rather (or can only afford) $10 a month for a multi-year license to Microsoft Office for $300. Subscriptions also meaningfully reduce the cognitive burden of repeat decision making. No longer do you need to “track” your toothbrush for wear, risk “running out” of toilet paper and then be forced to overpay for a small-volume purchase, or need to scan and hoard coupons to ensure a great deal.</i><p>Yeah, I&#x27;ll just have the cognitive burden of keeping track of half a dozen different subscriptions. Thank you.')
