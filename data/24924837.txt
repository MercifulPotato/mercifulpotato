I didn’t think Google would stop their support for the system since it was a hardware product and  believed they were aiming for a HomeKit ecosystem. \nHindsight, I was very wrong and I am now extremely disappointed. There is an obvious amount of opportunity here but I guess with all the monopoly talk, this doesn’t fit their product value and growth strategy. \nYou can’t count on google for expensive consumer products that do not fit within their core search product or have some affiliation to keeping you retained to their core search product.')
