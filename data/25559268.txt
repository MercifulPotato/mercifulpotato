Imagine claiming &quot;skills can beat racism&quot; or &quot;skills can beat sexism&quot;. No, nothing beats discrimination, because it was never based on the existence or absence of skills. Rather, prejudiced people take one look at you, see your gray hair, and make assumptions about you, and you can&#x27;t beat your hair color any more than you can beat your skin color.<p>Well, you could try to dye your hair and get plastic surgery, but again that has nothing to do with skills.')
