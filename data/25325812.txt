There were big blockers for it being used this way then. I did some chatting with the docker team  and we did push things a little in that direction. But the vision was still about running in prod.<p>To their credit the docker folks I talked with did listen and respond and move the needle (obviously) on it being a local dev tool, so I cheer them for that.<p>I use it all the time in my windows box for dev. Tho I do try and keep my software able to run on any os.')
