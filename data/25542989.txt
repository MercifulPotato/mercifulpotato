A lot of energy is wasted when the hydrogen has to be compressed for transport, storage and in the car. That makes hydrogen less attractive than batteries, even if we solve the inefficiencies of the hydrogen production.<p>However, it would be great news for many other fields. One way to make hydrogen more storable is to produce methane. And of course use hydrogen directly for industrial applications, like steel production.')
