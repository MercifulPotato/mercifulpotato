This was not an exploratory &quot;try something new&quot; test. This was an integration test to verify that all the &quot;on paper&quot; work was correct. The whole point of SLS is that its use of technology with extensive &quot;flight heritage&quot; is supposed to avoid having to break new ground.<p>This is like discovering a major issue during the shakedown cruise of a new ship. It&#x27;s better to find the issue now, and that&#x27;s why they test, but the point of this test wasn&#x27;t to learn anything new, it was supposed to just prove that it works as expected.<p>SpaceX is generally very up front about tests that they think have a high likelihood of failure, and the tests that do fail tend to be doing genuinely &quot;new things&quot; (like belly-flopping a booster).<p>I&#x27;m not a SpaceX fanboy here (I think Elon in particular is pretty insufferable), but it&#x27;s not really to fair to compare SpaceX&#x27;s development testing failures with this integration test failure.')
