The streets are a shared publicly owned resource just as the Capitol is. People who could be identified acting lawlessly in either situation should be prosecuted to the full extent with an eye towards stopping lawless idiocy.<p>Just for clarity: People standing peacefully nearby whose worst law-break is a curfew violation? I don&#x27;t think they should face any consequences, which I realize makes the curfew on its own fairly toothless, but that&#x27;s already the case now. But when you pick up a rock or bottle and throw it at police, that&#x27;s AB-DW on police in my book. (Same thing with criminal trespass and malicious destruction of property for the events yesterday.)<p>Basically, if you&#x27;re acting like a lawless idiot, I don&#x27;t care what your shirt says or what sign you&#x27;re carrying while you do it.')
