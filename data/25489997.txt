I&#x27;ve gone through SOC2, and it&#x27;s not hard at all to achieve. SOC2 is basically just about (1) documenting controls and (2) following them. You have a lot of leeway with your auditor on what those controls entail (and remember, you choose and pay your auditor, so there&#x27;s also a huge conflict of interest here).<p>We did have to do a yearly security audit, but it&#x27;s foolish to think that will catch all issues, and it relies a lot on the company being helpful and open with their auditor. You also a lot of leeway in arguing down issue severity.<p>We got SOC2 certified because many companies require that their vendors have it, but I personally think it has little to no value, and I would not trust a company any more because they&#x27;ve gone through it.')
