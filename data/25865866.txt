That helps ensure the project is sustainable, gives back to the community the big service obviously benefits from, and is certainly a form of &quot;good karma&quot;.<p>I think a lot of people are upset due to the perceived violation of that social contract, though it obviously isn&#x27;t a legal issue and may not even be a moral one depending on where you draw the line. AWS has the appearance of benefitting enormously from many OSS projects but rarely funds contributions - funding that would be a rounding error to the AWS budget.<p>The ball is entirely in Amazon&#x27;s court. They&#x27;ve earned this reputation (fair or not). They can make the problem go away at any time if they want to spend a little money.')
