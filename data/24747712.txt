Peak energy demand occurs right around or after sundown. If we&#x27;re going to fulfill this demand with nuclear, then we could just run the nuclear plants all day long and build no solar or wind.<p>Solar and wind are a good complement to natural gas. We can dial back the gas when the intermittent sources of energy are producing. This both saves carbon and money, since fuel is a substantial portion of a gas plant&#x27;, operating cost.<p>By comparison, a nuclear plant costs just as much to run at maximum capacity all day long as it does at partial capacity. If you have enough nuclear plants to full peak demand, which coincides with the trough of renewables&#x27; generation, then just run the plants at full capacity all day and skip building renewables.')
