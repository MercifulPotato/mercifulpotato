You are correct that row-level partitioning is not supported in the OSS version of CRDB. However, it sounds like there&#x27;s a bit of confusion about where manual table partitioning is and is not needed. The primary use-case for row-level partitioning is to control the geographic location of various data in a multi-region cluster. Imagine a &quot;users&quot; table where EU users are stored on European servers and NA users are stored on North American servers.<p>If you are only looking to scale write throughput then manual partitioning is not be needed. This is because CRDB transparently performs range partitioning under-the-hood on all tables, so all tables scale in response to data size and load automatically.
