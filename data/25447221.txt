The new releases have a lot of refactoring and redesigns that would break things anyway. The old ways are considered deprecated and keeping them around forever complicates the code and has about the same cost as backporting things to an old version.<p>If it&#x27;s too much work for application developers, the can keep on an old version of the library or maintain a shim. (There are still a lot of GTK2 applications out there, although distros seem to be removing them because nobody is interested in maintaining a shim or backporting things)')
