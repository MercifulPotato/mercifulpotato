The whole thing is a mess and a pain to use (and I use it multiple times a week). Sure the documents often look good, but when they don&#x27;t or there is an error, fixing it just becomes a nightmare. I wish somebody would design a modern typesetting system that would accept say latex equations but without 50 years of cruft and levels of macroses upon macroses.')
