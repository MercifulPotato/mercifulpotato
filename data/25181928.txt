If you don&#x27;t block the wrong-thinkers major media outlets will write article after article about how you platform Nazis or whatever, even though there&#x27;s no Nazis in sight.  If you stand up to them they will go after the advertisers.  &quot;Why are you advertising on a site that platforms Nazis?&quot;  And there&#x27;s not really consequences.  When Youtube, Paypal, etc. ban these people there&#x27;s barely a blip in their business.')
