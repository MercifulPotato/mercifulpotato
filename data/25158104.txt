I am honestly curious to see some evidence.\nIn my opinion application bugs are usually in the flow itself and have nothing to do with wrong types. I work a lot with both plain and Typescript projects. I used to like Typescript. But not anymore. With typescript applications tend to become bigger and more complex. Most devs using it have never seen vanilla js and are more java minded that prototype minded.\nIDE code completion works better for typescript. For sure. But is that really essential? Sounds a bit like the typical Java developer who works with giant spring applications containing classes with hundreds of methods spread in many files in a 10 layer deep folder structure.')
