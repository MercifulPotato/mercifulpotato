Then I use that account to unlock articles&#x2F;donate to many different sites. Then, at the end of the month, paypal (or whatever the service is) makes 1 payment to all those sites, for all users combined.<p>That way, instead of me transferring 1 cent, twice, to New York Times, Paypal could do 1 large transfer of all contributions.')
