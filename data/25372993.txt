But considering Google had no way of collecting that and asking for it would have resulted in loss of other business (they&#x27;ll keep hosting there and keep paying them) and this isn&#x27;t like Google lost 72k or like 72k even matters to them so it&#x27;s just good PR, good business to get money on the backend and faster.<p>I have to wonder if even if they tried to get the money would they legally been able to fight it. From my experience with judges in Europe, they would have most likely looked at the budget being ignore and then upgrading someone from a free to a paid plan without consent and told Google it was their own fault and the services weren&#x27;t ordered or authorised.')
