Item(by='dustinmoris', descendants=None, kids=[24958293], score=None, time=1604222358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958170, text='&gt; I think there&#x27;s sufficient contra-examples in both hemispheres to suggest that the weather is not a major factor -- though it is politically expedient &amp; convenient to point at the weather to distract from mismanagement.<p>I&#x27;m not a politician, I&#x27;m not a nationalist, my birthplace is not the culture which I&#x27;ve been raised under, where my parents come from I&#x27;ve never lived and where I live now I have no ties whatsoever, so simply I don&#x27;t care about country politics and trying to suggest anything different is the real disservice.<p>It&#x27;s a fact that warm weather plays a huge role. In Europe we have seen a first relief during Spring and all countries have seen a huge dip in cases during their warmest summer months, completely irrespective of the countries individual measures. That&#x27;s just a hard fact that you can&#x27;t argue away in good conscience.<p>Furthermore, irrespective of how well countries have done, how many sacrifices people have done and what measures countries have taken (e.g. Germany vs. Sweden vs. UK vs. Czechia, etc.) all European countries see the same acceleration of cases. The only difference is the baseline where the spike starts, but the curve upwards is literally identical, so it further underlines that the weather has a bigger influence than any other measure except a full lockdown on the infection rate of coronavirus.')
