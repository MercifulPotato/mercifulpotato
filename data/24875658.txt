They project Trump&#x27;s odds of winning PA at 13%, so if he does win PA it&#x27;s likely he&#x27;s doing better than expected in other competitive races. The originally linked tool is just showing all the combinations of outcomes for these 12 competitive races.<p>Sure, Biden would win the election if Trump won PA and FL but then lost Ohio and Georgia.
