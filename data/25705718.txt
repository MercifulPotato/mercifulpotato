But many people do belive there was fraud. I think there were some very suspect things about the election. But I read Article II, and the 12th amendment. The congress is directed to count the Electoral votes submitted by the states. It&#x27;s basically ceremonial, <i>unless</i>  there is no majority in the Electoral vote. There is a process defined for that situation. There is not a word about challenging the votes as submitted. Mike Pence was absolutely right.<p>There may or may not have been fraud in any of the states. But once they certify their Electors, that&#x27;s it as far as I can see. I honestly don&#x27;t know if there is a remedy even for clear fraud if the state goes ahead and certifies the results. In theory a state doesn&#x27;t even need to hold a public vote. The legislature could just appoint the Electors. The founding fathers clearly wrote the constition to give the power of electing the president to the states. Allowing any level of the federal government to override that seems to be a conflict of interest.')
