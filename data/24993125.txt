Whether it is the counting machines, Scantron readers or electronic voting booths, we are already using software.<p>What more software could do though, is create more transparency. And I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but this may actually be one of those cases where blockchain could be useful.<p>It is absolutely absurd to me that we have thousands of non-experts deciding to keep or throw out ballots based on comparing a signature.<p>With a more electronic method, a citizen&#x27;s vote could be signed with a key generated from a few unique identifiers like social security number, numbers in your street address and maybe a credit card number. My vote could then be forever logged in the blockchain. This could create more transparency because everyone could see and count the votes.<p>After voting, you could also give every voter a &quot;receipt&quot; where they could go online and check in the public blockchain to confirm that their vote was counted successfully.<p>And I don&#x27;t think we would need any sort of shared and distributed blockchain. Just a public one that can be verified by 3rd parties.<p>AWS has a managed blockchain service that I&#x27;m sure would work fine.<p>So while it may not be a good idea to open the actual voting to the entire public internet, that doesn&#x27;t mean that sound math and technology couldn&#x27;t be used to make elections more transparent and thus, secure.')
