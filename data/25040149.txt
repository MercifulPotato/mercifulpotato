I got it originally for a backup as well as just to have an Android phone again.  It is now my daily driver. It&#x27;s enough phone for me even if it doesn&#x27;t have the iPhone&#x27;s blistering speeds.  I am pretty sure I won&#x27;t be spending much more than $350 on a phone going forward.  I just don&#x27;t need anything more.')
