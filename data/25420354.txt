When I&#x27;m using them for development, my Ryzen is absolutely wiping the floor with the Macbook, Android builds complete in a fraction of the time, and I barely ever have to wait for anything to complete. The story is much the same with almost any development tool or process I use.<p>Yet benchmarks like these show comparatively minor performance differences between the two. I just get the impression these benchmarks are being cherrypicked, or are &quot;nerfed&quot; in some way on multicore systems.')
