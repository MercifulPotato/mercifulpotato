Item(by='KineticLensman', descendants=None, kids=[25238598, 25238121], score=None, time=1606557321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235868, text='&quot;Live like youâ€™ll never die&quot; can be a reason to put things off because you&#x27;ll do them in the future. And then the world changes and possible paths are suddenly closed to you.<p>Anecdata: my father died relatively young in his 50s after a decade of ill health that had forced him to give up some of the things that he loved, like sailing. This made a very big impression on me (I was in my mid-20s), specifically that you only get one life and you must make the most of your health while you have it. I am now older than he was when he died and I don&#x27;t have a bucket list of things that I want to do in the future. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve already done those things, rather than postpone them until I retire. That said, I&#x27;m currently in the process of seeing if I can bootstrap a totally new career for myself, in the outdoor conservation space after decades in the office in the s&#x2F;w industry. I might not make it but at least I&#x27;ve tried.<p>YMMV.')
