The NZ dairy industry,  has from the very beginning had a strong co-op focus as well as being concentrated on exports, even as its beginnings in the nineteenth century.<p>Despite great pushes over the last forty years this remains in modern form to the present day and is seen by NZ farmers as an essential part of their success, as this has allowed them to pool resources and invest in the vertical integration (transport, factories, shipping) to compete overseas. \nA similar structure also exists in other countries (US with DFA milk, Denmark &amp; Sweden with Arla are also in the top ten global dairy companies)<p>Until the early 1980s, NZ also operated a very protectionist trade policy dependent on access to traditional markets which ultimately failed badly. This experience and the (painful) resulting changes is a major reason why NZ is  such a proponent of trade agreements and multilaterality more generally on the global stage.')
