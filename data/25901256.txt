Populism is LITERALLY Virtue Signaling. They&#x27;re the same thing. So if there&#x27;s two teams, one identify with a different word for the same thing, you might as well just call them team red and team blue instead.<p>The actual ideological battle is between those who believe that the world is complex and that learning about the world is really hard work, but can be done through iterated improvement (i.e. people who have an education, not just on paper, but who can actually reason and critically think about the things they learn) and those who start from the assumption that they basically got it all figured out (the anti-intelectualists). This starts as a simple difference in attitude, but with time one of these becomes smarter and more knowledgeable, whereas the other stagnates.')
