It&#x27;s easy to do, for Firefox for example, just right-click and save-as in the extensions site, then rename your extension to a .zip file and extract e.g:<p><pre><code>    addon.xpi --&gt; addon.zip\n</code></pre>\nThen manually sift through the code looking for obvious malicious intent (or not so obvious malicious intent if the author is doing obfuscation). Note: obfuscation is a red flag! A simple scan for `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>` &#x2F; &#x27;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>&#x27;  would usually yield interesting URLs where data is sent. I have actually spotted malicious addons in the wild this way and reported them to Mozilla. They were thankfully removed.<p>Note: Obfuscation is NOT the same as minification, and I don&#x27;t mean minification when using the word obfuscation!')
