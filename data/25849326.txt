Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611164363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25847862, text='It&#x27;s a word you might have heard a lot in the past four years.<p>&quot;Truffa&quot; is almost certainly the right translation, but &quot;grift&quot; has some specific connotations that I&#x27;m not quite sure I can pin down. In some usage it has a connotation of small-scale petty crime. Almost as if you&#x27;re working very hard to defraud somebody out of a relatively small sum of money -- perhaps by association with the word &quot;grind&quot;.<p>But when it comes to politics, it&#x27;s much larger scale, while retaining the seediness associated with the small-scale version. It&#x27;s not just simple bribery or large-scale fraud, but the constant day-to-day use of the office to siphon off money.<p>I may not really be characterizing it well. English is full of words with many synonyms, but each with a slightly specialized meaning that people feel but don&#x27;t really show up in dicitionaries. So I don&#x27;t really know if &quot;truffa&quot; captures all of the implications of &quot;grift&quot; or not. But in terms of understanding the article, it&#x27;s sufficient.')
