I am following hackernews for about 4 months and loved this community. Recently, I have encountered with a post that OP was creating a tiny project every two weeks. He influenced me with that idea and I thought giving a try would be good idea so I have built Loope which is my first tiny project.<p>Basically Loope is A Spotify Playlist Analyzer. It is fetching audio features from Spotify Api and shows features in a nice gui. I could have post this project in Github but because of Spotify credentials in the project, I didn&#x27;t. Also, because of deploying this on Heroku&#x27;s free dynamo, opening the website can take some time. Sorry about that.<p>Any feedback, feature request or criticism would be appreciated. Thank you.')
