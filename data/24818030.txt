Even when these wrongdoings were sometimes the result of my parents unkind actions. This was a dialogue with myself, a prayer I guess.<p>As a result I decided to tell my Mum I loved her. Let&#x27;s just say the didn&#x27;t go well. It was an important step for me however. I have my own wonderful family now and saying I love you doesn&#x27;t come easy but I do it.<p>I&#x27;m nearly 50 and time has taught me two things. People are generally self-focussed. Thankfully there are those who put others first. Luckily I married one. Secondly, parents often get it tough and then bring their brokenness with them into their own family. It doesn&#x27;t excuse them but understanding your parent&#x27;s journey can sometimes make you more aware of what they did do for you rather than what they didn&#x27;t do for you.')
