I chose a single example to illustrate my point, but that doesn&#x27;t mean a single example is all that exists.<p>Anyway, the cops aren&#x27;t using these armored vehicles to kill people, they primarily do that with guns.  It isn&#x27;t the use of these vehicles that concerns me, but rather the role these vehicles play in recruiting macho edgelords to be cops (the sort prone to shooting people with guns.)  To address this, I would like all their vehicles to be repainted, uniforms redesigned, etc.  Aesthetics matter, it influences the sort of person drawn to the job.  A police force with a particularly militarized aesthetic will attract men who want to LARP as occupying forces in Baghdad.')
