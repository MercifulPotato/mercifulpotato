The UAR did not have nuclear weapons and wasn&#x27;t developing them (despite Israel&#x27;s unsubstantiated claims to the contrary), nor did Israel need nuclear weapons to defend itself (Ben-Gurion admitted that in 1963 to JFK.)  And even if they weren&#x27;t capable of defending themselves with conventional arms, the JFK administration offered to ensure the protection of Israel in exchange for inspections of Dimona to stop Israel&#x27;s bomb program.  Israel turned this offer down, and refused inspections of Dimona.<p>Israel did not need an atomic bomb.  In developing nuclear weapons (in cooperation with the white supremacist state of South Africa, it should be noted) Israel ensured that other middle east countries would eventually seek them.  They deliberately threw water onto an oil fire.<p><i>&#x27;David Ben-Gurion:\nMessage to US President Kennedy Regarding UAR Threats&#x27;</i> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org&#x2F;ben-gurion-message-to-us-president-kennedy-regarding-uar-threats-april-1963-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org&#x2F;ben-gurion-message-to-u...</a>)<p>&gt; <i>2.
