In addition, that power is mostly going to be taken up by resolution and framerate increases, so less is left over for more complex visuals.<p>Besides, I suspect we&#x27;re well into the diminishing returns curve with respect to visuals. Graphics are now very lifelike and to take them from &quot;almost live action&quot; to &quot;indistinguishable from live action&quot; may take vastly more computational and artistic resources then we maybe getting for the next 5 console generations.')
