But over several versions of Ubuntu and qutebrowser, I’ve encountered too many problems; I think most are due to the qtwebengine and the fact that qutebrowser is made with Python.<p>The latter often leads to the familiar dependency hell when trying to install or upgrade the program.<p>I have frequent crashes, it’s slow at rendering pages, it uses more memory than (for example) chromium and seems to leak memory; any kind of CSS animation causes the CPU to have a major workout. After one upgrade most video stopped working.<p>I never cared about the ad blocker, as I use a hosts file for that. Why doesn’t everyone? It seems to be a better solution.')
