At the beginning I thought it&#x27;s tennis elbow, but then started having problems with my neck as well and getting dizzy (vertigo, headache and sometimes nausea) when lying down and getting up from the bed. I&#x27;ve noticed that that happens most when my head is on flat surface and even more when it reclines back (when a physiotherapist lowered my head below the flat surface of the bed I was ling on). Did anyone experience something like this or has any advice?<p>I did have an ultrasound and EMG (electromyography) done which did not show any problems in my elbow.<p>I do exercise for my neck now and hope that will help... I might add some exercises from the OP to my routine.<p>PS. Funnily my problems (at the beginning it was only elbow and fingers) started during lockdown, when I finally started doing yoga-type exercises and I felt like I&#x27;m getting better at it (I think it&#x27;s just coincidence, not causation though).')
