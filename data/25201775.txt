That isn&#x27;t healthy, but Apple doesn&#x27;t care.<p>I get that you like your Apple device, but this company is destroying our freedoms, making it harder to run a profitable business, and taking advantage of their market position and customer base.<p>There isn&#x27;t a lot of room for competition to grow. Their draconian behavior is staunchly anti-ownership. They have a ball and chain around our ankle.<p>If iPhone had 5-15% market share, you might have a point. But it doesn&#x27;t. We&#x27;re running out of freedoms and breathing room. The giants are taking everything away.<p>Stop worshiping a dumbass phone and the company &quot;protecting you&quot; by taking away everyone&#x27;s freedoms. It&#x27;s a stupid little computer - worth far less than our liberty to write code, distribute it, and reuse&#x2F;upgrade the things we own as we see fit.<p>Apple has the advantage in that their particular computer is wildly popular and widely used. All it takes is for the DOJ to come and tell them to lighten up - and that&#x27;s exactly what we need.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;236550&#x2F;percentage-of-us-population-that-own-a-iphone-smartphone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;236550&#x2F;percentage-of-us-...</a>')
