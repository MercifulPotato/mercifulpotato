Wish it weren&#x27;t in PHP. Not looking a gift horse in the mouth, nor looking to start yet another PHP-bashing thread, nor criticizing your use of whatever lang or fw suits your personal needs -- I get it, this was a personal project and I appreciate your sharing it. But I have a personal aversion to PHP and for that reason I won&#x27;t be adopting this for my own purposes. But if I ever build a similar system, I&#x27;m glad to have yours to reference for inspiration. Slainte!')
