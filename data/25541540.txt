That article directly links it to Yudkowsky, Scott Alexander, and Less Wrong as a whole (with sufficient citations), as they were hugely formative in creating the pseudo-rationalism inherent in that movement.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140108010125&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jim.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;dark-enlightenment-and-the-endarkenment.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140108010125&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jim.c...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neoreactionary_movement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neoreactionary_movement</a>')
