The culture is very much geared towards buying a house, alone or with a spouse.\nIt&#x27;s also a small country where people don&#x27;t move alot, which might mean that they don&#x27;t value flexibility as much as larger countries where moving is generally over larger distances.<p>Also, the banks offer very good rates for these types of loans if you have a stable job and prospect.<p>Renting for very long periods seem like a waste for many people here.')
