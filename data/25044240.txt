The same is true for most of the airplanes, ships and robots.<p>So from a western perspective all those weapons are only useful in an offensive war against a weak opponent (no atomic bombs).<p>In this context it also makes sense to have less but better trained soldiers. Reducing casualties reduces bad press. You don&#x27;t need millions of soldiers to bomb away Irak anyway.<p>If you assume that military leaders have basic logic reasoning (i think they are smart actually), you see that self defense is not the primary goal for western countries (except Switzerland).')
