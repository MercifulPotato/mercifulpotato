But, I do think it could be a lot better. For example, today while writing a paper, I ran into a compilation issue that gave me the following error message:<p><pre><code>  ! Undefined control sequence.\n  &lt;write&gt; ...\\protect \\numberline {\\plist@algorithm\n                      1}{\\ignorespaces $\\protect...\n  l.350 \\end{theorem}\n</code></pre>\nNone of these commands (except \\end{theorem}) were in my paper, they were all in an included package. I later found out the issue was nowhere near line 350 or inside of the theorem environment. There just doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good way to debug LaTeX errors. The best method I found was to use some sort of binary search, removing parts of the document to see if the error persists â€” which is ridiculously time consuming.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;309010&#x2F;teach-me-to-debug" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;309010&#x2F;teach-me-to-d...</a>')
