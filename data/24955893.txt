We’re talking about roundabouts as an alternative to 4 way stop signs.<p>In a small residential roundabout there is a single lane going in a circle. Either you can safely enter the lane, or you can not. The roundabout serialises the traffic flow so that a driver entering the roundabout need only deal with the next vehicle in the lane. You don’t have to worry about the (potentially unsignalled) intent of any other drivers, make eye contact with them, time their arrival, etc.<p>To be honest though, I think you know all of this, and you’re simply engaging with me in bad faith.')
