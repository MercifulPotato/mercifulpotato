The editor says fairly gently that there are concerns with poorly-supported claims and omitting key information -- such as the media reporting on corruption claims and the fact that media outlets have not been given access to the supposed hard drive of emails. This results in a meandering and potentially misleading article that leads readers to conclusions it does not actually support.<p>They suggest a way to focus it more on core points which are well-substantiated and get a solid article out of it.  They&#x27;re not censoring his political views, if anything they&#x27;re encouraging him to express them in an article indicting liberal media for going soft on Biden.  They&#x27;re trying to get a shorter, more tightly-focused article for publication.  Which is to say, a more solid article.<p>That sounds like an editor doing their job -- editing is supposed to be the art of removing words, after all!<p>Greenwald sends first a polite reply, then a much less polite one that jumps to this vitriolic claim:<p>&gt; I want to note clearly, because I think it&#x27;s so important for obvious reasons, that this is the first time in fifteen years of my writing about politics that I&#x27;ve been censored -- i.e., told by others that I can&#x27;t publish what I believe or think<p>Followed by insinuations that they&#x27;re suppressing the story due to their political biases. It sounds like Greenwald can&#x27;t accept that there may be legitimate explanations for why the content isn&#x27;t focused or solid enough.<p>That&#x27;s downright nasty and unprofessional.')
