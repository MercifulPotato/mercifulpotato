Said that shoes were a modern creation and that our feet weren&#x27;t designed to need them.<p>It was an unmitigated disaster.  So I went to a different podiatrist.  She said &quot;let me guess, you went to Dr. So-and-so?&quot; and I replied yes, she said &quot;Yeah, I don&#x27;t agree with him.  Shoes are modern, but so are floors.&quot;<p>My feet are much happier now.  Properly designed insoles make pretty much any shoe comfortable for me (notably, the insoles aren&#x27;t really padded, they&#x27;re pretty hard).  Walking around on hardwood floors barefoot makes my feet hurt.')
