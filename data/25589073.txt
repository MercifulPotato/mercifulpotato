It smells like sewage.<p>A - I want you just to taste this then.<p>There can be a few responses B can make.  B can<p>1. Throw the drink in A’s (type)face.<p>2. Pour the drink on the ground and walk away.<p>3. Put a lid on the drink, say you will drink it later, and walk away.  Either trash it, have a lab or yourself test it, or just bring it to a police station, explaining the event, delivering the evidence and walk away.<p>4. Pretend to take a sip, say it’s not for you, thank A and walk away.<p>5. Actually take a sip, having weighed the possible consequences rationally and deciding to take a flyer.<p>6. Drink the whole glass.<p>B’s response probably depends upon their worldview and past life experiences.  Every option will have their advocates.  Even six...where do you think many drug addicts come from?<p>The first three are probably people who have had food poisoning before. Three and four are people-pleasers.  Five is an experimenter at heart, and six is a risk-taker&#x2F;thrill-seeker.  Number one is most probably from the greater NYC area.<p>I’ve seen people with information poisoning.  You are some pixels on a screen.  Have a nice day.<p>[This is all based upon a guess of what the whole opinion piece is, which is behind a paywall and doesn’t seem worth the bother to find a source to read.  So this may be just ranting at a bunny seen in a cloud.  Still relevant for other situations.]')
