Often the groups are closed, you have to join to see what&#x27;s inside. Closed groups are not indexed by google, so everything that&#x27;s written disappears in the Facebook silo.<p>With web forums everything is indexed and you can find the relevant info even if it&#x27;s written ten years ago, and you can see it without having to join first.<p>There&#x27;s lots of useful info written on the web and a lot of this info is hidden behind social network walled gardens.')
