As someone who is Catholic, this looks to me sort of like an attempt at a group confession, but at least in the Catholic tradition we perform examinations of conscience [1] and go to confession [2] and we are told to come to terms with what <i>we actually did wrong.</i> You don&#x27;t get away with some vague acknowledgement of being a sinner. As the Catechism says, &quot;Through such an admission [a person] looks squarely at the sins he [or she] is guilty of, [and] takes responsibility for them.&quot;<p>Whether one agrees with Catholics on any number of things (and many reasonable people do not), there is a certain logic to the idea that before you can be better, you have to actually say what&#x27;s wrong. Forcing a group of people to self label as racist in the way described above is unmoored from reality: even if one had done things that were racist in the past, there is no looking squarely at one&#x27;s short comings, and there is no taking responsibility for anything. And for someone who hadn&#x27;t done anything racist, or for someone who claims to have never done anything racist, it&#x27;s just a show, and things won&#x27;t actually get better in a meaningful way.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usccb.org&#x2F;prayer-and-worship&#x2F;sacraments-and-sacramentals&#x2F;penance&#x2F;examinations-of-conscience" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usccb.org&#x2F;prayer-and-worship&#x2F;sacraments-and-sacr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vatican.va&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ccc_css&#x2F;archive&#x2F;catechism&#x2F;p2s2c2a4.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vatican.va&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ccc_css&#x2F;archive&#x2F;catechism&#x2F;p2s...</a>')
