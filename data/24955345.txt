The realization that chaotic systems are ubiquitous, and that many physical phenomena (motion of the planets, how chemical interactions work at the electron level etc) can&#x27;t be modeled analytically (so far as we know) was a big upset to mathematics and science, and still isn&#x27;t addressed well in school curriculum.<p>To expand on your main point: A loose, but appropriate analogy is that FP appeals to programmers in the way analytic solutions appeal to mathematicians and scientists: Neat, ideal, beautiful... but a poor fit for many practical problems.')
