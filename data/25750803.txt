Item(by='vlovich123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610474930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735751, text='Nowhere did Linus say that AVX512 being a power sink is an unavoidable consequence and should be dropped for that reason. He just said &quot;AVX512 sucks right now - they should spend their resources elsewhere because the ROI isn&#x27;t there&quot;. When he made that statement he was factually correct - Intel had spent a lot of resources bringing AVX512 to market, the first version is shit (making correct selection of turning on AVX512 support tricky), &amp; they had to spend even more correcting it.<p>If you had said 10 years ago &quot;ARM sucks because it&#x27;s in order&quot; you wouldn&#x27;t be factually wrong on that front in that in-order sucks for performance, but you would be factually wrong because the first iPhone was already partially out-of-order and 10 years ago you&#x27;d be looking at the iPhone 4 which was a Cortex-A8 superscalar design. Also in-order is fantastic for battery - that&#x27;s why M4 &amp; below are still in-order. Note that me saying this doesn&#x27;t imply that will remain the case for all time, which is how you seem to be interpreting statements like that which would be an extremely poor interpretation on the part of the reader.')
