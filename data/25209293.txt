Luck begins to play a much more important role, as it&#x27;s no longer enough to perform well. You must perform well and have nothing go wrong.<p>When margins become this thin, contingency plans become unfavored wastes of resources. After recovering from a setback you&#x27;re unlikely to win, and when second place doesn&#x27;t pay the bills, it&#x27;s better to conserve resources so you &quot;Fail Fast&quot;.<p>Second place shouldn&#x27;t mean death.<p>Social safety nets seem to be a possible solution to this competition dilemma. I believe we should strive to help everyone in our society build the lower levels of their Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy on a solid foundation.<p>I believe that a Universal Basic Income could be a major component in a strategy to accomplish this goal.')
