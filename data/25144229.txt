Unfortunately a lot of people interpreted it as a class on &quot;how to be persuasive&quot; (as a writer) rather than &quot;how to avoid being persuaded by propagandists&quot; (as a reader).<p>We were taught common logical fallacies, and then tested on how well we could spot instances of them in a news article. But I remember also being asked to write persuasive essays, without being taught how to reason in a way that avoided those fallacies.')
