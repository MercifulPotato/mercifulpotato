Observing can sometimes be a bit dull and as you&#x27;re getting night shifted it&#x27;s hard to do anything productive while you&#x27;re waiting for the exposures to finish.  So you&#x27;re looking for ways to pass the time.<p>Anyway, somehow my two friends started looking at color blindness tests.  One of them had grown up in Latin America and hadn&#x27;t seen a color blindness test before, so the other was explaining how there&#x27;s a number in the center that you can&#x27;t see if you&#x27;re color blind.  And he said... &quot;what number?&quot;  That was how he learned at age 26 that he was color blind.')
