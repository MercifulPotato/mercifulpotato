It would suck if the stock went to $1,000 and the buyer of my call option exercised at that point. That would be a loss of $68,000.<p>On the other hand, if I am right that this is about the peak, then I get $20,000.<p>I could either close my position, or I could potentially buy the same call option strike with a shorter expiration for cheaper... Most likely the run up on GME will be over by then. If not, I could just buy another call option with a further strike on top of it.<p>Perhaps my strategy should be selling call options dated for 79 days from now with a strike of 320 for $190... Then buy call options for when I think this thing will end... Say 9 days out with the same strike for $152. If things go crazy high, then I can use my buy call option to cover the sell call option. If it doesn&#x27;t, then my profit is $192-152 = $40.<p>My theory is the stock has run insanely high, and even Elon Musk has made comments that are priced in. At this point, WSB users may have all their money they want in this play invested... Who else comes in to sustain the current price or drive it higher? What if GME execs decide to sell some shares to raise funds? Or if the SEC asks them to to stop the short squeeze? The stock almost reached the WSB pie in the sky goal of $1000... How many people are going to make sure they aren&#x27;t the last fool in the stock holding the bag?<p>But if I am really wrong, and the stock went to $5000 on a short squeeze, that would hurt. $5000-320= 4,680 x 100= $468,000.<p>I probably should buy a shorter run buy side call option to cover my risk. $20,000 with high probability outcome vs $468,000 with a low probability outcome...<p>Who exactly sells call options anyways? Someone has to be selling these naked in order to provide the volume that is out there, right? Probably people doing it behind an LLC shield so they can&#x27;t take unlimited losses and will leave their broker (&quot;too big to fail&quot;) holding the bag?')
