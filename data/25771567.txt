And tests are not a replacement for compilation and type-safety.<p>Like I said, you&#x27;re either using an existing ORM or just writing your own everytime, and the one you write probably won&#x27;t be very good as seen by the numerous security and performance bugs that are constantly found. Also abstractions are useful. All of software development is built with abstractions and they don&#x27;t suddenly become useless when it comes to databases.<p>I also don&#x27;t see what this has to do with API clients or build steps, but there are good and bad examples of those too.')
