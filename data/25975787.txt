Beef politics is new and a recent BJP&#x2F;Modi&#x2F;Adityanath invention.<p>It is the same tactics the British used to divide the country, and simply used as a tool to target Muslims.<p>The fact is that Hindus eat beef and there is no religious proscription against it, that is the whole point of &quot;Hinduism being a way of life&quot;.<p>Secondly - old cows are not a resource, and farmers do not care about them. You cannot support their population without making cows useless to farmers. So cows get slaughtered.<p>The efforts made to politicize this has lead to herds of cows destroying farmers and farm land. Now that the attention of the population is away from cows, I bet farmers and politicians are busy shipping cows to be butchered once again.<p>Its pretty amazing that no one wonders who is selling these cows to be killed, it only becomes an issue when muslims eat meat.')
