Then they complain about the stupid people and policies that get voted in.<p>I might be okay with “every informed person should vote”. But that “informed” part can be heavily politically interpreted.<p>People have largely missed the fact that politics used to be the domain of informed groups fighting for power blocs. Now it’s been “decentralized” and radicalized on Twitter and Reddit and made into glorified reality Tv entertainment by the mass media (who are clearly serving a market with high demand who treat politics like sports teams).<p>I’d rather have way less people voting and it go back to being mostly boring educated people topic than it’s below common denominator mess it is today.<p>But I’m unabashedly elitist and understand that there are plenty of well funded groups who want dumb malleable voters and as many as possible.')
