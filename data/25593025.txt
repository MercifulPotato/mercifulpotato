If you have gatekeepers you incentivize corruption. If you have tests you incentivize cheating. There&#x27;s just too many knobs and dials (programs).<p>Something like UBI is much simpler and therefor has far fewer attack vectors. The only test is to verify citizenship. A process to handle claims of non-receipt would be easy if a cheque can be expired and a new one sent.<p>Who cares if wealthy citizens also get a pittance (to them)? It&#x27;s more fair that they do anyway! Expire the cheques after like a year, so people can simply opt out by not cashing them before they expire.')
