The keyboard shortcuts (Alt-A or holding-space-to-unmute) only work when Zoom is in focus<p>I have 2 monitors, and drag the zoom controls to the non-presenting screen<p>Getting a headset with a physical mic is probably your best bet<p>Side note: noise-cancelling headphones are way more useful than you&#x27;d think. I delayed for 5 months before buying them, and regret every minute I didn&#x27;t do it earlier. Doesn&#x27;t help with the mic, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much extraneous household noises contributed to my malaise.')
