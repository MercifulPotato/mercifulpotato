Thus, an ISP offering both wifi routers has a [1 - (10% x 10%)] = 99% chance of eventual success*<p>&gt; <i>Rule #2 (&quot;a AND b&quot;, failure compounds and success drops): if you’re running two wifi routers at once (say, a primary router and an extender), and both of them work “correctly” for about 90% of the time each day, the chance that your network has no problems all day is 81%.</i><p>&gt; <i>My claim is that the &quot;choose between two internets [IPv4, IPv6]&quot; problem is the same as the &quot;choose between two flakey wifi routers on the same SSID&quot; problem (Rule #2). We should not be surprised that the combined system is less reliable.</i><p>&gt; <i>The World in Which IPv6 was a Good Design: mobile IP. That is, the ability for your connections to keep going even if you hop between IP addresses. If you had IP mobility, then you could migrate connections between your two internets in real time, based on live quality feedback. You could send the same packets over both links and see which ones work better. If you picked one link and it suddenly stopped, you could retransmit packets on the other link and pick up where you left off. Your precise heuristic wouldn’t even matter that much, as long as it tries both ways eventually.</i><p>&gt; <i>If you had IP mobility, then you could convert the “a AND b” scenario (failure compounds) into the “a OR b” scenario (success compounds).</i>')
