Keep in mind that I started reading this with an open mind, so might help for you to also &#x27;step back&#x27; and try to view it from more neutral eyes; if you want to call me a &#x27;left wing nut&#x27; after this, no problem for me...<p>You have some good points about how Twitter limits the API, and screws with your timeline and settings. I fully agree with those points. However, you seem to focus a lot on the &#x27;bot&#x27; aspect of it. This made me suspicious as to why you would; we know a lot of disinformation campaigns use bots, so it can be a natural conclusion that some have grievances against Twitter for limiting what bots can do...<p>You also mention S.230:\n<i>&quot;How they expect to retain 47 USC ยง230 (CDA) protections with this behavior&quot;</i><p>To me, that sounds like it&#x27;s a reference to the EARN-IT Act, which is about the right&#x27;s perceived censorship against them, and wanting to &quot;punish&quot; the likes of Twitter that &quot;do that&quot;. Again, sounded suspicious to me.<p>Finally (after which I stopped reading), your example of &quot;search censorship&quot; on Twitter is about some QANON slogan (or something like that, I&#x27;m glad so say I don&#x27;t want to know enough about them) - to me, that sounded even more of a grievance by someone on the right. As you stated earlier in the blog post, <i>&quot;their site, their rules&quot;</i>; I don&#x27;t see it as a question of censorship - does prohibiting someone to yell &#x27;FIRE!&#x27; in a crowded room constitute censorship, or preventing harm? I see it as preventing harm, by limiting the reach of something harmful (Just like France and other countries prohibit the display of Nazi symbols&#x2F;paraphernalia).<p>Again, that&#x27;s where I stopped; I don&#x27;t write this to put you down, just that the way you say it doesn&#x27;t validate your arguments in my eyes.')
