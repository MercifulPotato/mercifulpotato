Item(by='mojomark', descendants=None, kids=[25860952], score=None, time=1611243507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858606, text='&gt; i wonder how much money gets wasted on these failed explorations&#x2F;projects.<p>Failure is not a waste of money if lessons are learned. The value is in the lesson. As anyone whosed developed a reinforcement learning application knows, there is a balance between EXPLORATION and EXPLOITATION. If you don&#x27;t explore, your performance will never improve. This is true even if 99% of the explored states are failures.<p>I suppose if one doesn&#x27;t want to invest in exploration, one could always join an Amish township. They are very content and apparently happy with their perpetually static state of technological development - and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that until someone with a missile comes in to take over your land amd all you have to fend them off with is a hay fork.')
