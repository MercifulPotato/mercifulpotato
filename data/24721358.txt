Item(by='Communitivity', descendants=None, kids=[24722254], score=None, time=1602177365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720133, text='There&#x27;s another corridor that might make sense as their first one DC&lt;-&gt;WV&lt;-&gt;NC Research Triangle. At 4h by car, with a marketed Hyperloop speed (emphasis on marketed) of 670mph, you could theoretically cut the time to 30m. Meaning you could live in WV and commit to Durham,NC.  WV is also somewhat equidistant to Pittsburgh,PA and Philadelphia,PA as well.<p>If you managed to create a commuting hub that allowed 30 minute (plus time to hub, etc.) commutes to Pittsburgh, Durham, DC, and Philadelphia you would have a major hub with a great deal of value, akin to Chicago in the height of the railway days. That&#x27;s a pretty big if though, and would take a lot of work, money, and politics.<p>If they did it though they could expand the hub:<p>* Add a station in Richmond, and a line to VA Beach \n* Expand north with a line from Philadelphia to NYC\n* Once you are in NYC, expand north line a line to boston\n* Finally, expand sound to Atlanta and then to Orlando.<p>Lot of ifs in there, and not sure I would be on it happening, but if it did the benefits would likely be amazing in terms of less pollution from cars, less unemployment since your pool of workplaces is much higher, potentially less shipping costs,etc.  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;d love to see.')
