However, the means to<p>&gt; do so is undocumented, changes from CPU to CPU, and the raw data is<p>&gt; not calibrated. Calibration information is available, but again not<p>&gt; documented. This results in less than perfect user experience, up to<p>&gt; concerns that loading the driver might possibly damage the hardware<p>&gt; (by reporting out-of range voltages). Effectively support for<p>&gt; reporting voltages and current is not maintainable.  Drop it.<p>I&#x27;ve been running mostly on the power saving CPU scheduler because on any others, k10temp reports that my CPU idles around 1.44V - Nice to know that it was (probably) just a display bug.')
