The light from the windows looks like someone put studio lights outside each one, rather than the sun and sky. Given that Mitsuba supports spectral rendering, an empirical spectral sky&#x2F;sun model would improve the quality of the lighting by several orders of magnitude, and assuming such model is present in Mitsuba would be an easy change.<p>Secondly the glossy surfaces lack surface details and natural variation, they are unnaturally even and lacking imperfections.<p>There are other things as well but those are the main ones to fix IMHO. Fixing the lighting should be simple as mentioned, but adding the surface detail can be quite time consuming.<p>In this case the image is meant as an illustration, so the simplifications made are quite acceptable.')
