Item(by='a1369209993', descendants=None, kids=[25757096], score=None, time=1610497057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25755854, text='&gt; It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to believe Randall Munroe supports [something that he calls &quot;free speech&quot;] and at the same time believes someone spewing hateful vitriol can be kicked out of whatever private venue by the owners&#x2F;administrators of said venue. In order for you to believe this, you simply must accept that Randall is using a different, possibly more legalistic [definition] of &quot;free speech&quot; than you.<p>Sure, and it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to believe someone supports, say, not destroying [something that they call &quot;forests&quot;] and at the same time believes rainforests can be cut down to make more room for farmland. In order for you to believe this, you simply must accept that they are using a definition of &quot;forests&quot; that does not include rainforests.<p>Nonetheless, that person is against not destroying forests-the-actual-thing, regardless of what definition they use for &quot;forests&quot;-the-english-word.<p>&gt; The whole &quot;this is because Randall Munroe is a leftie and, like all lefties, is against free speech&quot; only serves to turn the debate into an absurd flamewar. Anyone going for this &quot;like all lefties&quot; is not interested in honest debate at all.<p>Who are you responding to? Because if I had said something like that, it would have been &quot;Randall Munroe is either a leftie or a rightie and, like all lefties and righties, is against free speech&quot;.')
