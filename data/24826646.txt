A condensing dryer (used to hang washed \nclothes on a line and have to take them down again when dry)<p>2. An extra car, old station-wagon with trailer hook + trailer. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s old and crappy so I don&#x27;t care when it&#x27;s getting dirty, scratched or dented, it will be decommissioned when it breaks down (used to borrow car every time we needed to transport something larger than fit in the small main car, or when we had to use trailer.)<p>3. A toaster (used to toast my bread in the oven which is both slow and energy efficient)<p>4. An electric kettle (used to boil water in a pot when we lived a place where gas was practically free)<p>5. A standalone freezer (used to have only a small one builtin to the fridge, with room for maybe 5 frozen pizzas)<p>6. Good powered studio monitors along with a XLR usb dac, I use them for general-purpose listening, love them. (Used to use headphones)<p>7. Coffee maker (used to either boil water and do slow pour-over or use instant which is expensive and not as yummy as an espresso)<p>9. USB Switch, for switching between the computers under my table, along with a monitor with multiple inputs, (used to switch cables around)<p>10. The long IKEA USB-C charging cables + 3 outlet chargers. (used to move smaller chargers+cables around the house, now there&#x27;s charging spots in bedroom and in the livingroom, and the cables are long enough that we can sit comfortably and use our phones while charging).')
