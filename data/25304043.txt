The only thing I can fault it on is the screen, the brightness is a bit anemic and there is some bleed. However, the performance is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using it for image processing, and the 8C16T gets through my problems at the same speed as my desktop Ryzen 2700X. Similarly the onboard GPU is sufficient for playing Witcher 3, at just a slightly lower performance than my RX580.<p>It has 2 legacy USB-A ports, MicroSD, HDMI and a USB-C-3.2 which I&#x27;ve used to run a 4K screen at 60Hz.<p>Price was <i></i>very<i></i> reasonable. I&#x27;m happy, this has stepped up my laptop CPU performance by a factor of 4, the GPU can now do all the stuff I want from a laptop, and it&#x27;s compact and has good standby life.')
