You did it once,<p>Look, I know the comments section of hackernews is not going to contain a long, nuanced conversation about what did and did not work, and I probably overstated it &quot;working&quot;, but let&#x27;s be clear; the lockdown in Victoria absolutely brought the outbreak under control, from over 500 per day to now nearly zero.

It sucks. Lockdowns aren&#x27;t binary, and I hope I didn&#x27;t represent them as so. Unfortunately they are only effective to the extent that they don&#x27;t let infections slip through the cracks. To be effective, the actual numbers need to be low enough, and kept low enough, that contact tracing and quarantining work, so that the economy can function at all. That ship has sailed for America. It is sad.<p>Victoria is an example of what happens when the thing gets out and starts spreading. Here in the ACT where I am, and the seat of government is, things are in much better shape, with only a few hundred cases overall through the pandemic, and a handful of deaths. A phased reopening has meant life here has gone back to nearer to normal, and even mask wearing isn&#x27;t required. Canberra has been very lucky and I can actually live my life like the virus doesn&#x27;t exist, because right now, right here, it pretty much doesn&#x27;t. But I can&#x27;t stay here forever, I&#x27;ll be out in the wild with the rest of ya soon enough. Thanks for letting the virus run rampant over my homeland. Cheers!')
