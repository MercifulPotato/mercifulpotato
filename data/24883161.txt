It seems to me that they could have gone with a more Kafka-esque (hah! always wanted an excuse to write that) approach where the write limit is only relative to the message group&#x2F;ordering id, i.e. a partition.<p>The thing Kafka doesn&#x27;t handle so well is increasing the number of partitions dynamically, so in some sense this is just a different name for the abstraction - you could still create N topics upfront and it would be similar to Kafka. But then why have the message group id in the first place if not to allow the topic to scale beyond what a single node can handle?')
