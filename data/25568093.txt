I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all played those sandbox physics games where a few values were tweaked just to far in one direction. Sometimes that can be really fun! I&#x27;d e interested to know if these more advanced tools take that into account, or will there be frequent cases of needing to roll your own physics engine?<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of an example, but I believe I remember reading about a game that purposefully used a slightly lighter gravity for some models to help the player feel more powerful (?) than other characters. I wish I could remember, but the idea is the same. Physics that are dynamic could be a fun&#x2F;useful gameplay mechanic and I hope we don&#x27;t see those types of games go away because everyone decides it&#x27;s too complicated&#x2F;not worth it to use a different physics algorithm than the one shipped in some console SDK.')
