Item(by='spiffytech', descendants=None, kids=[24815647], score=None, time=1602991969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24815217, text='I suppose I&#x27;m not speaking clearly here. Generally yes, my tasks come from a combination of my team pushing priorities up from below (ideas for improvements, paying down tech debt) and the business pushing requirements down from above (strategic&#x2F;financial objectives, promises to customers). Prioritization and assignment is usually a group discussion with everyone relevant.<p>The fact that priorities and schedules are decided with input and consensus from lots of people who aren&#x27;t me is the crux of my point. The article is about personal task management. It, like any number of similar articles I&#x27;ve read, offers a system that presumes I can pick and choose what I work on today based on metrics of my own choosing, instead of being bound by a decision made with other people. The article expects I&#x27;m in an environment where nobody cares if I push tasks back 2, 3, 4+ days for reasons that have nothing to do with the project or team or business, but because of arbitrary restrictions on when I allow myself to do certain things. Unless I can make a business case that &quot;theme days&quot; or similar systems benefit the business, the business just sees needless, disruptive delays it didn&#x27;t authorize.')
