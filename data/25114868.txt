We don&#x27;t want to paint our picture of the situation using only extremes. How about we include the &quot;average&quot; anecdata too?<p>The reason for those anecdotes is to counter the false narrative that young people are basically invulnerable to Covid, and should therefore live like it doesn&#x27;t exist.  That false narrative has been quite prevalent, even here, as an oblique way of arguing against public health measures.<p>There&#x27;s no actual prevalent narrative that no one escapes Covid unscathed that needs to be countered.')
