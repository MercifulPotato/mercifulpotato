I dont understand why you think I was trying to play Dark Souls.<p>2.) I am not talking about some game being &quot;not for me&quot;. I am about gaming community hostility toward people &quot;like me&quot; and towards games made for &quot;people like me&quot;.<p>That hostility manifest when we start to talk about what we want in games in general, what we want games to be like. Or when we hit the wall in game that pretends to be for general public, but halfway cease to be.
