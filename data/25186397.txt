FB got under fire for throttling traffic to &quot;left wing&quot; sites (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;21520634&#x2F;facebook-reportedly-choked-traffic-mother-jones-zuckerberg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;17&#x2F;21520634&#x2F;facebook-report...</a>), YouTube under <i>multiple</i> fires for stuff like Peppa Pig scare videos or for actively feeding users conspiracy propaganda, Reddit has many, <i>many</i> accusations of censorship regarding Uyghurs (since the Tencent ownership stake)...<p>tl;dr: social media platforms have intentions on their own and are not shy of using them.')
