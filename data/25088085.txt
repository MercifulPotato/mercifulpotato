After some experimentation in creative mode, I found the difference level that corresponds to the need to enable another reactor. Then I set up the inserters to each plant to only take in new fuel cells when the steam draw exceeds the relevant threshold.<p>This does have some waste in that it doesn&#x27;t count for hysteresis, and it doesn&#x27;t try to prevent the reactors from filling up, but at the level of megabase I had, that level of waste wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.')
