Citadel does not have the same relationship with these other brokerages.  So, to say Robinhood made their decision based on a conflict of interest doesn&#x27;t hold water.<p>- Just because Citadel accounts for $xx million of Robinhood revenue, doesn&#x27;t mean Robinhood stands to lose $xx million if they piss off Citadel.  There are plenty of other market makers willing to fulfill Robinhood&#x27;s orders.  Presumably these other market makers would pay slightly less than Citadel, but Robinhood would only stand to lose some small percentage of $xx million.<p>Putting yourself in Robinhood&#x27;s shoes, it makes little financial sense to comply with Citadel&#x27;s demands even if Citadel attempted to coerce them into implementing these trade restrictions.')
