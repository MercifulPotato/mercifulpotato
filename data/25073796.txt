Versus the golden years of single-income households, we:<p>1. Go out to eat and for entertainment MUCH, MUCH more often.\n2. Take more frequent, more distant, and much more lavish vacations.\n3. Live in homes that are approximately 40% larger.\n4. Purchase many more electronics and other semi-durable consumer goods.\n5. Purchase much more clothing.\n6. Drive more, and newer vehicles.\n7. Eat many more calories (obesity necessitates higher health care costs)<p>For most people in the US: if you downsized your home, traveled on a modest vacation once every two years, limited eating out to special occasions only, wore the same set of clothing for years on end, owned a single, used but dependable car for the entire household, watched two movies per year, etc, you&#x27;d probably be able to run a single-income household in 2020.')
