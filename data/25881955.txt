Sometimes when I&#x27;m working I need to chat open so I can get urgent requests and feedback.  In that case it&#x27;s really, <i>really</i> annoying for someone to pop something completely different into my feed and just baldly ask the question.  It&#x27;s a form of nerd-sniping[0], showing no consideration for my work mode.<p>Better to pop in something like this:<p>&gt; <i>I have a question, should take you X (second|minutes), ping me when you&#x27;re free</i><p>If I&#x27;m busy I can ignore it, if I have an expected time of availability I can send that back, and if I&#x27;m free now I can send back a &quot;Go!&quot;<p>I strive to get into flow, but sometimes the overall context is such that people should be able to break that with urgent questions.  Popping non-urgent questions into my time-line breaks flow and is a destroyer of productivity<p>So &quot;it depends&quot; - having blanket rules such as proposed in the post can be counter-productive.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;356&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;356&#x2F;</a><p><i>Edit: I get that not everyone will agree with me, but it&#x27;s so,</i> so <i>annoying to construct what I hope is a clear, reasoned response, just to get a downvote.  And no, this isn&#x27;t a complaint about getting the downvote, I&#x27;ve learned to expect downvotes when I express a contrary view, even one as mild as this.  No, this is an expression of disappointment that someone just won&#x27;t engage in the discussion.  Very disappointing ... usually HN is better than that.</i>')
