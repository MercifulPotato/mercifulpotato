There&#x27;s evidence this didn&#x27;t work.<p>I think the idea here is the same - if the big platforms ban certain types of egregious and harmful misinformation (that gets recommended to people susceptible to conspiracies) - these companies are hoping less people overall will watch this content, and probably more importantly, if anything bad comes of this, they won&#x27;t have their brands tarnished because of it.<p>Will it work? Who knows. They&#x27;re companies. Why can&#x27;t they do what they please as long as it&#x27;s within the law? Does the law require YouTube to keep up all content? YouTube has a Terms of Service and has censored lots of content for a long time. Why is there such a big distinction between beheadings, child porn, anti-vax, hate speech, and election misinformation? These companies already have a history of censoring &quot;political&quot; content for foreign countries.<p>What is new here?')
