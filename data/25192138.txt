When connecting to a remote machine, the sequence of events goes something like this:<p>1. enter ip, click &quot;connect&quot;<p>2. login prompt shows up<p>3. enter username&#x2F;password, click &quot;ok&quot;<p>4. self signed certificate warning shows up, asks me to accept&#x2F;reject the certificate<p>5. after accepting the certificate, the connection succeeds and I can see the other machine.<p>This sequence of events makes me think that the password authentication step isn&#x27;t done over TLS at all, or is done over TLS but is vulnerable to MITM attacks. Can you confirm&#x2F;deny whether this is accurate?')
