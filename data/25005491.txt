Item(by='Dagger2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604644606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001678, text='&gt; Twenty years of poor adoption world-wide demonstrates its lack of easy integration. I don&#x27;t need to argue this, you just did.<p>This isn&#x27;t down to the design of v6 though, it&#x27;s down to two things: the design of v4, and human laziness.<p>v4 isn&#x27;t forwards compatible with a larger address space, so there&#x27;s no way to magically integrate a larger address space with existing v4 nodes. All of the possible ways to make cross-compatibility easier are already available in v6. Updating the internet&#x27;s L3 protocol is simply a hard problem with no real shortcuts.<p>As for human laziness: v6 deployment didn&#x27;t really start until 2013. Deployment was at 1% in 2013, and is at 30-35% today. People put it off until after the RIRs started running out of addresses to allocate, even at the cost of paying extra money to keep v4 working. This isn&#x27;t a technology problem, it&#x27;s a human problem.<p>&gt; even for something as simple as setting up a gaming server with a few friends.<p>This isn&#x27;t even possible in v4 for a lot of people today, due to v4 exhaustion. It&#x27;s going to become less and less possible over time, as v4 exhaustion gets ever more acute. Even if we took at face value your claims that v6 is unintuitive (which I would disagree with), surely it&#x27;s better to be able to set a gaming server up with v6 than to not be able to do it at all?')
