I’m <i>fine</i> with zero-price but I would also do okay with something-price, because I managed to live just fine before all of these “you are the product” (as technologists constantly gloat) services.  What would happen if we reached something-price?  I think, in my case, I would just stop using a lot of the services, because (1) I won’t have the budget to pay for for all of them as subscription services, and (2) see the aforementioned point about living just fine without them before.<p>Because here’s the rub: it’s not like people are <i>addicted</i> or <i>have to have</i> these services—it’s more like they are addicted or have to be a part of the network effect of these services.  (<i>Oh I don’t know about that guy, Tony, he ain’t got a FB profile...</i>)  And once these services become something-price they just won’t be viable any more, because they are not really essential and paying for 8+ services (or whatever?) is not feasible.<p>But realistically services like FB are just stuck with their current business model; they will not pivot to something else because they know they would be screwed.  But they, of course, twist that into some kind of consumer+small business sympathy spiel.')
