If Rust wants to get a share of the pie when it comes to data engineering, then it needs to have at least a killer app with an ecosystem around it. We can talk all day and all night for why some languages are more successful than others but it seems like ecosystems are giving them a boost. Hopefully, Rust will be the language for microVMs and kernel-level modules. I was strictly referring to people that think Rust would displace Java as idealists.')
