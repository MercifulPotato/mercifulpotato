But it would be nice to be able let me replicate all the deployment&#x2F;development setup aspects in a style that doesn&#x27;t have an impedance mismatch with existing projects (especially monorepos!). It&#x27;s fine if it occasionally breaks, it&#x27;s unsupported, without warranty, I&#x27;m on my own, etc. Just let this be an option for people with Opinions on deployment&#x2F;build systems, but no such Opinions on Haskell software engineering.')
