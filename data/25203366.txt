In my experience (when having to supply said bars) is that they serve primarily to tell the hapless user that things are still happening.   In other words, the actual number is not important...what is important is real feedback that things are still happening and it&#x27;s worth waiting. Or things are b0rked and you should start over.  I don&#x27;t care about a real time or % progress bar...just something that honestly (to OP&#x27;s point) lets me know that things aren&#x27;t screwed.<p>Edit: typos')
