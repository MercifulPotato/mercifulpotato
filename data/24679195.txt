If the majority did that, society would collapse.<p>People still need to eat and live their lives.  They&#x27;ll have more revenue for doing that if they don&#x27;t automatically have to give half of it to government.<p>Taxing spending removes a repressive socio-economic influence on people among different classes of economic status.<p>Poor people stay poor because that way they don&#x27;t have to give away half their income.
