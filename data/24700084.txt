If you can&#x27;t track conversions, it also means you can&#x27;t run advertising campaigns effectively because so much of advertising relies on conversion tracking to know whether ad spend is having an ROI or just burning money.<p>Then again, perhaps the target users of a privacy friendly analytics solution aren&#x27;t in the same category of people who are running paid ad campaigns on Adwords, etc.')
