I think saying it&#x27;s all to sell licenses is a disingenious, lots of longstanding Java pain points get addressed by Kotlin in a really nice way. It has a really strong webdev ecosys building up, and comes with a rather interesting feature set as language itself. I&#x27;d say its good &quot;typed Ruby&quot; (OO at the core, FP where it makes sense, very expressive, dont type too much).<p>Scala&#x27;s issues on the other hand stem, I think, from it being multi-paradigm. Where Kotlin is OO-core with FP where it makes sense, Scala is both OO and FP at the same time which makes it messy.<p>Frege explored being full FP on the JVM, but looking at the repo[0] it did not get much traction.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Frege&#x2F;frege" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Frege&#x2F;frege</a>')
