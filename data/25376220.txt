To take a break from my usual work, more backendy-businessy, but without taking a break from my computer (a mistake) I&#x27;ve decided to work a bit on Generative Computer Art and I wanted to share one particular experiment that - I think - has enough quality to share with you guys.<p>I&#x27;m definitely taking my first steps in this particular dev area but I imagine &quot;Perlin Noise&quot; and &quot;Flow Field&quot; are like the &quot;Build a Blog in 5 minutes&quot; entry level things everyone does for GenArt so I don&#x27;t expect to be particularly original, but I hope to have packaged this with enough bells and whistles to warrant some interest.<p>You can play around with certain variables that influence the image generation and you can download snapshots along the way, if you do hit something that you find appealing be sure to share with me, I would love to see it :)<p>Thank you all\nDavid')
