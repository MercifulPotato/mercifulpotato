I <i>like</i> the idea of JD very much - and I&#x27;ve been meaning to reorganize my notes by it, but can&#x27;t ever get started on it - so there&#x27;s very little of value I can add to conversation beyond an upvote.<p>On GP&#x27;s:<p>&gt; <i>My guess is the cynics are the ones who usually comment while people who are more positive will probably be more likely to just upvote?</i><p>It irks me to see this comment pattern regularly being called out as &quot;HN specific&quot;, because it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s universal in on-line discussions - particularly those on platforms with upvote&#x2F;reaction buttons. There is nothing interesting in &quot;I like it&quot; comments, so you always get disproportionately more of critical comments (&quot;I don&#x27;t like it because&quot;, &quot;I had a problem with it&quot;), tangents, and low-quality humor. HN is perhaps different than most places in its strong dislike of low-effort jokes - which leaves us with just criticism and tangents. My point thus is: it&#x27;s not HN, it&#x27;s the Internet. It&#x27;s not a mutual admiration society like you get when you go out with friends for a beer. I would think people would&#x27;ve gotten used to it in 2020.')
