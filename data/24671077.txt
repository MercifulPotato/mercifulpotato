Item(by='ketzu', descendants=None, kids=[24671498], score=None, time=1601721589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670700, text='&gt; Open source is different<p>I believe the attributes given to open source here are wrong.<p>There is a ton of open source code that is crap where not even the author had any interest in making it actually good (the same is true for writing). There is code that is the result of what&#x27;s alluded to be &quot;copywriting work&quot; that&#x27;s open source.<p>For me, this reads like a strawman, or maybe super idealised version, of open source is like compared to a vague strawman of what working in a company is like. It feels like this is neither true nor are those the only options out there.<p>&gt; So if a user of your software is addressing you because some part of your code sucks, and is willing to work with you to do something about it, and is very demanding, donâ€™t think they are abusing you because they are not paying you.<p>I don&#x27;t feel the users that are called &quot;abusive&quot; to maintainers and contributers are the ones because some of your code sucks and they want to make it better.<p>It&#x27;s the ones that want you to pander to their use-case. That have unreasonable demands. But even the ones with bug reports and telling you your code sucks in some way, should have some basic civility while communicating. No power of refusing pull requests shields you from insults and the mental burden of being harassed because you refuse pull requests (or close an issue someone opened).<p>I personally expect other people to value my time, not necessarily in money though. This is a general rule of life, not a matter of open source.')
