The name &quot;Game UI datase&quot; suggests a bit more than mere tags.<p>For the interested, the UI solution I was referring to is how the functions of the buttons on the right side of a common joypad are communicated to the player. When one of the buttons is pressed, a short description of all their functions will appear in the top right, layed out in the exact position they have on the actual joypad. Press a modifier key that changes the functionalities of these buttons and their descriptions will change while the modifier key is pressed.<p>This ensures that you will never forget what all the buttons do, which is a common problem for me as I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to play and can sometimes leave a game for months before picking it up again.<p>The website only shows the &quot;empty&#x2F;unpressed&quot; state of this element of the HUD, skipping one of of it&#x27;s most innovative features.')
