We’re a team of 3 (currently expanding) and started the prototype back in April to keep in touch and to really feel like you’re together during these covid times. As everyone might have experienced the past year, normal hangouts &#x2F; meets &#x2F; zooms are simply too awkward and soulless to use informally above 4-5 people.<p>It feels surprisingly real, it’s a combination of video chat and walking around in 3D. Your webcam is your head, and people sound louder the closer they are to you.<p>It&#x27;s gotten quite popular by now. A lot of companies use it for office drinks and social gatherings, and we&#x27;re seeing that from there they start using it for more work-ish things as well as team checkins or standups.<p>We’re using Jitsi as our video conferencing infra running on google cloud. Coupled with a Unity WebGL client on the frontend side of things, hosted on Firebase with photon used underneath for our networking layer.<p>To make it extra easy here’s a link to an island for you HN folks to discuss (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmibo.com&#x2F;join&#x2F;8PHX-4JYX-FEQ2-5ECT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmibo.com&#x2F;join&#x2F;8PHX-4JYX-FEQ2-5ECT</a>) — we’ll keep it up for a day or so to prevent it from devolving into a Chatroulette. Or you can of course sign up for your own (free!) account.<p>Curious to hear any feedback and happy to answer any questions!')
