I do not believe I misrepresented what you <i>wrote</i>, though I may have misrepresented what you <i>meant</i>.<p>But then I read the rest of your comment and I feel comfortable that I didn&#x27;t misread anything at all. In fact you make that clear at the end:<p>&gt; And in the meantime people in Poland live everyday lives, not caring about all that stuff.<p>I know Polish people that do not think like you. I don&#x27;t take them to represent the entirety of your country, nor do I take your word either. I&#x27;m not really going to debate the topics, nor do I care to defend myself against the imagined caricature you&#x27;ve conjured of me. I just think your claims to represent the reality in Poland do not square with the reality I know others live or behavior that is plainly evident from your major political party in power. Of course that party doesn&#x27;t represent everyone anymore than Trump represents most Americans, but it evidences something real and tangible.')
