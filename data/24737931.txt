HAPS by Synoosys for example has a bunch of huge Xilinx FPGAs in there. I&#x27;ve never used one, but apparently it takes care of splitting the huge ASIC design over the array of FPGAs so it looks like a single chip, and can run at 100s of MHz, so way better than simulation that could be a few kHz at best')
