It was what made my interest in systems engineering soar. Unfortunately your characterization of it falls quite short.<p>Here&#x27;s the mailing list email that inspired the bug:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marc.info&#x2F;?l=openssl-dev&amp;m=114651085826293&amp;w=2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marc.info&#x2F;?l=openssl-dev&amp;m=114651085826293&amp;w=2</a><p>I kind of doubt that some guy that thinks he &quot;knows better than the OpenSSL developers&quot; is saying things like this on <i>their</i> mailing list:<p>&gt; What I currently see as best option is to actually comment out\nthose 2 lines of code.  But I have no idea what effect this\nreally has on the RNG.  The only effect I see is that the pool\nmight receive less entropy.  But on the other hand, I&#x27;m not even\nsure how much entropy some unitialised data has.<p>The result was something like 32k sources of entropy which is not enough.<p>Here&#x27;s the bug Kurt was trying to fix: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.debian.org&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;bugreport.cgi?bug=363516" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.debian.org&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;bugreport.cgi?bug=363516</a>')
