They all have varying degrees of recirculation vs bringing in outside air. If you are running heavy ac or heavy heating, it costs more to bring in outside air. So there may be seasonal variations in recirculation settings even within the same sealed environment. I’m less confident on this point though as I don’t know hvac’s very well and they are supposed to filter viruses.')
