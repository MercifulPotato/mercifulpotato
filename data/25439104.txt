I&#x27;m sorry, but you are objectively wrong on so many levels it&#x27;s hard to know where to start. But I guess I&#x27;ll try nevertheless :)<p>- Sharpen&#x2F;noise reduction: If you want to avoid over-denoising and over-sharpening you need RAW, there&#x27;s no way around it. I find Apple&#x27;s rendering (and most other phone makers) distasteful. Anything above ISO 800 is just trash on JPG but pretty good on RAW. It&#x27;s\x1f the reason I left my Canon G10 and later S100 on the drawer years ago when the iPhone started shooting RAW.<p>- Dynamic range (latitude, for old folks like me). If you want detail on the sky and on the shadow under the rock on a sunny day, you need RAW. Also, no other way around it.\nMagic-AI-Smart-Auto-HDR+ can sometimes help but it&#x27;s comical at most others.\nDistributing the tones is part of the creative process.<p>&gt;Camera gear and RAW are just tools and will not make your pictures better<p>Oh yes, they will. That <i>camera doesn&#x27;t matter</i> motto never dies, it seems. Tools are extremely important. They don&#x27;t work on their own, of course, but are definitively part of the equation.<p>Since we&#x27;re on HN, a good analogy would be that because all computers are Turing Complete, they are all equivalent and you shouldn&#x27;t worry with specs, OS, languages, editors, compilers, etc.<p>While one can make an interesting sports event shot with a pin-hole you can&#x27;t use it to freeze someone in mid-air, etc, etc. I think you get the point :)')
