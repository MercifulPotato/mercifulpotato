But on the other hand, there is a noticeable increase in web shops in the EU which, for example, do not require any account creation at all - put something into the shopping cart, go to check-out, enter your address, enter your SEPA direct debit number, done. It is much faster and serves me as a customer better.<p>And no GDPR consent form needed, as all the processing is only for what is needed to do the payment and the delivery.')
