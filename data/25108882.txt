Item(by='bonzini', descendants=None, kids=[25109353], score=None, time=1605509518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105006, text='&gt; People will charge when electricity is cheapest<p>So if it&#x27;s cheapest from 6 PM to 6 AM they will start charging (absent any control from the utility) at 6 PM approximately.<p>I am interested (genuinely :-)) in standards for grid to appliance communication and on which countries have those discounted rates. Would I lose the discount if my commute is longer (so I need a continuous supply throughout most of the night)? Are they tied to specific wires coming in the building?<p>Also did anybody run the numbers on the power that would be needed by a supercharger network comparable to current highway gas stations?')
