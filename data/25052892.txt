Notice the extremely large amount of cache – this was one of the surprises reveals of the event as the A14 still only features 8MB of L2 cache.<p>&quot;this was one of the surprises reveals&quot; not sure what they were going for, probably just remove &quot;reveals&quot; and it works?<p>Also they talk about the A14 in the title but then barely touch on it at all. It&#x27;s like 3 sentences about it then a recap of Apple&#x27;s last transition.<p>EDIT: I now see that there are multiple pages. I really don&#x27;t like it when webpages do this and I like it even less when it&#x27;s not clear at all that there are multiple pages. The title for the next &quot;section&quot; is 20px tall and not clear that it&#x27;s a link to go to the next section (No &quot;Next&quot;, arrow, etc) and the dropdown for switching between pages (this has got to be the worst way to do pagination IMHO) is 16px tall...')
