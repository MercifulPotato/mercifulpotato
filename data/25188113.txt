It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;coal is anti-social! don&#x27;t you care about the environment!&quot;, but it&#x27;s just as anti-social to just shut down an industry and say &quot;best of luck, I heard you can move to California and build websites in JavaScript&quot;. Often times there just aren&#x27;t easy answers.<p>I also want to push back on &quot;everything commercially successful is run by tyrants&quot; kind of narrative. I get the frustration, but these blanket, ideological statements do not help anyone, anywhere. Do you make money? I guess you&#x27;re a tyrant!<p>Let&#x27;s not forget, the countries that we put up on a pedestal as the shining examples of how a country should be run (Norway or whatever) are very much capitalistic countries with free markets, IPOs, and commercial companies. I hardly see businesses there characterized as tyrannical.<p>I do really get the frustration, but it needs to be directed at the failures of our elected representatives. Not, commercial entities.')
