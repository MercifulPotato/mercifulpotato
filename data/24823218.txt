I&#x27;ve given up on trying. people just have to search &quot;garys autoclicker&quot; if they want to find it now, or have it bookmarked. &quot;autoclicker&quot; is pushed all the way back to page 4 for my site now. on bing I am page 2 behind basically autoclicker dot org and every other variation of the TLD')
