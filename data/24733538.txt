I would honestly accept that with no question.<p>In a work environment, I would expect the person I&#x27;m talking to to be presentable, ie their avatar would be presentable, so no goofy backgrounds or annoying accessories.<p>But the key for me is, I&#x27;d actually have something to see. So often in my work in in meetings and three people have cameras on and the rest don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t really care what they look like, I care if they&#x27;re engaged, nodding their heads, their facial reactions.<p>I don&#x27;t always have my video on either, I don&#x27;t have great upload speeds so I usually appear as a big blob anyway. I&#x27;d happily have whatever representation of me be in my place if it meant people could see my reactions')
