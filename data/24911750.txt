It seems to me like the universe would get on exactly the same without internal representation. By &quot;internal representation&quot; I mean a universe without &quot;embodiment&quot; -- no experience of being me or being you, no feelings felt, no colors seen, no sounds heard, etc.. And yet those experiences &quot;exist&quot; in some sense. Call them illusions or whatever, but I am and you are. So the problem is, if we can imagine the universe getting on exactly the same without those experiences, why is it such that I am and you are. That seems to be the puzzling question to me -- that nothing has to be experienced, and yet things are being experienced.')
