I never thought of it myself so I must be content with reverse search and grepping through bash history.<p>One suggestion would be to make it a homebrew recipe for macOS and the Linux version. It would then see a lot more adoption (even if the alias has to be set manually which is fine as it&#x27;s personal). I&#x27;d install it instantly (and probably forget about it for a month).')
