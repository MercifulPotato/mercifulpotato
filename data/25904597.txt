What if it&#x27;s an open problem. What if It&#x27;s a wrong question, based on poor representation of the problem?<p>I&#x27;m actually making tool for this exact same thing and the issue is most noticeable in kialo (which I argue is the same thing, with more mature UI). If you made all the research, conversations and planning to know, that answering this &#x27;A or B&#x27; problem solves it, then Kialo (or that app) are perfectly fine tools. But most of the time people don&#x27;t.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loomio.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loomio.org</a> is another attempt at solving the same problem. It does provide some improvements, but also fails in interesting ways (mostly, I think, through not considering temporality very seriously).')
