Personally I think a 3W LED is better than a 5W, but I know most people disagree.)<p>Our main bathroom light draws, I&#x27;d guess, 0.1W. It shows up as 0.0 with a kill-a-watt so I don&#x27;t really know. And it&#x27;s only used for about half an hour a day at most.<p>&gt; a super-committed, hour-every-day stationary-bike-using person<p>60W * 1 * 30 = 1800Wh per month<p>So no, forgetting to turn a light bulb off for an entire night, twice a month, does not waste more electricity than that gained by a cyclist who is capturing their electricity.<p>I think it&#x27;s a great hack to turn this machine into an electrical generator.')
