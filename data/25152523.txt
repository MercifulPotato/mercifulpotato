Consider:<p><pre><code>  const fn foo(x: &amp;mut i32) {\n      *x += 1;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nwould you consider this function pure? I don&#x27;t think many would. Also, it may be pure given Rust&#x27;s semantics, but it kinda goes against the intuitive, usual way people talk about purity, so that makes it hard.<p>(This is not yet stable in Rust, but will be.)')
