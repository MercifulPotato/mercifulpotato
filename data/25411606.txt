It honestly worries me to no end that people keep cashing out in USDT, because it is non-auditted, no proof of sufficient backing or collateralisation.<p>The last audit Tether had was in 2018 I believe, and then it was found they are only 70% backed by equivalent fiat [1]. God knows how much unbacked USDT they printed in between then and now. Other stablecoins are much safer: USDC is more than 100% backed by fiat USD [2] and is audited by several firms at set intervals. DAI v2.0 (MCD) is also over collateralized by a large margin. I personally prefer DAI for my stablecoin needs.<p>Tether has also been rife with scandal [3]. I hate to see so many DeFi projects relying on USDT. People need to start to exclude Tether because they resist transparency and accountability, completely antithetical to the cryptocurrency ethos.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-04-30&#x2F;tether-says-stablecoin-is-only-backed-74-by-cash-securities" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019-04-30&#x2F;tether-sa...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;tethers-stablecoin-dominance-drops-below-80-as-audit-controversy-lingers-on-on&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;tethers-stablecoin-dominance-drops-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopotato.com&#x2F;the-downfall-of-a-stablecoin-tethers-long-history-of-scandals&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopotato.com&#x2F;the-downfall-of-a-stablecoin-tether...</a>')
