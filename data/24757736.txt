Consider this hypothetical system:<p>1. Data is collected<p>2. Dynamics are modeled (population health, hospital capacity, economic output, etc.)<p>3. Problem constraints are well posed<p>4. Computational resources are allocated to solve for the constraints<p>In my mind, this would be the rational approach to solving this problem. Steps 1, 2, and 4 should be apolitical. Only step 3 is political since many people would disagree on what should be optimized. Step 3 is what people should debate. Steps 1, 2, 4 should be transparently managed by public+private working groups of experts.<p>Instead, the public and political discourse around lockdown and data collection are proxies for an informal debate around whether population health or economy is more important, which is not a well-posed problem, nor is it an effective way to engineer a solution.')
