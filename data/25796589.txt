There is, indeed, a lot of wisdom there. I did most of my recreational x86 assembler coding in 1993-95. I got the book when it came out (an unwieldy tome in paper form) and poured over it but, sadly, I never really did much x86 assembler after that.<p>There&#x27;s a lot in the book that&#x27;s dated, being very VGA-specific, or specific to the x86 CPUs of that day. Even so, there are lots of ideas in the book that transcend that. His advice about optimization, and about how to approach problems, is timeless.')
