Like, we&#x27;re just going to scratch a whole bunch of words from the dictionary because someone somewhere is offended? The other day, people at my workplace were saying that expressions like &quot;blind spot&quot; and &quot;falling on deaf ears&quot; needed to be purged. AFAIK, &quot;blind spot&quot; is not actually about blind people, it&#x27;s a term related to driving and the angles seeing people can&#x27;t see in without looking.')
