Real evidence, not just allegations.<p>The only unequivocal &quot;evidence&quot; I have seen has been eyewitness statements, but those eyewitnesses have repeatedly refused to testify under oath. That makes their allegations useless to the legal system.<p>The way that some people continue to make those allegations in spite of being unable to produce any evidence makes me suspect they are not interested in legal avenues, but rather in drumming up civil unrest and distrust in the foundations of the United States. That suspicion might be reason for YouTube&#x27;s actions.')
