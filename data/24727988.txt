Political means pertaining to the distribution of power and resources in a society. But what kind of power&#x2F;resources, which society and what form of distribution vary greatly. That many things have a colour doesn&#x27;t mean the concept of colour is meaningless, nor that it draws its meaning from things that don&#x27;t have a colour, because colour is an aspect with many hues. In short, &quot;everything is political&quot; means learning to look at the political aspects of things. The goal is not to distinguish between the political and apolitical, but between the many different shades of the political.')
