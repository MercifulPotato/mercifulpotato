Item(by='bonestamp2', descendants=None, kids=[25595689, 25595991], score=None, time=1609438113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594502, text='There are a number of reasons why they might not be able to change suppliers sooner:<p>1. The contract. I assume new contracts have an escape clause if underage workers are discovered, but maybe that contract didn&#x27;t.<p>2. A reliable alternative. I worked in procurement for one of the major automakers and it&#x27;s not always easy to find another supplier who can meet your requirements for lead times, capacity, quality and whatever other terms are in the contract.<p>3. Risk. Every supplier makes mistakes, so it&#x27;s reasonable to give them the benefit of the doubt that the problem was an honest mistake and that it may take some time to address issues. It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s risky to move production to a new supplier. In this case it&#x27;s also risky not to, for fear of consumer backlash, so they have to balance those risks.<p>4. Resistance. It&#x27;s a lot of work to move to or onboard a new supplier with a new part. Even for basic plastic and metal autoparts, it can take 6-12 months. For very specialty items such as electronics and chemicals, it can take even longer. It&#x27;s generally less time consuming and less disruptive to work with suppliers to solve problems, especially if the current supplier is delivering on spec, price, and timing.<p>5. Patents. If they&#x27;re using a part that is patented by the supplier, it may take a full design cycle to reengineer the product to use a completely different part that allows them to replace the original part. With Apple&#x27;s thin designs, it wouldn&#x27;t be out of question that they were using ports that were designed to be especially thin on the backend or attached to the PCB in an unusual way.')
