Open-source-as-a-<i>funding</i>-model was surely a thing, but turning open source into a source of consistent and growing free cash flow has been much more rare.<p>At my last start-up the first things to go out the window when we wanted to stop burning money were the commercial Aerospike and Nginx licenses.
