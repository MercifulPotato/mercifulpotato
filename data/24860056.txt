Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=[24860203, 24860491, 24860092], score=None, time=1603385182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858750, text='&gt; And an anonymous tip-off enabled BBC News to follow the ransom negotiations in a live chat on the dark web.<p>So, that &quot;anonymous tip-off&quot; was obviously from the hackers, right? I guess the other option is a &quot;whistleblower&quot; at UCSF (would anyone else know about it?), but the hackers have a lot to benefit from everyone knowing about it, so next victim thinks &quot;Gee, respected institutions like UCSF are willing to pay the ransom and didn&#x27;t have the capability to recover otherwise, we should probably just pay the ransom too&quot;.')
