I think that is the norm, and that&#x27;s the problem of debt. When financial people use debt, that debt comes with structure and consequence: it might be monthly payments or it might be due sometime in the future. Offer such people a &quot;debt&quot; that has nobody enforcing it, nobody quantifying it and of course it wont be paid back.<p>Agile engineers making scary &quot;booga booga&quot; noises about &quot;we need to refactor&quot; just don&#x27;t carry the same weight as not being able to make payroll because your note is due. And yet that seems surprising to engineers.')
