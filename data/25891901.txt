Item(by='helen___keller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611495373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890302, text='&gt; I expect this is how most of HN&#x27;s crowd grew up, too.<p>To be fair this is evidence of bias, not evidence of superiority<p>&gt;  With more people and shops etc in your neighborhood comes noise and chaos.<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily true. Not all urban spaces are built like manhattan. If you live on main street next to the shops, sure, but a very easy and pleasant urban form is one with a main street with shops and quiet side streets with apartments and houses. For example, a lot of the neighborhoods in Brookline, MA[0]. The bigger issue is that because there&#x27;s so few neighborhoods built like this, the few that exist are <i>incredibly expensive and desirable</i>, atleast in greater Boston.<p>[0] consider the map view here. Residential, tree filled streets all close to a shop-lined (and rail-lined) main street <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@42.3396099,-71.1361021,426m&#x2F;data=!3m1!1e3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@42.3396099,-71.1361021,426m&#x2F;dat...</a> . I lived 1 building away from the main street (just across from the school) and the only &quot;urban noise&quot; was the school. It was a peaceful and an amazing neighborhood. I would have moved there permanently if it wasn&#x27;t like 700k for a 2 bedroom in an old building (or $3MM for a brand new 4 bedroom townhouse).')
