It&#x27;s too bad nodes became associated with niche hobbies or interests.<p>E.g. a fraternity&#x2F;sorority that hosts a node would make perfect sense for a local timeline. I guess the only issue is that these organizations aren&#x27;t permanent. So people would have to migrate, which isn&#x27;t a thing for twitter or facebook. I know mastodon has a feature for this specifically but I think people would still find it too confusing if people&#x27;s handles kept on changing.')
