The seal - which is being forced outwards by rotation - will fall in to the hole slightly and then wear against the edges of the hole as it rotates past. This gradually increases blow-by and reduces efficiency until it no longer seals at all.<p>This design has a smooth surface against the seals at all times, and they can be lubricated directly.')
