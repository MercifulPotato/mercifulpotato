So he wouldn’t write the Shire as a 1 to 1 allegory about the industrialization of the english countryside, but he would write on general themes like nature vs industry and good vs evil. What he mostly didn’t like was the idea of writing something to have a specific intended interpretation as opposed to readers having more flexibility in how they experienced a work of writing.')
