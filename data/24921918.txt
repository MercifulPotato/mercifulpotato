We have both unpaid FMLA and unpaid time off.  The difference is that with FMLA the company still subsidizes health insurance to some degree.  If you are in the US, your company has the FMLA option.<p>One of my coworkers (a very senior manager) is in Germany and has a serious family issue.  He has been working part time for a while at a reduced salary.<p>How many years do you have in career? 10 years or more?  If you take 6 months off, will that matter in the long run?  Won&#x27;t it be better if you don&#x27;t have work stress on top of everything else?<p>&gt;If I could get a job where I&#x27;m basically assigned tasks to code things to spec, done, next, that&#x27;d be perfect.<p>There&#x27;s no guarantee that a job that starts like that will stay like that.
