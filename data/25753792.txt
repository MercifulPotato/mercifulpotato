(For copyright, there&#x27;s the DMCA takedown process, which is more generous because people don&#x27;t tend to get killed as a forseeable consequence of civil copyright violations.)<p>Of course, if you are a second level host and don&#x27;t have item-by-item control (such as AWS for a site hosted there by another firm), the only efficient way to acheived that may be to drop the entire account.')
