Well, likewise: you risk putting someone else in the hospital by catching the flu. Has it stopped you from living before?<p>And of course, there is a matter of degree: getting a seasonal shot is one thing; demanding that people <i>avoid seeing their families</i> is entirely another.<p>Finally, consider that every young, healthy person who gets this virus is afterward immune, and contributes to overall population immunity. Therefore, getting the virus and recovering from it is a <i>positive outcome</i> for society. This is offset by some small risk of transmission, of course, but that&#x27;s a manageable risk. After all, masks and social distancing <i>work</i>, right?')
