That would be foolish. Different developmental stages require different strategies. As China&#x27;s economy matures, the strategy is increasingly changing to that of opening up.<p>The move to open up their markets, and to allow majority-foreign ownership, began way before the trade war. It was already ongoing in 2014: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business-25647808" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business-25647808</a><p>China signed a major investment deal with the EU last month. China made major concessions. Unlike Trump, who with his &quot;tough on China&quot; tactics only managed to antagonize China and didn&#x27;t get a proper trade deal, the EU got the sort of concessions that Trump was after, by being properly diplomatic.<p>This is the problem with the US attitude of treating China as an enemy. I also have no idea where all the &quot;engaging with China is a failed strategy&quot; and crowd comes from: the EU literally showed you that engagement works better than antagonization and coercion! Facts literally show you that China was already opening up before Trump!')
