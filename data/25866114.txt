I don’t doubt we are seeing less great software being shared in the open because of it. If we want more useful software shared as open source we should fix this. The Amazon problem doesn’t help. I’m with Elastic.<p>Simply put, this is a naive and entitled attitude. And here&#x27;s my proof of that: Elastic is a success story. They gave away software for free and turned it into a $15B business. And yet there&#x27;s still people like you being apologists for their outright lies and intentionally misleading statements. I find it so incredibly absurd.<p>Elastic is tricking you into thinking that they are not an absurdly successful business. That&#x27;s not true.<p>Oh, and one last time: This license change doesn&#x27;t even protect their business, so it&#x27;s totally pointless. It&#x27;s just a business blunder. The SSPL will not make a difference to Amazon because they&#x27;re not going to use the SSPL version of the code. It&#x27;s so simple.')
