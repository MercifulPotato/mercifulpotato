Everyone wants attention, attention is money and power. Attention is the value system on the internet.<p>So of course they don&#x27;t want to share it, not even with the user. But we want to have a say about content evaluation as well, we have our own values.<p>Perhaps the best way to neuter Google, FB and Twitter is to spin out the ranking&#x2F;filtering&#x2F;presentation part and make many of them. I don&#x27;t care about the indexer too much, it can stay in one piece. But for ranking and filtering I&#x27;d like to select other settings than they allow. Maybe settings proposed by EFF or other NGO&#x27;s I trust more than a for profit company.<p>It used to be that we only had the option of a few channels to watch and newspapers to read. You could switch but they would be very restrictive in the choice of content. Internet gave us freedom and a high variety of options, but now ranking and filtering take them back. They want to take choice from us and impose theirs.')
