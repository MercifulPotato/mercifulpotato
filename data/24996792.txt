Item(by='Doxin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604568454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24985752, text='They do, but those are mostly intended in case <i>somehow</i> all the lift cables snap&#x2F;detach&#x2F;disappear. In that case the elevator would drop, the brakes would engage and slow the elevator down to a stop. In the story told you can easily imagine the elevator dropping and getting caught by the cables in a time frame shorter than what you&#x27;d need for the brakes to stop the elevator. A drop of just a foot could easily cause plenty of injuries.<p>EDIT: I should also mention that the mechanism I described above should not be confused with the overspeed governor which is located in the penthouse and wouldn&#x27;t notice anything at all if the lift cage gets stuck.')
