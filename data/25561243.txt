It provides approximately 1,000 calories, and the average person needs approximately 2,000 per day, so we&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;ll need to order two. That puts the food costs at $12 per person.<p>The average cost to install a kitchen is around $60,000. If we assume a rate of return of 5%, that is $3,000 per year right there that the money needs to provide to justify it being invested in a kitchen and not invested elsewhere. That covers more than half of the individual restaurant cost right there and leaves only about $4 for everything else. Does $4 even begin to cover the time it would take you to make your own Big Mac meal (I agree that it isn&#x27;t fair to compare with lobster) at home once, let alone twice? While the average home has 2.5 people, not just one person, we&#x27;ve only just scratched the cost of having a kitchen. We still have ingredients to pay for, the opportunity cost of occupying the land, electricity&#x2F;gas, taxes, repairs and maintenance, etc. You&#x27;re blowing your $30 budget in pretty short order. Okay, if you are one of those TV families with 14 kids, then perhaps you can gain some economies of scale at home.<p>Yes, if you&#x27;ve already invested heavily in having your own kitchen, then you can become more price competitive with a professional kitchen. Though that is true of a lot of things. After you&#x27;ve invested heavily in having your own silicon fab, you&#x27;re going to laugh at how much Intel is charging for their chips as well. The means of production comes with a cost, though. And while it may be a sunk cost for most, it should not be ignored on that basis.<p>The real world is complicated, though.<p>1. If you&#x27;re buying a used home, as most people do, they rarely come with silicon fabs but virtually always come with a kitchen, leaving you little choice in whether or not you want to invest in one. If land is cheap, it usually doesn&#x27;t make sense to divest yourself from owning a kitchen. However, if land is expensive, then the calculus changes. When land is expensive, the land occupied by a kitchen can be put to more productive use that outweighs the investment you have already made.<p>2. Because most people are invested in home kitchens already, restaurants aren&#x27;t optimized for providing food you want to eat on a regular basis. Eating a Big Mac twice a day, every day isn&#x27;t sustainable. But at the other end, non-fast food restaurants focus on providing entertainment. Your kitchen can compete with them as your kitchen doesn&#x27;t have to be entertaining. To be fair with them, we would have to include the cost of having a living room, TV, Netflix account, etc.')
