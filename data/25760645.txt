Media loves taking stuff out of context, not just with Trump mind you.<p>2. Not only big tech is censoring Trump, but normal media too, for example more than once channels refused to air live presidential addresses, sometimes they aired but with comments, or they waited for a while and then aired it edited.<p>I saw other day here in HN people saying BigTech kicking Trump off their platform was fine because he wouldn&#x27;t be silenced, since he has the Whitehouse official system of contacting with the press... thing is, the press is now delibetarely ignoring him too, so you have a situation where both BigTech and Press is not letting his words through, isn&#x27;t that censorship?')
