They were pushing an agenda.  It was not rare to see a &quot;false information&quot; flag only to see the &quot;fact-checking&quot; article support the claim.  One particular claim I saw marked false was China did not need a vaccine to keep covid under control.  The article went on and on about everything other than vaccine.  There were like three or four lines talking about vaccines.  Those were mostly about how the Chinese weren&#x27;t anti-vaccine.  At the time of the &quot;fact-checking&quot; article, there were only about 1 million Chinese vaccinated which was still in testing.  That is just a drop in the bucket compared to the total population.  The source articles the &quot;fact-checking&quot; article linked to did not even mention vaccines.  Sounds more like pushing an agenda rather than fact-checking and educating.')
