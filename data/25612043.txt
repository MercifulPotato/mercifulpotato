You can get a free copy at fpcomplete.<p>Did a free course in December with him, and I&#x27;m still watching the classes because it has so much great info there.<p>Also I do recommend the Rust Programming, it really teaches you &quot;how&#x2F;why&quot; use Rust.<p>To conclude, rust-learning (at GitHub) have great links, amazing articles about parts of the language, there is so much knowledge there, just go collect it :P')
