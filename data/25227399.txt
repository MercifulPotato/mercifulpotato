It is clear that humans have deference to authority as one of universal values, why is that?<p>There is a sort of standard (&quot;right-wing&quot;, &quot;evolutionary&quot;) explanation that argues that social hierarchies are of biological nature, similar to hierarchies in some species, they are related to sexual selection and simply somebody has to be an &quot;alpha&quot;. Ultimately, I rejected this explanation because I think the evidence for it is contested. Some humans are actively willing to submit, it&#x27;s not just the threat of violence that causes them to do so, and the deference to authority is not always sexual in humans. It seems that not all hierarchies are simply a struggle for power, although arguably in large-scale human groups, it often becomes the case.<p>Currently, my favorite explanation of authority as a natural human value comes from the idea that the authorities represent &quot;institutional memory&quot; of the particular human group. So for example, the first authority you meet, your parents, exists to give you knowledge and experience of their life, so you wouldn&#x27;t learn from zero as a child. Similar goes for the social group as a whole, the authorities in the group (typically the elders) are the people who lean conservative, and make sure that lessons of the past are remembered by the group.<p>Given this explanation for the role of social hierarchies and authority, I am not sure what replaces this &quot;institutional memory&quot; in &quot;leaderless&quot; organizations. If nothing replaces it, it must become inefficient eventually by repeating past mistakes. Or the leaderlessness might be short-lived and the authority which holds the institutional memory will appear.<p>However, I agree that in modern large companies, the management is often turned over much more frequently than some employees. This, assuming the actual role of hierarchy in human groups is to gatekeep institutional memory, would explain why some conclude that management is useless. But it is not clear whether going further and entirely removing it is going to be better.')
