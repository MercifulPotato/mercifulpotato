It&#x27;s a CLI tool which picks up the local code changes from the system and compiles them over a extremely high powered remote server.<p>It runs the compiled app on your local device using the remote ADB. It exposes a URL for the web apps that can be accessed to see the changes.<p>Please take a look at the project and let me know what you think. If anyone is interested to try it out, comment below. I will share the details with you.')
