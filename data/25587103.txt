For example, it should become very difficult for a human driver to hit a pedestrian or cyclist. Not impossible. Just exceedingly unlikely to be the fault of the driver.<p>Secondly, driver assist will habituate drivers and other road users to the performance characteristics of AV technology. The upshot is that AV technology will not be benchmarked against the way drivers and other road users behave and perform today. In some ways the expectations for incrementally better safety will be higher. In other ways, the &quot;flavor&quot; or road risks will change in a way that converges on how AVs perform.')
