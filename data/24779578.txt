I can&#x27;t imagine they would care about (or even know about) having a LinkedIn profile with zero related employment, no contacts to network with, etc.<p>I know I am being a little &#x27;difficult&#x27; with my question and I am not criticising I am just interested on your thought process more than anything.<p>-----<p>Update: Just realised you edited your original reply so my reply doesn&#x27;t make quite as much sense now :)<p>I think your direct email option is good. If it were me I would automate the direct email with a <i>little bit</i> of weak validation such as &quot;please explain in one or two sentences your situation&quot; then anyone who emails with a few words are automatically validated and any blank or one word emails are either auto-deleted or put aside for manual validation.<p>Just an idea though. I figure posting to HN means you wanted a little feedback :)<p>Best of luck with your book. I don&#x27;t have a need for it right now (thankfully) but I hope it helps others as it appears you have a put a lot of thought and work into it.')
