Another 10% are so are willing to do anything to become famous. It has always been this way.</i><p>Not sure that&#x27;s true, though. Here&#x27;s a cloud to cover your sunshine: what if the very concept that beliefs have to correspond to observable reality is a relatively new one, or a relatively unpopular one (with a 10% of the population subscribing to it)? What if it&#x27;s an unchanging constant that people believe whatever <i>works</i> for them in the immediate, observable way? What if it&#x27;s natural for people to believe in lies, if these lies don&#x27;t seem to cause obvious, instant hurt to them, and especially if these lies benefits them socially (going along better with their tribe, finding their in-group, raising status)?<p>I worry that for most of history, we could get away with believing in bullshit. And now we&#x27;ve scaled up and advanced our societies to the point they <i>need</i> accurate beliefs to function. Problem is, holding inaccurate beliefs doesn&#x27;t usually hurt you in an immediately obvious ways, so our monkey brains don&#x27;t connect the failures of our institutions with the bullshit individuals spread to each other.')
