Item(by='Nacdor', descendants=None, kids=[24936454], score=None, time=1604004845, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24935588, text='The most shocking part of this whole fiasco is the way The Intercept&#x27;s editors blatantly play favorites, allowing disinformation that helps Biden while censoring a legitimate story that hurts him:<p>&gt; 4) Finally, I have to note what I find to be the incredible irony that The Intercept -- which has published more articles than I can count that contain factually dubious claims if not outright falsehoods that are designed to undermine Trump&#x27;s candidacy or protect Joe Biden -- is now telling me, someone who has never had an article retracted or even seriously corrected in 15 years, that my journalism doesn&#x27;t meet the editorial requirements to be published at the Intercept.<p>&gt; It was The Intercept that took the lead in falsely claiming that publication by the NY Post was part of a campaign of &quot;Russian disinformation&quot; -- and did so by (a) uncritically citing the allegations of ex-CIA officials as truth, and (b) so much worse: omitting the sentence in the letter from the ex-CIA officials admitting they had no evidence for that claim. In other words, the Intercept -- in the only article that it bothered to publish that makes passing reference to these documents -- did so only by mindlessly repeating what CIA operatives say. And it turned out to be completely false. This -- CIA stenography -- is what meets the Intercept&#x27;s rigorous editorial standards:<p>&gt; &quot;The U.S. intelligence community had previously warned the White House that Giuliani has been the target of a Russian intelligence operation to disseminate disinformation about Biden, and the FBI has been investigating whether the strange story about the Biden laptop is part of a Russian disinformation campaign. This week, a group of former intelligence officials issued a letter saying that the Giuliani laptop story has the classic trademarks of Russian disinformation.&quot;<p>&gt; The Intercept deleted from that quotation of the CIA&#x27;s claims this rather significant statement: &quot;we do not have evidence of Russian involvement.&quot;<p>&gt; Repeatedly over the past several months, I&#x27;ve brought to Betsy&#x27;s attention false claims that were published by The Intercept in articles that were designed to protect Biden and malign Trump. Some have been corrected or quietly deleted, while others were just left standing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-editors-showing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-edito...</a>')
