I think brain implants, gene editing, AI and other technologies are going to happen</i><p>I had a discussion with someone - &quot;if the 21th century is the century of biotech&quot; (the clich√© in the Silicon Valley since the late 90s) is true, why are we seeing little progress? My reply was: perhaps biotech history will be similar to electronics history, and it&#x27;s just too early for now. Spark-gap transmitters were put into service in the 1900 and started the electronic age. In the 1910-1920, vacuum tubes were invented (the entire radio industry started before we even had an RF amplifier). In the 1940s, the first generation of electronic computers came into existence. Transistors were invented in the 1950s and practical ones didn&#x27;t exist until the 1960s. VLSI started in the early 70s, and it&#x27;s only in the 1980 that the microcomputer revolution was finally here.<p>Although Moore&#x27;s Law arguably is much older than VLSI, but it still took 40 years before the new science of electronics invented the computers, and another 40 years before VLSI&#x27;s exponential growth. Thus, I wonder, is the Human Genome Project the spark-gap transmitters of our era? Then CRISPR-Cas9 is the vacuum tube? And today we see a Hacker News headline <i>&quot;AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology&quot;</i> [0], a breakthrough of protein folding using deep learning. Well, we are probably reaching the biotech equivalent of electromechanical computers right now. This &quot;electronics-biotech&quot; analogy seems right, if it&#x27;s the case, brain-computer interface will be invented in the 2070s, like 1970s VLSI.<p>On the other hand, classic cyberpunk is always about the near-future. Its plots were usually based on a quick interpolation of the extreme growth of computing power we were seeing in the 80s, combined with the caricature of post-capitalism, it is only from this assumption that leads to radical social changes. If the story took place in the 22th century instead of 40 years later, it would be very &quot;uncyberpunk&quot;. Cyberpunk&#x27;s predictions has failed to materialize from this perspective. But it may still have a chance - if the singularitarianism are correct, the singularity will be there by 2050...<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25253488" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25253488</a>')
