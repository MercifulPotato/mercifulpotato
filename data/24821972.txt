The feed for each would only be about that topic so I can delve into what I feel like at that moment. The other big benefit is that I know everyone following me is following for that topic. On Twitter I mostly talk about tech and when I post about politics it may be uninteresting to 80% of my followers. Because one single account is supposed to represent me they have to put up with that and it creates a worse user experience.<p>The advantage of anonymous virtual accounts is we can have as many of them as we like, we should embrace that and build a better social network because of it.')
