I did so because we don&#x27;t have budget for a professional network engineer, but we do have some important network requirements that I needed to be able to set up with minimal learning curve. For the most part this turned out great, there&#x27;s a powerful UI that lets you configure all of the basics. And lets you inspect everything without having to relearn a bunch of tools and concepts everytime. I&#x27;d say perfect for a situation where the CTO has to &#x27;solve&#x27; the network.<p>What disappointed me is that some aspects are really unfinished, and it looks like there&#x27;s no intention of it to be fixed.<p>For example we bought their pro firewall (which has been out for years), it&#x27;s got 2 WAN ports for automatic fail over. To use the 2nd WAN port I had to switch over the UI back to legacy mode. Ok weird but I guess the new UI is still sort of new. But then it turned out that to configure automatic fail over in the most common way, I needed to ssh in and edit configuration files manually.<p>It didn&#x27;t turn out to be very hard, but it was just jarring. One of their flagship products, and of the 4 ports it has, 1 port is not supported in their main UI and it&#x27;s most common use is not possible even in their legacy UI.<p>Unifi Protect has similar incompleteness issues.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a company that does it better than Ubiquity right now, just disappointed that it stops there.')
