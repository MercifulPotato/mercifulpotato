Debian averages about 3 years with LTS, which is really good for for a community distro but really short for a commercial distro.<p>Updating a personal server every 6 months may be easy, but in a mature business it often makes sense to wait 5 years or more before upgrading certain infrastructure so that time and effort can be invested in other areas instead.')
