Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609104630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549298, text='So that previous video was not showing the start of the explosion, it was showing the end of the explosion. Labeling the end of the explosion &quot;source&quot; is misleading. It&#x27;s possible when the RV exploded, some of the flammable material was forced across the street, and that&#x27;s why there is fire across the street.<p>The first frame with an explosion has the explosion centered closer to the RV than to the other side of the street. I downloaded the video with youtube-dl and stepped through frame by frame with MPC-HC.')
