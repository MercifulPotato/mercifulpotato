Stuff like stacktraces, class:line_number when I was searching where something happens, links to webpages related to the task.<p>I was keeping a notepad tab open at all times anyway to keep context when I was doing something (otherwise I forget when I&#x27;m back from lunch and have to search again). So this is only making this context permanent and searcheable.<p>Then when I do something 3 months later and get a stacktrace I vaguely remember or other problem that I can imagine what the keyword would be - I just grep in that directory and find all the context needed, including jira task, commits, all related webpages, etc.<p>I also write short free-text notes there, but these are usually very short and less important than the copy-pasted stuff.')
