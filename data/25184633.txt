I&#x27;m in the process of buying my first at the moment and it&#x27;s <i>immensely</i> difficult to find something suitable and affordable (UK dev wages outside of London don&#x27;t compare well with the US...). I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s entirely down to homeowners though, or construction companies only building massively profitable mansions instead of small first-time buyer size homes. There definitely isn&#x27;t much to choose from where I live unless you have 2 good incomes to spend on it.')
