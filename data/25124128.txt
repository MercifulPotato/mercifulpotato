Go check it out.  Fake your enthusiasm, and go all in on researching it and finding out what plants, birds, etc. are found there, and look for them.  Hiking or birdwatching or etc. may not be your normal thing, but fake it for a while and you may find it does actually become somewhat interesting, even if you will go back to long-distance travel as soon as you have the chance.')
