As an obvious example, if you creep around neighborhoods looking for people with valuable property that isn&#x27;t well-secured against theft, then offer to sell a homeowner the information about the security problems you&#x27;ve discovered, and then sell that information to professional thieves if the homeowner declines, I don&#x27;t think that would be &quot;exactly what should happen according to free market economics.&quot;')
