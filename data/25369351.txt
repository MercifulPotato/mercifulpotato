So you actually end up writing the same thing you&#x27;d do if you didn&#x27;t have transactions: you issue an attempt to reserve, wait for the response to that attempt (whether that&#x27;s transaction commit succeeding&#x2F;failing or a queue processor processing), and handle both possible results. The transaction support doesn&#x27;t actually help you because it&#x27;s at the wrong level to be useful.')
