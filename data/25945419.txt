I miss a lot of things about it, with &quot;o&quot; being one of the big ones.<p>I know that I can use qutebrowser on macos, but using safari (with Vimari) just feels more integrated with the OS and my other Apple devices, and that&#x27;s been something I&#x27;ve enjoyed more than I expected to.<p>Writing this is making me think I should give qb on macos another shot though...')
