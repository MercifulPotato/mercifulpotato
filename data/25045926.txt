Until I started working with Erlang&#x2F;Elixir, I would probably have agreed with the OP article instead. Or at least its title, for reading about concurrency problems has become rather obsolete (for me).</i><p>That summarizes the problem with most of the articles and discussions on concurrency. People talking past each other because those who don&#x27;t do much concurrency, especially complex concurrent software, haven&#x27;t reinvented Erlang yet and don&#x27;t understand what the fuss is about, and those who do can&#x27;t explain in relatable terms how the actor model helps them organize concurrent code, preserve local reasoning, abstract, compose it, tolerate faults, etc. and eventually they stop bothering and so poor concurrency articles and comments continue to dominate the infospace.')
