Item(by='justiceforsaas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602988077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24813948, text='This article makes UpWork sound like a &quot;magic pill&quot; platform. The OP claims to have submitted 10 proposals and landed 2 jobs out of them (20% success rate).<p>Is this replicable? I doubt it.<p>I don&#x27;t really like these type of &quot;I made $$$ in [insert a short time period here&quot; articles. I prefer meta-analyses (where you take many success&#x2F;failure stories and try to find patterns, I&#x27;m focusing on doing this for startups which is a bit related to this [1]). The author also claims that &quot;Medium is full of negative Upwork stories.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad thing though. It signals that there are factors that contribute to people succeeding&#x2F;failing on UpWork. Rather than painting them in a negative light, it would be a good idea to take them all, compare what they did vs. what he did and try to decode WHY he succeeded and why they failed. An article doing this would be much more useful to your average freelancer. Although I doubt it would get viral on Medium like this one (for some reason, the Medium audience loves success stories, forgetting about the survivorship bias [2]).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Survivorship_bias" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Survivorship_bias</a>')
