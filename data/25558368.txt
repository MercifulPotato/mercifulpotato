I originally had &quot;frequency&quot; but I figured that would be confusing when juxtaposed to &quot;cavity size&quot;, took the inverse and forgot to flip the sign.<p>My background is audio processing is one of my hobbies, I have torn down and repaired noise canceling headphones and understand how they work (and have previously talked about this on Reddit and been corroborated by an actual engineer at a company designing such headphones), I have implemented laser galvanometer closed loop feedback systems and worked with them (which is both a similar control system problem, and a different part of OP&#x27;s research paper on the light path), I have attempted room and speaker response cancelation (and wrote my own DSP firmware for implementing biquad filters, which I use for my DIY living room rig), making an open source speaker calibration system is in my future project list and I&#x27;ve recently done a lot of thinking about this... and, most importantly, since this is neither my professional nor academic field I have no reason to overstate my claims or mislead about the importance of my work, unlike way too many academic researchers (see also: that guy who I recently called out for being a paper mill about side channel leakage methods after he successfully spun a false media story about generating Wi-Fi signals from RAM using a misleading paper title; in that case infosec <i>is</i> in fact one of my professional fields).<p>I don&#x27;t like to brag or anything, I&#x27;m just a curious guy who likes tinkering with (lots of) things... but if you insist on asking &quot;what are your credentials&quot;, well, there you go.')
