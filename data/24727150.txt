The push for politicizing the workplace is being driven from the top. Jeff Bezos is just one of many wealthy Americans who own large stakes in both media and tech companies. Their media companies promote diversity because they think it will produce positive global social effects, but their tech companies resist it presumably because they think it creates negative local economic effects (why else wouldn&#x27;t Google be %15 Black and 25% Hispanic?) Assuming the positive global effects, its a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; situation where ironically the strongest pressure on individual companies comes from employees  who consume the media being produced by the owners of those companies instead of those owners directly.')
