Lol, no.<p>You say &quot;Lol, no.&quot; as if this was a settled matter - inherently dismissing all possible criticism. There are studies that indicate that the higher concentration of bacteria which masks lead to in the area around your mouth may lead to an increase in dental issues.<p>Is this settled science? No. Does saying &quot;Lol, no.&quot; do a disservice to the scientists trying to settle this? Yes.')
