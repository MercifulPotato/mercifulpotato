Item(by='mildlyclassic', descendants=None, kids=[24799469], score=None, time=1602841795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799112, text='90% of the cost of being an ISP comes from laying the core underground fiber network that serves as the backbone of the system. This usually costs anywhere from $30k - $50k per kilometre to lay because it involves digging trenches, getting permits, etc. It takes about $50M to deploy a basic network in a city like Bangalore for example - we know from our existing ISP partners that this is a reasonable figure.<p>The fact that we are using FSOC to replace the underground fiber is what creates the 10x in savings. It only takes a few hundred FSOC units to do the job of the fiber as the core network and is much, much cheaper.<p>I&#x27;ve added a reply further down the page that addresses why we&#x27;d like the public to be involved, I&#x27;d be happy to elaborate more if you&#x27;ve got more questions.')
