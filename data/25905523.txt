It&#x27;s not really programming, it&#x27;s a series of commands that tell the 3D printer nozzle to move to a certain location at a certain speed while extruding at a certain rate. There are a lot of ways you can mess that up, you can tell the nozzle to go as low as it can and just start extruding, giving you a big blob on the bottom of your 3D printer. You can tell it to move to a position that it physically can&#x27;t, outside of the bounding box it can print in. Most 3D printers don&#x27;t have endstops to prevent you from going too high on an axis, so they&#x27;ll try to do that and tear themselves apart. You can try to extrude while your extruder isn&#x27;t up to heat and grind down your filament. You can physically jam your extruder into whatever it is you&#x27;re printing. There are all kinds of things that 3D printers are physically capable of doing that are unsafe.<p>Computers are just a machine like a 3D printer. You&#x27;re &quot;physically&quot; moving bytes of data around (that&#x27;s where most of the heat comes from), doing operations on them, etc. Nowadays you generally can&#x27;t get them to destroy themselves but in the earlier history you absolutely could tell the machines to tear themselves apart in the same way you can tell a 3D printer to tear itself apart.<p>Computers are just machines for moving bytes around, and it&#x27;s really hard to make a machine that you can only do safe stuff with.')
