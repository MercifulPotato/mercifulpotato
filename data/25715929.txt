I just can’t guarantee when, and I can’t tell you how much gain you’ll miss by investing conservatively until then.<p>I’m prepared for the risk of a market crash by maintaining a market posture that matches my risk tolerance and investing horizon.<p>Edit to add: “are you preparing for a market crash?” is another way of saying “are you confident you can time the market?” I’m not.<p>And I think that if someone could confidently time the market, they would be unlikely to be vocal about it. Announcing the future if the market is likely to change it.<p>Honestly I think that’s what some crash predictors are trying to do. They’re long bitcoin or gold, or short the market, and if they can get everyone else to go along with them now, they’ll make money now.')
