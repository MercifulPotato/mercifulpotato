And by that, I mean, <i>insane random changes</i>.<p>Just look at, for example, the recent madness with Firefox on Android.  They effectively pushed a beta about 6 weeks ago, removed tonnes of features, made many menu items difficult to navigate to, removed compatibility with almost all add-ons, it&#x27;s slower, it crashes for many constantly, it&#x27;s just a plain, simple mess.<p>They had 4.5 stars at one point.  They now have 3.9 stars:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=org.mozilla.fi...</a><p>Do you know how <i>hard</i> you have to work, to drag something down from 4.5, to 3.9, in a month, with almost 4M users?<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think they could do worse, if it was intentional sabotage by some hostile insider.<p>And it&#x27;s endless garbage like this from Firefox.<p>What firefox sees:<p>&quot;OMG!  Chrome is gaining ground!  Quick, turf everything that is unique on our platform, that is different from Chrome.  We must be just like them&quot;<p>What outsiders see:<p>&quot;Great, everything I cared about, unique to firefox is now gone.  Plus it&#x27;s slower, buggier, and they keep changing everything around on <i>every single release</i>.  Great.  Time to move on.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t compete with the giant, by being the giant.  You etch out a unique market.<p>Meanwhile, Firefox did the precise opposite, and removed their uniqueness.<p>They aren&#x27;t long for this world.')
