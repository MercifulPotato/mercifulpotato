It integrates with the password management APIs on iOS so I can create an account on a computer and log in using this same service&#x27;s app on my phone seconds later and the password will already be there, I just have to stare at the device for a second and I&#x27;m logged in.<p>It&#x27;s all incredibly seamless and I can&#x27;t imagine having to go back to managing passwords manually.')
