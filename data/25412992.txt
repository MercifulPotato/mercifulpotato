This &#x27;strategy&#x27; question is a mis-understanding people still have with Bitcoin, I probably should have written about it. My TL;DR is:<p>Bitcoin is not a business, it doesn&#x27;t require a staff to run, yet it is still viewed through the same lens as a business acquisition or strategic pivot. If executed right, a Bitcoin purchase changes absolutely nothing about the underlying business.<p>Bitcoin is nothing more than a tool for MicroStrategy to keep the money they&#x27;ve earned over the last 31 years.')
