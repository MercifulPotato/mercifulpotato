During winter months, good luck seeing sun at all, it is all just grey sky. And when it shows up one day for a couple of hours, i have a strong feeling that even then it wouldn&#x27;t be enough.<p>I remember 2 years ago, it was so bad, that local newspapers were celebrating when we finally got our first glimpse of sun (for a couple of hours) for that year on some day in late January (like 24th or 25th). It literally took almost an entire month to see the sun for the first time that year.')
