Modern jets even have automatic throttle&#x2F;power control too.<p>A better name for Tesla&#x27;s system is what it actually is... Driver Asist. But that&#x27;s not sexy... and we&#x27;re far off into the weeds.<p>&quot;Instant&quot; means instant. There is no way to paint it differently.<p>It&#x27;s disingenuous to call an ACH transfer &quot;instant&quot; instead of &quot;It&#x27;ll take several days during which time we&#x27;ll lend you money&quot;, like RH did here.')
