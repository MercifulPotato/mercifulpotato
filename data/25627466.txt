I&#x27;m in a similar position with WFH and distractions eat 10x the time they used to. Without the cadence of walks and meetings and face-to-face interactions, I rationalize that I keep my personal computer on my desk to help keep an eye on sleeping kids, check in on personal projects, etc., but having it there is a gateway to -not- doing the work I&#x27;m paid to do.<p>So, book your calendar with video meetings, book walks to get away from your desk.
