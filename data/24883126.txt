These are based on my own personal experiences and conversations with med students, so YMMV. I personally use Anki with the Image Occlusion Enhanced and Speed Focus Mode add-ons almost every-day, and frequently use text-to-speech&#x2F;swipe gestures on the android app to review cards while hiking.<p>If you&#x27;re casually doing like 20 cards a day on the train while commuting to work, this will definitely not apply.<p>A. Anki is almost never used <i>alone</i> in medical education. It&#x27;s used as an aid to retaining information within a heavily-structured curriculum where you&#x27;re going over the same concepts over, and over, and over in the form of lectures, clinical encounters, supplemental videos, more lectures, anatomy lab, histology lab, boards-prep, etc. So, like the author said, there&#x27;s a ton of med students using it, but context is very important.<p>B. Lots of people don&#x27;t use the algorithm. They use it in cram-mode to drill a subset of a pre-made deck into their head before an exam. Even if you never use the SRS algorithm, Anki is by-far the greatest flashcard program ever built (cloud sync, TTS, robust image support, open-source, etc.).<p>C. Many of the people grinding thousands of cards a day have a lot of factual knowledge, but really aren&#x27;t great at stitching it together for practical application. If you need to memorize random facts, great, but be very aware of that potential limitation.<p>D. Game-pads are the secret weapon. Joy2Key, or roll-your-own in Python like I did with the Inputs and PyAutoGui packages.<p>E. Use it with a very specific goal in mind. Med students are by-and-large using it specifically for the USMLE Step 1 exam, in which you have to memorize a finite, well-delineated set of information, much of which is irrelevant after the first two years. I&#x27;ve never met anyone who has <i>graduated</i> med school and kept using it, because grinding cards sucks and life is short.<p>F. Don&#x27;t be afraid to commit deck bankruptcy. If you&#x27;re reviewing 900 cards a day, and you don&#x27;t know why anymore, delete the deck and start from scratch.<p>G. There&#x27;s a distinct balance between reviewing cards so frequently that you&#x27;ve memorized the cards not the concepts, and making the cards so challenging that it takes too long to review efficiently (I did 871 cards in about 2 hours today - that&#x27;s a common number for a med student, some kids are doing thousands per-day - like, they roll out of bed and start tapping on that game controller). Be very, very aware of that memorizing the cards thing. You probably don&#x27;t know as much as you think you do.<p>So, in summary, it&#x27;s a really cool program. I wouldn&#x27;t characterize it as a superpower, however, since it has some glaring downsides, and is not particularly noteworthy when used in a vacuum. Again, that&#x27;s from somebody doing &gt;500 cards&#x2F;day.')
