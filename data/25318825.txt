The downtown—previously a ghost town—is alive, even at night. The number of businesses on the tax roll has grown from 1,908 to 8,864.<p>&gt; After LVT was adopted by voters in 1996, 70% of residential parcels saw a tax decrease; importantly, in the most at-risk neighborhoods (older pre-war housing and factory blocks) upwards of 90% of homes had their tax liability reduced.  Local business taxes were frozen by law at 1996 levels.  Construction returned to the city: the number of taxable building permits surged past neighboring Bethlehem, market investment returned, and capital improvement reappeared in city budgets.  Tax burdens on productive work and business declined. The losers in this trade were absentee owners of vacant lots, who had to shoulder much more of the burden.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;3&#x2F;6&#x2F;non-glamorous-gains-the-pennsylvania-land-tax-experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;3&#x2F;6&#x2F;non-glamorous-g...</a>')
