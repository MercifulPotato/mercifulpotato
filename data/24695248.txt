I made an account — this seems like an awesome idea, and I really like your vision. It seems like this format will really appeal to hacker-types with the idea for eventual federated + custom domain communities that can interact with each other. It’s similar to my own idea of an ideal social media network.<p>Some of the structure seems a bit confusing though as I look around. How can I create a new community or a custom domain? I don’t see the option anywhere. I also can’t find a way to post to any communities besides my own username.<p>If it weren’t for your comment in this post explaining everything, I’d be really lost. I’d recommend a page with a series of graphics that shows the basic idea of how everything works together. I also noticed that most of the static links on a subdomain page don’t work (ex. the “About” links at the bottom of the page).<p>Overall, really great job so far and I can’t wait to see what else comes of this! I’ll definitely be looking out for when you open-source the project, at least for better understanding, and maybe to contribute too! :)<p><i>Edit:</i><p>Ah okay, seems like you need to be following a community to be able to post to it. That makes sense.<p>It also seems like maybe I need to create multiple accounts to create multiple communities? Each account is its own community? So if I wanted to make a community for “golang” for example, I’d have to make an account named “golang”... Then that account owns itself as a community? That’s my best guess!')
