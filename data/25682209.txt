There is no breaker needed. They allow people to bet on falling and rising prices. A crash doesn&#x27;t make people go away it makes winners and looser just like if the price goes up. The more it move in one direction the more people will be interested in betting on counter movement anyway so if it swings more its swings more likely back too.<p>There are certainly &quot;cheating&quot; exchanges out there but cheating by stooping trades every once in a while is absurdly inefficient and makes people leave the exchange even if they dont know about the cheating.\nExchanges can cheat way way simpler by front running the order books.')
