I saw it happen. On my forum, that very question was asked, and it wasn’t a philosophical debate. It was an operational one - how do we balance free speech ideals vs actual forum evidence.<p>The framework that fits the evidence and the ideals was<p>1) we want a market place of ideas to function<p>2) there is content that easily dominates and sidelines all other ideas.<p>3) there are Maliciously engineered arguments that need complex rebuttals to Massive emotional payloads, which will never be accepted.<p>4) cat videos, pictures and memes will out perform everything else<p>We let things be for a long time. Very light touch approaches. It doesn’t work. The good ideas will become irrelevant before theY are even read, and that is long after bad ideas redefine reality.<p>The underlying nexus is that our ideals on free speech do not take into account human wetware bandwidth.<p>If reality must be perceived, and the perception system is flooded, then it doesn’t matter how good our science or reason is. The system is still blind.')
