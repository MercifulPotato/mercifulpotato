It’s a very odd type of cognitive dissonance where something is both a model to be copied and a mess at the same time by the same people.<p>it&#x27;s only odd if you think economic productivity is the sole determination of what makes a desirable place to live. regarding SF in particular, it&#x27;s phenomenal what has been accomplished there, don&#x27;t get me wrong. but this has to be weighed against the fact that a &quot;starter home&quot; costs $1mm, the rate of petty crime rivals that of the most dangerous cities in america, etc. it&#x27;s not cognitive dissonance to acknowledge that, while great things have been accomplished, a lot of stupid mistakes have also been made.<p>and by the way, I don&#x27;t think the ban on non-competes is usually what people are thinking of when they describe california as a mess.')
