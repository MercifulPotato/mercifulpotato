It&#x27;s a community effort<p>That doesn&#x27;t stop Apple needing control, or at least feeling that way.<p>&gt; Apple could as well contribute whatever improvements it deems necessary to benefit themselves and everyone else<p>They do. Apple uses OSM data <i>and</i> contributes to OSM indirectly (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple</a>).<p>&gt; It would&#x27;ve been a much better starting point, too<p>Who&#x27;s to say? As stated, Apple does use OSM data. They use data from multiple different sources. (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gspa21.ls.apple.com&#x2F;html&#x2F;attribution.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gspa21.ls.apple.com&#x2F;html&#x2F;attribution.html</a>)<p>&gt; than whatever proprietary data they licensed to get started<p>I detect a bit of a fallacy in what you&#x27;re saying, that Apple wanting to have control over their own geographical data must mean that they aren&#x27;t using or contributing to OSM. It isn&#x27;t a zero-sum situation.')
