There is often a <i>large</i> cost of moving. Eg - I use `sketch` for designing. I can move to Figma, but it&#x27;ll be a learning curve and the performance just isn&#x27;t the same.<p>Additionally, in order to move to Linux I need to find a good alternative to many other software that I&#x27;m using.
