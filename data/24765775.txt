Among my group of ~40 coworkers, about 30 (including me) have left the city. As far as I know all but one were renting.<p>Everyone who left gave the following rationale:<p>- we can work remotely so move wherever or nomad now<p>- SF is not very fun during the pandemic<p>- WFH in my tiny apartment is much less enjoyable than when I was working in the office and didn’t spend much time in the apartment<p>- therefore I’m moving for a year or so until things fully reopen<p>Now I think the question is what does the eventual full reopening look like and how long does it take?<p>Many people will move back, because many office jobs will return, and many people love city life and the office work environment (including me).<p>But the longer things take, the more people get established elsewhere, and the more companies decide to make remote permanent and don’t reopen an office, the more I think this market reset in SF will be long-lasting.<p>As other posters have said it’s a welcome relief though. Prices are <i>still</i> very high, and new construction remains far from sufficient to keep up with demand.<p>(edit: typo)')
