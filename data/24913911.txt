A carbon tax is workable, I&#x27;ve just come to favor a sales tax as simpler.<p>They&#x27;re both consumption taxes, the latter says &quot;ok, this is what we have to take out of the economy to pay for mitigation, lets do it as a sales tax and then pay some of it back for products that reduce carbon burden, either directly or as substitute goods for especially polluting technologies&quot;.<p>The more moving parts something like this has, the more opportunities there are to take advantage of that. Sales tax already exists, it&#x27;s well understood, this would be fire-and-forget, and it wouldn&#x27;t create a bunch of new jobs for accountants (nothing against them, but we don&#x27;t want that).')
