Some lighter-than-air quality? I assume the complexity involved in making a helicopter collective would be too heavy. Is it really quadcopters all the way down?<p>2: Why not smaller? Would an even smaller drone be unfeasible due to battery weight and square&#x2F;cube law issues? What&#x27;s stopping us from gram-scale drones? Presumably the interaction with the air would create new problems and things to take advantage of.')
