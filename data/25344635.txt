But if we&#x27;re talking about the ability to eyeball what&#x27;s going on, I&#x27;m not sure...<p>In Clojure if you see a macro (will be highlighted as a different color) followed by something in square brackets you&#x27;ll know what&#x27;s up. The little extra syntax Clojure introduced is quite a big game changer to readability vs other lisps.<p>The problem is we can introduce new macros that may behave differently. You don&#x27;t have that problem in languages without macros. But if you did have macros, brackets and indentation would lose signal too. Conversely if we didn&#x27;t have user macros in Clojure the standard convention would be a 100% reliable signal too.<p>I mean, I agree in general that people may find C-like languages more readable, but these examples seem rather poor.<p>I can see why some people would find this more readable<p><pre><code>   if (a || (b &amp;&amp; (c + 10 == 11))) {\n     doSomething();\n   }\n</code></pre>\nthan this (though I still believe this is mostly a cultural difference)<p><pre><code>   (if (or a (and b (= (+ c 10) 11)))\n    (do-something))\n</code></pre>\nBut this is about extra syntax not indentation. You can indent both in many different ways.<p>If anything, given the extra syntax, the js snippet has more possible indentations in this case.')
