It reads like someone who feels the need to defend a top down model of control. In my experience, these models are really more about perception management and creating the illusion of productivity while a lot of developer talent under their umbrella is wasted. I might be a bit jaded, but I honestly think a lot of the popular &quot;agile&quot; methodologies of today are directly responsible for the commonality of software bugs and glitches in production code. Most devs today will never get to experience a feeling of ownership over the technology they ultimately produce.')
