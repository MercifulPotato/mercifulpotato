That&#x27;s.. Not a lot. Maybe they only did it for batter life. Maybe they will allow more in the future. But you can only get an M1 with what Apple sells you, and the future means comparing to what&#x27;s available from AMD and Intel at that time as well.<p>This is my main concern. I’m still on the edge about getting an M1 device since I plan on mainly using it for iOS stuff and casual usage and have plenty of PCs for my hacking ventures, but I’m used to having 64GB and would hate to join the ranks of people who complain about Electron ;)')
