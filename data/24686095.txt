Shouldn&#x27;t you be instead waiting on a condition that gets set when work is queued? Like an event object, or an I&#x2F;O completion port, or something that indicates work is ready? Instead of polling for the condition?<p>&gt; On Windows the &quot;as soon as physically possible&quot; part is unfortunately 16ms in most cases, and that&#x27;s just not acceptable for something as precise as audio work.<p>Aren&#x27;t you contradicting yourself here? If you&#x27;re doing audio don&#x27;t you want periodic multimedia timers? Which are built for this purpose and actually also do deliver the resolution you need?')
