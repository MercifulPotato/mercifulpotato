Obviously, from my perspective, the economies of scale, the infrastructure, overhead, and institutional resources available to programmers at a dedicated software development firm would produce an application at better quality per dollar (however you measure it) than a high school teacher in their off-hours. To me it seems that it&#x27;s certainly not cheaper for us as a society, as a species, and only appears so because you are under-paid. If you were paid your actual worth, the school would say &quot;we don&#x27;t have the funds to develop this in-house, and had to buy a commercial typing program off-the-shelf, despite its loose fit for our use case.&quot;<p>How can we, as rational members of society, abide this?')
