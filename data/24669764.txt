Meanwhile, it&#x27;s painfully obvious that the whole thing is aimed to be a &quot;low-touch&quot; &#x2F; &quot;fully automated&quot; campaign where the participation rules are designed around that goal. Makes sense -- it&#x27;s easy to scale, etc. However now it&#x27;s clear that the outcome is the polar opposite of GSoC, where participating in GSoC has prestige and produces high quality oss contributions, and it&#x27;s facing an unwinnable battle against an internet army looking for the minimum effort end-run around the rules to extract a tshirt...<p>So, my take is that DO should take a longer view and try to raise the profile of Hacktoberfest by making it more exclusive -- eg take a step toward GSoC. For ex, there are a handful of oss-bounty sites (bountysource, issuehunt, etc) where people post bounties for things they want implemented. Could DO partner here in some fashion? Such as matching bounties in a certain range ($10&lt;x&lt;$50?) with a tshirt? Or matching bounties? Make it a year-round promo instead of one month?')
