Most people wouldn’t want to install a charger out in their parking strip, on general principle - too exposed. Running high current wires out into the front yard and under the sidewalk would also be a mess.<p>And that’s all ignoring the fact that the city owns the parking strip, not you, and I don’t think they’re going to be interested in having that kind of equipment in their space.')
