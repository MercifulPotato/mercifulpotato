Scalability and (current) speed are not the same thing. However saying poorly was probably unfair, I should have said is less scalable than Tor is.<p>&gt; You can develop dynamic services on Freenet just fine.\n&gt; [...]<p>What you&#x27;re describing is how I would define a static page (plus client side scripting). Which works fine in many use cases. But you can&#x27;t ssh into some server over freenet, or plop your php site from the world wide web unchanged, on to freenet. You can do these things with Tor, along with (at least in principle) all the &quot;true p2p&quot; things you mentioned you can do with freenet (Obviously in the Tor case you need to have your server always going and have sufficient capacity). That&#x27;s why I would describe Tor as more flexible in terms of the things you can &quot;host&quot; (for lack of a better word). But the flexibility comes at a cost, and in exchange for being less flexible, freenet has a lot of interesting properties that tor does not have.')
