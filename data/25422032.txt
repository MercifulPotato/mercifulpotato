They don’t know enough about computers themselves, and the advertorials&#x2F;computer magazines don’t do them any favors.<p>In some cases, you don&#x27;t have a choice.  As far as I know, all current Roomba models have their schedule programmed via an smartphone app.  I don&#x27;t have one, so I don&#x27;t know if it exactly requires the internet, but it&#x27;s close.  Older models (like the ones I have) used buttons on the unit and had no need for any kind of network at all.')
