They really are special, and a cut above games like Witcher 3 or BoTW imo. I don&#x27;t think I have ever played a game where nearly every element was best in class and worked so well together.<p>The &quot;stories&quot; are brilliant, and the way they are told is perfect for the medium. There is an incredible world, that is awe inspiring and fascinating, with deep and expansive lore, and yet it never gets in the way, or suffers from a disconnect with the player. In BoTW the vast majority of my actions make no sense in the context of the plot. In the DS games or BB the world doesn&#x27;t revolve around my character, so my actions are those of an inhabitant rather than the driver of the plot, and thus my actions don&#x27;t destroy my suspension of disbelief, despite the freedom given to me, the same way they do in a game like Cyberpunk where my player clearly exists in the separate plane from the one the the world is in.<p>The music matches the atmosphere and gameplay seamlessly, with very few disconnects. Especially Sekiro, which links its music to the gameplay nearly flawlessly. I won&#x27;t claim it superior to Undertale, but it still lives in the very upper echelons.<p>The gameplay is genre defining. I don&#x27;t think much more needs to be said of it, other than that the difficulty has been grossly misrepresented. My former roommate, who struggled with the tutorial levels of fallout 4 beat Sekiro. These games aren&#x27;t easy, but they also probably aren&#x27;t &quot;too hard&quot; for your average player.<p>And the level design is brilliant, intricate and varied, awe inspiring, and encouraging&#x2F;requiring exploration without it feeling like a chore (swamps excepted).<p>Go play these games, jeez.')
