I used the ergo baby carrier which supports the head when you’re chest to chest with the baby. Later you can turn the baby around when the neck muscles are developed. \nAlso, no worries: she’ll let you know what her status is and she won’t forego too many meals :)\nI’d also recommend multiple carrying contraptions like the solly if you can muscle memorize how to wrap it. You’ll figure out what works best for you and you have a backup if your primary is involved in a diaper accident.')
