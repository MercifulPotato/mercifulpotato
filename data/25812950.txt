While some folks are clearly using it successfully and seem to like it, another bunch of people say &quot;it was a huge pain in the butt to get E2EE working, and if it two software engineers struggled this much...&quot; etc.<p>When did this E2EE failure happen (so I know if these are current bugs or ones fixed months&#x2F;years ago)? What platforms was this (web, iOS &amp; Android are entirely separate codebases)? What actually went wrong?  The simple case of signing up and DMing someone should just work, and the E2EE should be transparent.<p>The main possible failure modes I&#x27;m aware of right now are:<p>* Risk of undecryptable messages during federation outages (due to messages being shared separately from their keys)<p>* Risk of verifying another user getting stuck if there are weird failures&#x2F;edge cases we haven&#x27;t spotted yet<p>* Verifying yourself when you log in on a new device has confusing UX, and there&#x27;s a known bug that can stop keys being synced to the new login even once verified.<p>If anyone in the &quot;I tried Matrix and it was awful&quot; camp could give detailed feedback (either here, or on github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-{web,ios,android}&#x2F;issues) then it would be genuinely useful for prioritising our work.  At the moment the vast majority of negative feedback on HN has been &quot;it sucked&quot; without giving a hint of what actually went wrong.')
