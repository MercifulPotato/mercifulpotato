As the wp_postmeta table grows larger in size, it will generate longer running queries as it tries to query against non-indexed key + values. At a certain point, your only option is to start modifying WP core code and the DB tables for your specific needs...which at that point, the poor software architecture becomes an enormous problem. Granted most small blogs will never see these kinds of issues since they will never reach these inflection points, but they needlessly exist none the less.')
