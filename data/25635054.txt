Pfizer is targeting 1.3B doses manufactured in 2021, 600M from Moderna, which still leaves the world plenty short (remember each person needs 2 doses). It&#x27;s a group effort, and there are additional vaccines under development&#x2F;review that will hopefully contribute to the effort.<p>There&#x27;s also discussion around whether Moderna&#x27;s vaccine can be reduced from 100ml to 50ml while retaining the same efficacy, which would obviously double the amount of doses provided by Moderna.')
