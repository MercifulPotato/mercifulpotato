I think the biggest risk is that it&#x27;s only a small improvement, and people may feel like, &quot;Tried alternative voting systems, they were more complicated and didn&#x27;t really improve anything.&quot;<p>However, I ended up voting Yes on 2 because it will increase awareness that alternative voting systems <i>exist</i>. The more people who are aware that FPTP sucks moose juice, the more likely we can pass other, more impactful, reforms like STAR. So basically I&#x27;m wagering that there&#x27;s more people like this, than people who will give up on voting reform due to RCV (really, IRV)&#x27;s shortcomings.')
