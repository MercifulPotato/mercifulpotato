They don&#x27;t make any sense to us and we&#x27;re pretty good with them all going away.<p>The primary problem is that in each of them, the cats have all been overly stressed out - far worse than what the cats at our local humane society experience even! Each one we&#x27;ve visited has had weird rules of engagement made by humans rather than cats, that clearly weren&#x27;t working for the cats.<p>On the human side - it&#x27;s a total con. I get that the funding is necessary to make these places work, but frankly I&#x27;d rather continue to donate to my local humane society as it feels as though the funding is more clearly put to the benefit of the cats. $50 for a cup of coffee and a 30 minute visit where you might not even be allowed to pet the cats (!!!) makes no sense to me.<p>I&#x27;m not meaning to condemn all of these places - and I haven&#x27;t been to any in SFO - but having gone to a handful, I&#x27;ve been disappointed.')
