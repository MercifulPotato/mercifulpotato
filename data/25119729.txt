Item(by='Izkata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605580619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112603, text='&gt; I had been taking very short breath right from my upper chest area. This was actually causing me pain. I learned to breath by expanding my abdomen and after forcefully breathing very slowly like that for 2 days, everything went back to normal.  So there&#x27;s a big tip for anybody reading this. I think it&#x27;s called diaphragmatic breathing, Google it.<p>And the moderate version of the other way is called &quot;shallow breathing&quot; or &quot;chest breathing&quot;.  From what I understand it&#x27;s actually really common but not very good for us, because it doesn&#x27;t really expand the bottom of the lungs, so we&#x27;re not getting as much breath as we should.')
