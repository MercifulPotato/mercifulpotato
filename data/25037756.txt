Local contact tracing handles &quot;complex&quot; cases, which are generally things like workplace outbreaks where they have the help of employee records and attendance lists. National contact tracing handles all the other, less robustly recorded social contacts. I believe that in Canada, where all contact tracing is local, a lot of areas have recently abandoned tracing the kinds of contacts that are handled by the UK&#x27;s national scheme altogether because they don&#x27;t have the resources and it doesn&#x27;t work well.')
