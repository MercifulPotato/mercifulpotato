This is useful for hobbyists. I&#x27;m not against learning new languages, but sometimes you want to use what you are familiar with so that you can think about your project, not learning to write the code.<p>Also re: your last point, most of these languages have library support for common features, and you definitely don&#x27;t have to think about registers and memory addresses. Look at the kind of projects people make with Arduino, flashing LEDs and servos work just fine in a high level language.')
