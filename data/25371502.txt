With the old one, I change a file, it gets automatically ssh&#x27;d to my dev server, and my changes work instantly. I&#x27;m sure that if the PHP and JS had to be comp&#x2F;transpiled, it would take a minute or so (it&#x27;s just under 100K LOC, some files 13K LOC).<p>For the new application, I get the same fast feedback because Go does incremental compiles and create-react-app with TS also does incremental compiles with live reload (without requiring a full page reload).<p>For production builds, the old is pulled through tools like ioncube and uglify, the new one churns out an optimized binary and webpack-flavored .js files.<p>I mean if you zoom out enough there&#x27;s no noticeable difference.')
