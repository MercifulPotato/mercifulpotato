I don&#x27;t think so.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re being rather unfavourable there. The Jackbox developers have been pretty responsive listening to user feedback in the past. For example Linux support was added after several requests on Steam forums. They&#x27;ve also added other features like subtitles specifically for streaming via video conferencing solutions. So if Zoom &#x2F; Teams &#x2F; etc didn&#x27;t work well then you can bet they&#x27;d have posted another workaround and&#x2F;or a game patch since the alternative is they&#x27;d lose a lot of potential business in 2020.<p>As I&#x27;d said, I&#x27;d used it fine over both Zoom and Teams (multiple times on both in fact) and the only reason I even bought Jackbox Party games was because several different work colleagues (I think it might have been 3 different people) recommended it to me after they had played their own games (individually) over Zoom and other conferencing solutions.<p>I don&#x27;t have any experience with Jitsi so maybe the issues you were having were Jitsi specific? Maybe, being a techie, Jitsi was already &quot;good enough&quot; but you thought you could improve upon it a little and ended up over-engineering a solution? (we&#x27;ve all fallen into that trap -- when you spend your entire life building enterprise solutions it&#x27;s sometimes hard to take a step back. Particularly when it&#x27;s something as fun as OBS). Or maybe there was some issue with Linux? All I know is that myself and everyone I know has had zero issues hosting using Jackbox&#x27;s recommended approach.')
