Since it&#x27;s profound amplifying hearing aids won&#x27;t do a damn thing (apart from possibly damaging the hearing for the good part).<p>I&#x27;ve thought about looking at if there are frequency shifting hearing aids or even just earpieces to shift some of those higher frequencies into my hearing range of the right ear.<p>I haven&#x27;t spent too much digging deeper into it - since I&#x27;m completely functional at normal levels, however whispering by anyone and low volume female voices on my right side are completely lost.  I typically do that &quot;speak to my good ear&quot; contortion.  Or just sit in the corner of the table or sit to the right in other conversations.')
