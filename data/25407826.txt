Item(by='Mandelmus', descendants=None, kids=[25408231, 25408293], score=None, time=1607877987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406606, text='It&#x27;s long been a pet peeve of mine (to put it mildly) how our entertainment industry aestheticizes violence, tragedy, dystopia, and criminals, but then claims to intend the opposite.<p>Walter White in Breaking Bad is supposedly the protagonist in a tragic story about the corrupting effects of criminality, greed, and the drug trade, yet the most memorable and culturally cited impressions are of how badass and powerful Heisenberg is.<p>Games are notoriously bad at this (the favoured term here is &quot;ludonarrative dissonance&quot;) where some games pretend to denounce violence in their stories or cutscenes, but the gameplay makes mass violence the most gratifying and fun part of the entire experience.<p>And if anyone were to criticise the educational&#x2F;cultural impact of such aesthetic distortions, the inevitable killer argument in return is &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;artistic freedom&quot; and instant panic about the threat of censorship.<p>(As an aside, as a European I find it especially striking how depictions of even artistic and consensual adult sexuality or even just plain nudity are considered far more corrupting and &quot;taboo&quot; in US culture than depictions of violence. I think that&#x27;s fundamentally fucked up. Some brief nudity? Rated R. People getting shot? PG-13.)')
