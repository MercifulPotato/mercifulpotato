Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611077183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835447, text='&gt; Euro-critical countries in eastern Europe profit hugely from the EU and would never seriously consider going back to the previous state of things.<p>The <i>elites</i> of those countries benefit way more from the influx of euros, some breadcrumbs are given to the people and then everyone stays under the illusion they are better off. The central bank keeps pushing money, Brussels and Berlin get happy about it until some external crisis show that the periphery countries never actually changed their ways and now are even more fragile to external shocks and even more dependent on the EU.<p>Sounds familiar? If you know anything about Greece besides Santorini and Mykonos, it should strike a note.<p>&gt; if the EU had a centralized fiscal&amp;monetary policy, things would have looked much less bleak for southern parts of the Union.<p>Sorry for the stereotyping, but this is such a German comment and so short-sighted that if I get into a long response to it my blood will boil a little. Instead, let me refer you to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nntaleb.medium.com&#x2F;lebanon-from-ponzi-to-antifragility-c9867eb71998" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nntaleb.medium.com&#x2F;lebanon-from-ponzi-to-antifragili...</a> who maybe can get the point across better than me.')
