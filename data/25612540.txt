I think it could have been more popular if web browsers had defaulted to it when saving pages, rather than this weird html + _files&#x2F; directory (which on Windows is mysteriously linked so that when you delete one, you delete the other - no idea how they do that!).<p>What I&#x27;ve read of EPUB is also pretty disappointing. Seeing as it&#x27;s a compiled format, once again, instead of going the zipfile + bunch of html inside + specific layout, we could have had a subset of html in .mhtml.gz with, like, metadata in a &lt;script type=&quot;application&#x2F;json&quot; id=&quot;x-epub-metadata&quot;&gt;. And then, guess what, web browsers could have been able to read it nativelyâ€¦')
