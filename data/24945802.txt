You can&#x27;t read other people&#x27;s mail if you&#x27;re not on their address list. Recipients probably don&#x27;t even know their emails came from MailChimp, let alone go there to participate in anything. With this rule, MailChimp is just poking their finger into organizations&#x27; private relationships with their subscribers.<p>Imagine a church emailing its members before Easter saying that Jesus rose from the dead. Since that&#x27;s impossible, it&#x27;s a clear violation of this misinformation rule. But I doubt MailChimp will ban it because their &quot;sole discretion&quot; is obviously going to be biased political opinion, not anything objective.')
