Those capabilities are great. But those capabilities exist whether a Bitcoin is priced at $1 or $25,000. Why are those capabilities enough to drive the price of a Bitcoin up?<p>Higher prices means Bitcoin is capable of moving bigger capital. At $1, you can&#x27;t move around $10m worth of bitcoin (that&#x27;s like half of the possible supply). At $35k, moving $10m and trading it is a piece of cake. $10m liquidity is available in many markets now and do no move the price.<p>Since the supply is limited, the price is just a gauge for demand.')
