Then self-driving cars only need to be a little safer than the drivers they replace. Which means if infrequent drivers with little experience that get replaced by robotaxis of average reliability could be a net-win in saved lives.\nDelaying their deployment until technology arrives that beats the most conservative drivers just means accepting a higher death toll.')
