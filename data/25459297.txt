It’s certainly possible to write code in Julia that is slower than corresponding Matlab or Python code.<p>Generally, naive Julia code shouldn’t be any slower than Matlab or Python, but it can happen. The Julia Discourse forum has many posts from people surprised to find their code running slower in Julia, but the community is also incredibly helpful so these posts almost always result in some rather simple modifications to the code that makes it handily outperform Matlab or Python implementations.')
