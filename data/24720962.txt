My reasoning being that a common bottleneck for gaming workloads is single thread performance, and unless this is highly focused on a single core clock boost, I&#x27;d expect that single-threaded performance increases would be multiplied appropriately by core count, though perhaps not perfectly linearly.<p>When you see marketing reaching for &quot;non-gaming&quot; metrics, it&#x27;s often for highly parallelizable workloads, which benefits non-gaming disproportionately, but e.g. for compiling&#x2F;linking there are still tasks that have to be done serially, which is where that single-threaded performance boost is critical.<p>I&#x27;m definitely excited at this point to see what a Zen 3 threadripper can bring to the table.')
