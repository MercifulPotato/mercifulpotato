Same for a couple of public Slack groups.  I consider these services as wholly ephemeral.<p>Same goes for any product from Google, since they are notorious for service termination. In doing so, they abandoned their core promise of indexing the world&#x27;s information. G+ is gone, and the Groups archive is ever-thinning: Usenet posts I made a couple of decades back were once accessible thus, since Google bought the Dejanews archives, but are no longer discoverable.<p>Fortunately all my most interesting snippets and contributions these days start life in my own private repositories, so I have my own record. Everyone should do the same.')
