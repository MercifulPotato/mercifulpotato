However, she spends most of that on her hobby (more than I spend on the mortgage). She doesn&#x27;t contribute to any bills other than her gas and tires. I pay all the bills, benefits, utilities. I do all the shopping, cooking, baking, mechanic work, handyman work, projects, legal research (a case she got us involved in because she won&#x27;t listen to me), medical research (our son has an issue), etc. Of course I watch the kid pretty much as soon as I get off of work most days and on the weekend. She won&#x27;t let us move to a cheaper area or for me to pursue a different job. For example, there&#x27;s a position at Google in Pittsburgh that I would have liked to interview for. I&#x27;m guessing I wouldn&#x27;t get it, but I&#x27;d like to try. But my feelings and opinions aren&#x27;t worth anything.')
