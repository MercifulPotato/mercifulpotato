There is a level of malice here that I feel you are definitely dismissing while charging end users with a level of responsibility that it is impractical to handle regardless of what UI&#x2F;UX affordances you want to put on it.<p>It&#x27;s not a UI&#x2F;UX problem. It&#x27;s a &quot;you are offloading moderation to the end user&quot; problem--it is a fundamental failure of the approach. If you are going to put all of the work of moderation on the end user, <i>regardless</i> of whether you dress it up as &quot;shared moderation&quot; or whatever, the end user is going to leave and cede the floor to those who want to dominate the public discourse with sewage and crud and threats because the end user has a life to live and things to do with their day. There is a fundamental human cost to being exposed to the kind of garbage that Twitter et al filter out on the regular. It takes a toll on the psyche. It will drive people away. And that&#x27;s not a &quot;but muh engagement&quot; for whoever&#x27;s metrics and KPIs are involved--it is a realization that this is now the public square and ceding it to actively anti-civil movements is <i>bad</i> for liberalized society in general.<p>If there&#x27;s a failing of technical imagination on my part, fine. There strongly seems to be a failing of appreciation of how modern supremacist movements operate on yours. This is not a technical problem, this is a human problem. It&#x27;s a question of whether the psychic damage inflicted upon bystanders by constant and unending exposure (because that is, genuinely, what the end state here is) is worth whatever hypothetical benefit is realized by giving these parties a place from which to abuse others until they definitely, yessir, are blocked by all of them and never, ever seek to get around it to continue their abuse.<p><i>&gt; And why would I be otherwise?</i><p>Speaking frankly? Because this discussion is dominated by bad-faith types whose axe to grind is really that there&#x27;s a movement against their favorite flavors of supremacism and they generally use arguments like the one you&#x27;re putting forth as retrenchment now that the tide has turned against them. If that isn&#x27;t your bag, I appreciate that; I think you&#x27;re incorrect, but that&#x27;s separate from <i>disingenuous</i>.')
