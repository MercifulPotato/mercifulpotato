Or why companies will send you two separate letters on the same day with a small note that this is more efficient for them than collating them.<p>I assume that k8s also makes it much easier to move to a different cloud provider if you&#x27;re unhappy with one (or the new one offers better pricing). Instead of rewriting your bespoke scripts that only you understand, anyone familiar with the technology will know which modules to swap to make it work with the new provider.')
