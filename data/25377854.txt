Item(by='adwn', descendants=None, kids=[25378339], score=None, time=1607630559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25377439, text='&gt; <i>Not really an exact [...] solution</i><p>But it <i>is</i> exact.<p>&gt; <i>Not really [a] closed form solution</i><p>It&#x27;s my understanding that what is and isn&#x27;t &quot;closed form&quot; is rather arbitrary. Functions which are used frequently – like exp() – are elevated to closed form status, and yet you can&#x27;t evaluate exp() in a finite number of steps. So how is the explicit solution to the goat problem objectively different?')
