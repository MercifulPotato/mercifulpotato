She passed away a fews year after I recorded a day in the park showing here what my phone could do. And I&#x27;ll watch the shit out of those slightly grainy 30 second clips until the day I die. That camera wasn&#x27;t great and would be considered barely passable but it was in hand and it could do the job, in 2007.')
