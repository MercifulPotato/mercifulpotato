Item(by='darawk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605056019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053296, text='&gt; So you&#x27;re defending the person who is trying to explain why polls got it wrong by using polling data to show that their argument belittling the BLM protests was correct.<p>He&#x27;s not belittling them. He&#x27;s supporting them and their cause, and offering course corrective advice so that they are better able to achieve their stated goals.<p>&gt; This is ridiculous on it&#x27;s own, but also ignores things like how wrong it is to blame the protests for violence often instigated by the police<p>Violence was instigated on both sides, but regardless of what the underlying reality was, the perception was that leftists were responsible for much of the violence, and that is problematic electorally.<p>The Twitter thread you linked is exactly why the Democrats lost power this cycle. This thinking, right here:<p>&gt; And for those pointing out that Dems may have lost some House seats in conservative districts, at least in part due to BLM: If you define your party based on what you think might work in one district in Oklahoma, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>You may not like the fact that you have to think about the median Oklahoman voter, but the reality is that that voter is much <i>more</i> important than the median say, NYC voter. Because you already have NYC in the bag. Oklahoma, on the other hand, is up for grabs. Whether or not this system is how things ought to be, this is how it actually is.')
