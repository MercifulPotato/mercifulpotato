Then I just poke my head in the appropriate list whenever I want to catch up on what&#x27;s been happening in a given subject.</i><p>I&#x27;ve been doing the same (although I&#x27;ve actually been on a break from Twitter for over a year now). Care to share links to your lists?<p>BTW, it took me forever to realize that I didn&#x27;t have to follow an account in order to put it in a list. I&#x27;ve been putting off a serious pruning (several thousand) of who I follow, and I wish there were better tools for doing that pruning.')
