Frankly, I&#x27;m way too boring on the site for me to be guilty of this so I appealed 5 times over ~4 months.<p>I must have gotten through to a person eventually because I was unsuspended with the message:<p>&gt; We’re writing to let you know that we&#x27;ve unsuspended your account. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to see you back on Twitter soon.<p>&gt; A little background: we have systems that find and remove multiple automated spam accounts in bulk, and yours was flagged as spam by mistake. Please note that it may take an hour or so for your follower and following numbers to return to normal.')
