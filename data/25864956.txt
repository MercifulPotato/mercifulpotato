It&#x27;s hard to even think about &quot;schedules&quot; or anything until the summer -- over a year with minimal friendship contacts.<p>Video calls don&#x27;t work for me, and everything is closed in SF. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but video calls just don&#x27;t seem <i>real</i> to me. It does very little to energize me in my friendships. I don&#x27;t know how people do it.<p>Half my friends have taken the opportunity to move away, so they&#x27;re gone for good except for a few times a year that we travel to each other after Covid. The other half I&#x27;m desperately hoping things naturally get back to pre-covid friendship levels.')
