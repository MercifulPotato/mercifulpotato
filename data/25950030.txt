The bailout was going to be announced. Citadel didn&#x27;t want informed observers speculating on whether Citadel had just ponied up to an unhedged falling knife.<p>Otherwise, Melvin is a hedge fund. Its LPs are nervous, and assuring them the worst is over could sow doubt in would-be defectors. This could also be done by way of confidential notice, however, so on its own it isn&#x27;t enough. The other factor is, perhaps, to get the people prank calling and such off their backs. That was a stated factor for Left at Citron.')
