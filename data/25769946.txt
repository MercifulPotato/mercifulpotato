It&#x27;s actually really, really hard and people have these rules of thumb in their heads that aren&#x27;t actually correct.<p>Which gets me to wondering if we could formalize some of this stuff... (in relevant &quot;code scopes&quot;, dgmw!)<p>EDIT: If there is one thing I <i>am</i> certain about it is the fact that a <i>lot</i> of consistency can be relaxed around human interaction. It&#x27;s lossy anyway, and people <i>will</i> call you (eventually, depending on anxiety&#x2F;shyness) if you haven&#x27;t fulfilled an order. The browser is the first order of that and that&#x27;s already out of date once you show a page, so... Anyway, that&#x27;s just to say it&#x27;s amusing how much people worry about consistency on the <i>front end</i>')
