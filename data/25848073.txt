But they will need some time to play catch-up.<p>I think it raised their eyebrows a bit, but don&#x27;t agree that they need some time to play catch-up. Bottom line is the vast majority of Intel and AMD chips are running Windows. You can&#x27;t even buy Windows 10 for an ARM processor. Microsoft flirted with the idea at one point, but has pretty much abandoned it. So why would Intel or AMD market ARM chips at all when Microsoft isn&#x27;t supporting them at all?<p>If you are talking about servers that is a different story (since lots of servers run Linux). AMD already made a server with an ARM processor, the latest &quot;Opteron&quot; series was ARM <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;amd-opteron-a1100" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;amd-opteron-a1100</a> These came out in 2016 and don&#x27;t think they sold nearly as well as Epyc has. Taking a second look at offering ARM for the datacenter in the fture might not be a bad idea for AMD though.')
