Just ended up frustrated, making no more money than people coasting in the same position, and still got laid off during downsizing instead of the people who spent time playing office politics and going out to happy hour with the supervisor.<p>I feel kind of guilty now though, because I actually managed to get hired at a really good company a few years ago, but I can&#x27;t work up the motivation to put in as much effort as I did before. Now I&#x27;m the one coasting (still not schmoozing though), and see other new people making the same mistake I did.')
