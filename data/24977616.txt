Item(by='black_puppydog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604392090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976224, text='The problem (okay, &quot;a&quot; problem) here is that it is indeed OSS, and not FOSS, that is being used.<p>It might be worth re-visiting &quot;Post-Open Source&quot; by Melody Horn (boringcactus) [1] on this. You might want to copy&#x2F;paste that link instead of clicking. :)\nIt has been discussed here before [2] and (unsurprisingly, IMHO) gotten quite a bit of blow-back from the HN crowd.<p>The General Intellect Unit podcast recently had an episode on the piece [3] and I think they made the point clearer (well... also they roll the piece out to 1h 40min) by more openly posing it in a class struggle context. (Side note: please don&#x27;t post replies attacking this as communist. The podcast has &quot;marxists&quot; in the name, you wouldn&#x27;t be insulting them, and I&#x27;m merely engaging with their content, so if you&#x27;re gonna try to attack their&#x2F;my positions, please do the same and don&#x27;t just throw scary words.)<p>The bottom-line is that Open Source Software has nothing to do with the freedoms of the developers. It is...<p>* a corporate entrenchment scheme: enlarging your hiring pool by establishing your in-house solution as the industry standard, giving you full hiring pipelines and stronger negotiation position against current and prospective employees.<p>* a capitalist commons: by tending to one industry standard, the companies (not their devs, who will still have full work days) save on duplication of effort.<p>At the same time FOSS (which <i>does</i> focus on the freedoms of the devs to read, modify, learn...) kind of misses the point by being...<p>* too obvious a trap, and thus ineffective. No sane capitalist company will go anywhere near AGPL code (and we just had an example on HN of someone trying. it wasn&#x27;t pretty)<p>* ultimately not even clear on how this will make anyone&#x27;s lives materially better, even if it were effective. It&#x27;s not gonna raise your salary, nor give you more paid vacation, health insurance. As a dev, you&#x27;ll still be producing surplus value (okay, in a hopefully less alienated way) that will then not be paid to you (that&#x27;s the definition of profit) so from this perspective the &quot;F&quot; in FOSS doesn&#x27;t really bring much to the table.<p>The GIU podcast concludes that yeah, working in IT was nice for a while, because it posed some fundamental problems to capital and as a dev you were in a much better negotiation position. However, those times are over. Capital has found a way to make IT labour just as fungible as manual labor, at least to the extent that we should expect those &quot;rock star&quot; benefits to dwindle soon. Up to us to realize that and take action.<p>Again: relaying analysis here. Not sure I buy <i>all</i> of it. But even if, please keep your replies centered on the content, not the vocabulary it&#x27;s presented with.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boringcactus.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;13&#x2F;post-open-source.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boringcactus.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;13&#x2F;post-open-source.htm...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24397552" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24397552</a><p>[3]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;generalintellectunit.net&#x2F;e&#x2F;066-post-open-source&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;generalintellectunit.net&#x2F;e&#x2F;066-post-open-source&#x2F;</a>')
