You were mostly paying for the CD-ROM, but the paper magazine helped give you an idea of what was inside before you bought it.<p>I remember trying to play the content on the CD-ROMs was quite challenging. Different videos needed different video players to be installed. Or the latest version of a particular video player. Some of them needed more memory than my PC had. You had to have a relatively high end PC to play all the content, and I always had a low end PC.<p>But there was no other way to get that kind of content onto my PC. Download speeds were horrible. Connections were unreliable. Some of the download methods used required me to start over at the beginning when the download failed in the middle after 15 minutes. It was challenging.<p>Did I mention I had to walk to Tower Records in the snow, uphill both ways?')
