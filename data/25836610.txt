Item(by='yongjik', descendants=None, kids=[25837621], score=None, time=1611080158, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836197, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not at all sympathetic to the &quot;we have to crush this viewpoint&quot; camp since they amplified Hillary&#x27;s claims of a &quot;stolen election&quot; for years.<p>Clinton never claimed the <i>counting</i> of the votes were rigged, and I know of no serious politician claiming that Clinton should be installed as president because of the claimed Russian meddling, whether they believed it or not.<p>So, on one hand, we have a candidate who was pretty much dropped like a hot potato by fellow Democrats the moment she lost the election.  On the other hand, we have mainstream media giving hundreds of hours of coverage to a president insisting he actually won the election, when all evidence says he didn&#x27;t.  ...And you&#x27;re saying who is censored?')
