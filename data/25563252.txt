Outside, the man jumped into a black Dodge Challenger as officers drew their firearms and told him to stop, but he took off, causing an officer to jump out of the way, the report states. He crashed into the back of a patrol car and a column outside the hotel before speeding out onto Route 9, an officer wrote.</i><p>Not sure how you characterize that as &quot;shoplifting&quot;. They had already questioned him about the shoplifting, without pulling their guns. It was the escape, driving at the officers, and ramming that got the guns pulled.')
