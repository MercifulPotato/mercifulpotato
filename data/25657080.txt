It may be the top position with high pay, but a CEO is so high up the food-chain that they touch very little.<p>Funny then how the CEO is the right level to take that high pay, which is generally defended as compensation for the ultimate responsibility.<p>Either the CEO is responsible for what happens under his reign, or he isn&#x27;t. If he is, why shouldn&#x27;t he shoulder the blame for the bad parts; if he isn&#x27;t, why should he be paid for the good parts?')
