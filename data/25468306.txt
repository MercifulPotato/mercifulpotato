More often than not, when I send someone a link to a thread, Twitter decides to show only the first post or few. There&#x27;s a link to see the rest of the thread but there is zero indication as to whether this link will reveal 1 or 2 or 1,000 further posts. I forget the exact text, but it&#x27;s something small like &quot;See replies&quot; or similar. A plain link, no icon.
