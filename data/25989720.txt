What I mean by that is that certain actions in the flow of command result in states that depend on previous interactions.<p>For example, how does Uber test their driver dispatch system, and corresponding notifications on the part of users when the driver is getting close to their pickup location? In here, the behavior of the application depends on the driver accepting a request, starting his ride, etc.<p>I find it difficult to reproduce situations where the previous &#x27;flow&#x27; affects the current state of the application and it&#x27;s expected behavior.<p>Hope I was able to explain my difficulties clearly.<p>Thank you!')
