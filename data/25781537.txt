If your country hasn&#x27;t built a working public nuclear power plant in several decades, at what point should we switch from &quot;could&quot; to &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot;? The UK built several in the 1960s, now we have one in progress built by France, which is 10x more expensive, overbudget, delayed, and I wouldn&#x27;t be certain of it ever being finished until I see it.<p>Last time I looked, the USA was in a similar position. Hasn&#x27;t started building one in at least 40 years[1] and the one I saw on that list finishing in 1990 (Seabrook) I thought might be more recent, says it was permitted in 1976, took 14 years to get Unit 1 working and Unit 2 was cancelled due to delays, and cost overruns. That&#x27;s the kind of thing I&#x27;m talking about.<p>The current 92 of them provided 20% of the USA&#x27;s electricity generation. So you&#x27;d need another 368 to do the other 80%. How long will they take to build, 15 years each? 55 years to go all nuclear, assuming you build ten at a time. How do you get from &quot;we haven&#x27;t built a nuclear power plant in 40 years&quot; to &quot;we could build 10 at a time continuously for the next half-century&quot; in a convincing way?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nuclear_power_in_the_United_States#Nuclear_power_plants" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nuclear_power_in_the_United_St...</a>')
