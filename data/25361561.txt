Let me give two examples of obstacle. US has monopoly in the software tools that engineer use to design IC. Japan has the chemical that semiconductor fab foundry need to make IC. US now has slapped sanction on China&#x27;s top fab foundry SMIC with intention to kill China&#x27;s semiconductor industry. China&#x27;s semiconductor companies&#x27;s stocks are dropping stone while Taiwan semiconductor companies&#x27;s stock are rising like crazy so a lot people are pessimistic about semiconductor companies in China. Semiconductor is a very expensive game to play. China has big domestic market but it is not large enough to sustain a semiconductor business. This is very different from other industries.')
