Standardized parts and a well defined firmware interface (and thus &quot;standard&quot; bootloaders instead of a multitude like on ARM) is what makes the PC truly special. Moving to a world where you can&#x27;t install Linux or where every single machine has incompatible firmware would be disastrous, IMHO. \nCurrent PCs can last for decades thanks to modern Windows and Linux being able to boot on old machines, without the need of special bootloaders or new firmware, just somewhat generic drivers (see AHCI, Intel HDA sound, etc)')
