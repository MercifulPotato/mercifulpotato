Not sure I have any empathy for the contempt at all. I just don&#x27;t buy this sob story what-so-ever.<p>I feel even less bad for violent extremists that have zero goals or demands except to destabilize everything because they believe whatever they see on the internet. There is no ideology for them to defend; only their right to hate. They only want the ability to have whatever they believe to be true to be the case even when it is not the case.<p>Ironically, if the people who were truly destitute and down-trodden could find some way to ignore the superficial partisanship that they&#x27;ve been sold and unite under social and economic policy we might have an actual movement on our hands. Unfortunately they&#x27;ve all been convinced that their superficial differences aren&#x27;t superficial at all and that the other side is wrong; now it appears at any cost.')
