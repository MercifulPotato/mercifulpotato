I can&#x27;t recall any others running currently because some of them might&#x27;ve become defunct and&#x2F;or I&#x27;ve forgotten about them. I wonder what the appeal of the name is nowadays.<p>(I have seen Terminator and am familiar with the origins of the name)<p>I should clarify: It is another company&#x27;s trademark or whatever as far as I know (again, could be wrong. Don&#x27;t know how Disney litigates things in this domain).<p>Again, I could also be wrong about this not being the only thing called Skynet in the past few years.<p>I welcome responses!')
