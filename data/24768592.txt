The cheapest one has the possibility of being &quot;throttled&quot; AT ANY TIME there is congestion on the local towers. The mid-tier has no throttling until you have used at least 22 GB in a month on a line. The highest tier has no throttling until you have used at least 75 GB in a month on a line.&quot;<p>from 2019:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.verizonwireless.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;4G-LTE-LTE-Advanced&#x2F;Data-Throttling-All-day-every-day&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;1104441" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.verizonwireless.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;4G-LTE-LTE-Advanced...</a>')
