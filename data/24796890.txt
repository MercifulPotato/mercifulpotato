We didn&#x27;t have 3D printing as an option back then and I don&#x27;t think it makes any sense even today. Sure, for prototyping it is valuable but even then we would make prototypes from the actual process (CNC) because then we can test the mechanical properties.<p>Most people think prototyping is holding the part in the hand and seeing how it looks. Perhaps if youre doing ergo work.<p>If 3D printing can go through rigorous process of understanding variation, void forming, failure modes, repeatability and reproducibility tests, sure it can be used. My question is - why? Perhaps a part can be made so that it saves so much weight with its shape that is not easily machinable. Then it makes sense. There are so many hurdles.<p>In some ways, 3D printed parts are considered &quot;composite&quot;. It would need to go through some rigor as some of the theory&#x2F;proceedings laid out in a book like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;ICAF-2019-Manufacturing-Proceedings-International&#x2F;dp&#x2F;3030215024" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;ICAF-2019-Manufacturing-Proceedings-I...</a><p>It is very much under study and scrutiny.')
