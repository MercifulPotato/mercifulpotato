I mostly hear it from well-off friends.<p>There is an American aristocracy. They live on inherited wealth, have never connected to the common person and are a scourge.<p>But there are people whose compensation is tied to productivity growth. And there are people who are not. Getting those of us making six or seven figures, with health insurance and a retirement portfolio, looking to buying a house and having kids, to find common policy with someone constantly facing foreclosure, who may not have a bank account, whose kid is struggling with opioid addiction and canâ€™t afford to fight an illegal parking ticket issued by their dying town will be hard.<p>Put another way, we have Americans who feel they need to fight to survive. And we have Americans who feel they need to fight to thrive. Those result in different policy priorities.')
