It seems like three months is pretty typical. When someone gets six months most people call them &quot;lucky&quot;. When someone gets a year people call it &quot;unheard of&quot;. No whether that&#x27;s fair or not is anyone&#x27;s guess.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting take from the point of view of the USA. They address international DropBox employees in passing in the letter.  For Mexico, by law companies have to pay 3 months severance when they decide to lay off an employee. Sometimes, when the person is fired for having bad performance the company can negotiate for less than that.  In theory when an employee is fired for some cause attributable to him, the company doesn&#x27;t have to pay the severance but the burden of proof is in the company, and it is very difficult to prove so.<p>That &quot;at will&quot; employment culture in the USA looks crazy ruthless for someone living with these protections.')
