Consider the new york times online.<p>I gave an example elsewhere that the owner of a physical bulletin board wouldn&#x27;t be liable for posters on it, even if they occasionally came by and took down ones that they felt should be removed (for any reason).<p>Section 230 claims that internet sites are more like a physical bulletin board then a newspaper, in that they are remove-later, not review-first models.
