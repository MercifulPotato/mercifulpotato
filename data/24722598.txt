The instruction cache also typically has to deal with  caching micro-ops. I believe L2 and beyond store both instructions and data. There&#x27;s also cache associativity, where the the same location in memory can be stores in one of N locations, which can differ per level. I think L1 caches are typically more associative because that takes extra silicon per byte. It looks like Zen 2 at least has an 8 way associative L1 cache.')
