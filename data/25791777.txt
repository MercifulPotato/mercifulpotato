That means that Google must pay for all news links. It couldn&#x27;t, for example, decide to partner with some news orgs and not others. It also couldn&#x27;t just remove news altogether. The penalties proposed are also insane. Billions if I recall.<p>Which then leaves them with either effectively being held hostage to pulling search entirely as described here.')
