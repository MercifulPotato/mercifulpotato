They are not specially strong and they may be consumed by the monks. In fact, like for the wine where a lot of monastery produced and developed the basis for modern wine production, it as a bit similar in Belgium for the beers.\nTake Orval for example, one of the most famous and it have 6.2% alcohol level. A draft pils beer in Belgium is expected to be around 5%-5.5%. And a few monasteries produced and keep producing beers in Belgium without being Trappist labeled like the Dominicans in Liege with their Sanctus Dominicus.<p>Besides the rules to give the Trappist label were :<p>* The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.<p>* The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life.<p>* The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds. Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trappist_beer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trappist_beer</a>')
