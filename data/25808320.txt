The huge corporations who ultimately want to take control of the population have realised that, and are using that excuse to get in bit by bit.<p>But in reality, DoH doesn&#x27;t really provide &quot;more security.&quot;<p>All it does is obfuscate DNS queries.  If you&#x27;re concerned about ISP tracking, DoH doesn&#x27;t really help with that <i>at all</i> since the ISP can see where you&#x27;re going just by looking at packet headers anyway.<p>And the Googles and Facebooks of the world <i>love</i> DoH because it bypasses PiHole style ad&#x2F;tracking blockers.<p>The appropriate solution is to use PiHole (or PiHole style blocklists) in concert with a <i>local</i> recursive resolver (or an external resolver that supports DNS-Crypt), not to obfuscate your DNS requests, allowing all the ads&#x2F;tracking&#x2F;spying connections to proliferate.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect solution, but it&#x27;s a much better solution than needing to implement one or more ad&#x2F;tracker blocking solutions on <i>every single device</i> on your network.')
