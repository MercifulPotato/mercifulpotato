Is there any fundamental issue with using one of these things to share a link to a menu or something? Many restaurants are trying to avoid menus it seems (which makes sense) and I could see a QR code making this easier for people.<p>I don&#x27;t like the idea that my OS&#x2F;browser history basically knows everything about me, but I don&#x27;t really see how visiting a menu is a serious problem, given that the same systems also generally have my location data too... Is the concern that people who visit restaurants are much more likely to be spreaders of COVID? Could just looking at a menu (implying visiting the restaurant) be enough to implicate me of something?<p>I&#x27;m just left wondering in all this mess. Who watches the watchmen?')
