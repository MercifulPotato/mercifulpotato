Item(by='cabraca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603733304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24898202, text='&gt; It&#x27;s ridiculous to say that Asian Americans have experienced anything near the racism that black people have in the United States. I don&#x27;t think they should even be included in the conversion when talking about racism. The racism they experience is mostly prejudice-type racism, not systemic.<p>How much more systemic can you get than an Executive Order?\nSure, it wasn&#x27;t to the same degree as for black people, but shouldn&#x27;t it have an effect? At least a little?<p>&gt; If it&#x27;s so easy for black people to get out of the cycle, why don&#x27;t they?<p>Yeah, why don&#x27;t they? Check the biography of every black celebrity. Everyone chose to get their shit together early in their life or was supported by the parents. EVERYONE! ICE T by joining the military to support his daughter. Samuel L. Jackson was sent to LA by his mother before anything bad could happen after a tip from the FBI.<p>At some point personal responsibility has to come into play.')
