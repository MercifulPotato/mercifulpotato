Police escalated during protests, then when it got too hot, they pulled a LA Riots style retreat.  Protesters became violent and undercut the moral fiber of their message, going from patriots to criminals very quickly.<p>My understanding was the police decided to withdraw from the area due to the intensity.  It looks like the Seattle people rejected law enforcement, but weren&#x27;t trying to overthrow the government.<p>Not all violence is equal.  Overthrowing the US federal government because you didn&#x27;t win is very different than CHAZ.  Both can be disgusting while acknowledging that FEDERAL INSURRECTION AND ATTACKING DEMOCRACY IS WORSE THAN CHAZ.')
