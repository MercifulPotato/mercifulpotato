Otherwise, when the default value is changed, previously compiled callers will use a different value than declared by the callee. Compiling the default value into the caller is a problem in C++, and (IIRC) in Swift. In other words, (positional) default parameters should act like syntactic sugar for equivalent method overloads. And then actual overloads provide more flexibility for the callee implementation because it doesnâ€™t <i>have</i> to represent the default case as a special in-band value.')
