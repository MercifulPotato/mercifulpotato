You could take that same energy and help the victims instead. I doubt whoever suffered whatever violence it was that merited 13 years has forgotten the whole thing by now. I doubt they&#x27;re stoked to see their attacker off to start a cushy new job. You don&#x27;t get 13 years for something trivial.* If after that time you find it to get a job, well, you kinda have to wear that.<p>*for non-violent stuff, like drugs, obviously you can. I&#x27;m referring to this specific example, which is described as violent. Non-violence shouldn&#x27;t impact your future in the same way.')
