I work with quite a few above-average and bright guys. Even something as simple as &quot;you make this module, you make this module, I make this module and they all communicate through this core interface&quot; is far from trivial. In something like Scrum, the emphasis seems to be more on &quot;everyone works on this little piece of this module&quot;, which bloats the communication overhead required and I get into the same problem you describe: implementation details need to be made concrete much faster, as now people need to know them to proceed instead of a general idea what data they&#x27;ll be getting.<p>NB: I know this is not specific to Scrum, and Scrum does not enforce this. Yet I can&#x27;t help but feel there is some sort of correlation.')
