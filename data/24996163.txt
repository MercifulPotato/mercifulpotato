For myself, I dislike pollsters and mainstream media, so I will say that my vote is not information I share. For my friends and family, they&#x27;ll blatantly lie in an (probably vein) attempt to throw off the numbers.<p>There is a huge distrust of media in the US, and pollsters are seen as part of that. I do think there is some component to bias influencing the election and how polls can be either manipulated or withheld to manipulate that.<p>Personally, I think we&#x27;d be better off politically without pollsters and less polarized without the media complex.')
