There are plenty of women who choose not to reproduce, others who actually have standards and don&#x27;t want to lower them to reproduce with just anyone, and yet others who are asocial, antisocial, or have a variety of psychological issues that make them unlikely to partner up with anyone.  Same with men.<p><i>&quot;If you are going to have a son, and you know he&#x27;s not going to be the most handsome guy, don&#x27;t have a son. Otherwise you&#x27;re a trash human being pushing a lifetime of suffering on another human due to no fault of his own&quot;</i><p>Oh, please.
