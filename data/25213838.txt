Their current model is based around the classic three-tier app (basically Ruby on Rails) no matter how much web applications have changed since then.<p>Heroku still doesn&#x27;t have any data hosting options. You have to go to a third party for this.<p>Heroku doesn&#x27;t have any static site hosting options. You have to go to a third party.<p>But the biggest problem I have with Heroku&#x27;s model is how much I need to pay. I&#x27;ve been a Heroku customer for years and I&#x27;m still not exactly sure what a dyno is. And if I get it wrong, I can have auto-scaling... but only if I&#x27;m paying a minimum of <i>$250 per month</i>. Now that&#x27;s not a lot to big companies, but for bootstrappers that&#x27;s insane. And I only get 2.5GB of RAM for that $250&#x2F;mo? And if I&#x27;m using microservices, every service costs me a minimum of $25&#x2F;mo, $250&#x2F;mo if I want auto-scaling on those services.<p>Like I said, Heroku is great and I use it in production and pay them money every month, but man if it&#x27;s not stuck in 2015. Luckily so is my application so I don&#x27;t have too many issues except for the ridiculous cost even as EC2 is <i>dramatically</i> cheaper now than it used to be (does Heroku support Graviton? I don&#x27;t think it does), but PaaS in general is &quot;the old way of doing cloud&quot; and Heroku is becoming less relevant every day.')
