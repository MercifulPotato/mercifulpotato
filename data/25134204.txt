Having an effective discussion over email is actively painful and worse yet no one can refer back to your detailed documentation later.<p>Good on you for communicating. Personally I&#x27;ve found that details are great, but being able to distill that core message down to a quick code really helps. Call it an elevator pitch, sound bite or whatever but it is really transformative. So much communication seems to be just passing along a historically linear repeat of facts rather than helping reader by distilling down.')
