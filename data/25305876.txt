This is different from desktops, where additional pixels can be used to add screen real-estate.<p>All of those additional pixels require additional battery and CPU power to drive. By contrast, black-levels, backlit-uniformity, color accuracy, and pixel fill can be improved without those trade-offs. Most laptops have a lot of room for improvement in these areas, and IMO they lead to a better picture overall versus increasing the resolution. As a bonus, you also get to side-step a lot of unfortunate software scaling weirdness!<p>And while adding HDR and increasing the refresh rate <i>does</i> come with battery&#x2F;CPU&#x2F;software trade-offs, I <i>still</i> think they&#x27;re more worthwhile upgrades than merely jacking up the resolution on a small screen.<p>I have no idea whether the Pangolin screens are terrible on these metrics too, I&#x27;d just like to see a lot less focus on resolution. It&#x27;s actually really hard (impossible?) to find an HDR panel that isn&#x27;t 4K, and IMO that&#x27;s a shame. We live in a world where Samsung phones run below their native screen resolution by default in order to conserve battery[1], which makes no sense whatsoever. If the native resolution of the screen was lower to begin with, battery life would be even <i>better,</i> and the everything would <i>look</i> better overall due to lack of scaling!<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;samsung-lowers-default-screen-resolution-smartphones-to-save-battery-life-2019-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;samsung-lowers-default-scree...</a>')
