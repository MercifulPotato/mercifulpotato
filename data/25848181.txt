It shows moral corruption. It&#x27;s not corruption in the legal sense but outlines the issue of why the pardons do not make sense.<p>ex-POTUS is still an influential individual and is just profiting after the binds of the position are lifted.<p>I think it would be a pretty nice decree to disallow the president to become extremely wealthy X years after presidency.
