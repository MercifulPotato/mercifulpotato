They don&#x27;t make much more than minimum wage in many cases.  That&#x27;s how daycare can remain somewhat affordable...economies of scale.<p>Even your own source of care.com has a &quot;Nanny Share&quot; program that reduces the cost more.  Without sharing, full time care (40 hrs a week) for 2 kids in my area is $16 an hour...which is less than 2 bucks more than minimum wage.  $17.65 an hour if its 3 kids.  Certainly not three times the $14.65 an hour that is for a single kid.')
