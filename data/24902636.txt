I have been working at my current job for about 7 months. I am the front end developer for a chain of retail outlets in Denver. I work on our website, our customer facing kiosks, and our POS systems. There are only two other developers and one of them has become a nightmare and is making it impossible to work there. I have been verbally abused, belittled, blamed for things that weren&#x27;t my fault, had my accomplishments diminished and taken credit for.<p>The guy is well known for this kind of behavior. I&#x27;m not the only person that has had a problem with him but it&#x27;s just excused as &quot;the way he is.&quot; After yet another round of it I sent screenshots of our conversation to our boss and was told &quot;that&#x27;s just how we communicate around here. He told me to go fuck myself just last week.&quot; I&#x27;m afraid of losing my job if I report him. We just moved here and are still not quite on our financial feet after some personal disasters last year. How should i proceed? Just suck it up until i find a new job?')
