How? Because, there will be a rise in number of drivers, due to it being more profitable now. This will lead to more drivers sitting idle at any given time. Overall incomes will initially decrease and then slowly come back to current incomes as an equilibrium is reached. In the end we&#x27;ll have more drivers, each earning the same as now. I don&#x27;t think the goal of minimum wage can be achieved by raising prices.')
