The lack of it is big WTF.<p>It gives you 100% control over when you&#x27;re talking and you don&#x27;t have to alt-tab between programs in order to &quot;mute&quot; yourself.<p>You can bind it to e.g MOUSE3 (scroll-push) and it works fine with other programs, games and stuff. Switching between muted&#x2F;unmuted is different thing.<p>From somebody who uses&#x2F;used ventrilo, mumble, teamspeak and nowadays discord for like last 12 years for hours per day, almost everyday.')
