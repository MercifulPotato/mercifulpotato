Also (EDIT) I wonder if it&#x27;s maybe more about the risk of epileptic seizures (which are a legal liability) than the bugs - to quote from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameinformer.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-psa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameinformer.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-epile...</a> , &quot;[...] V will be given a headset that is meant to onset the instance. The headset fits over both eyes and features a rapid onslaught of white and red blinking LEDs, much like the actual device neurologists use in real life to trigger a seizure when they need to trigger one for diagnosis purposes&quot;. That sounds like a really bad design decision if you ask me...<p>Then again, CD Projekt is a relatively small developer, and Sony would probably think twice before treating a game by say, EA, the same way, so I wouldn&#x27;t completely rule out double standards...')
