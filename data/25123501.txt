Item(by='neurostimulant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605619923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118520, text='Docker compose is certainly enough for personal use, but if you ever want your apps to be available during update process (on docker compose you&#x27;ll have to shut down your app container before you can update it), it&#x27;s very easy to setup a basic blue&#x2F;green deployment using the readiness probe option in kubernetes.<p>Also, kubernetes load balancer is pretty easy to setup and plays well with multiple services and letsencrypt. On docker compose, I&#x27;ll have to either use nginx and update it everytime I add more apps or use something like traefik if I want a load balancer that can read configuration from app&#x27;s label. On kubernetes you simply specify several lines of ingress definition in your yaml file, which is not too complex for a typical app.')
