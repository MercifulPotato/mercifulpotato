It&#x27;s like saying &quot;you are what you eat&quot;, which is mostly nonsensical.<p>Exercising your brain causes structural changes, whereby neuronal circuity is &quot;rewired&quot; to create more optimal paths. Stroke victim recovery is functional, in which parts of the brain take over responsibilities for what was damaged (but it&#x27;s not &quot;transferred&quot;, you still need to learn it all over again).<p>Neither, however, somehow magically define you as a person just because your brain decided some optimizations would help with repetitive tasks or worst-case decided cortical remapping was necessary to recover from injury.')
