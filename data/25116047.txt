The point of DKIM is, first and foremost, to fight spam. The non-repudiation aspect is, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, a side effect of DKIM, not a core feature.<p>The more I think about it the more I inch towards agreeing with TFA. If I need my email to be authenticated I can sign them with GPG. If the law enforcement needs to see if I did or did not send an email they can subpoena Google.<p>&gt;Non-repudiation over time is a truly powerful property of DKIM&#x27;d email for a great many uses outside of blackmail.<p>Can you expand on this? I can&#x27;t really come up with a use case that wouldn&#x27;t be about associating somebody with an email they may want to distantiate themselves from.')
