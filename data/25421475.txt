It wasn’t all that bad, but I wouldn’t say that it was very well insulated either. It was OK if you just wanted to heat one room, though I did have a decent collection of fleece sweaters and whatever. Actually, The warm summers were rough because there was no cooling, and most of my clothes were designed for cold, damp weather.')
