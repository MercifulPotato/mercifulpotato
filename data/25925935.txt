Granted I never posted anything that attacked people but I did clean up my FB that I haven&#x27;t used for years to post&#x2F;browse. Deleting stuff, hiding images, etc...<p>Also try not to be doxable in general but sucks like when YT forces you to use your actual name in comments otherwise changing it would change it in email. Can make another account too. At least the comments I don&#x27;t think are indexed publicly.<p>That&#x27;s always fun finding dumb things you posted online as a kid.')
