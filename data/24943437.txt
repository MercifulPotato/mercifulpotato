Not to mention that fences then stop movement of other animals(also including wolves) which has massive impacts on ecosystems. Also, if you ever had a dog, you know that no kind of fence will stop a sufficiently determined dog unless you make it out of solid metal and 10ft tall(and even then my dog would just dig under it, so be prepared to have to bury it few feet under the ground too).')
