And all the downstream &quot;brands&quot; that assemble this technology into a plastic cases to sell to consumers can only do so much to differentiate. They also sell TVs, etc. and have thousands of other SKUs, so they really don&#x27;t care about any individual product.<p>Apple is both incentivized (due to their ongoing customer relationships) and able to break out of this mold because they:<p>a) Produce a tighter number of SKUs<p>and<p>b) Do enough volume to control and change what the original equipment manufacturers are producing')
