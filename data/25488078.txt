In every job, the first thing I have to learn is how I&#x27;m allowed to write C or C++ at the company, since each provides such a huge surface.<p>The difference between C&#x2F;C++ and Lisp&#x2F;D is, I think, not language flexibility.  They are all incredibly complex and flexible languages in their own way.  The difference is funding and critical mass.  C and C++ persist because companies pay people to use them and to improve them.  Or, in terms of the curse essay, companies pay people to cooperate.  The result is an enduring dominance.  Those languages work better because more people use and improve them, so they stay relevant.  Neither Lisp nor D seem to benefit significantly from that, so you have what is left: people without the time or interest in producing truly polished solutions.')
