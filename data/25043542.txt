It enables collaboration features that are really useful, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pernos.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;browser" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pernos.co&#x2F;about&#x2F;browser</a><p>Resource utilization is also an issue. To accelerate the debugging experience we build huge databases of all program states. You can&#x27;t run Pernosco on your laptop.<p>Having said that, we understand the trust issue, we are very open to offering an on-premises version of Pernosco and we are keen to talk to people interested in that.')
