WhatsApp was using battle-tested technology (ejabberd, XMPP) and <i>removing</i> things that didn&#x27;t make sense to them (federation). Moxie had one trick (end-to-end encryption) and wanted to build a whole messaging platform around that. Instead of standing in shoulders of giants, he chose to ignore all the lessons from the past and do everything from scratch out of the belief that he can do better.<p>At some point, these systems break.  In Signal&#x27;s case, this point has been reached.')
