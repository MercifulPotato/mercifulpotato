And then she&#x27;s delusional enough to think that she can misbehave and make ultimatums?<p>The article links to a &quot;landmark study&quot; that shows that black women are underrepresented in training datasets and therefore misclassified more. Sure, that&#x27;s important to fix, but it sounds like an undergraduate project, and it&#x27;s not something I would call AI.')
