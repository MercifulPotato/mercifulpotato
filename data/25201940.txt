Finance shops have tried their hand at Kaggle before, but I think they&#x27;ve normally been out of their domain. e.g. Two Sigma recently did a reinforcement learning game competition.<p>I&#x27;d caution the HN crowd not to expect production-level quant models out of this, like I&#x27;m seeing some doing in the comments already. Kagglers are excellent machine learning practitioners and the models that come out of many competitions are top-notch stuff, often making their way into research papers. But this is a short competition on limited data in a non-real-world scenario. The winning models will be very interesting educational exercises and probably wonderful recruiting material for Jane Street, but won&#x27;t be the underpinnings of a new fund.<p>That said, I can&#x27;t wait to see what comes out of this one. It ticks all of my competitive boxes :)')
