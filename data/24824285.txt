The app&#x27;s purpose is born out of the necessity to meet and converse with others while preserving privacy and comfort.<p>I wanted to create a safe virtual space for people to connect without worrying about how they look and what they might see. I also didn’t want to sacrifice the visual cues that help human beings communicate in more meaningful ways.<p>You’ll speak as you normally do, and through your webcam, you’ll animate an avatar with your movements. Users you chat with will hear you and only see your avatar.<p>I built the app by integrating Pose Animator (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yemount&#x2F;pose-animator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yemount&#x2F;pose-animator</a>), which processes camera frames in-browser and animates SVG characters, with the codebase of a side project.<p>Future direction:<p>- Higher fidelity and more diverse avatars<p>- 3d virtual space for immersive experience<p>- Spatial audio<p>Built with Elixir + Phoenix LiveView + Alpine.js + TailwindCSS + WebRTC.<p>Looking forward to your feedback!')
