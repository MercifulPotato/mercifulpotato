But that&#x27;s actually the 5700XT, which is 4.5x as popular as the RX5700 non-XT. The RX5700 is not as widely available in the first place if my understanding is correct.<p>But yeah Nvidia in general has got the market for gamers pretty much cornered. People will go for Nvidia all the time if the price is the same ballpark. But it still has ways to go before it comes even close to its predecessors in the RTX 2080 and the RTX 2080 Super, both of which are about as popular as the RX5700XT.')
