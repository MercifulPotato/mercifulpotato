For a while I was doing a lot of work with automated abductive reasoning, specifically using Parsimonious Covering Theory. And I still think abduction is something important to incorporate, but recently I&#x27;ve gone back and started (re)-learning some of the basics around logical inference: forward and backward chaining for inference on FOL, unification, skolemization, resolution, magic sets, etc., using Prolog, OPS5, yadda, yadda. I&#x27;m just about at the point of wanting to try implementing a simple inference engine or two using forward chaining, backward chaining, etc. as a learning exercise for myself.<p>No real project to link to at the moment. I&#x27;ve just been doing a lot of reading and thinking, not much coding. But hopefully there will be code soon. But, at least for now, it&#x27;ll just be re-implementing well-known stuff for didactic purposes.')
