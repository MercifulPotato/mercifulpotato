That was the least of my concerns while I was in that dystopian dump.</i><p>* I watched a man push another man into the street. The man pushed into the street drew a knife on the first man. This was around noon (we were out for lunch), in broad daylight. McAllister &amp; Leavenworth<p>* I was openly approached to buy what was most likely not legal drugs. (I was noping out of there and trying to position myself between him &amp; my now-finacée as fast as possible, so I couldn&#x27;t really tell you.) ~10:30p, 8th &amp; Folsom.<p>* Not <i>technically</i> SF, but a man entered the Caltrain car I was on screaming obscenities, muttering to himself, and making death threats to those in the car simply for looking at him. Sometime in the evening, slightly north of MTV. I believe he was detained at MTV.<p>Not to say I&#x27;ve not seen other stuff in other cities. But, &quot;never felt unsafe anywhere in SF&quot; … yeah, no. Esp. around Civic center, it&#x27;s <i>super</i> sketch. (That said, the original &quot;lawless&quot; and &quot;dangerous to enter into&quot; comment is also overboard. SF is a fine city, parts of it are quite nice. But there are parts where you should have your wits about you, too.)')
