You have to Foster a culture where people don&#x27;t treat politics like religion. When the culture doesn&#x27;t give undue attention to self important people who wear suits and ties, then the incentive structure changes how news is produced to fit that environment. But if we just treat issues like these as engineering problems, tweaking variables to fit a broken environment without considering the human aspect, the system simply won&#x27;t support whatever improvements we try to make.')
