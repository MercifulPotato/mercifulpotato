Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611101897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840580, text='&gt; I wish these folks trashing apple spent even 10% of their effort on the cheapo android phone companies.<p>And here we&#x27;re back to that magic word, whataboutism.<p>The Android Market is largely dominated by Samsung and a bunch of Chinese players (Huawei, OPPO, Xiaomi, One Plus, etc.). I haven&#x27;t seen people use a Google phone since forever. Samsung has already left China, and is only involving the Chinese supply chain at an arms&#x27; length. The other firms will continue their abhorrent practices anyways.<p>The point of the article is that Apple, being an American company, constantly extolling about virtuous they are, took a bit too long to shift. Sure, it&#x27;s justifiable and even inevitable to take that long. But people tend to hold trillion dollar American companies to a much higher standard than they do a bunch of Chinese copycats. Yes, they should hold Google to the same standards too if it happened, but it would be impossible to do anything against the Chinese firms but fart in the wind since they practically don&#x27;t care enough to change.')
