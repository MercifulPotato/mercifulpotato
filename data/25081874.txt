That should be subtracted from their operating costs and only then compared to what they charge for the storage. My guess is that they&#x27;ll make quite a killing on the thing, as a whole.<p>Even besides the morally questionable aspects (of the data mining), considering their position and leverage they might very well be slapped with some anti-trust rulings in the future.<p>Unlikely to happen in the US, since the meaning of anti-trust there has been systematically eroded and limited to where it has become all but a complete farce (compared to its original meaning&#x2F;intentions). However, that&#x27;s what you get when large corporations can pump vast amounts of money into politics, as if they were a voting citizen. But there is still some hope in other places. Either way, it shouldn&#x27;t take rocket science to see how Google has a tremendous (unfair) advantage over any competition in this regard (which is what anti-trust really is about; not just avoiding&#x2F;regulating absolute monopolies).')
