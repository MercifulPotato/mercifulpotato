I can see an argument for this for Uber, because of the network effects. But I cannot see an argument for this for Google Photos, because the network effects are not that strong, and the capital costs are directly proportional to how many users you have. (You don&#x27;t need to scale our your datacenter&#x2F;cloud until you actually have users to justify doing so.)<p>So while I agree this can be an issue in general, I&#x27;m not seeing the argument for it here. I think it would actually be relatively easy for a competitor to get started in this space.')
