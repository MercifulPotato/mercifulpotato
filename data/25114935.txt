Then a couple of weeks ago started using beancount, with the emacs mode.<p>So far I&#x27;m still far more comfortable in vim and the terminal -- even, for instance, switching back to my terminal to do `bean-check` rather than doing it within emacs itself. I could see myself keeping my use of emacs pretty limited like this indefinitely, and still finding it useful - I&#x27;m unlikely to give up these uses of emacs. Maybe over a long enough time horizon emacs will feel a bit less strange to me and I&#x27;ll find more places it fits a niche, or maybe not. Either way, it&#x27;s a nice addition to my tool set, and I&#x27;ll be curious to see where I land with in in a year or so.')
