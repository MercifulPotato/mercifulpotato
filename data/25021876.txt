If it were not political, reform in the prison system could absolutely be achieved.<p>The vast majority of Americans would accept reforms to Healthcare if each law were not hugely politicized. For example, some Republican voters accept or reject literally the same policy when it&#x27;s presented by different sides of the aisle.<p>Americans would overwhelmingly accept some kind of Amnesty for children of migrants, and &#x27;some kind&#x27; of program for others if - on the other side of the aisle - there were serious reforms and enhancements to ensure border integrity. Any attempt to offer amnesty would probably be weaponized by Republicans and Fox for political points.<p>The majority of Americans believe that fetus&#x2F;babies that are viable in the 3rd trimester (i.e. could be born premature) should not be up for abortion. But that &#x27;the day of conception&#x27; isn&#x27;t really tantamount to life. But the extremists won&#x27;t allow for any common ground.<p>Even on business tax, income tax - if you actually put numbers together, there are plans that are very popular, but rejected by one radical side or another.<p>Left wing Governor Cuomo, and Far Left Wing Mayor Deblasio pushed hard for the Amazon deal for NYC, but AOC et. al. really pushed to kill it even though the majority of her constituents (ever people of colour) wanted it. Amazons investment in NYC, while controversial, was quite popular - but killed by more radical voices.<p>Popular political systems tend to promote and highlight the more extreme views, this is amplified in the press with arguing talking heads.<p>AOC, Donald Trump get <i>huge</i> attention for the loud, bombastic, contrarian positions they take. In politics &#x27;attention&#x27; is everything, that&#x27;s their currency. They are not incented to &#x27;govern well&#x27; they are incented to &#x27;get &gt;50% of the votes&#x27; which they do so by making a lot of noise, and spinning everything their opponents do against them.<p>It takes a lot of maturity, a lot of credibility in systems to get away from that.<p>Go ahead and have a look at the politics of Germany, they have some English language sites. They have some <i>actual</i> Nazis over there, and yet, somehow, the news and debate is still deftly boring. It&#x27;s really amazing. Angela Merkel, possibly my favorite politician, has to be the most &#x27;opposite&#x27; to Donald Trump imaginable. Coalition governments have a lot to do with that as well.')
