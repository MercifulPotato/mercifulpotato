I managed to get it halfway working on ish, but it’s just not there, so as of now, I use the shellfish ssh app, that allows to sync folders, through WireGuard also.<p>Note that I use syncthing for the casual read only &quot;important documents&quot;, such as ID copies, tax documents,  ebooks, etc. I don’t sync photos, movies and such.\nMost editable documents are in git repos.<p>I sometimes work on my iPad, and then I use a ssh client or the ish app (a shell, with vim, etc).<p>I have used this setup for years, and it’s just low friction, low maintenance for me. I have thought about using an own cloud&#x2F;nextcloud setup, but it’s just too much work for little value. Like running gitlab instead of ssh and git.')
