This was a situation where &quot;Pedestrian (child) abruptly enter into road from behind cover.&quot; and there&#x27;s an old lady on the sidewalk.  In other words, there&#x27;s a situation with limited visibility, limited room to maneuver (since the only other option is to go up on the sidewalk) and pedestrians present (the child may not be known but the old lady was).   If you&#x27;re in that situation and you&#x27;re going too fast that you can&#x27;t stop on a dime, you were not going a &quot;perfectly fine speed for the situation&quot;.')
