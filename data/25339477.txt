Everyone here is talking about why the tech elite are leaving due to the quality of life when Keith Rabois specifically has like 3-4 IPOs he was an early investor in going public right now and makes no sense to stay in California in 2021 and pay state capital gains taxes on those sales.<p>Same with Elon Musk and Tesla’s absurd stock price. And probably a lot of other people given the hot IPO market.<p>Point is it’s so disingenuous for these people to say it’s because of SF or California when it has everything to do with taxes and not much else.<p>To blast the Bay Area and state which made them rich and then flee before they owe a penny is gross.')
