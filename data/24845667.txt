Also, isn&#x27;t that like a wrong rationalizing its existence by another wrong?<p>Let us consider unfairness such as forcing a kid to ride a bus 3 hours per day when there is a perfectly good school next door they can&#x27;t attend because they&#x27;re Asian. Does that &quot;fix&quot; segregation because it&#x27;s an &quot;equal&quot; unfairness too?<p><i>Two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right, but three lefts do.</i>')
