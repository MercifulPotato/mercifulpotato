Async is great technically but one of the things I love about Ruby is the elegance and clarity.  That tends to go out the window when async is introduced in many languages.  async&#x2F;await has helped a ton though, so hopefully Ruby will get something like that as we go.<p>I would just suggest that sometimes performance isn&#x27;t worth sacrificing clarity.  Obviously sometimes you have to (Big O can be an unforgiving beast) but not always.')
