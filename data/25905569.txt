RDBMS are complex systems, and gaining sufficient knowledge of their internals would require several months of work. Though, it would wonderful for me to collaborate with some RDBMS engineers to integrate my current research efforts in their system.<p>Actually, some time ago, we asked a bachelor&#x27;s student at the University of Pisa to integrate the PGM-index in Redis (which is simpler than an RDBMS). He did it, and the results were really promising, -3x overall memory usage with respect to Redis ZSETs.')
