The company was absolutely <i>paranoid</i> about doing anything ever again that would create that set of lawsuits and from what I can tell, in the 8 years since I left MS, that culture is still alive and well. It&#x27;s probably why MS is the only company I still feel comfortable doing with, among the &quot;tech&quot; companies.<p>The hard slap they got from the government was enough to apparently permanently change the company culture around treatment of users and other businesses.<p>I see a lot of the excesses we see coming out of Google, Twitter, FB, to be a consequence of there being, well, zero consequences for their behavior. They&#x27;re like petulant children who never learned limits and think it&#x27;s ok to do whatever they want, no matter who they hurt. That&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> how you teach children -- give them limits. Ironically, the same rule applies to adults.')
