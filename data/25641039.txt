That reduced the load on my database server by over 80%. It&#x27;s a small site that only generates about $5&#x2F;day from AdSense, so I need to keep the expenses down on it, and I don&#x27;t want all of the revenue paying for bots that don&#x27;t bring in any significant traffic.<p>If I didn&#x27;t block any search bots, I bet the bots would make up at least 95% of the traffic.<p>On my larger sites I don&#x27;t mind serving a million page views a day to random search bots, but on that smaller one it doesn&#x27;t make sense.')
