Item(by='gecko', descendants=None, kids=[25875437, 25875221, 25875749], score=None, time=1611342847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25875019, text='Hydrogen <i>as part</i> is totally reasonable. It gives us hydrocarbon density without us needing to <i>add</i> to the CO2 in the atmosphere. The important thing to remember when discussing it is that it&#x27;s an energy <i>storage</i> medium, not an energy <i>generation</i> medium. Most of the time I get irritated is when people treat hydrogen as the latter. But if our culture is just too damn wedded to cars for now, <i>and</i> battery tech just isn&#x27;t there yet, then using hydrogen as a stopgap--provided the hydrogen is made from renewable energy--seems fine to me.')
