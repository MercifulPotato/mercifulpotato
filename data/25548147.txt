Especially other people&#x27;s failures. People who are honest with themselves can warn you around the mistakes they made, but people who succeed rarely have much luck identifying which selection of choices got them there.<p>I think the reason is that success is usually cumulative: each little win builds on the last until it&#x27;s obvious you&#x27;re going in the right direction. Those wins often depend on random or temporary things you have little control over. For example: CED was the perfect format for the decade RCA started developing it in, but it took until VHS redefined the market to finish it.[0]<p>Meanwhile one mistake can send everything tumbling down. Study enough mistakes and you might know enough of what to avoid to stay afloat long enough to find the right chain of wins.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PnpX8d8zRIA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PnpX8d8zRIA</a>')
