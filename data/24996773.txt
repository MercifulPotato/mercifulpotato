This is quite a striking example of that. I read this title today and immediately thought &quot;that&#x27;s old news&quot;. But it turns out that I read this only yesterday and in comment, not even an article. It&#x27;s strange how my brain seems to store this information quickly, but doesn&#x27;t have enough time to timestamp it.')
