We have Big Data, we have data scientists, we have ML&#x2F;AI....it&#x27;s going to be used for all of these goals no matter what. The genie is out of the bottle.<p>Blaming Palantir here is a bit like blaming Colt or Smith &amp; Wesson. They&#x27;re just one of many companies that are providing, or could be providing, or with they were providing, these same services.<p>And the services themselves, and the science behind them aren&#x27;t inherently evil. It&#x27;s not like the math behind their models is special &quot;let&#x27;s oppress society&quot; math.<p>Blaming Palantir for the things the government is doing is as effective as blaming Boeing or Google - whose services are also used by the US Government for various (nefarious) purposes.')
