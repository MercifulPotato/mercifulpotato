To combat this, you would need to tunnel the enveleope information in headers.<p>Isn&#x27;t that exactly what Envelope-to is supposed to be? Protocol-level data? It&#x27;s not really part of the e-mail, but added when sending it. If you forward the mail to another machine, there will be a new envelope.<p>I can see that it&#x27;s all a gray-ish area with email (because email is a mess (which might be part of why it&#x27;s been successful)) but I can&#x27;t see a reason to complain about losing Envelope-to.')
