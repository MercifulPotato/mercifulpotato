Your atmospheric drag is a function of velocity <i>squared</i> times the density of the atmosphere- a very non-linear function of how close to the ground you are.<p>Rockets have a huge advantage in that they go <i>slow</i> near the ground, where the atmosphere is thick. They&#x27;re not dealing with as much air resistance. As they reach altitudes with less atmosphere, they can throttle up. This saves a lot of fuel, mass, energy.<p>A rail gun, however, can only add velocity, energy, at the beginning, and will slow down every moment for the rest of the launch. This is the worst possible condition. You&#x27;re at your highest velocity while you&#x27;re in the thickest part of the atmosphere. You&#x27;d need to put an incredible amount of extra energy into the system because of that.<p>So maybe you put the end of your rail gun on the top of a very high mountain. But the construction costs, the transportation costs, all of this, probably makes it simpler to just use rockets instead.')
