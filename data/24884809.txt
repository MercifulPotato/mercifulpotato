I wonder if there are any I just didn&#x27;t know were.<p>I also wonder if anything about Haskell makes it particularly suited as the implementation language for Pandoc. It must have a lot of parsers in it, and Haskell is supposed to be good for coding parsers.<p>There are parser generation libraries and meta-libraries for certain other languages, notably C++. I wonder what Pandoc in C++ would look like. Probably a pretty good parser meta-library could be spun out of such a project.')
