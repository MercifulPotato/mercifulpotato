Telling myself about the same reasons plus the price tag.<p>I already had a Windows Desktop for game, and for the first time in the Windows history, I really liked what they did with windows 10. They also seem to be more invest in pushing the platform forward. And contrary to the popular opinion, I do believe in convertible devices. Also, I told myself I can also run Linux for development.<p>I then bought an HP laptop with similar spec than the MBP, for about 500$CAD less. Seem like a real save, but god I was wrong.<p>The fun with Linux lasted for less than a month before I just gave up.<p>The consistent (across all apps and terminal), powerful default emacs key bindings on the macs is a gem for programming and productivity. I miss that all day.<p>The touchpad is mediocre, they are all mediocre, never saw one working as good as the MBP. Even when someone told me that they&#x27;re working great and let me try it, it was clear they never work with a MBP or don&#x27;t use it that much.<p>Native apps in general, like photo, video editing, notes etc. are more polish and perform better on the mac. Web app though is quite different. icloud.com is terrible compare to onedrive.<p>Resume, battery life, screen, even if the tech specs sheet says it&#x27;s the same, it&#x27;s not in real life.<p>It&#x27;s hard to put a price on all that, but at the end, I didn&#x27;t save 500$ in value, I lost way more than that. Moreover, comparable specs, innovative devices like the surface line, are now price about the same.')
