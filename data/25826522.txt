For example you can choose between Material UI, Bootstrap, or Bulma for your UI. Firebase or Auth0 for auth, and so on down the stack.<p>It then runs your app in our built-in editor where you can play with styles and drop in new components from the Divjoy library. The idea is to give you that &quot;Aha! I&#x27;m building something and it works!&quot; moment right away. That&#x27;s a better experience than spending your first few hours sifting through docs.<p>You can try all this out without signing up or paying. Just head to the site, pick some options, then a template.<p>PS. You may remember my original Show HN from over a year ago (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20688044" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20688044</a>). The 2.0 version takes that concept and expands it from mostly static sites to full SaaS apps.')
