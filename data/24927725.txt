I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever encountered any situation where something like this has come up, personally. It might be more common than I think it is, and if someone feels harassed in some way related to a a project I&#x27;m responsible for, I definitely want to provide them a private way to voice their concerns. I&#x27;m just ambivalent about it all due to stories like the one described in this post.')
