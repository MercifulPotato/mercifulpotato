One thing I think we all need to consider essential is ethics.  As software continues to eat the world, programmers are being used for unethical endeavors and I think all too often we don&#x27;t notice it.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting every programmer who works for the likes of Facebook, Exxon, and Comcast quit their jobs. (though, if they did, wouldn&#x27;t <i>that</i> turn some influential heads in the right direction?) Simply push back when asked to work on something that you feel might cause harm.')
