And while it&#x27;s true that Narnia is an idealized culture (like Gondor under its good kings) and therefore portrayed as superior to Calormene culture, Lewis is willing to elevate an aspect of the latter above <i>English</i> culture when he writes &quot;In Calormen story-telling is a thing you&#x27;re taught, just as English boys and girls are taught essay writing. The difference is that people want to hear the stories, whereas I never heard of anyone who wanted to read the essays.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think Tolkien or Lewis wholly escape the charge of racism; I think few people do, in their time or ours.
