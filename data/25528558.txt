This is a nuisance for platform pedals and conventional shoes and obnoxious for clipless pedals and cleated shoes.<p>I would highly encourage avoiding the Ballard Bridge.  IMO it&#x27;s very dangerous.<p>Walkability in Ballard is pretty good.  We&#x27;re within 15 minutes walking distance of QFC and the bar&#x2F;restaurant area south of Market.  That said, I prefer to drive to the grocery store so I can go infrequently and buy more at once.')
