Of course, even there it is a constant trade-off between effectiveness (regarding propulsion) and what is considered acceptable discomfort for passengers or the environment (regarding audio).<p>I believe that drones could already be made way more quiet with long existing technology. The key question here might be: how much shorter do you want your flight last, and how much more expensive do you want your drone to be?')
