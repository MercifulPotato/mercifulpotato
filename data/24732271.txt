Likewise, supply chain areas like storage and shipping move a lot of product per employee.<p>2) &#x27;butchers&#x27; and similar jobs are relatively high skill and likely pay above minimum wage anyways. They also have better economies of scale. But at any rate, it&#x27;s unlikely professional butchers are particularly involved in producing meat for fast food burgers and likely 1 or 2 low wage employees in a factory are doing all the manual labour involved in producing meat for hundreds of burgers.<p>At any rate, I don&#x27;t think the null hypothesis can really be that every level of the supply chain has the same level of labour costs.')
