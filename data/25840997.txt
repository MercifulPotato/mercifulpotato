We only endured a short &#x27;official&#x27; lockdown time, however ended up working on home for the most of the rest of the year.<p>Our hard border policy certainly helped ease the stress fairly early in the piece however, and we all had a (comparatively) easy time after that.<p>Personally I had some additional stress while working at home - we had a kid at the start of March so it was an interesting time - but luckily for the most part our state was quite insulated from the social impacts of the covid period.')
