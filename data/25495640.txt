Item(by='mannykannot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608563728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493689, text='Whether the story, which you have as good as accepted as plausible [1], does closely parallel the proposed Neanderthal case, is a separate issue (in that regard, note that all OP says about that is &quot;it is likely these people have the same bone deformities.&quot;)<p>&gt;And [OP] <i>suggested</i> those North Koreans were likely doing the same. [my emphasis of the weasel word]<p>So it seems you will read the anecdote literally when doing so allows you to attack its credibility, <i>and</i> you will find an unstated assumption in it if doing so allows you to attack its relevance.<p>As noted above, the OP merely seems to be suggesting something that other posters have also mentioned: the physical evidence mentioned in the article might have been the result of winter famine, and not definitive evidence of hibernation; furthermore, there may be people alive today, or recently deceased, in whom this physiological damage might be found. I can&#x27;t say for sure, but OP may be suggesting that they might help with the further studies of this hypothesis.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25490193" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25490193</a>')
