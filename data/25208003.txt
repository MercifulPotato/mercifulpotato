I grew up in the &#x27;80s, and for my whole life I&#x27;ve been told by climate scientist that we are 5&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;20... years away from one particular climate catastrophe or another. The field has been heavily promoting doomsday predictions for even longer than I&#x27;ve been alive. At first to get people to take them seriously, and since then to scare them into action. However, regardless of any good the scientists have accomplished, any climate skeptic today can say &quot;climate scientists are full of shit&quot; and point to literally decades of climate scientists being full of shit. The noble lies have done irreversible damage to the credibility of the field amongst large portions of the population.')
