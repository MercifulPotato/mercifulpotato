The set with the marker and the polymer folio was USD 299. For the sake of comparison, just the 10.3 inch display plus the driving board on Waveshare is USD 234 plus shipping, and it&#x27;s kind of a pain to deal with.<p>The reMarkable, OTOH, &quot;just works&quot;, as well as an i.MX6 machine with an e-paper display can.<p>It&#x27;s a Linux machine with a framebuffer, with the added difficulty that you have to explicitly tell the framebuffer to update itself, unless you put the driver on auto-update mode. For my application, explicitly refreshing the framebuffer works better, though.')
