They are legal benefits for Twitter to NOT be a newspaper. That&#x27;s why they need to claim an objective reason for censoring&#x2F;fact checking a specific story.<p>So, I understand what you say but Twitter would beg to differ with you.<p>Also network effects are harder to come by in newspapers. Imagine if there was one newspaper that had 100x the readership of the second most popular one. That&#x27;d be considered a threat to democracy.')
