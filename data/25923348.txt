This particular snag needs local access but I will grant you that my web server or other exposed service might provide a local interface.<p>Instead of throwing your hands up and screaming &quot;crap&quot; you do your risk assessment and attempt to mitigate as best you can.  I read a lot of blogs and have a fair amount of logging and analytics lying around the place (and that&#x27;s just at home).<p>Fairly recently I found that my wife&#x27;s car had loose nuts on the front nearside wheel.  That was a change to fix a worn tyre for obvious safety reasons but for whatever reason the fixings were not done up properly.  I think they were done up finger tight but a distraction caused the mechanic to forget to use a spanner (wrench) to finish the job to spec.  The wheel seemed to work fine but you would get a low rumble sound on corners.  It was not a trivial to diagnose fault because you had to notice it before failure - I&#x27;m a (non chartered) Civ Eng and IT bod but not a mechanic.  There is a minimally screwed on plastic cover that stopped the bolts from flying out - not much.<p>A car wheel is a thing we can all look at and see that the four bolts are not working properly, once you remove the plastic cover and see them wobble.<p>Now that is what you can do to protect yourself (risk assess, mitigate etc.)  However there should also be something that protects &quot;civilians&quot; and I think that is what is missing.  I&#x27;m not too sure how we do that.')
