It&#x27;s the fact that it&#x27;s a good faith hint. It&#x27;s my job to go find the truth given this mild heuristic.<p>They&#x27;re the ones doing me the favour so I have to contribute in order to get more information. In this case, I can attempt to find an error in the proof or to ask clarification. But if I were to ask them to write out a proof then I&#x27;m being a fool and I&#x27;ll get fewer hints from them in future.<p>I noticed that most people who really know their field don&#x27;t cite their assertions. It makes sense. So now I&#x27;m not surprised when people don&#x27;t provide a citation. It&#x27;s just a hint. They didn&#x27;t sign up to be my tutor.')
