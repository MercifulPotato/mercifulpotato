I just bought it and I was worried about battery life.<p>At 1am, Thursday night, I took the battery off the charger, at 100%<p>I have slept 2x in it, but I wasn’t asking the phone to record my sleep on the second night and so it didn’t. That seems to matter to Apple’s sleep-tracking software.<p>It is currently 2:50pm on Saturday, and my battery charge is at 38%<p>Seep tracking, night 1, took about 10% of the battery life. Might have been 8. I don’t remember.<p>I have nearly every notification turned off. The standing notification is still on. I have heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, most health tracking I can get turned on.<p>I’ve run at least one, maybe two ECG’s in this battery life.<p>I have the always on display turned off because I don’t need my display on all the time and I think the feature is mostly a gimmick.<p>I’ve been playing with my watch a bit because I find it fun and it’s new. I’ve used it to read email, to log me in to LastPass, to check SMS 2FA, to purchase drinks and other items and so on.<p>I did take it off for about 3 hours last night, but did not charge it.<p>I have not taken the watch for a cardio exercise yet. I have the wifi and gps-only version.<p>Long story short, I could absolutely see this watch lasting 2 days with my usage patterns, absolutely no problem. Charging it 30 minutes when I’m in the shower to push it back to a healthy battery life is absolutely not going to be a problem.')
