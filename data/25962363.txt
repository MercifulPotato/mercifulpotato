Item(by='filleduchaos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611953509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961703, text='A decade ago in secondary school I learned of capitalism as an economic system where [the vast majority of] the means of production are privately owned and operated for profit through the purchase of labour, and of socialism as a broad umbrella term for economic systems where the means of production are socially owned (and that there are various kinds of social ownership) and self-managed by labour itself. As far as I am aware these are the definitions that have been in play for the century and a half or so that the theories have even existed. In my experience they only get weird redefinitions (such as socialism apparently being &quot;whenever the government does something&quot;) in particularly polarised countries (cough the US cough). Sure, people arguing from ignorance or disingenuity are technically having a debate, but why on earth is everyone listening to them?<p>Beyond that, speaking more precisely about tax policies (statism), free market competition (market economics, laissez-faire) and safety nets (social welfare) is an endeavour all societies should partake in, sure. But it&#x27;s also orthogonal to the axis of capitalism vs socialism. Having a higher marginal tax rate, regulating markets, and&#x2F;or implementing a welfare state doesn&#x27;t magically remove the private ownership from a capitalist system. Similarly, charging no taxes (or even not having a state at all), operating a free market and&#x2F;or not having a social security system wouldn&#x27;t make a system that runs on social ownership any less socialist.<p>It&#x27;s like attempting to resolve a debate between functional programming and OOP by saying we should focus on specific elements of the two so that we can speak more precisely about things like static&#x2F;dynamic typing instead. That does not answer the original question at all.')
