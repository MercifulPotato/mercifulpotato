To understand why, compare two scenarios:<p>(1a) Widespread civilian mask wearing, fewer civilian infections\n(1b) Healthcare workers treat fewer patients. Workers face low-to-moderate risk of infection due to PPE shortages.<p>(2a) Zero civilian mask wearing which leads to a burgeoning civilian infection rate.\n(2b) Healthcare workers treat an endless flow of patients. Workers face very low risk of infection but at worked to exhaustion.<p>In which scenario do both healthcare workers and society at large benefit the most?<p>The point of wearing masks is to reduce risk ex-ante. Nobody should pat themselves on the back because they only started wearing masks at the point where the absolute benefit mask wearing is highest because, according to my interpretation of your logic, that point coincides with when society is suffering most from the disease.<p>Either public health officials lied about mask efficacy or were downright incompetent. Successful public health doesn&#x27;t optimize for the well-being of just doctors, hospitals, and medicine. It&#x27;s a role that requires intimate understanding of tradeoffs, complex systems, and public compliance.')
