It mainly focuses on data structures for efficiently storing and editing text. I can&#x27;t recall any GUI-related topics being in there.<p>My initial implementation was based on this book and used one rich TextView with Spans to do the rendering. After that turned out way too slow I switched to drawing everything myself using the Android 2D drawing API&#x27;s. It was a fun side project and I learned a lot from it.')
