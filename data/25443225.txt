Politician A says: &quot;I feel bad for SMBs that will suffer if we prioritize privacy.&quot; Politician B responds: &quot;I totally agree. They should just simply ask me for my permission, that seems fair, no?&quot;<p>Politician B is likely aware that asking for permission is going to cause the outcome that Politician A is predicting and is unhappy about, so in a way they are saying: &quot;My privacy is more important to me than the SMBs&#x27; ability to survive.&quot; Which, to be clear, is a perfectly reasonable answer, and one that the majority of people will support. Except, that&#x27;s not what they are saying. Their response ignores the inverse correlation between the two choices and paints a picture that represents the best of both worlds. Really smart and really effective - you help other supporters of your view ignore its downside and make them feel better about continuing to support it.<p>I&#x27;ve been asking myself why people argue this way, and PG&#x27;s article titled Refragmentation [1] helped me understand some aspects of the new world we&#x27;re living in. An alternative explanation is that it is - ironically given the context - all Facebook&#x27;s fault which has been reinforcing the echo chambers of ideologies. If you believe that the Earth is flat and you wanted to find some validation, Facebook will be happy to do that for you. Just search for &quot;flat Earth&quot;, join the biggest Facebook group on that topic [2], and within days you&#x27;ll start getting content (and friend suggestions) that will make it hard to escape that alternate reality. They will feed you with convincing arguments that are better than what you can come up with, so that the next time someone says: &quot;Dude, what about the ISS?&quot;, you&#x27;ll be able to say, &quot;I agree with you and think you bring up a valid point. I also think that [insert an argument that cannot coexist with the concept of the ISS].&quot;<p>I am longing for the days when people would openly disagree with each other, because that forced them to actually listen to the arguments and then address them as opposed to talking to each other like politicians do, whose job depends on getting their constituents to support them even when their ideology is wrong.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;re.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;re.html</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;2205176794" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;2205176794</a>')
