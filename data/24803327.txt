Last time I used the Dropbox web interface was back in 2010. I want to download a PDF. I click on it and it opens. I scour the page for a download button. Cannot find it. I see on the sidebar &quot;Share \\&#x2F;&quot; I click &quot;\\&#x2F;&quot; nothing. I see &quot;Open \\&#x2F;&quot; and I click &quot;\\&#x2F;&quot; and it has one item called &quot;connected apps&quot;. After looking around I finally find a button with 3 dots &quot;...&quot; I click on it and it has a link to &quot;Download&quot;.<p>I estimate ~5 minutes to locate the download button. I think to myself that I should leave Dropbox a note about this. I would think &quot;Download&quot; is a critical feature that should be front and center. So I try to find a contact or feedback form. Nothing. I google &quot;contact dropbox&quot; and find the only options are to talk to a bot or write a forum post.<p>So my question how can I contact an actual UX person at Dropbox to commend them on how awesome the web UX is!')
