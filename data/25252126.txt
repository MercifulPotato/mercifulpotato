While everyone and their dog can attend some six weeks coding bootcamp or teach themselves using free and open resources and can then start contributing to open source code, dealing with hardware requires a good education in fundamental physics, good amounts of money for components and tooling (a good soldering iron, air filters, fine-controlled hot air gun, a decent oven, the equipment and the chemicals for etching, a precise micro-drill, ...). Many people don&#x27;t have that amount of upfront money and skills, and those that do often don&#x27;t have the amount of free time to help advance open source because, as I wrote, it takes <i>lots</i> of time and money to deal with smart hardware.')
