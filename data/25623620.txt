I&#x27;ve worked with multiple serial GPS receivers that stored the last solution in nonvolatile memory as a start point.<p>A quick way to check: buy a brand new one, plug it in, and see if it starts offering (low-quality) fixes for Shenzhen or wherever it was QAd. Unfortunately some receivers won&#x27;t actually provide NMEA sentences until the quality flag goes on, so it&#x27;s not quite this obvious, but I just recently bought an industrial cellular modem with onboard GPS and experienced a 30 minute or so wait before the quality flag came on and I started getting NMEA sentences. Presumably it was busy discovering it wasn&#x27;t in Kansas any more.')
