We&#x27;ve been getting these exact symptoms practically forever.<p>Given the sensitivity of the topic right now the least we can do is get data before adding to the discourse. It&#x27;s hard to take panic back. Given you can get a PCR test with same-day results, it would be nice if OP could wait 24 hours to confirm :)<p>I got super sick back in February, basically the same exact symptoms OP posted, and a cough that lasted 6 weeks. Took an antibody test a few months later. I tested negative.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK532961&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK532961&#x2F;</a>')
