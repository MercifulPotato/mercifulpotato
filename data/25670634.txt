Where I live, I have to pay someone to be able to sleep inside, to eat, to travel, to communicate, to access information. And the only way to make those payments is to obey one person or another who gets power that trickled down from the top.\nSocialism is nothing but the attempt to fix these things by organizing like minded good people to be social. It might not always work, and nothing can last forever, but to the extent it does, I think that is the measure of good over evil in society.\nA capitalist republic is the organization of like minded authoritarians who maintain a class of people like me to use as labor and manage via economics and trade.\nAs I see it socialism is the only sincere attempt at a fair society and republican capitalism is just authoritarianism with a delegation-style of management. IE: federal bank pays a corporation that bids on a job. corporation pays producers. producers pay servants. and on down the pyramid. And all the way down, there is no accountability to any good or fairness. In fact, the opposite is protected, because the way that an authority wants to treat their subordinates is considered human rights in capitalism. they call it privacy. corruption is the system. Pursuit of happiness (a euphemism for greed) is good.\nI think fair access to natural resources without needing permission is human rights. I believe that is called socialism. I don&#x27;t demand service or subordination from anyone, just fairness, by which i mean equal or at least a minimum basic access to land or material resources to live. Capitalists demand service from me and respect for their perspective that i don&#x27;t own resources and they do since they have exploited and conquered more people than I have, which they call fairness.\nThe state = The status. It doesn&#x27;t disappear people. Capitalism and crime disappear people. This just means the state is poor&#x2F;capitalist.\nAn elected body is not the state. It is just an organizing scheme for people to communicate and participate in the kind of economy where 1 person = 1 vote and no one is allowed to gain more or less influence than that except by true social means aka popularity.\nYour argument reminds me of people arguing against the scientific method because most or all scientists make mistakes. It just means you need better science. Science isn&#x27;t a guarantee, but it is an ideal method of determining objective truth. Capitalism is the false utopia, with invisible hand and other superstitions. Socialism makes no such promise. It doesn&#x27;t promise equality of outcomes. It is just a method for fairness. It is democracy that has not been corrupted by respect for unaccountable accumulation of private control or power.')
