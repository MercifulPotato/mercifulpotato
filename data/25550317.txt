Air-breathing first stage is all I can think of (but it&#x27;s essentially still a rocket). Skyhooks and space elevators will have to wait for advances in materials science and will require orbital manufacturing capabilities. Launch loops seem to be too complicated either. Mini launch loops &#x2F; big guns &#x2F; other constructs that provide all kinetic energy at ground level won&#x27;t work because of atmosphere density, and even if you had magic materials that&#x27;d survive hypersonic shocks and G forces, it&#x27;d still be a ridiculous waste of energy compared to rockets.<p>At this point I think we don&#x27;t need anyone surpassing SpaceX, we just need more people copying them. In of itself, it&#x27;ll drive launch costs further down.')
