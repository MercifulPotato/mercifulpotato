If AI research has demonstrated anything it’s Intelligence doesn’t increase linearly with computation. Compare two identical chess engines where one has 10% more computational power behind it and that program has a surprisingly limited increase in ELO score.<p>It’s seductive to think AGI will suddenly advance  technology dramatically, but dumping more effort into existing technology has a bad habit of hitting diminishing returns. Ideas like nano-machines seem to have vast potential, until you realize biology is already operating at those scales and has significant limitations.')
