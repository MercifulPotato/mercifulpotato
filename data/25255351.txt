Their parents started middle class and made some money.\nI bet my parents wouldn&#x27;t have failed the test - and they definitely always stocked the house with food and could provide resources and a stable environment.\nMy grandparents had a harder life (thanks to the wars, most likely) and share the same mindset I had (even though I never spent much time with them, we lived far away).<p>I wonder how much of that it&#x27;s actually genetic, more than environmental. You could still find correlations compatible with the study, if it were. \nPassing down the &quot;poor&quot; genes would create genealogical lines of poor families.')
