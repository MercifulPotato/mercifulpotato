He seems pretty smart and reasonable.<p>But I cannot get over the fact, that over the last 20 years, Berkshire Hathaway had a 7% annualized ROI while a simple Nasdaq fund had 8%.<p>He talks so much about being smart, analyzing assets, investing in things you know something about, waiting for good valuations, margin of safety etc etc. But what for? Investing in a more or less random selection of tech companies would have had a better return.<p>Am I missing something?')
