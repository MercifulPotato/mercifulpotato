I then checked a few other sites and learned<p>* Washington Post no longer has a paywall<p>* anandtech.com is seemingly unaffected, but tomshardware.com is very different (and less pushy)<p>* SoundCloud says &quot;Oh no! | JavaScript is disabled | You need to enable JavaScript to use SoundCloud&quot;<p>* nationalreview.com is broken -- I can only read a few paragraphs in a NR PLUS story, and there&#x27;s no way to keep scrolling (I can read the article fine in another tab)<p>* An article I co-wrote, published in a Cambridge University Press journal, is now sans tables and figures, but the console reports no errors or exceptions.<p>An interesting experiment! Overall, it seems my internet experience is better without JS (but reading an academic article online is way worse).')
