Here are the daily cases by specimen date.  Dotted line is Saturday&#x27;s data, solid line is Sunday&#x27;s.  The difference between the two is partly the normal daily update, but around 2&#x2F;3 of it is correcting the underreporting:<p>7-day moving average:\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;danger.handley.org.uk&#x2F;misc&#x2F;rates-uk-recent.png" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;danger.handley.org.uk&#x2F;misc&#x2F;rates-uk-recent.png</a><p>Raw data:\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;danger.handley.org.uk&#x2F;misc&#x2F;rates-uk.png" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;danger.handley.org.uk&#x2F;misc&#x2F;rates-uk.png</a><p>Looks like all regions were affected, but by far the largest corrections are in NW, NE and Yorkshire regions.  In particular, NE had looked like cases were declining, but we can now see this was incorrect, and they&#x27;re still increasing  rapidly<p>Edit: note the most recent 3 days are always incomplete, so any decline shown there is not a real effect.')
