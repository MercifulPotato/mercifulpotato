I&#x27;ve learned that when I see a binary tree question, I might as well just wrap up the interview. They have no intention of hiring me.<p>I am mediocre at them. Most represent stuff I haven&#x27;t done. A lot of it is common sense, but I&#x27;m solving them for the first time, so my approach is usually sub-optimal (I tend to start with naive approaches, then refine, if necessary). The testers are usually looking for a formulaic approach. A lot of my approaches are orthogonal to the &quot;classics.&quot; I started as an EE, so I&#x27;m pretty good with things like drivers, SDKs and APIs, but they aren&#x27;t really something that you can do in a 50-line test.<p>What&#x27;s really insulting, is that when I&#x27;m asked, I usually send links to relevant gists or repos; often focused on the exact method that addresses the question asked.<p>It&#x27;s ignored (so far, 100% of the time -the &quot;faker&quot; comment was made by someone that was explaining why they ignored it).')
