It&#x27;s not, that&#x27;s the entire point.<p>Ahh, classic: blame the user.<p>You are wrong for expecting things to work in a way that&#x27;s familiar!<p>Global hotkey bindings?  Sure, that works on Windows, macOS, and X, but it doesn&#x27;t on Wayland and its your fault for expecting it.<p>The beatings will continue until morale improves!<p>&gt; As an end-user you can continue to use what works for you.<p>LOL, Wayland is literally being marketed as the replacement for X.  It&#x27;s even the default display server in Debian, Ubuntu, and (I think?) Fedora.<p>Why are you surprised that people therefore expect stuff that works in X to work in Wayland?')
