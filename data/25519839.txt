Basically they are given a lot of money to “disrupt” a market. So they first have to have to show a lot of growth. The easiest way to do that is to offer for free (or deeply discounted) what used to cost money. So the growth numbers go up. Eventually, they need to be able to start showing a profit. However, the original, most obvious way of monetizing customers is gone, so then the company begins doing shady stuff to try to boost revenue.')
