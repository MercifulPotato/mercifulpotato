As soon as I wanted to do something that was not in examples, that would either won&#x27;t work at all or needed a horrible hack to work. I can&#x27;t give a real example from the top of my head, but I am thinking like the examples would not show how to do a modal popup window and then you learn when you try to instatiate such window then the other window goes crazy or if you close the modal window everything closes and there would be no way to fix it other than digging into library code.\nI hope this one is not like that.')
