This keyboard is probably the reason I&#x27;m still able to work in the industry today.<p>The Microsoft Ergo Sculpt keyboard is amazing.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t require any getting used to, because it has a standard layout, and your hands sit in roughly a standard position when you&#x27;re using it.<p>It&#x27;s compatible with both Windows PCs and Mac&#x2F;OSX.  One point of caution, however: I have found that only <i>some</i> of them work automatically with my work Macbook.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the USB transmitters come in 2 varieties: one that says &#x27;Microsoft&#x27;, and one that says &#x27;Logitech&#x27; (IIRC).  The ones that I&#x27;ve had good success with on the Mac are the ones that have the Microsoft transmitter.  If you&#x27;re just using it with a Windows PC, it doesn&#x27;t matter which one you end up with.<p>Here&#x27;s a link on Amazon to buy it for $70: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Microsoft-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Business-5KV-00001&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00CYX26BC&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;Microsoft-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Busine...</a><p>Seriously, if you&#x27;re not already using an ergo keyboard, unless you&#x27;re one of those mechanical keyboard gearheads who obsesses about colors of switches, you&#x27;ll probably like it.  I guarantee it will kick the socks off of any built-in laptop keyboard, and it&#x27;s better than most wireless keyboards, IMO.')
