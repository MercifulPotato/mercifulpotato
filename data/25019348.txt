What is the ROI of a website? Of showing up in Google organically? Of a well designed logo? On some level, customers expect to be able to find you. You need to show up, and show up well, at the point that customers are simply exploring. That’s fairly untraceable.<p>The other is distribution, holistically. Tesla might not have “marketing,” but they have showrooms, launch events, and referral programs. Every successful business started with precisely one highly effective way to acquire customers. Marketing, on some level, is about making sure that acquisition channel is working, start to end.<p>As companies grow, everything becomes muddy.

That’s normal and true everywhere.')
