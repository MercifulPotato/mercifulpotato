Even you are unable to do those a good solid barbell strenght training program can work wonders.  Anecdontal for me, but I find whenever I stop training my back&#x2F;neck pain comes back.<p>Also important to move a few times a day if you are doing the kind of sitting work most of us do.  I make sure that I take a 20-30 min walk before I start working and then at least 1 more time mid-day.  This also helps a lot IMO')
