Of OpEx.<p>So what? If that cost is necessary to run a platform that is safe for those who are on it (= from spammers, catfishers, threats, pedophiles or right-wing extremists) and that does not serve as a breeding ground for threats for society (= &quot;freemen&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Reichsbürger&quot; groups, militias, neo-Nazis, antisemites, Qanon, ...), then this cost should be paid by the ones making the profit (=Facebook), <i>not</i> society.<p>&gt; Second, it’s 250k human moderators who will feel obligated to, you know, moderate stuff.<p>So what? The digital equivalent of police(wo)men on patrol. Just because it&#x27;s The Internet, it should not be a free-for-all land.<p>&gt; How anyone could think 250,000 people running around with mod powers on people’s Facebook walls is not deeply, deeply problematic<p>The US alone has nearly 700k police officers for 300M people, that are running around with guns and regularly kill people, and yet society accepts this.')
