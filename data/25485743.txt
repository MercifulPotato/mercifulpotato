That is science.<p>Please check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Falsifiability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Falsifiability</a><p>&gt; In the philosophy of science, falsifiability or refutability is the capacity for a statement, theory or hypothesis to be contradicted by evidence. For example, the statement &quot;All swans are white&quot; is falsifiable because one can observe that black swans exist.<p>&gt; The observation of a black swan falsifies the hypothesis &quot;All swans are white&quot;.<p>&gt; (...) Popper argued for falsifiability and opposed this to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability. Whereas verifying the claim &quot;All swans are white&quot; would require assessment of all swans, which is not possible, the single observation of a black swan is sufficient to falsify it.')
