All the structures at present are based on majoritarian views without due protection to minorities or minority views. I have yet to see a system which protects minorities from the tyranny of majority.<p>Communist or Democracy both can survive only when administration appease majority and follow majoritarian views. Seen it first hand by living in both the systems.')
