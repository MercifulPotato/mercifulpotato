A large proportion of complaints of cancel culture are coupled with implications of frustration that they feel they can&#x27;t say unpleasant things that they would have gotten away with previously. Or people complaining about direct efforts to change social norms that they don&#x27;t agree with, claiming that due to a status quo bias, change is cancellation and therefore baseless.<p>As with most ideologies, discussing the definition is a fairly pointless task because its subjective and ill-defined, especially by those who feel passionately about it. The term is pointless. What happened in this case sounds bad, at a glance. Let&#x27;s not generalize it to other things. It&#x27;ll get nowhere. Whether or not one believes something is a part of cancel culture has no bearing on whether a particular idea to squash something is good or not.')
