I had a bad experience with my laptop purchase as well.  (Issue wasn&#x27;t discovered until after the return window.)  Hopefully, you&#x27;ve already been escalated to their &quot;real&quot; customer support tier by now.  I had to send mine in <i>three</i> times.  One of those times they returned the laptop with a downgraded mainboard.<p>In the end I&#x27;m pretty happy with the laptop but I will never buy from them again.')
