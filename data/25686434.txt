It&#x27;s just a constant barrage of &quot;someone laughed at an image&quot;, &quot;someone liked [200 words of text]&quot;. And the best part is that Apple has flipped out and somehow assigned half the iOS participants to SMS instead of iMessage (I think because I do own several Macs&#x2F;iPads and have an iMessage account, just not on my phone), so they&#x27;re in the same hell that I am... and it&#x27;s all my fault.<p>Trust me, they&#x27;re not eager to include me in the next conversation.')
