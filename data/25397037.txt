But (I am always confused about starting with but) I would not think anything is wrong with &quot;a lovely old little green rectangular French silver whittling knife&quot;.<p>I had a team mate who always used passive voice in technical documentation. My manager always used to point it out to him but he was never able to fix it. Once he got mad and said, &quot;Ma&#x27;am, I have no idea what you are talking about, this is the only voice I know&quot;. On his next Birthday she gifted him a copy of Lynn Truss&#x27; Eats Shoots &amp; Leaves. He later said that was the best book gift he ever got.')
