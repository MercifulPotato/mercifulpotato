If every country starts to selectively kill people in other countries perceived to be hostile where do we stop or draw the line? Do it just because you can? If China or Russia did it in other countries sure as hell the US or Israel would be &quot;up in arms&quot; about it. And draw the line where? Someone is employed by agency that develops new technology that could be harmful....let&#x27;s kill her&#x2F;him? Or just because s&#x2F;he said something critical on TV? Back to the stone age everyone - with high tech of course.')
