In my opinion, it tries to do too many things and doesn&#x27;t do any one thing particularly well. If you are just wanting a kanban board, you are better off sticking with Trello. If you are wanting bug tracking, feature requests, etc, you are better off with things like GitHub Issues and other specialized tools. YMMV of course.')
