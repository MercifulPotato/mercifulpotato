Accomplished everything that I wanted to and now I&#x27;m struggling to find any meaning in the work (of course, a common problem). The work is no longer interesting and I have no motivation to rise further up the ladder.<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted to start my own company but I&#x27;m not sure how to go about it. To maximize my chances of finding a cofounder with an idea or someone who would work on my idea with me, I&#x27;m considering joining an early stage startup. I assume I would find way more like-minded people and be far more likely to find someone to start something with. Joining a startup also ensures I learn the necessary skills to build one. However, this would mean leaving quite a bit of money on the table and forgoing all the connections I would make at FAANG.<p>I know &quot;starting something&quot; is an arbitrary goal, but one that I work on consistently with side-projects. But again, since I&#x27;m at a FAANG with coworkers who aren&#x27;t interested in entrepreneurship, it&#x27;s hard to not get exhausted by the menial labor during work hours. It&#x27;s extremely hard to find people who want to think about startup ideas at FAANG, would be great to get recommendations on how to go about this at FAANG.<p>There&#x27;s also one additional, critical downside of staying at FAANG: any side-projects I work on that could later turn into a full blown company could potentially be owned by my current company due to contract clauses.<p>I have a few options, but would love to get everyone&#x27;s opinions:<p>1. Stay at current company (and even switch teams), start networking on the side, continue spending some time on side-projects<p>2. Leave and just start working on side-projects full time<p>3. Leave and join an early stage startup<p>What do you think would optimize my chances of some day finding a cofounder &#x2F; starting a company? Would love to also hear from people who found themselves in similar situations. Thank you!')
