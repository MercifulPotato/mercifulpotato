If I receive an RSU grant that vests over 4 years, it&#x27;s not just because the company hopes I&#x27;ll stay that long but primarily because the company hopes that will align my incentives with the shareholders&#x27; incentives. If I work to make the company better over a multi-year period, we all win together. If they instead just give me the equivalent value in cash salary, my incentive is to extend my term of employment, not the value of the company.')
