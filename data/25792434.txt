That said, I still use Vivaldi for all my online banking on desktop and I use Vivaldi as secondary browser on mobile to browse reddit or other social media platforms.<p>I have several browsers installed on my Galaxy S7: Firefox, Vivaldi, DuckDuckGo, Naked Browser, and Chrome. Out of all these, Firefox is the worst performing and nearly unusable it&#x27;s so slow and causes overall system slowness. Vivaldi and Naked Browser are the quickest and least resource intensive. Chrome is a few steps better than FireFox with DuckDuckGo somewhere in the middle. 90% of the time I used DuckDuckGo for general browsing though due its privacy tools.')
