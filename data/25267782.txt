Very few copies are printed, but they serve as an important means of preserving this knowledge, and books that do not survive a single reading do not instill confidence in the longevity of cheap print on demand. They aren&#x27;t any less expensive now either. I also buy most books used, often to avoid these terrible newer printings.')
