Item(by='apostacy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602267661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24730871, text='&gt; I understand the gut feeling to be suspicious of any large org to filter information. People on this very thread are screaming &quot;censorship!&quot; as if they were Orwell in the streets warning us the end is nigh.<p>I mean, these companies have a monopoly or near monopoly on communications, and they have openly said they are going to arbitrarily remove information that they don&#x27;t like, without any kind of transparency or accountability.<p>Is the fact that congress is not enacting a law supposed to mean that it is not censorship, and that we can&#x27;t complain about it?<p>Would you be ok with other private networks doing it?<p>Besides, if we must have censorship, could we at least have someone more deserving of our trust do it? These policies of removing &quot;fake news&quot; greatly worsened COVID-19. As late as February, they were removing &quot;disinformation&quot; that it was infectious human to human.<p>Telling someone to mask up in early March could get you banned.<p>Posting first party evidence of the chaos in China in January could get you banned. It was fake news and disinformation. They were protecting us.<p>These companies should be begging us for a second chance to filter the truth for us.<p>Not just are these companies fallible, but they also have a very obvious neoliberal agenda. I&#x27;ve watched every single progressive podcast I liked get shadowbanned or outright removed from every major platform over the last year.<p>Why are people so eager for this?')
