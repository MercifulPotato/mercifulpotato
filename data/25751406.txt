My critique was a bit misdirected.<p>I guess what is behind it is my frustration and anger with the increasing widespread acceptance of black box computing devices - which are supposedly ‘user controlled general purpose computers’, yet are increasingly not, and which are instead actively spying on us and policing us in a million different ways.<p>[Edit: what follows is an articulation of various things I’m currently witnessing (a stream of consciousness), as well as frameworks I’m currently learning to apply, that I want to record for myself and others - potential allies who are concerned with this as well]<p>I’m angry that our overall tech and science literacy is constantly decreasing. I’m angry that a lot of things are getting more and more locked in (Tivoization), blocking learning and making it increasingly unfriendly for beginners<p>What this looks like in practice is that the essential&#x2F;necessary ‘ladders‘ to learn and accomplish something (the age and current-skill level -appropriate materials or tools&#x2F;technologies) are kicked away, with those who kicked it away (locking it away) claiming that they did not use those ladders themselves. They instead claim others can follow in their footsteps - without having, or being given, access to the very same ladders they needed to climb up themselves. This is bourgeois gatekeeping. There’s a book written about an economic theory by economist Ha-Joon Chang, called ‘Kicking Away The Ladder’, that I believe illustrates this well:<p><i>“How did the rich countries really become rich? In this provocative study, Ha-Joon Chang examines the great pressure on developing countries from the developed world to adopt certain &#x27;good policies&#x27; and &#x27;good institutions&#x27;, seen today as necessary for economic development. Adopting a historical approach, Dr Chang finds that the economic evolution of now-developed countries differed dramatically from the procedures that they now recommend to poorer nations. His conclusions are compelling and disturbing: that developed countries are attempting to &#x27;kick away the ladder&#x27; with which they have climbed to the top, thereby preventing developing counties from adopting policies and institutions that they themselves have used.”</i><p>The two main strategies originally used by the global north as they developed, yet which global south countries are now denied access to in north-south relations, are: <i>protectionism</i> and <i>government subsidies</i>.<p>The exploitation that happens today on a large scale between north-south, seen in the way global south countries are plundered and abused by the global north capitalist firms and governments, is the same phenomenon that we see (on a smaller scale) in the global north capitalist education system, where rich capitalists can get their children tutoring and give them much more patience and attention (as well as opportunities to take over a family business or other non waged intellectual labor - in opposition to waged manual labor - and a chance to develop favorable relationships  with other capitalists) than parents of working class children, perpetuating antagonistic class relations.<p>-<p>Also I shouldn’t be talking about MacOS internals (SIP, etc.) because I don’t know enough about it yet.<p>Thanks for clarifying, and no, please do not wear any such badges!')
