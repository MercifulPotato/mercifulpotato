Those sweet pepers are much larger than the ones grown on soal. But the only difference is the taste and the thickness of the skin. They might even be a little more healthy because they were grown in a lab like controlled environment.<p>Imho the taste is a big trade-off, but growing them on water takes way less space and also makes a failed harvest less likely.')
