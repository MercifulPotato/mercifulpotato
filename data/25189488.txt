Buffer is already part of the standard library for nodejs. What this is, is a &quot;safe&quot; variant of the very same buffers, as the previous ones were found unsafe. Although if you&#x27;re controlling the runtime, there is no need for safe-buffer package anymore, as Buffer from the standard library is now safe. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;buffer-constructor-deprecation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodejs.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;buffer-constructor-depreca...</a> for all information around nodejs &quot;safe&quot; buffers. Feross&#x27; library is mentioned there as well.')
