Real estate would effectively never appreciate, so no one would hoard it. If the tax is 0%, then it&#x27;s a completely &quot;free&quot; market. Anything between the two just reduces the ROI.<p>Since a high ROI in the short term promotes speculation (and <i>not</i> development), it seems like this would reduce speculation and the likelihood of bubbles forming.<p>Of course that&#x27;s a ridiculously oversimplified view. There are a zillion different ways to stack this, which is what would happen in any case. To spur development and not just buy-and-hold, the law might be written to exempt certain kinds of improvement costs.')
