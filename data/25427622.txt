Bubonic plague CAN be spread by (fleas on) mice or rats. But historically it was not, at least not in Europe. The most recent outbreaks in Europe in the 19th century were carried by lice. We know this for certain. Looking back at historical outbreaks in the Middle Ages and early modern period, the information about how the plague spread is consistent with lice, not rats as the vector. For example, people sharing the same bed and sheets get sick, but not people in adjoining houses sharing the same walls and garden. The outbreak of the great plague in London is not near the quarantine docks as one would expect, but rather a poor area on the completely other side which was known to be a site of prostitution. It then spread largely along class lines through communities with poor hygiene, largely skipping affluent areas even when there was nothing that would have prevented rats from moving through.')
