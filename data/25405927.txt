Those features should <i>always</i> get “first cold press” treatment; even if they aren’t particularly challenging or difficult.<p>That way, even if the technical “whizzy-bang” stuff goes pear-shaped, or takes longer than planned, a viable MVP is still available, to generate funding and support for continuing development.<p>It’s amazing how often this fundamental approach is ignored.')
