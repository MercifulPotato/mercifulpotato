You want to get rid of that &quot;Schuld&quot; asap. Even if it&#x27;s an Euro you borrowed for an Einkaufswagen.<p>Than there is the &quot;credit&quot; for things you should actually pay from money you have or otherwise not buy at all. Like a fridge or a TV or something like that. You usually don&#x27;t go around and tell other people that you did that. You pretend that you actually paid for it and that it&#x27;s yours. This is also where US debt-culture comes into Europe though. You can see for years now that shops encourage going into debt for those kind of products. They try to normalize it because it&#x27;s easy to hide and pretend.<p>Third are really big investments like a house or a business. Taking a credit there and discussing those with your friends and relatives is nothing that is frowned upon. Nobody expects you to have that kind of money (and if you had, you&#x27;d probably not admit to it).')
