I&#x27;m staggered how many bugs there are though. I run into one about every five minutes. So far off the top of my head:<p>- NPCs floating in space<p>- NPCs walking through solid objects<p>- NPCs randomly spawning in view<p>- I have a gun that wont fire if I use a scope on it<p>- I have another gun whose model disappears in car chases<p>- Some objects have meshes that duplicate (cigarette floating in space while the character is also holding it)<p>- Randomly getting flagged by the cops for a crime when im literally just walking around with my weapon holstered<p>- Quest goals not registering&#x2F;having to repeat certain actions<p>None of these are like a huge deal, sometimes it&#x27;s even really funny, but dear god is it incredibly buggy.')
