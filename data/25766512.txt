After some time thinking, I would say it&#x27;s not the way to go.<p>Let me tell you why. You probably would improve your communication skills, but I think there are other more effective and less risky ways to improve your social skills.<p>1. Maybe you would benefit from visiting therapist. After few sessions, you may understand yourself better and you&#x27;ll be also talking therefore improving your communication skills. It&#x27;s really interesting and effective way to know yourself.<p>2. As others mentioned - Toastmasters. You&#x27;ll get used to giving speech in front of people which will significantly improve your overall social skills.')
