I don&#x27;t see on what basis you&#x27;re concluding that somehow grandparents were more grateful and the current H1B workers are less so. It seems purely anecdotal at best, and more likely a declinism bias. Regardless, why does it matter whether H1B people feel grateful or not for US ? It may matter for their own mental health, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t for the rest of us living in this society - what matters is whether they can support themselves, and whether they follow the law and integrate with the society.')
