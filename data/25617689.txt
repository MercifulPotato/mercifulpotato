Item(by='berkut', descendants=None, kids=[25619391], score=None, time=1609630153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25617360, text='The line I&#x27;m drawing is high-end VFX &#x2F; CG is still IMO years away from using GPUs for final frame (with loads of AOVs and Deep output) rendering.<p>Are GPUs starting to be used at earlier points in the pipeline? Yes, absolutely, but they always were to a degree in previs and modelling (via rasterisation). They are gradually becoming more useable at more steps in pipelines, but they&#x27;re not there yet for high-end studios.<p>In some cases, if a studio&#x27;s happy using an off-the-shelf renderer with the stock shaders (so no custom shaders at all - at least until OSL is doing batching and GPU stuff, or until MDL actually supports production renderer stuff) studios can use GPUs further down the pipeline, and currently that&#x27;s smaller scale stuff from what I gather talking to friends who are using Arnold GPU. Certainly the hero-level stuff at Weta &#x2F; ILM &#x2F; Framestore isn&#x27;t being done with with GPUs, as they require custom shaders, and they aren&#x27;t going to be happy with just using the stock shaders (which are much better than stock shaders from 6&#x2F;7 years ago, but still far from bleeding edge in terms of BSDFs and patterns).<p>Even from what I hear at Pixar with their lookdev Flow renderer things aren&#x27;t completely rosy on the GPU front, although it is at least getting some use, and the expectation is XPU will take over there, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite ready yet.<p>Until a studio feels GPU rendering can be used for a significant amount of the renders (that they do, for smaller studios, the fidelity will be less, so the threshold will be lower for them), I think it&#x27;s going to be a chicken-and-egg problem of not wanting to invest in GPUs on the farms (or even local workstations).')
