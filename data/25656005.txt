And I just began doing it myself, probably with a small amount of guidance from him around the mechanics.<p>I ended up getting pretty good at prose by the time I was 9 or 10 and wrote a novella when I 14 (which was thankfully never published or distributed!). I don&#x27;t write for a living but the skills stayed with me and of course have been very useful in all kinds of avenues.<p>I think, though, that if I had been encouraged to do 90 minute learning sessions with my father, I wouldn&#x27;t have been so interested. There was a joy in finding my own path into that world, and if&#x2F;when I do have children of my own this is something I will keep in mind that there&#x27;s a fine line between sparking interest, and trying to force an interest.')
