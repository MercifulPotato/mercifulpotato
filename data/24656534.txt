You definitely could, and maybe discount the appreciation by some pessimism factor to account for some possible future situation where housing values get get in half.<p>For me it&#x27;s a lot easier to think about if I just live somewhere where a house in 30 years will (inflation adjusted) cost very roughly what it does today.')
