For example if there&#x27;s some bug in libc++ that&#x27;s not something I can overlook when evaluating the M1.<p>There was another comment here that was deleted that accidentally showed the output of running x86-64 go on the M1. That&#x27;s another weird risk at the user level, that you may unknowingly run the wrong binary through rosetta2 instead of running the native one.')
