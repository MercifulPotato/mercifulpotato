I am opening all the envelops one after another and found that they are distributed 50&#x2F;50 to red&#x2F;blue.<p>Same if my friend is opening the envelops.<p>Now for all the opened envelops if I have got 10 red balls. Now if my friend open the paired envelops, he will probably get 7 blue and 3 red.<p>My observation of the balls had an effect on his side and shifted probabilities on his side.<p>If that&#x27;s what you mean, what does observation or measuring even mean? How do the balls know the envelop has been opened.')
