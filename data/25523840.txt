(maybe one out of every 20-30 songs) I will discover a shiny new gem of a song that really resonates with me.<p>SoundCloud Weekly[0] recommendations have been solid for months specifically with ambient: ~85% Good tracks with ~30% Resonating enough to Favorite. My other contexts &#x2F; use cases include listening by Album and Artist, Genre, Mood- and Mind-Setting, and Discovery.<p>Spotify works well for Albums and Artists. \nHypeMachine is my go-to for Discovery and Genre. \nSoundCloud and BandCamp work well for diving into artists and labels discovered.\nPlaylists and Favorites across these are best for Mood- and Mind-Setting, as are &quot;special purpose&quot; options like Brain.fm and Ragya.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;discover&#x2F;sets&#x2F;weekly::[username]" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;discover&#x2F;sets&#x2F;weekly::[username]</a>\n[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ragya.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ragya.com&#x2F;</a>')
