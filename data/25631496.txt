If the leadership is good, it is very efficient and effective. Unfortunately based on thousands of years of examples, good leaders are rare. Without checks on power, bad leaders can tear a country down at lightening speed. Democracy is absolutely a messy government and it is frustrating to watch the glacial speed and bickering. It is also a very stable government that checks the worst impulses of the human lust for power. It keeps the power-hungry chasing each other&#x27;s tails and away from the ship&#x27;s wheel.')
