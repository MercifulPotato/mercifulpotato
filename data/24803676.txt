For example, dog implies &quot;likes dogfood&quot; is a reasonable thing to say, but &quot;doesn&#x27;t like dogfood&quot; certainly includes dog outliers who only eat, say, kitchen scraps, and refuse dogfood.  So no, a implies b doesn&#x27;t let you say not a implies not b, given the normal definition of &quot;implies.&quot;<p>I suspect though that this is the kind of quibbling that will quickly pass the interview test; you say something about dogfood and colloquial use of _implies_, the interviewer says &quot;oh no, we&#x27;re talking about formal logic where implies means...&quot; and you go on from there.  And frankly, that&#x27;s the kind of interview question that&#x27;s useful, since if you assume that marketing people use the logic definition of &quot;implies&quot; you&#x27;re going to be in all sorts of pain in real-world meetings about developing software.')
