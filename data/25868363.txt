That few details I added were the minimum that belonged in this story - and it was far from everything that was needed.<p>I&#x27;m not calling out the NYP here. Nearly every US news org is equally inept and lazy, no matter their ideology (real or perceived).<p>I acknowledge that not all orgs are like that. And often disappointing news outlets sometimes perform absolutely brilliant journalism (eg: Panama Papers).<p>But most basic reporting is just put out there, without even  minimal vetting of details.
