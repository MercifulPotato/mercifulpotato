The F5 great is you want to have to bother with electronics (I&#x27;m faster without the electronics, but to each his own). Digital SLRs are an example of entrenched technology that doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>DSLR don&#x27;t make sense. The mirror in film SLRs was always a compromise [1] that doesn&#x27;t exist once you have a digital sensor. It was a compromise that became popular, at least in 35mm. The DSLR was a legacy format that was &quot;professional&quot; only because camera manufacturers would put things like big focus motors on mirrorless cameras. Market forces slowed the adoption of mirrorless and gave the SLR a reprieve to their inescapable demise.<p>So in a sense, ya, the F5 is greater than any D-SLR. The F5 is the pinnacle of the SLR, an excellent solution in the film domain. Digital SLRs are compromised format for a solution no longer needed.<p>[1] The SLR lets you see what the film will actually see. +1. The SLR has mirror shake -1, and a film plane that&#x27;s far from the last lens element -1. For small &quot;sensors&quot; like 35mm, it (usually) wasn&#x27;t that big a problem (lightweight mirrors, geometrically smaller distances between lens and focal plane). For medium format, SLRs (like Hassleblad) were neck in neck with other solutions (Rollei, Fujifilm). For large format, I don&#x27;t think there was any SLR made.')
