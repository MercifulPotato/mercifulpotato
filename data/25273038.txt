An international wire transfer would have taken $35 out, and both parties would have had to go to their banks and fill out paperwork. With PayPal, the other party could have just claimed fraud after the task was done and reversed the transaction. With cryptocurrency, the transaction was sent instantly with a fee of less than a dollar, and settled within 20 minutes.')
