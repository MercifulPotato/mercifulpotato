Tube amps do have their own sound, primarily due to higher harmonic distortion and the use of output transformers in the signal pasth.  Whether this &quot;sound&quot; is agreeable to you varies by the individual, but there is certainly no universal agreement that a tube amplifier sounds &quot;best&quot;.')
