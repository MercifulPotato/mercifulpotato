Otto largely reflects that time in my opinion and a lot has happened in the container and control plane ecosystem since then. I respect HashiCorp&#x27;s decision to pull the plug on it. (That&#x27;s coming from someone who works somewhere that takes the complete opposite stance on these things so I&#x27;m fully aware of the trade offs.)<p>I&#x27;ve only skimmed the release blog post for Waypoint but from where I&#x27;m sitting it seems like a &quot;meta Control Plane&quot; which makes it a wildly different tool compared to Otto.')
