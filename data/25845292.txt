Once or twice, okay maybe it&#x27;s the complainer&#x27;s perception that&#x27;s wrong, but again and again, for over a year? Then your damn system has a problem.<p>The least you could do to address it is not let downvotes instantly affect a comment&#x27;s visibility.

Did you lose the source code or can&#x27;t find another Malbolge maintainer to take over?')
