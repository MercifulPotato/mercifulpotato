It is a routine thing in an organisation of just 120 people. Now imagine that instead of an educated and selective group, you are dealing with a pool of desperately partying, drunk globetrotting influencers, political figures with Neanderthal technical skills or other walking security disasters.<p>How often do you think account recovery due to lost 2FA would be triggered?<p>For proper protection you need hardware 2FA, and for usability reasons you <i>really</i> need the NFC enabled Yubikey so the same second factor can be neatly enforced on a mobile phone too. But you can&#x27;t have just one. If the access is for anything non-trivial or of high importance, you need at least two such devices. Preferably three.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of Yubikeys you need to subsidise, because most people sure as hell are not buying them out of their own pocket.')
