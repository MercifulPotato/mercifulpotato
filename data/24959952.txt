Item(by='nimbius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604243453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957200, text='disclosure: I work as a diesel engine tech in a midwestern city.<p>Ive seen and dealt with a lot of tow companies, and a plurality are pretty shady but the worst are the police-centric ones.  Lock-in deals with police departments for example are astroturfed as &quot;the official tow company of $city police&quot;   without so much as an audit.  Bidding almost never takes place for this service model, its just a cop whos wifes brother owns a tow company.  These are generally the worst, as they rarely respond to anything but a parking enforcement dispatcher.  The tow lot is derelect dirt property, and the only thing in the office is a credit card machine and a television.  They exist to collect a fee and send a cut to the city, and rarely employ anyone who understands how to hook up a car safely, just quickly.<p>If you hire a tow driver: look for the words &quot;recovery&quot; or an endorsement from your insurance company.  Avoid AAA towing as shady companies habitually stencil that logo on everything.  If there is a heavy recovery truck with a crane in their lot, you&#x27;re in professional hands.<p>If you&#x27;re being towed:  do not argue shout at or threaten the driver&#x2F;operator, they&#x27;re just paying their bills and if its an &quot;official city&quot; tow company it can get you a quick night in jail. instead document everything you can, take pictures and tak your time if you think you&#x27;re being wrongly towed (it happens.)  keep track of your vehicle after this.  call and check up on it, as some of the shadiesst tow companies will actually send you a letter warning you of an intent to auction your property after a set date if you dont pay.  Somethines this is just a scare tactic, other times its real (im told in Los Angeles they can do this.)  Fighting a parking violation tow should be straight forward at your local courthouse unless the citys come to depend on tow revenue.<p>If you&#x27;re booted:  call the city and confirm it! ask them to confirm the device by its serial number or markings and that information about your vehicles violation EXISTS With them.  If you call the number on the boot to pay your fine, ask the person on the other end when the car was booted, who booted it, and at what time (all of which should be documented by the tow company.)')
