Feel free to change the wording on the proposed CoC from <i>don&#x27;t be a jerk</i> to <i>don&#x27;t be an asshole</i> or something similar, the end result should still be the same: most people will understand what is meant. Some people won&#x27;t but that can not be helped. The more elaborate the code, the more it will be used for other purposes, Fewer words is also possible but even in the total absence of a code of conduct most communities - 4chan et al excluded - will still have the unspoken assumption to <i>not be a jerk</i>. Having this encoded in a code of conduct at least makes sure those other, politically motivated &#x27;codes&#x27; do not get a foothold.')
