They are one and the same. People talk a lot about replacing&#x2F;removing plastic use. What if instead of trying to get rid of its weakness, thus removing its benefit, we make it even stronger. More durable, less shed, more like metal. Thus less micropastics.<p>Short term, this seems like a win without apparent downside. Long term, technology plus policy will eventually solve the recycling problem.<p>Although I don&#x27;t have anything technical to back it up. Just pointing out the direction of thinking.')
