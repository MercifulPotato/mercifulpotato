Cars can handle steeper inclines and sharper turns. If necessary, humans can do very steep inclines and very sharp turns. And they can handle narrow paths. You&#x27;d obviously want to minimize that, but it&#x27;s possible.<p>Since the requirements are different, the possible routes may be different.')
