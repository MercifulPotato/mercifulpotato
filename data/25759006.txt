He was a psychologist and Harvard professor who researched stories of alien abductions and tried to make sense of them from a psychological point of view.<p>To the best of my understanding (do your own research), he hypothesized that many of these stories were <i>true</i>, even if the explanations were not really <i>aliens</i>. They were spiritual and cultural phenomena that people really experienced.<p>&gt; entire schools full of children reporting metal objects landing with beings coming out to communicate with them telepathically<p>You&#x27;re referring to the 1994 incident in Zimbabwe, which Mack famously studied. It&#x27;s certainly an interesting one!<p>I remember going through all the videos on the internet about that incident, and ultimately being unimpressed with the investigation. There were 60 kids at the school, Mack only interviewed a few. Why is that? I get the feeling they actually interviewed many more but cherry-picked stories to fit their narrative. There were also stories about UFO sightings in Zimbabwe in the days leading up to that event, I&#x27;m sure many of the kids had heard about it before they went to recess that day?<p>I&#x27;ve never read any of his actual long-form publications on that incident though (don&#x27;t even know if there are any), so perhaps I missed something.<p>Back to your basic question: &quot;how could all these people be crazy?&quot; I don&#x27;t think anyone knows, and I&#x27;m not sure many people are studying it. But even a super smart Harvard professor couldn&#x27;t make a strong case one way or the other, even after studying a school full of children directly after one of the most compelling UFO sightings in history. So it&#x27;s probably best to move on, assume it wasn&#x27;t aliens, and wait for someone to capture an alien craft clearly on video. Personally I use it as a reason to upgrade my iPhone and get those sweet new cameras ;)')
