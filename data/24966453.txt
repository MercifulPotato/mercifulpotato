Requiring wired keyboard is such a let down and limiting. I would then connect it to my 4K smart TV and also use it as full blown computer! With dedicated app, it can turn any TV to smart TV, picture frame etc with unlimited customizations. It would be like Chromecast on steroids, open programmable OS and a keyboard!')
