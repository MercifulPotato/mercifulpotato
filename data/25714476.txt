It&#x27;s also a common colloquialism among climate change deniers, no? So, if you need to explain to someone how cold weather doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;global warming is fake&quot;, maybe also steer them toward the notion of climate change. &quot;Anthropogenic forcing&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s our fault&quot; is of course another important matter.')
