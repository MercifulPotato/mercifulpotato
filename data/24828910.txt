More forests means more rain.<p>Under the current models we send most of the rainfall immediately back into rivers + oceans. By creating inland forests we get mini little &quot;oceans&quot; to evaporate and move water for a 2nd rainfall. Each cycle the plants + ground hold onto a little, but mostly it can be evaporated and re-rained again and again. Deserts have the issue that they have little to hold onto the water, and to reevaporate it for subsequent rainfalls.')
