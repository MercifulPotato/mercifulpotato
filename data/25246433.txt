Every time a company fails, it&#x27;s a function of one of two things:<p>1. A lack of a product people will pay for, reliably delivered in a way they&#x27;re willing to accept. If people won&#x27;t buy your thing, you don&#x27;t have a business, you have a hobby.<p>2. Poor financial acumen leading to costs being higher than turnover. Unless a business actually turns a net profit, it&#x27;s not a business. It&#x27;s a subsidised organisation waiting to collapse.<p>There&#x27;s a whole pile of ways both of those can go wrong, but it&#x27;s always one of those two. Bad product &amp;| marketing, or poor financials.<p>The may valuable piece of advice I can give is, work out a proper strategy (start with a model like Roger Martin&#x27;s strategy cascade), and then for every thing you plan to do at any point in the business, right down a list of assumptions which would have to be true for the idea to be good. Then try and knock those down with evidence, starting with the most fragile, least likely, most important ones first. Always try and prove your ideas are bad, not that they&#x27;re good. At least then you&#x27;ve robustly tried to kick the shit out of them before the market does.')
