I was also surprised to see Gatsby and Next.js listed in backend, but it makes a weird kind of sense. I think &quot;static site generators&quot; would be a better umbrella, but it&#x27;s a shady distinction for sure.<p>And your summary of Next.js API Routes is correct as well. As an example, I have a site built in Next that needs to be able to query data off of a SQLite database. Back in the old days I would have set up a simple PHP server of some kind… today I might have knocked something crappy together in Node… but in Next, you just point at a route, grab the SQLite database out of the filesystem, and look over your query parameters. It&#x27;s really neat.')
