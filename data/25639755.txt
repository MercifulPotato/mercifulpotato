Thats why the union benefits in terms of health insurance is so important.<p>So imagine a union of software contractors - that union would have no power because anyone wanting to use a contractor could sidestep them immediately by hiring a non-union contractor of which there are many.<p>How it could work is this - imagine you took the top 20 researchers in machine learning and they unionized, and refused to work except under a contract negotiated by the union. If Google wants &quot;that guy&quot; then they have to use that union contract. &quot;That guy&quot; has power, because people want to hire them. That can form an umbrella under which other ML researchers can sign up. Suddenly you can&#x27;t effectively do ML without working with the union.<p>Companies with people like that keep those people under extremely lucrative contracts so its unlikely they would be financially motivated to form such a union. There&#x27;s also the factor that &quot;what even is the top-20 researchers&quot;. In movies you know if you have Brad Pitt or not. But you 100% need as many top people as possible to somehow become union-minded. I&#x27;d hope that this group of Google workers grows quickly. Its great that they&#x27;ve voted to form.<p>Note of course I&#x27;m just spitballing here and am not at all an expert in labor relations or how unions really form or work. Maybe it didn&#x27;t go like that. Here&#x27;s an interesting article thats paywalled, but it at least describes an early unionization and then a big back and forth struggle. It would behoove us all to understand how the labor movement of the 1890s to 1960s came about, because it would appear we are just about to enter such a period.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;3815030?seq=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;3815030?seq=1</a>')
