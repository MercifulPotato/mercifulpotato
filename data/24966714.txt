This means that by using range constraints or similar, there is often an overspecification that can hurt down the road.<p>Furthermore, the possible values differ from location to location as the values travel through the program. In that sense, the possible values are often underspecified &#x2F; underconstrained, even though the specifications are already not simple.<p>This is why I prefer to go with rather little constraints - in a compiled language, you <i>have</i> to specify the physical layout (8&#x2F;16&#x2F;32&#x2F;64 bits?), and I try to specify not more than that in most cases.<p>Then, so much safety can be achieved by placing asserts in strategic locations.')
