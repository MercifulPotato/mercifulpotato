If you have options other than DCA (e.g., a sizable percentage people get some kind of windfall in their life), then carefully evaluate whether DCA is the right way to treat that capital. It usually won&#x27;t be, even compared with dead simple strategies like a diversified buy-and-hold.<p>As an aside: Ignoring any kind of extreme luck, in a field like tech with rapid raises, no matter which investment strategy you choose your nest egg will almost entirely be comprised of funds from your last 5-10yrs of work.')
