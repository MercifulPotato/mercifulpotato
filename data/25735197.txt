The US Government is not a room or a building. A coup is considered successful if it holds power for 7 days; these jokers didn&#x27;t hold power for 7 seconds.<p>&gt; <i>insurrection to overthrow an uncontested democratic result.</i><p>This is overstating from a certain point of view. It was contested in court (and soundly affirmed). Bear with me for a moment - <i>if what Trump was saying about the election were true</i>, we would <i>want</i> this kind of reaction. I think we can all agree that rigged elections are an affront to democracy. It&#x27;s just that <i>this election wasn&#x27;t rigged</i>, as affirmed by courts many times, so the mob wasn&#x27;t acting righteously. This train of thought has some nuance so I&#x27;m not going to be surprised when some folks misinterpret it.<p>There are two things to think about:<p>1) how have we let misinformation get so bad that it ultimately forms insurrection? We&#x27;ve got Snopes, disclaimers on social media, etc - is deplatforming the only thing left to counter fake news that calls people to violent action?<p>2) what are the implications of giving social media &amp; hosting platforms the power to arbitrate what&#x27;s fake news and what&#x27;s not? This is incredible power and without checks &amp; balances it is probably too much for individual private companies to hold the keys.')
