Is Amazon obliged to keep their communications with Parler private? Certainly Amazon&#x27;s customers don&#x27;t adhere to that norm.<p>The controversy here seems very simple. When Amazon alerted Parler to specific violent posts, did Parler immediately remove them, or did it wait to remove them until shit blew up? I don&#x27;t know that I need to care whether or when Amazon alerted BuzzFeed. Amazon says it&#x27;s removing Parler because of Parler&#x27;s behavior, not because of something Buzzfeed reported.')
