I used to use it a lot, and in many respects it&#x27;s just plain better than Xcode. You can one-click install a plugin to use vim bindings, for example, whereas in Xcode you have to strip out the code signature so that you can install a third party plugin for vim bindings because, I don&#x27;t know, fuck you I guess.<p>The problem was that AppCode was always a few months behind Xcode in terms of Swift support, and Interface Builder never really worked right. So the workflow was to have them both open at the same time and constantly switch back and forth, which at the end of the day just isn&#x27;t great.<p>I wish Xcode didn&#x27;t suck, but it does in so many ways. Not much to be done about it.')
