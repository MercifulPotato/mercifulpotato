Takedowns only apply to infringing content itself, not to tools. (Even if the tool <i>were</i> in violation of the DMCA it doesn&#x27;t seem like the RIAA would have standing to pursue it.)<p>That being said, it also seems like GitHub is well within their rights to choose not to host a project accused of violating the law.')
