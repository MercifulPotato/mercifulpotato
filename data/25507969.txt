You need to spend a considerable amount of time preparing to be an F1 driver. If your manager (ie. yourself) decides to sit in F1 driver seat but disregards advice to first get years of experience before doing so, this is only going to end in a disaster. And it will not be &quot;a pitfall&quot; of F1 car.<p>Obviously the problem are managers who misplace their focus. &quot;Microservices&quot; is a shiny object everyone wants to brag about but nobody wants to do the ground work necessary.<p>So I see teams that don&#x27;t even have repeatable build&#x2F;deployment procedure want to do microservices. Why not have repeatable builds and deployments first? This is already going to improve the situation a lot and be basis for further development which may culminate, at some point, with microservices-style environment.')
