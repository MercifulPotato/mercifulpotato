It provides them some tools but it has shown no interest in them as humans or as entrepreneurs. Google may get a lot of hate too, but we remember that they ve built and promoted a lot of open platforms and open source stuff that stayed with us (despite their bad habit of shutting down services). Most other companies acted similarly. Apple is singularly capricious , and their primary appeal is their rich customer base, which  they are waving like a carrot in front of everyone. It&#x27;s only popular in US btw.')
