Item(by='fossuser', descendants=None, kids=[25499463], score=None, time=1608409266, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476251, text='Yeah - this is the real risk with TikTok, not the data (or who hosts the data).<p>Moving the cloud hosted data to Oracle doesn&#x27;t solve the underlying risk.<p>The real risk is CCP manipulating what&#x27;s surfaced via the algorithm to sway public perception or to censor things they dislike. They&#x27;ve already done this explicitly with the protests in HK and Tiananmen Square, they&#x27;ll do it in other ways that suit them.<p>The worst part is with TikTok the manipulation is more subtle, harder to see - are you seeing something because it&#x27;s popular? or because the CCP is interested in you seeing it?<p>Are you not seeing something because it&#x27;s not popular? or because the CCP has told Bytedance to kill it?<p>Moving the data to Oracle misses the point. The data is not important in this case, but the ability to control what the public sees <i>is</i>. Letting the CCP have control over that lever when they abuse it elsewhere: that&#x27;s the risk.<p>This can be an issue anywhere, but the CCP has a terrible track record and no interest in a free press or free speech. What they&#x27;re doing to the Uyghurs and what they&#x27;ve done to HK and how they treat people talking about Tiananmen Square. They don&#x27;t take responsibility for any of it and they do what they can to suppress all of it.<p>It&#x27;s a very machiavellian view and their soft influence on the US and western companies tied economically to China to self-censor or otherwise defer to the CCP&#x27;s interests is alarming.<p>That recent article about Tim Cook killing an Apple TV show written by a couple ex-gawker editors doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Gawker was awful and we&#x27;re better without it, shows glorifying it, or supporting the editors that worked there. This is Tim Cook deciding for himself he doesn&#x27;t want to support those people, it&#x27;s a principled position.<p>The other bit in that article about an Apple rep saying the two things Apple TV would never do are &#x27;nudity and China&#x27; was a lot worse. The South Park &#x27;band in china&#x27; episode was right. This is Tim Cook knowing what&#x27;s expected of him to be able to operate in China - it&#x27;s not a principled position, his hand is forced.')
