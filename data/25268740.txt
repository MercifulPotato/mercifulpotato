But I don’t think that the author was all that interested in getting into Linux vs BSD. Instead, they were more interested in pointing out the problems they had with macOS and how it is moving more away from its UNIX roots. This is a fair point.<p>The larger question of “if not macOS, then what” is almost a throw away in this post. Which, I don’t blame the author for at all... it’s a prickly issue and includes a lot of background context that dilutes their primary point of macOS issues.')
