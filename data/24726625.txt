Just because the legal reasoning is internally sound doesn&#x27;t mean the resulting narrative makes any sense when applied to reality, and it hardly is the only possible internally sound judgement. There is plenty of room for arbitrary semantics (and I would argue actively harmful and ignorant semantics) to dominate the resulting judgement.')
