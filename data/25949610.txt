Have you ever had a user propose a feature, agree to contribute it, and go dark? A pull request says &quot;I did this work, I think you might want to use it&quot;. Even for repos that aren&#x27;t accepting contributions, it&#x27;s better to have pull requests so that users can fork and apply PRs themselves than not have anything. Even if the original organization isn&#x27;t interested in open collaboration and just wants to code dump, the community can still fix their own bugs and if it becomes frequent enough a maintained fork might appear.')
