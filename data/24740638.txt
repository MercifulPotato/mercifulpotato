The worst thing in the world is when you sit down at someone&#x27;s computer to fix their &quot;quick problem&quot; and it takes you forever because you have to figure out their weird keyboard first, or run back to the supply cabinet to get a regular keyboard and hook that up so you can type.<p>But I myself have been using the Microsoft ergo keyboard for 20+ years. Any time I start a new job, the very first thing I do is request an ergo keyboard.')
