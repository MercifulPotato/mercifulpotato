The answer, I think, is No, the distinction does not matter.<p>The consciousness in the machine will think &quot;Wow this worked!&quot; and go on with life in the machine.  The original consciousness (you) will say &quot;well that was dull - look at that machine consciousness having all the fun inside the machine.&quot;<p>But now extend the metaphor.  Is there really any difference - in your perspective as the original consciousness - between the consciousness in the machine (your copy) and the consciousness next to you? (Your wife, husband, friend, brother, or sister).  Or the consiousness across the street?  Or any other consciousness that&#x27;s not you?  Each has its own set of memories that gives it a sense of self.  Each sees the world outward from its own perspective.<p>So really, is there any difference at all?  Either they&#x27;re all totally different...or maybe they&#x27;re all the same......')
