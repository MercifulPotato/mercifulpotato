A lot of futures will work independent of the runtime. E.g. all the sync primitives&#x2F;channels&#x2F;etc from all sources (futures-rs&#x2F;tokio&#x2F;async-std&#x2F;futures-intrusive&#x2F;etc) will work with all runtimes.<p>Then a lot of objects which require a runtime (e.g. an async socket) might still work on a foreign runtime as long as the original runtime is running. E.g. I think you can use async-std sockets from inside tokio, as long as the async-std runtime is also running in the background. Same is true for the other direction to a certain extent, but it&#x27;s a bit more complicated to set up.<p>So overall you will need to understand how the runtimes work and if particular pieces can be mixed and matched. If you don&#x27;t want to invest in that knowledge =&gt; stay on one side.<p>And before someone starts to blame the Rust ecosystem for that: It&#x27;s not really different in any other environment. You can&#x27;t easily mix and match GTK, QT, libuv and boost asio eventloops. It&#x27;s event a lot harder than trying to combine Rusts async types.')
