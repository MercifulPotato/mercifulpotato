More likely I would expect people from Romania to be homeless in Germany. I think some homeless here are (possibly illegal) immigrants who don&#x27;t have access to the same social security measures.<p>But there are also homeless Germans, despite of safety nets existing in theory. I think it is often associated with mental illness and addiction, making it difficult for people to master the bureaucracy to get access to social services.')
