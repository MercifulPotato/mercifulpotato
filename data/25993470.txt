Occasionally, accessories that only go to a different model or brand of that thing.<p>I don&#x27;t have the industry expertise to know how true it is, but I&#x27;ve seen it stated numerous times in threads like this that this is entirely intentional. Supposedly the data shows that a person who just bought a rowing machine is actually quite likely to buy another one (because they aren&#x27;t satisfied with the first one, because they collect rowing machines, etc) compared to most other demographics.')
