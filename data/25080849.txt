If an app gets later reported as malicious, they need to revoke the certificate that has been used to sign said binary.<p>So when you open an app, how else are they going to check whether the certificate is still valid or whether it has been revoked?<p>Can anyone confirm whether this lookup applies to unsigned as well as signed binaries? As far as I know if I build a brand new binary with cargo, and run it, it doesn&#x27;t do any checks.')
