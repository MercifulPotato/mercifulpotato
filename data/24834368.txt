I went to the free 10-day Vipassana meditation course (the Goenka one) and learned how to relax my neck muscles and process the emotions so my neck stays relaxed.  After learning to deal with the root cause, my quality of life has improved.  Therapy also helped.<p>Most neck tension, migraines, headaches, and lower back pain are from emotions.  If your neck tension is due to emotions, I hope you can learn to deal with them and find long-lasting relief.')
