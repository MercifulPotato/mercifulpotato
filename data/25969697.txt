Only the OS package manager should touch system directories. Before using the &quot;--global&quot; flag, think about what you&#x27;re actually trying to do, and what the better way to do that would be. One conventional workaround is to install commonly used tools to &quot;~&#x2F;bin&quot;. Root is not required for that.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s a good idea to keep the username used for development separate from the one used for browsing the web. It wouldn&#x27;t be surprising for rogue npm packages to search for e.g. credit card details. I&#x27;m sure the browsers try to obfuscate that somehow, but how much can they really defend against code that is allowed to read the disk?')
