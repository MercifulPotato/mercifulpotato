Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=[25025869], score=None, time=1604820022, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015629, text='&gt; <i>By comparison, the top quartile hourly fees charged by corporate attorneys with 10+ years of experience is $450 per hour</i><p>I was a seventh year associate at a Silicon Valley law firm when I left for my startup in 2014. At that time, my rate was $600&#x2F;hr. I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper firms out there, but I&#x27;m also sure that rates have gone up in the last 6 years. The figures he quotes for the lawyers that were used ($1,200 for partner, $900 for senior associate, etc.) are about what I would expect legal fees to be at a first- or second- tier firm in Silicon Valley these days.<p>Perhaps the $450 number is based on nationwide averages â€” but if so that&#x27;s not really relevant to the cost of Silicon Valley lawyers. I know I wouldn&#x27;t hire a lawyer around here who has 10 years of experience and charges only $450&#x2F;hr.<p>I&#x27;m not quibbling with the major thrust of the article (I&#x27;m a startup founder, so I&#x27;m all in favor of VCs covering their own legal fees). But when I read the stat above, it made me suspicious because it is so far off from my experience.')
