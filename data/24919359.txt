Elderly usually retire and spend much more time outdoors than those in the middle of life working 8 hours a day. However it is true that elderly absorb at a slower rate and someone already on their death bed and unable to walk would spend more time indoors. Those people are usually given vitamin d supplements though as when you are already sick doctors know you will be deficient and recommend vitamin D.')
