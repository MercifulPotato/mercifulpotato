Power loss over long distances is much more heavily influenced by current (current is squared in fact in the equation) rather than voltage. To say another way, you’ll have a lot less power loss with 50k volts at 100 amps than you would with 250V at 2,000A, despite both having comparable wattage (this is in part why high voltage power lines exist on land). Another reason is that electrical conductors (especially with copper, but also with aluminum and others) are heavy and the higher the amperage, the larger the conductor needs to be and thus the more weight.')
