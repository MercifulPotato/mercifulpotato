I&#x27;ve been WFH remote for a little over 3 years now. My productivity went down a little the first couple years, but it&#x27;s dipped a lot more in the past year, even though I was already &quot;used to&quot; WFH.<p>There was one particular instance that really stood out to me last weekend. I ran into a friend of mine for the first time in a while who asked &quot;How have you been?&quot; to which I replied &quot;Well, it&#x27;s hard to say -- the days kinda just blend together&quot;. He responded, &quot;Yeah, same&quot;. And we sorta just left it at that. Sure we could&#x27;ve talked about specific work troubles or the media we&#x27;ve consumed lately or whatever, but it felt like we already had this understanding of what each others&#x27; lives have been like in isolation since they&#x27;re largely identical, so why try to fake the &quot;normal&quot; conversation in abnormal times?<p>I should add I do have other friends I&#x27;m closer to with whom I have regular conversations about the minutia of quarantine life, but with this particular friend it was like &quot;Well...we got nothing right now, let&#x27;s agree to talk once life becomes interesting again&quot;.')
