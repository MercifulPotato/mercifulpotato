Perhaps read the study and declare whether they control for the aspects you are concerned about? Bearing-less skepticism adds no value.<p>&gt; Also, &quot;countless&quot; studies have shown negative correlations between coffee and human health.<p>I have never seen a study with negative correlation all-cause-mortality for coffee consumption. I&#x27;m sure one could exist, but it&#x27;s a topic I&#x27;ve looked into a good bit, and I think it&#x27;s pretty fair to stay the evidence for coffee overwhelms that against.<p>Funny enough, in your less-than-clever search on google scholar for &quot;coffee disease&quot;, *literally* the first hit results reads:<p>&quot;During follow-up, 102 men were identified as having PD. Age-adjusted incidence of PD declined consistently with increased amounts of coffee intake, from 10.4 per 10,000 person-years in men who drank no coffee to 1.9 per 10,000 person-years in men who drank at least 28 oz&#x2F;d (P&lt;.001 for trend)...&quot;<p>Gee, in this study, which you apparently linked to support the idea that there are studies that imply negative health consequences associated with coffee consumption, coffee seems to be associated with a fivefold reduction in risk for Parkinson&#x27;s Disease!<p>Did you really assume that any hit with both &quot;coffee&quot; and &quot;disease&quot; in it necessarily must  be a study that concluded that coffee caused a disease?')
