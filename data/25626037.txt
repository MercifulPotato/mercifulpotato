You could explain why you think this is any closer to fraud compared to selling anything else and claiming it&#x27;s the best in its class, or what safe-harbor carve outs by whom, or why they matter more than other effects, or what you think should be done to change them, or <i>anything</i> more substantial than &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised&quot;. Oh aren&#x27;t you? Great, cool story bro. Except it&#x27;s not &#x2F;even&#x2F; a cool story.<p>It&#x27;s old man &quot;get off my lawn&quot;. It&#x27;s every tech forum&#x27;s old-man status grabbing which is now approaching Reddit &#x2F;r&#x2F;SysAdmin levels on HN.
