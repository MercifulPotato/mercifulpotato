Item(by='ehnto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608477612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486058, text='This article is conflating a lack of involvement from tech as some kind of exploitation and complicitness in itself, I think that&#x27;s a pretty unfair take. The adult industry is wildly exploitive and I don&#x27;t think choosing not to start a business in that industry should be a mark against someone.<p>I must also suggest that if you&#x27;re looking to SV to use tech to bring ethics to adult work, you&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree. We should be thankful SV hasn&#x27;t stepped in to &quot;disrupt&quot; the industry, with it&#x27;s track record of privacy violations and exploitation of user data it&#x27;s the absolute worst match up for a privacy sensitive industry like adult work. I don&#x27;t think techs lack of involvement is out of the kindness of it&#x27;s heart anyway, I think it&#x27;s a risk avoidance outcome.')
