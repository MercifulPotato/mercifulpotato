I mean, I like Dark Mode in some places (mostly the extremities -- Dock, Menubar, etc) and in games, IDE. I do have dark tone for the IDE but as soon as I&#x27;m typing Markdown or Text, I have a lighter version. This is the same for reading -- I like the old brown-ish background with dark texts.')
