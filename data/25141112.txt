Effectively Apple is &quot;settling&quot; or &quot;bribing&quot; small developers with this change, so they aren&#x27;t compelled to join the antitrust movement led by bigger players.<p>From a business standpoint, Apple is trying to splinter the critics into various factions. A bit extreme analogy but it&#x27;s akin to inciting conflict within the opposition - actually almost textbook monopolistic behavior. Segment the market by offering tiered incentives.<p>This reminds me a bit of the Netflix stance on net neutrality. They were for until they grew big enough and could pay off ISPs. ISPs essentially created the proverbial moat for Netflix.')
