Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604785954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018724, text='&gt; Had the Democrats put up anyone who was less divisive than Hillary Clinton then we are not where we are today.<p>&gt; Likewise this time around, nobody I have talked to seriously voted for Joe Biden on his own merits. They voted for him because he&#x27;s not Donald Trump.<p>That might just be a function of your bubble.  Biden was probably the Democratic candidate with the <i>broadest</i> appeal, which is in fact his own merit.  Biden wasn&#x27;t running for President of California.  He might not have <i>deeply</i> appealed to this or that demographic or ideological slice of the electorate, but if you go too far in that direction with a diverse electorate you risk getting either electable failures that bully the rest of the country (like Trump) or unelectable failures (like some of the other candidates in the primaries).')
