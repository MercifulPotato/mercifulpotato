It&#x27;s like Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy, but applied to teams. You first have to have a functioning team that completes it&#x27;s basic needs (tasks) before you can move on to higher-order objectives such as &quot;growth&quot;, &quot;moral&quot;, strategic objectives, building confidence, training, etc. I think the important point is that the team&#x2F;leadership of that team need to move past that basic point and grow in other needs.')
