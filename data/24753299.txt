The comment I was originally replying to seemed to imply that bail creates a system where rich people can just commit all the crimes they want, forfeit the bail, and then go on with their lives like nothing happened. I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s not at all the case. Just because you&#x27;ve paid the bail doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re free to go and you won&#x27;t suffer any consequences for the crime.')
