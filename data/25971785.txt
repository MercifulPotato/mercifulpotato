Many people don&#x27;t realize for example that the Andromeda galaxy is visually about 6 times the size of the full moon, but just too dim to see. Some of the nebulae I photograph are actually <i>barely</i> visible with the naked eye if you go to a truly dark enough place (e.g. Death Valley).<p>A big part of what I&#x27;m trying to do through photography is to inspire more people to be interested in space, STEM, and also protect the beautiful views that have been bestowed to us by the universe. It&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m quite privileged to have easy access to in California but did not when I was growing up in Asia and later on the east coast of the US.<p>By the way, although although a lot of people have been pointing fingers at StarLink, including a huge swath of the amateur astronomy community, it&#x27;s not actually a huge problem for most photography and observations. StarLink satellites are easily filtered out using even the most basic outlier rejection techniques (e.g. sigma clipping) and their tracks are presumably predictable and known in advance. They are much less of a problem in my experience than planes and assholes with car headlights who deliberately stop by your observing site for extended periods of time. I can&#x27;t comment if there are any research projects affected by them but I imagine that at most they are an annoyance to data filtering and not dealbreaker.')
