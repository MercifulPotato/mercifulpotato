Just install our app to &quot;corp-ify&quot; your phone&quot;<p>* Employer now views your mobile device as containing sensitive company IP and therefore they have the right to snoop on anything on your phone.<p>If you install corp on your phone, Google views it as a right to rootkit your phone, view all your private messages, etc. I learned this the hard way. Whether this is ethical, or legal, I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s one of those things that seem obvious to some and not obvious to others.<p>If your employer expects you to use a mobile device at work, have them pay for your phone and only use it for work purposes, assume that HR can view EVERYTHING on your phone, because they can, especially at a company like Google that has both deep mobile expertise and insane paranoia around things like IP protection and stopping whistleblowers.')
