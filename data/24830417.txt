You would not typically revoke anything - third party trust in that hardware&#x2F;software combination would go away. That might be for example all iOS versions below 14.2, or all iPhones before the A14 chip.<p>If your service cares that much about key policy, you remember the attestations of each key so that you can change how they apply to security policy. That might be, for example, allowing someone to authenticate into a lower security level until they re-register the phone after upgrading their operating system.<p>In that sense, Yubico has a disadvantage in that their security policy does not allow firmware updates, so any firmware compromise will permanently tarnish those manufactured keys.')
