Programming as a job has pretty much ruined coding for me.<p>Recently, I got a chance to build something with hands using wood. All the sudden I remembered the rush and thrill of endless creative possibilities. really got into it, hours passed by. I almost had believed I had ADHD, but all that was gone. I couldn&#x27;t be more focused.<p>Now that i recall in beginning i hesitated&#x2F;delayed going into full time job as a developer, but lack of money + good salary as dev made it the choice. also finding any other job was even harder, in programming like an artist at least you can show what you are. don&#x27;t need as much credentials, shiny work history, etc. Habit of building stuff helped me to have many projects to show skills through.<p>It&#x27;s kinda weird I feel I&#x27;ve more of an academic interest in programming, but with interest in staying up to date with latest stuff.<p>Sometimes I wonder what other roles could I have gotten, i&#x27;ve seen business oriented roles to having it easy. To me they almost look like their entire job is relaying information.  Sure I wont be making a tech salary but there would have been much to gain, one of those things would have been leftover mental energy to enjoy coding.<p>quite a rambling ... what has been your experience.')
