Another for VS Studio, there&#x27;s integration with that which is quite useful to send commands directly. I have all my most of ten work websites on buttons of their own.<p>As mentioned, I also have button boxes however I&#x27;m still working out what the best way of sending commands would be; Joy2Key seem to mess up alt keys sometimes, making it sticky. When it worked it was nice, imagine adjusting text size just twisting a rotary for example.')
