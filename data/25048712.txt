So far though your argument has been that Americans are less civically-minded, and your supporting evidence has been a few people you talked to who mentioned movies and watching American infotainment television.<p>This isn&#x27;t a particularly useful or interesting conversation for me at this point, so I&#x27;m going to go back to work. Thanks!')
