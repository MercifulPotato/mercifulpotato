However ETH&#x27;s launch was conducted via ICO, where people sent BTC in return for ETH, and the exact same launch style was later declared de-facto illegal security sales with companies being penalized.<p>The SEC essentially caved to the crypto industry and said (paraphrasing) &quot;Yes, ETH was launched as a security, but it became &#x27;decentralized enough&#x27; where it is now a commodity&quot;. But gave no guidance on how any other coin could become &quot;decentralized enough&quot; to accomplish the same feat, to the detriment of the US crypto industry which has fallen way behind offshore entities.')
