In such circumstances brain damage is quite likely, and then the disease would indeed be the cause.<p>Fortunately, the group of people that end up on ventilators is not really that large, and I can imagine minor brain damage would still be preferable to death in many of those cases.<p>As a sibling commented, theeffects that won&#x27;t start to manifest until a year or two has passed are more worrying.
