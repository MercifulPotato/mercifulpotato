Here we&#x27;ve had around 2,500 confirmed Covid cases, and perhaps around 10,000 cases in actuality. Nearly all of them happened in the first few weeks of the semester, and now the positive test rate is extremely low.<p>Looking around town, it&#x27;s pretty clear what happened. There are some students that have acted like nothing is happening, partying and drinking constantly. That population has presumably hit herd immunity already. Meanwhile, there are many students (and staff) that are exercising precautions, and not venturing out a lot, and probably few of them have contracted the disease.<p>Now, we can&#x27;t just go back to normal, or else cases would spike among this second group -- but locally it seems that we can afford to relax a bit.<p>And, also, we&#x27;re at 8.8 million <i>confirmed</i> infected -- the actual numbers are presumably much higher.')
