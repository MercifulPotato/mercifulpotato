That makes me extremely leery of claims that gig drivers can make minimum wage ( or more) in those areas. I feel the drivers are basically subsidizing the ride companies profits.<p>Are licensed cabs not serving those areas because it&#x27;s not profitable, or are they not serving those areas because other areas are more profitable and the licensing regime&#x27;s medalion limits mean the more profitable areas won&#x27;t be saturated with (licensed) taxis.<p>Unlicensed taxis could mean less profitable, but still profitable realms are able to be serviced, because there are more taxis. It also makes it more possible to profit because the prices aren&#x27;t fixed, and some of the costs of licensed cabs can be avoided (at possible peril).<p>It does seem like mostly a scheme to subsidize rides (and vehicle leases) by investors, with little benefit for the drivers. I also am deeply suspect of the long term health of the current unlicensed taxi services; but there&#x27;s certainly potential.')
