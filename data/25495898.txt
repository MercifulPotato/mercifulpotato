This reminds me of a game my friends and I created in college: System32 Roulette.<p>It was a drinking game where we would set up a Windows 98 machine and take turns randomly deleting a file found in the system32 folder, then rebooting.<p>If the computer fails to boot sufficiently to allow the game to continue, you lose and finish your drink (and have to reinstall windows).<p>It was pretty fun because windows was quite good and whining and complaining about countless problems but still being functional.')
