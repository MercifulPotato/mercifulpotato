In Type Faster I was creating new lessons with article I wanted to read. In Sublime Text I&#x27;ve used two panels - on left side I had article on right it was my typing space. While Type Faster shows you what word you have to type right now Sublime doesn&#x27;t so I had to memorize as much words I wanted to type to avoid looking back and forth between panels. This is also useful when learning new language, if you are using Duolingo you most likely focus on speaking&#x2F;reading&#x2F;pronouncing words and not on writing so retyping articles in that language is very good method to memorize words.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceforge.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;typefaster&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceforge.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;typefaster&#x2F;</a>')
