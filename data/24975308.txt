Hedge funds will frequently choose to pay that instead of setting up their own scraping operation, because scraping sucks.<p>Not all hedge funds, of course. Some do actively try to reverse engineer your dataset. But you probably don&#x27;t want to work with those anyway.<p><i>&gt; The canonical &quot;sexy&quot; alternative data set sold to hedge funds is counts of cars in retail parking lots from satellite photos.</i><p>I&#x27;ve personally developed forecasts from (ostensibly) public, scraped sources which beat drone and satellite footage of manufacturing facilities. That one Bloomberg article is not representative; satellite footage sounds sexy but it&#x27;s not what most alternative data looks like.')
