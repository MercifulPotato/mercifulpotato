We have been researching this as well for a product.<p>I am surprised to see that so many people have issues with email delivery. Though email delivery can be delayed and in theory there are no guarantees.<p>Have you considered using SMS or a 2FA App like Duo? They should be near instantaneous.<p>The idea of sending this over telegram or signal is a good approach though the costs of Whatsapp messaging would be prohibitive. Even SMS will not work at scale. So really boils down to 2 things<p>(1) Speed - can you service live with delays or provide an alternate?\n(2) Cost - this cannot be tied to the per message cost like transactional or promotional email&#x2F;SMS.
