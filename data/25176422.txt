But assuming you&#x27;ve been locked out of your Gmail account and [as quoted in the linked post &quot;...have years of important emails attached to [the] account...&quot;:<p>1: Don&#x27;t depend on Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter etc. not to suddenly lock you out of your account for no apparent reason.<p>2: Don&#x27;t expect to be able to get through to anyone at Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter etc. who cares about your problem, if it does happen.<p>3: If you do insist on using a service like Gmail, don&#x27;t keep all your eggs in the webmail basket. Access your account via an email client with IMAP. Then, if you get locked out, you&#x27;ll at least still have your email archives and can move on from there.<p>It never ceases to amaze me the people who trust monolithic unaccountable 3rd parties with their &quot;important&quot; data and then compound the issue by not having a local copy to fall back on.')
