Free-flowing highway lanes move people at ~2000 people per hour per direction per lane, and the Seattle light rail has a capacity closer to ~30000 pphd. So light rail is 15x more space efficient than car travel; you might need to build a bridge, but you will generally need to build <i>less</i> bridge. Autonomous cars may improve road capacity but not 15x. More importantly, roads have a very noticeable capacity curve as they become congested and become less efficient; trains don&#x27;t really get slower with crowding, they mostly just get more crowded inside.<p>And I don&#x27;t know, I-90 is kind of a crapshoot (especially on weekdays) when it comes to congestion. Even worse, it&#x27;s bad both ways, because you have both heavy inflows to jobs in Seattle and jobs at the various Eastside centers like Redmond and Bellevue. 520 is much better, but it&#x27;s also tolled, which is also why I-90 is so much worse.')
