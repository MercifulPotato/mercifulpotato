Ultimately if she felt strongly enough about something to indicate she would leave if they didn&#x27;t budge and they felt strongly enough about not budging  to let her go then the finishing date is moot.<p>Edit: also you put the stuff about &#x27;agreeing a leaving date&#x27; instead of &#x27;I will quit&#x27; in your ultimatum to make it clear that you&#x27;re dead serious about leaving and are trying to be reasonable rather than threatening, not because you need next month&#x27;s paycheque.')
