I think some of those things are going on. Other points I&#x27;m a little skeptical about—for example I don&#x27;t believe that the left&#x2F;right divide correlates as strongly with the US vs. Europe as you suggest. Many of the strongest leftist posts we see come from the U.S. and many of the strongest rightist posts come from Europe (to judge by IP geolocation).<p>Your &#x27;no synchronization&#x27; case is tribalism. That&#x27;s certainly happening here, as probably in every large-enough group. Yes, it&#x27;s a significant problem. But it&#x27;s not the astroturfing&#x2F;manipulation problem being discussed in this thread. If your skepticism about &quot;strong defenses&quot; was meant to include this case, that&#x27;s too general.<p>Your &#x27;synchronized&#x27; cases <i>would</i> constitute abuse in HN&#x27;s terms, and if you or anyone notice it happening in the future, we&#x27;d greatly appreciate being told about it at hn@ycombinator.com. Actually, if you can even point to cases where it happened in the past (e.g. &quot;some content [was] getting popular on &#x2F;r&#x2F;rust, or &#x2F;r&#x2F;python, some people there [connected] to HN to upvote it here&quot;), it would be interesting to look back and see whether we detected it and&#x2F;or could do something differently.<p>The one thing I&#x27;d caution is that it&#x27;s extremely easy to convince oneself that these things are happening when they&#x27;re not. Nearly everyone with strong views about this phenomenon is massively deceiving themselves about it—if you&#x27;re only guided by what <i>feels</i> like it <i>must</i> be happening, there&#x27;s far too much opportunity to just project things into the situation. People do this all the time, and it&#x27;s a big problem—as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere in this thread, it&#x27;s actually a bigger problem than the abuse and manipulation being complained about. The solution is to guard against that by always looking for some extraneous indication (i.e. evidence)—for example a thread on Reddit saying &quot;let&#x27;s upvote this on HN&quot;—and to be agnostic in the cases where one doesn&#x27;t have that.')
