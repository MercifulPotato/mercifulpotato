My mx-5 happened to be one of them.  When I confronted him about it, he claimed some passers by called him a faggot and that&#x27;s why he broke all the windows.  No ashtray incentive needed when you&#x27;ve got Crazy to make up for it.<p>On another occasion a homeless person reached into my mx-5 and broke the center console door&#x27;s latch while I was in Safeway in San Mateo.  I had left the back window zipped down with the rag top up as I was going to be quick, nothing was left visibly out.  I came out of the store to see her crawling out from the back window and run away.<p>These happened &gt; 7 years ago, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worse now.<p>Not that I think car alarms would have made any difference here.  People commit petty crimes in broad daylight throughout SF with impunity.  It&#x27;s surreal.  We watched a bicycle chop shop operate in broad daylight for over a month from the CoreOS office windows, SFPD drove past constantly without doing anything about it.<p>Edit:  Just remembered my ex&#x27;s mx-5 had its <i>new</i> rag top cut into for the contents of its center console months after she moved to the inner sunset, parking on the street around 7th and Judah.  That&#x27;d be about 10 years ago.  I&#x27;d just installed that top, still raises my blood pressure to think about it.')
