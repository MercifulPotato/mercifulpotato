He has been racist for a long time.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;trump-r" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;trump-r</a>...<p>Seen this before. When you actually look closely into it is always far more complicated than it is presented and they always omit important information. In many of these examples is someone quoted something he said over 30-40 years ago and they happen to remember everything perfectly. I can&#x27;t remember what I said a month ago on any particular subject. I find a lot of these stories hard to believe.<p>It is always the same pattern, whenever you point pop your head over the parapit and say &quot;Look I think you are being a bit ridiculous about &lt;controversial character&gt;, I think it is a bit overblown&quot;.  You always have people googling every hit piece that ever been written about them (usually by a partisan news outlet) and then you are expected to rebut every claim. I can&#x27;t possibly do that.<p>I will stick to what I said before. I don&#x27;t believe anything any of these media outlets print. This btw goes for both left wing, right wing it doesn&#x27;t matter they all outright lie whether that is by omission or overtly.<p>You people can play team sports if you want. I am not doing it.<p>&gt; Has any other President actively tried to harm states he didn&#x27;t like? Trump has.<p>I doubt this is the case. Most examples I&#x27;ve seenwhere he and one of the Governers were engaging in some Realpolitik.')
