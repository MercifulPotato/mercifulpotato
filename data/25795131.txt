You certainly can compare threads between CPUs and GPUs for fp32 performance, <i>if</i> you have a pure compute workload without divergence. I work on OptiX, BTW, so I’m biased there, but there is also a reason why most commercial renderers are steadily moving toward the GPU. I predict it won’t be long before your statement flips and most CG movies are rendered on GPUs.')
