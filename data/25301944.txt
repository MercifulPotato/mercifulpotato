Item(by='sod', descendants=None, kids=[25303319], score=None, time=1607088139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25297958, text='So on my macbook pro 8gb m1, everything node.js related (thats what I work with, node.js compiled to arm via `npm install v15`) is more then 2x as fast as on ryzen 3900x PC, and even faster as on my i7 16&quot; 32gb 2018 macbook pro. Example: My angular project compiles in 65 seconds on the intel macbook - while fans screaming in terror. And in 30 seconds in the m1 macbook - not even getting warm.<p>So if Intel came with a new CPU that said all my workflows are now 120% faster and power consumption dropped 4x because of a breakthrough (and not 4% year over year like the last 10 years), would you believe it?<p>But because Apple did it, it is &quot;blatantly untrue&quot;?')
