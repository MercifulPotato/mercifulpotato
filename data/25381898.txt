If purchasers as an aggregate did not think that that the service was worth the price, other people would have to drop their rates or they&#x27;d not get business.<p>The fact that their rates are similar does not suggest they&#x27;re colluded -- the going rate is <i>expected</i> to be similar between competitors in a competitive market.  People with higher than average rates will be encouraged to drop their rates when people do not hire them, and people with low rates will be encouraged to raise them when they are swamped with work and are continually told they were the cheapest.')
