Some more questions since you are the person which shows up for esp32 and nim in the whole wide world :)<p>You&#x27;re welcome. lol, no one else did it so there you are.<p>&gt; Did you try out the esp-idf 4.3 release yet?<p>No, my work requires stability so I haven&#x27;t tried any of the new esp-idf releases. Nesper does compile with 4.2 if you pass the flag for it, but it&#x27;s not well tested. If none of the major API&#x27;s have changed 4.3 should work.<p>It would be good to wrap the mqtt aws service. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have time for it though. But it&#x27;s really not too hard to wrap using `c2nim` on the header files. PR&#x27;s welcome! :-)<p>&gt; Do you have any thoughts on Freertos vs Zephyr whilst using Nim?<p>I would like to try Zephyr sometime. FreeRTOS is used by AWS and the esp32 so it seemed a good start.')
