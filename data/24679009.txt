I mean, with full doses the reported benefits are things like connecting with the thread of the universe and speaking across planes to dimensional beings that inform you that we&#x27;re all one, but the word fractal is jammed in there somewhere. I&#x27;m not saying these people can&#x27;t have fun, but pulling THAT experience back to just reduced levels of the drug is probably still going to give terrible accuracy for self reported results.<p>Microdosing reminds me of those people who left high school parties saying it was fine because they drive better drunk, or that they took some coke to balance it out.')
