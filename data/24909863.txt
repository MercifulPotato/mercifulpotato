The structure you need to represent something like<p><pre><code>    lea eax, [eax + eax * 4]\n</code></pre>\nis tree-shaped. It&#x27;s not as general as many other parse trees, since you don&#x27;t have arbitrary nesting. But it is a tree-shaped thing that represents a parse, and if you need a name for it, &quot;parse tree&quot; is reasonable. The list containing all the labels&#x2F;instructions&#x2F;whatnot in the program is also a trivial tree.<p>(I&#x27;m aware that RISC-V addressing modes are probably simpler than the x86 example above.)')
