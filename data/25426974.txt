I checked out your landing page, but I still don’t know exactly what your product is or what it’s for. Defining it in terms of other services doesn’t give me a clear picture of what it is or compel me to use it. Showing some use cases or examples might help. (The google sign in is also a dealbreaker for me, but I’m still curious as to what this is.)')
