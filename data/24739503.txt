Item(by='exikyut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602342848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726043, text='When my local public transport (bus+train) did a major-ish route overhaul, routing directions on Maps glitched out for a couple days and showed large &quot;black spots&quot; (maybe 5-15mi in size?) where regions of generally accurate&#x2F;useful routing were slapstuck together with large straight lines that cut diagonally through backyards, houses, major highways, etc (and sadly didn&#x27;t account for runway room so weren&#x27;t even flyable). So in a scenario where you were zoomed out enough to see 2-3 towns, you&#x27;d get a complex route shape in one part of the map, another complex route shape in another part of the map, then one single &quot;nope I can&#x27;t  do this&quot; giant line connecting the two regions. The giant line often connected to the complex shapes at awkward angles, eg 60-70Â°.<p>Unfortunately IIRC most of the screenshots I took show my actual address&#x2F;immediate surrounding area etc, so they&#x27;d be fairly heavily censored. If anyone [is actually reading this and] is especially interested,  I can try braving my scary not-organized screenshot archive and try and find them.')
