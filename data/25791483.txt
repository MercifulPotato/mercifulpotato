Vendors respond to proposals with complete bespoke solutions that may or may not integrate well with existing infrastructure design, and then some of those vendors are actively resistant to changes that integrate them in.<p>It&#x27;s really fun explaining to a vendor that 1. A system is going to be domain-joined so it can be managed and monitored. 2. The users will not have administrative rights to the machine. 3. The vendor will not have the ability to remote access the machine whenever they want. 4. Security software and policy settings will be applied to the machine. It continues to amaze me how often these four items <i>absolutely blow the minds of the vendors I&#x27;ve dealt with</i>.')
