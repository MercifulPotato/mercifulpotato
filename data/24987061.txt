Koenigsegg, the supercar company, manages to make a decent profit producing and selling cars that have production runs of less than a hundred units, and they&#x27;re only moving up to 300 units on the latest model. I think you can run a viable automotive business selling a <i>tiny</i> number of cars to very wealthy collectors.<p>In the case of Klein Vision, those will be aircraft collectors as well as car collectors, so maybe the market can sustain them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koenigsegg#List_of_models" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koenigsegg#List_of_models</a>')
