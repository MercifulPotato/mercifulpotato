Can you really load files onto it as a connected storage device?</i><p>Yes, all Kindles.<p>The remaining annoyance is that besides PDFs and a few other document file formats, the Kindles don&#x27;t read standard EPUB format ebooks, only .mobi or .azw ebooks.<p>That was kinda sorta okay when the Kindle first came out (Amazon got .mobi through their acquisition of Mobipocket, and .azw is mostly the same format), as at the time practically every e-reader device had it&#x27;s own proprietary format, but since then everyone has converged on the EPUB standard with Amazon the lone holdout.<p>Thankfully, Calibre can automatically convert ebooks of whatever format to .mobi when transferring from your library to a Kindle.')
