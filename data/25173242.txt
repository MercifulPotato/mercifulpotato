Lets look at the Spanish flu in US - the US wasn&#x27;t ravaged by WWI&#x2F;revolutions&#x2F;rebelions, didn&#x27;t have systemic hunger, etc. and had time to and implemented some of those measures like quarantines&#x2F;lockdowns&#x2F;masks, so very reasonable to compare to today. Spanish flu killed 700K in US . Covid already 250K in US - even if we imagine that we&#x27;re at  the peak today, it still means end number like 500K.')
