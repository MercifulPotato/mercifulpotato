Intense social pressure to interact with people who _do_ take part in the existing system means you have to partake in the existing system to interact.<p>My friends use Messenger so I need a facebook account, or my family uses WhatsApp so I need a non-rooted android phone.<p>No mainstream messaging apps support federation and many are hostile towards reverse engineering.  WhatsApp for example will permaban accounts who do not use official clients in the name of &quot;security.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t notice because you have already excluded anyone who chooses not to use a mainstream Android or iOS device.  Or anyone you know who _would_ like to make that choice doesn&#x27;t, cause they don&#x27;t want to be that one friend who can&#x27;t be reached as easily as the rest of the group.')
