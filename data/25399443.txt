The way we do AI today is that we have a static dataset, train a fuzzy function and then let it do work in production. The production model doesn&#x27;t identify when it makes mistakes and update itself like every animal does. Ants does this. They don&#x27;t do it perfectly, but they do it.<p>So the way I see it until AI starts meaning only models that updates themselves as they evaluate input it is a pointless term. Currently basically every single instance of AI you see people talk about are just dumb immutable functions.<p>Edit: And to clarify, I believe it is impossible to reach human level intelligence without having a model that mutates itself as it tries to solve the problem. Humans are smart since we learn while doing, not that we first take a long course before we start doing.')
