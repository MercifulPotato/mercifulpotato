Traditional media (newspapers, TV, etc.) tend to be pretty honest about it from my experience but on social medias pictures of protests are almost always instrumented to make it appear as though something had way more support than it actually has.<p>And I&#x27;m not talking about sligh misjugdments, I&#x27;m talking being off by one order of magnitude.  \nIn your typical picture of a protest taken with a smartphone from a high-rise building there is at most 5 to 10k people in the shot. Yet you&#x27;ll often find such pictures on social medias labeled &quot;100s of thousands in the street protesting for [whatever]&quot;.<p>And for someone who&#x27;s not particularily paying attention it&#x27;s easy to be manipulated because we really have no frame of reference for what thousands of people look like, let alone tens or hundreds of thousands.')
