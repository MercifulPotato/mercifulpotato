MS started making their games I believe 4.8gb in size and all the pirates could only buy DVDs which were smaller as nothing bigger was actually available. The first thing pirates did was truncate the games and removed some padding so they could fit all the security features the disc required to play and remain stealth. Then MS found a way to detect truncated discs and many people were banned. Then one of the 360 main hackers came out with a genius idea to take the discs we could buy and modify the firmware to a certain brand and model of DVD burner to allow the burner to burn right to the outer edge of the DVD. This was possible because all dvds are actually slightly larger then their listed size but standard DVD burners could not burn to the extreme edge. Some burns didn’t write perfect and sometimes you had to burn it a few times before it was stealth. They also had a program to see if the stealth worked and the disc passed or failed. I never did receive a ban and eventually moved to another mod on my 360 that didn’t require discs at all. What a flashback reading this article.')
