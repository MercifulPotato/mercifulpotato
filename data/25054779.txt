Promises were the touted solution to callback hell, async&#x2F;await the touted solution to endless promises chaining. While async&#x2F;await is (tasty) syntactic sugar for promises, I think it’s a real improvement over callbacks - it’s one less argument to every function (because of promises) and I think it’s easier to read: there tends to be less nesting.')
