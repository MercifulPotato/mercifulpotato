A school bus could just have a transmitter to indicate whether its lights are on or not; construction workers could be given road signs that transmit similar signals or better yet use a portal to construct a virtual geofence around wherever the construction is happening before it begins. These are all easily solvable problems in today&#x27;s world; what is missing is the political capital to invest in these solutions despite the insane ROI.')
