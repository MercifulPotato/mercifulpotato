My problem with macOS is the fact that updating&#x2F;upgrading the system crashes a lot of configuration.<p>2) Why FreeBSD?\nBecause I love it :) my company&#x27;s product is based on FreeBSD, my servers are FreeBSD, my operating system of choice for teaching is FreeBSD. The handbook is there, all man pages are well written, pkg is easy to use, it&#x27;s a whole system. Also: ZFS and DTrace makes your life easier. Sure, I can have ZFS on Linux and eBPF, but why learn a new technology when DTrace is rock-solid. FreeBSD is not &quot;just&quot; an OS, it&#x27;s a complete self-hosted development ecosystem.<p>3) WiFi?\nYes, WiFi is not the best, but not everyone needs 100Mbps connection. I have a wired connection at home to use when streaming movies to my PS4 (also a FreeBSD-based system), but other than that, it&#x27;s fine. I will still donate every year so the devs improve it.<p>Apologies for the bad English, it&#x27;s not my native language.<p>Thanks for posting and reading!')
