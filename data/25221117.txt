And this is all occurring at sub-executive levels.<p>In couples counselling, the goal is often to mitigate interpersonal conflict by employing techniques to <i>quickly move</i> the interaction from the &quot;lower brain&quot; (fight&#x2F;flight) to &quot;upper brain&quot; (executive function). The usual techniques prescribed are to slow things down by mirroring the other person&#x27;s words (i.e. restating and asking if they got it right), validating them without agreeing, etc. By doing this, the interaction turns from an antagonistic one to a cooperative one. (I&#x27;ve personally tried applying these techniques to heated online discussions and have had some success).<p>This might also explain why when folks are under stress or under threat, their executive function is impaired -- possibly the brain is spending all of its &quot;budget&quot; on the lower brain.')
