AFAIK, it is impossible to make `_(f&quot;Hello, {name}&quot;)` work - at least without a preprocessor or very arcane bytecode manipulation magic. This is unlike much uglier but common and well-supported `_(&quot;Hello, %(name)s&quot;) % {&quot;name&quot;: name}`.<p>In the examples I&#x27;ve used `_` as an alias for a `gettext` call - I believe this is a common practice to do something like `from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _`.')
