It is the title of the Reddit thread :)<p>Edit:<p>I agree the title is very clickbait-y. I posted to HN because I am curious about thoughts here on the ToS changes. Wondering if HN guidelines in this case allow redacting the title to e.g. &quot;Will people leave Instagram after the latest changes to their ToS?&quot; or something similar.<p>Edit2:<p>Updated the title from: &quot;What&#x27;s up with everyone deleting Instagram over the updated terms and conditions&quot;')
