In the end this won&#x27;t be a story of Robinhood traders making money but rather about how Robinhood traders lost a bunch of money because of internet hype.<p>The narrative about a cabal of rich people &quot;nakedly trying to stop&quot; Robinhood traders from trading is also manipulative garbage. Every reasonable and level-headed explanation of why Robinhood halted trading was about credit limitations, that is in agreement with what Robinhood stated publicly, and now that the credit has been remedied Robinhood trading has resumed. No conspiracy theory necessary. The hype is wrong and, worse, intentionally misleading.')
