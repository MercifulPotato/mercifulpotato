Vulnerabilities can arise only from the cryptographic primitives, from implementation flaws (e.g. insufficient checks), from side-channels exfiltration (such as timing or traffic analysis), or from incorrect user behaviour. Hence, these are the aspects which deserve further investigation and particular care in the implementation and use of this protocol.<p>The basic encryption primitive of MTProto 2.0 is assumed to be a perfect authenticated encryption scheme (IND-CCA and INT-CTXT). Although no attack on this scheme is known to date, these properties need to be formally proved in order to deem MTProto 2.0 definitely secure. This proof cannot be done in a symbolic model like ProVerifâ€™s, but it can be achieved in a computational model, using tools like CryptoVerif or EasyCrypt [5, 2], which we leave to future work. However, even in the very unlikely case that a flaw is found in the encryption scheme, the results in this paper would be still valid: the protocol could be used just by replacing the encryption scheme, and no other changes would be required.<p>[&#x2F;quote]<p>This analysis the protocol, not the cryptographic primitives, which was what get criticized')
