From the linked article,<p><pre><code>    Mr Gevers had told officers he had substantially \n    more evidence of the &quot;hack&quot;.\n</code></pre>\nAn earlier article gives a little more detail, but nothing substantial. From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-55019858" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-55019858</a> --<p><pre><code>    He did not post any tweets or change any settings, but \n    said he took screenshots of some parts of the \n    president&#x27;s account.\n</code></pre>\nIf he has screenshots of private messages, etc, that would certainly prove he had access... but only <i>if</i> Trump or somebody with legit access to Trump&#x27;s account was able and willing to verify them.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t blame this researcher for lacking more concrete proof. He could easily have proved his access by changing something in Trump&#x27;s account, sending a tweet&#x2F;DM, etc. But by doing so he likely would have brought some serious legal issues down onto himself.')
