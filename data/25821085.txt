Users familiar with Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;etc must weight the benefits of Julia against its slow library startup, its cryptic error messages, and its thin documentation.<p>Also, the lack of a community repository for well-vetted Julia libraries can limit uptake by professional researchers who must be able to trust their tools. A real strength of R (in comparison not just to Julia but also to python) is that such a repository exists, and that it has automated testing across a range of computer architectures and versions of R, including not just unit testing within individual libraries, but also testing of related libraries.')
