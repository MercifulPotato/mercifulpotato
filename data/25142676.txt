FTA: &quot;My husband and I said she could have a phone when she turned 14...&quot;<p>People are arguing about everything from extended school hours, excessive homework to climate change in this thread.<p>Could it be that the daughter was raised in a highly sheltered environment and once she hit puberty, she had other interests besides collages, jewelry and sewing?<p>I wrote this in another comment...<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a tale as old as time. Every child is a genius, angel, perfect until they hit puberty. Then we find &quot;rock &#x27;n roll&quot;, &quot;rap music&quot;, &quot;radio&quot;, &quot;MTV&quot;, &quot;television&quot; or other culprits for corrupting our youth. Today it is social media. Tomorrow it will be VR. God knows what comes after that.&quot;<p>The entire article is about an overprotective and controlling mother complaining that her daughter is now a teenager. Instead of blaming rap music, she&#x27;s blaming the iPhone.')
