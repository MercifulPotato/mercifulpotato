Item(by='hamburglar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607136335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310529, text='&gt; being able to spoon-feed input into a program is extremely useful, and is part of the &quot;conversational&quot; CLI paradigm that the authors mention above. Commands that silently block on `stdin` are frustrating, but the right solution is to check `isatty(3)` and print an informational message rather than killing the program entirely<p>This was the one thing I was coming here to nitpick.  I use the &quot;blocking stdin&quot; behavior regularly to pipe copy&#x2F;pasted text through various commands (various openssl subcommands, for example) and would be very annoyed if a program decided on its own that I shouldn&#x27;t be doing that.  At most, it should print a message like &quot;Reading from stdin...&quot; or something on stderr, but even that seems like introducing noise to hold the hands of people who don&#x27;t understand the pipe paradigm.')
