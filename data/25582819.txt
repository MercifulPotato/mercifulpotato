Like most drivers I&#x27;m falsely convinced I&#x27;m a safer driver than most, but still I expect quite a large range (say a factor 10 between 10th and 90th percentile?). It seems reasonable for self-driving cars to be expected to improve safety over human driving for the large majority of drivers, not just half of them.')
