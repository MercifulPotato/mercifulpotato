It has only recently garnered enough popularity to establish successful chains (aside from highly Americanized options like Panda Express, PF Changs, or HuHot).<p>Small, independent, &quot;Ma &amp; Pa&quot; type restaurants vary much more in quality than established chains.  When your only options for Asian food are those kinds of restaurants - and a limited selection at that - it&#x27;s not surprising for bad quality to sometimes be associated with the cuisine.<p>I still have to drive far out of my way to find good Indian food, despite living in a metropolitan area.  Which is a shame, because I really enjoy it.')
