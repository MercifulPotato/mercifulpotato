There are some issues that need to be ironed out with some packages that I use not compiling for some reason on the arm iOS simulator, but that has diverted me to compiling on device which isn&#x27;t much of a hassle.<p>I am not bothered as much by the 16gb of ram, it is still rather usable. What I really bought the machine for was the battery life. I&#x27;ve had it for a day or two and it is amazing how long I can stay away from my power socket. Also this thing runs really cool. I have not even heard the fans spin up once, even during the recent Sydney heatwave (45Â°C).')
