I&#x27;ve had a ThinkPad X in daily use for 6-7 years now, and I&#x27;ve even fallen flat on top of it after slipping on ice going home one winter. It&#x27;s still chugging along. It&#x27;s not the thinnest device there is, but there&#x27;s definitely some kind of an attempt in that direction compared to bulkier devices. (The associated compromises in general are also there.)<p>I have no experience with Apple hardware, but I don&#x27;t think Airs have a reputation of being super fragile either.<p>The thinner and lighter form factor also does have its advantages; it&#x27;s a bit more comfortable to handle when using it to watch video on the couch, for example.<p>Compromised performance is definitely true, though. (Or compromised thermals, or some kind of a compromise on that axis in any case.) Ditto for more or less compromised upgradability and replaceability, which is unfortunate.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want the thinness to end, although striving towards it at all costs is something I would also disagree with, and probably wouldn&#x27;t go for the absolute thinnest stuff there is.')
