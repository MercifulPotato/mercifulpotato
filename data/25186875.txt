Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25189415], score=None, time=1606140501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25184514, text='&gt; And my personal experience is that some percentage of my comments are downvoted immediately and then upvoted to neutral -- as was the case here.<p>But are you not making an assertion about how voting behaves overall?<p>&gt;&gt; Corrective upvotes are a tradition on HN. If you aren&#x27;t being an asshole, some people will upvote you back to neutral if they think you are being downvoted for the wrong reasons.<p>&gt;&gt; You just have to have a little courage of conviction and patience and not start editing your post in reaction to voting or complaining about it, etc.<p>&gt;&gt; HN does a much better job than most platforms of allowing people to genuinely express a minority view -- assuming they can follow the guidelines and not bitch about the voting and not get reactive and inflammatory because of baggage, etc.<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not an easy thing to do, but it can be done here, unlike most platforms.<p>Have you formed this conclusion based on a statistical analysis of the raw voting data on a variety of platforms?<p>If so, can you link to where you obtained these datasets (I&#x27;d like to have a look myself)?  If not, upon what is the conclusion based?')
