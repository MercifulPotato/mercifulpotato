Item(by='roelschroeven', descendants=None, kids=[25603672], score=None, time=1609502781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601953, text='&gt; The focal length numbers printed on an EF or an EF-s lens are the same thing for consistency. The crop factor isn’t included. So if you take a photo on a full frame 5D and also an APS-C 7D and crop accordingly to account for the difference in sensor size you get the same thing.<p>No, that seems to be a misunderstanding. The focal lengths on the lenses are the real focal lengths, not the 35mm-equivalent ones. For example, have a look at the EF-S 24mm f&#x2F;2.8 STM [1] The name says it&#x27;s focal length is 24mm; that 24mm is also printed on the lens. The description says &quot;a 35mm equivalent focal length of 38mm&quot;. So clearly its 35mm-equivalent focal length is 35mm, and its real focal length is 24mm.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usa.canon.com&#x2F;internet&#x2F;portal&#x2F;us&#x2F;home&#x2F;products&#x2F;details&#x2F;lenses&#x2F;ef&#x2F;wide-angle&#x2F;ef-s-24mm-f-2-8-stm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usa.canon.com&#x2F;internet&#x2F;portal&#x2F;us&#x2F;home&#x2F;products&#x2F;d...</a><p>&gt; So what do the numbers printed on the lens correspond to? It’s hard to find but this canon page suggests it’s 35mm equivalent: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.usa.canon.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;index?page=content&amp;id=ART143777" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.usa.canon.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;index?page=content&amp;id=ART14...</a><p>What that page indicates is the crop factor for each camera (i.e. the ratio of its sensor size to a 35 mm sensor, equal to the factor you have to multiply the real focal length with to get the 35mm-equivalent focal length). For the 7D, the table says that the 35mm-Equivalent Focal Length is &quot;Approximately equivalent to 1.6 x the lens focal length&quot;. Let&#x27;s apply that to our 24mm-lens above. 1.6 x 24mm = 38.4mm, which is essentially the same as the 35mm in the description (focal length specifications are not very precise anyways).<p>So it checks out: the number on the lens is the real focal length; to get the 35-mm equivalent focal length you can either look it up in the specifications or simply multiply with the crop factor.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with Canon, but as I presume you can put EF lenses on APS-C cameras (I know the equivalent of that works in the Nikon world). If you compare an EF 50mm lens and an EF-S 50mm lens on the same APS-C camera, you&#x27;ll notice both have the same field of view. Because the focal lengths are the real focal lengths, they behave the same when placed on the same camera.<p>But if you compare an EF lens on a APS-C camera with that same lens on a full frame camera, you&#x27;ll see that it has a wider field of view on the full frame camera (because the full frame camera has a sensor that&#x27;s 1.6x the size).<p>When reading about focal lengths, always make sure to understand what reference the author uses; it&#x27;s often not explicitly mentioned. For example, people often say a &quot;normal&quot; lens (i.e. a lens with a field of view that appears natural for us humans) is a 50mm lens. But that&#x27;s only true for full frame sensors. For other sensors (or films) you need the equivalent: for APS-C (or Nikon DX) it&#x27;s around 35mm, for medium formats it&#x27;s 75mm or larger depending.')
