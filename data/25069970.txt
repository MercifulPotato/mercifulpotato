This generally results in smaller video files with the same quality. As you increase the compute insensitivity of the video encoder you get diminishing returns. 30% lower bitrate might need 10x as much CPU time. That tweet says more about the type of encoder and chosen encoder settings than anything about the hardware.<p>Imagine going on a hike and climbing an exponential slope like 2^x. You go up to 2^4 and then go down again and repeat this three times so you have hiked 12km (4<i>3) in total. Then there is a athlete who is going up to 2^8. He says he has hiked 8km and you laugh at him because of how sweaty he is despite having walked a shorter distance than you. In reality 3</i>2^4 (48) is nowhere near 2^8 (256). The athlete put in a lot more effort than you.')
