It still doesn&#x27;t take 6 months to fix this issue... if they wanted to fix it.</i><p>Just because it was reported as an issue doesn&#x27;t mean it was thought as a bug (or an issue to fix) by Apple. That&#x27;s what they wanted to do. People coded it explicitly.<p>&gt;<i>Deprioritizing it was a deliberate choice by Apple.</i><p>Of course. Why wouldn&#x27;t it be?<p>&gt;<i>From my perspective, the explanation is simple: ContentFilterExclusionList wasn&#x27;t a &quot;bug&quot;, it was a deliberate &quot;feature&quot;.</i><p>Again, of course. Some people complained this was a bug, Apple thought it wasn&#x27;t, the issue remained on the back burner, until some time it was given more consideration and was decided to fix.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is &quot;why this took 6 months&quot; doesn&#x27;t make much sense as a question. Why wouldn&#x27;t it? Unless something is a show stopper or high impact bug, it would take time. Even to be accepted as an issue to fix in the first place will take time. Plus all the internal red tape.')
