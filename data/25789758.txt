You know who else uses fake names and emails and creates multiple accounts once the previous one runs into a checkpoint once it appears to be fake? Scammers and bots. Use your real name, and then lock down your privacy settings to where only your friends can see info about you. It&#x27;d be annoying to your friends trying to remember who &quot;John Smith&quot; actually was all the time anyways.')
