They tried to &#x27;cancel&#x27; Stephen Pinker, hardcore Harvard secular humanist [1] - who will survive the ordeal but much erstwhile reasonable science won&#x27;t get published.<p>&quot;The definition of &quot;cancel culture&quot; seems to have degenerated to the point that it encompasses any criticism of anyone for any reason. &quot;<p>... this is obviously false given the examples above.<p>It&#x27;s an easy lie: &quot;Some people use the n-word, so cancel culture is acceptable in all cases&quot; is the logic implied.<p>But this:<p>&quot;Having someone disagree with you and express that disagreement isn&#x27;t cancel culture, it&#x27;s free speech. &quot;<p>... is the crux of the lie.<p>It&#x27;s fine that people disagree. That&#x27;s probably a good thing actually. &#x27;Cancel culture&#x27; is not about disagreement, <i>it&#x27;s about sanctioning people for having opinions</i>.<p>Nobody is &#x27;up in arms&#x27; that people are &#x27;disagreeing with JK Rowling - they are concerned because of attempts to stop her books from being published, to stop her films from being made, to stop her public opinions from being published. [2] And if she were any less powerful, the campaign would be more successful, in 2020 you need to be a billionaire to have an opinion.<p>Couching the aggressive dismissal and deplatforming of people&#x27;s who&#x27;s opinions are different from yours merely as &#x27;disagreement&#x27; is really a devious and wilful ignorance of the rhetorical goalposts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;steven-pinker-will-be-just-fine&#x2F;614323&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;steven-pin...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publishersweekly.com&#x2F;pw&#x2F;by-topic&#x2F;industry-news&#x2F;bookselling&#x2F;article&#x2F;83771-mission-driven-indies-drop-j-k-rowling-s-books.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publishersweekly.com&#x2F;pw&#x2F;by-topic&#x2F;industry-news&#x2F;b...</a>')
