For a long time US government was able to exploit internal and foreign markets to run deficits, but the &quot;free lunch&quot; has ended. No one wants to buy those treasuries at the proposed rates and volumes anymore. So what did the US government do? If we remove the extra steps, it effectively coerced the Fed to print money and give it to the government. If it&#x27;s a one time thing, economy may handle it, but there is a strong temptation for politicians to keep doing so, which can only end in disaster.')
