Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=[25255004], score=None, time=1606746124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253847, text='I can&#x27;t speak to Germany, but in the US saving from a good but not extremely high-paying job over the past few decades, investing prudently but not too conservatively, maybe having a few moderately good stock wins from RSUs&#x2F;options or otherwise, having bought and paid off a house in a not outrageously expensive area, gets you into that range. Depends of course on how you spend your money, educational expenses for kids, etc.<p>In any case, it doesn&#x27;t require winning the startup lottery or having a $400K salary at Google.<p>ADDED: ~$2m + paid-off house is the sort of range people (typically engineers, non-software) I&#x27;ve had discussions about &quot;targets&quot; with have in mind.')
