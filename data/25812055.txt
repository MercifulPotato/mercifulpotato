Some have a bunch of magic numbers you can use as alternative &quot;second factor&quot;, basically another password for the special purpose of bypassing a real 2nd factor. That&#x27;s of course stupid and dangerous.<p>Then there are those where you can register another 2nd factor, e.g. another Fido-Key, SMS-Codes or recovery email. Those might be better or might be worse, depending on the method and circumstances. E.g. SMS is vulnerable to all kinds of SIM-Cloning and redirection stuff, email is vulnerable to whatever your email might be vulnerable to.<p>The only thing I would accept as really idiot-proof and secure is &quot;go someplace, show a government-issued hard-to-fake ID&quot; (like a passport, not your drivers license...) like banks do. But that only works with physically present businesses and accounts that are strictly tied to one person. And even there, &quot;Joe Smith&quot; might impersonate &quot;Joe Smith&quot;...')
