Earl Kitchener is an evil man. But he acted independently to convert humanitarian refugee camps into punitive concentration camps. The British government itself investigated the allegations, and explicitly put an end to Kitchener&#x27;s abuses after they came to light. The opposition party and subsequent prime minister vehemently denounced his actions.<p>In contrast, Nazi leadership sat in a seaside resort and meticulously planned out the industrial mass execution of millions of people. The entire regime from Hitler down was involved. So while, I&#x27;d agree there&#x27;s a moral equivalence between Kitchener and Heydrich, the Nazi regime itself is far more guilty than the British Empire.')
