There are a couple more &quot;options&quot; than e.g. WhatsApp, but they&#x27;re presented <i>very</i> clearly: &quot;Join millions free on the largest public server&quot; or &quot;Premium hosting for organizations&quot; or &quot;Custom &amp; advanced settings&quot; -&gt; tap the first + free one -&gt; Sign up &#x2F; Sign in with a totally-normal experience after that.<p>Re &quot;you said it was called Matrix&quot;: fair, but I wouldn&#x27;t send people to &quot;matrix&quot; &#x2F; the protocol for <i>any</i> system with multiple implementations.
