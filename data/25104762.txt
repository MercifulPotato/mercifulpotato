Abolish the state or private property? Devolve control into local worker&#x27;s councils or other non-hierarchical means of decision-making?<p>The US, in general, does not have any non-conservative judiciary. <i>Stare decisis</i> by itself ensures that there is a strong conservative streak in the available pool of jurists. So yes, the Supreme court has center-left (Sotomayor), centrist (Breyer, Kagan), center-right(Roberts, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch), and reactionaries (Alito and Thomas), but nobody as far &quot;left&quot; as it has &quot;right&quot;.<p>Historically, for example, William O. Douglas was about as left as the court has gotten, and he was more in favor of environmentalism and ending the Vietnam war than really aggressive left wing concepts.')
