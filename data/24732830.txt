If it&#x27;s about the cost of it (it costs Google&#x2F;Apple much less money to build and maintain an ecosystem so they can &quot;afford&quot; to do it) wouldn&#x27;t that imply that there is a huge market opportunity for someone else to build their own ecosystem and charge less? But maybe because that doesn&#x27;t happen is proof that it may not be &quot;too high&quot;.')
