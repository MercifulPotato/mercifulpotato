Not that much.<p>US courts don&#x27;t follow US constitution literally, and take freedom doing a lot of &quot;interpretation.&quot;<p>My law professor in Canada, who once was a US citizen, and a practicing lawyer in US said:<p><i>â€” US constitution is fairly good at protecting what&#x27;s written in it, for it being near nothing.</i><p>His favourite poke at the US legal system was an example how either Texan, or Kentuckian court managed to establish how &quot;A woman is not legally a person&quot; in a way that did not directly contradict any US law, precedent, or article of constitution. And that happened as recently as sixties, if not seventies.')
