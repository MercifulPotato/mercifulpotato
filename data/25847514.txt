If one have a variable that is an index into an array, then it is natural to initialize it to an invalid index like -1. But in Go everything is initialized by default to 0. So to get -1 one needs extra code.<p>With one-based indexes zero would be a very natural invalid value as an index similar to a null pointer.')
