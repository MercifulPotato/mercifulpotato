This time, it&#x27;s probably a handful of people who had critical mass and the mass is following suit.<p>If you analyze and act on a market based on an analysis, you are manipulating the market, period. HFT for example happens at time scales never conceived before and are almost undoubtedly market manipulation. The only way not to manipulate the market is to not interact with it.<p>It really becomes this arbitrary pointing game where subjectivity is thrown into play and favors are called as to who is or isn&#x27;t breaking the rules.
