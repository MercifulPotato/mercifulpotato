Corporations are \n    part of the government regulatory apparatus system.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m intrigued. (That&#x27;s not sarcasm)<p>What&#x27;s the libertarian alternative? What are examples of situations where removing the liability shields would encourage more beneficial behaviors from corporations?<p>It seems to me that corporations, minus the liability shield, would still be nearly as potentially dangerous. They are more or less sociopathic entities by necessity; ceasing to exist if they cease to turn profits, a thing they can only do if they compete successfully against their equally sociopathic rivals. Corporations can of course behave responsibly and generously, but this is always going to be at odds with their fundamental mission.<p>(While all of this sounds anti-corporation, I&#x27;m not. Private enterprise is and should be the backbone of society. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s awfully destructive, unchecked.)')
