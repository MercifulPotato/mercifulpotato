It&#x27;s forecasting.<p>That&#x27;s not my point. The point is people don&#x27;t give away <i>predictive edges</i> for internet points (or reputation). There are many reasons why but the lack of a betting &amp; trading StackOverflow is one symptom. It&#x27;s just an example, but TBH it&#x27;s not that relevant since this market wouldn&#x27;t involve revealing edges.<p>&gt;People go near real money strategies like that all the time.<p>Absolutely, and it&#x27;s a problem with real funds. But:<p>- It&#x27;s a lot rarer.<p>- There&#x27;s a much stronger incentive for other people to quietly take the opposite sides of those bets, which normalises the market.<p>We&#x27;ll see what effect it has, but I think this marketplace will just end up following the values on PredictIt.')
