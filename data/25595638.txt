Also, it&#x27;s very selective memory.  Why did you not include the data point of 1920&#x2F;1921 contraction where they did not go off the gold standard and the economy snapped back?  In relative terms, the contraction bottomed out worse than the &#x27;29 contraction.<p>This &quot;recovered faster&quot; talk is all insane.  All of the metrics you are using are basically metrics that apply to the top maybe 10% of income earners.  The only metric that maybe applies to the rest of us is &quot;employment&quot;, but who can know anymore, as the real returns to labor have been totally distorted, and in a lot of ways employment numbers are measured in a funny fashion (we don&#x27;t count people not seeking work).  The rest of the population is not necessarily doing as great.<p>&gt; the lesson of 2020 is that governments should follow the advice of macroeconomists more than they already do.<p>Don&#x27;t forget the lesson of King Edward II, who was discovered to have debased the currency and funnelled the funds to political cronies (mostly Hugh Despenser).  Who knows if the account of the exact method of his death were true, but what is true is that the people got so angry at the real returns to their income that they triggered a civil war to depose him.')
