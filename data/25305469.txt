But reading his assistant’s termination email and Gebru’s emails to management and subsequently to allies (for which she was quoted as not being worthy of a manager), the real issue is the company feels she’s too independent and threatened by her lack of submissive attitude. This has spoken more about the company’s attitude toward culture and perception, elucidating the very points in Gebru’s email to Brain allies that the company doesn’t care about opinions or humanity. Ironically, the very reason she is in her role to help with as an ethicist - which also puts into question how they see this role not as innovative but as a shill. Gebru’s mistake is she worked for the wrong employer.')
