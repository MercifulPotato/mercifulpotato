Don&#x27;t even write <i>shiny_api_key = &quot;A-CLEARLY-FAKE-KEY&quot;</i>. Don&#x27;t write ANY secret AT ALL in your code, no matter what. Even for test frameworks. Just don&#x27;t do it.<p>Build in the secret retriving function from day one. Have it grab from an environment variable and it will be 100% seamless from development to production. Add more complexity&#x2F;security if and when you need it.<p>This can later be leveraged to allow for zero-downtime credential rotations for running services, which allows for seamless use of ephemeral credentials, which is what we should all be moving towards.')
