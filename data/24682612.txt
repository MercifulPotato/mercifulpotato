Sorry, but we all know these scores are less meaningful on the extreme high end.  If you can scoop up everyone two standard deviations above the mean and select randomly from them, you&#x27;re doing fine, and the poor kids get a break from the the grueling regime of trying to rank higher than the other kids who are trying to rank higher than the other kids who are trying to rank higher.')
