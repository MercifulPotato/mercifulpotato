It doesn&#x27;t use any intermediate representation like DAG or state machine. It executes your code directly as a  synchronous program with blocking operations taking as long as necessary to execute. For example the following code would be absolutely valid as a Temporal workflow:<p><pre><code>    waitForApproval(purchase); \n    sleep(Duration.ofDays(30));\n    sendEmail(email);</code></pre>')
