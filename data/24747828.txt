In our usenet group some people found a sale of used fw900s (definitely for less than 500â‚¬ each). They then organized a group buy, which had around 20 interested people.<p>Then they wondered how they would actually get all of those transferred across half the country. I think in the end they rented a truck or trailer to pick them up. It was definitely a bigger feat than getting a LCD shipped from your favorite online store.')
