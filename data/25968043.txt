If there&#x27;s enough proactive people for upkeep, it stays the same or even gets better. If not, things keep getting worse until something sufficiently bad happens, then outrage follows and reactive people spring into action - e.g. protests or outright revolutions depending on how bad things were allowed to become.<p>When things are good (or at least good enough) for a long time, less and less people see the need to be proactive...')
