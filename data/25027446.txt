Charity is real and it helps people right now where they need help the most. Social justice is a fantasy dreamed up in ivory towers. But only the left is compassionate, right?<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve been there. I&#x27;ve seen it.&quot;\nWhere have you been and what have you seen to feel the need to put down experiences of those in minority who have succeeded in life? What have you as a member of the compassionate party done to help the poor people since charities aren&#x27;t you thing?<p>&quot;Have you?&quot;\nI have never ever once heard a migrant say: &quot;I hope those nice social justice people succeed with their big ideas.&quot;.\nIt was always: &quot;Look what those nice people from the church down the road did for us.&quot;.')
