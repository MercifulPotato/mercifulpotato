Item(by='lhorie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605114804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25059871, text='It isn&#x27;t _my_ proposal. Stoning is a real punishment that was implemented in certain societies. You asked for alternatives to prison sentences and I presented them. It&#x27;s a bit tall to then suggest that I invented things like islamic law and further, that I&#x27;m a moron for bringing it up.<p>If you scroll elsewhere, you can see I also mentioned that one could spend weeks fruitlessly debating what constitutes a criminal beyond redemption and that that does add extra layers of touchiness when it comes things like capital punishment.<p>You may not like capital punishment (and I&#x27;m neither condemning nor advocating for it), but it is a real punishment framework that addresses tax burden and the problem of discomfort of having to live near a sex offender. Does it have flaws? Absolutely. As you said yourself, justice systems make mistakes. When I said &quot;tautological idea of justice&quot;, what I&#x27;m deriding is the double standard some people fall into when making an argument that boils down to &quot;killing innocent people is wrong because it cannot be undone&quot; and use that as a differentiator in opinion between capital punishment and long prison sentences, since one can also make the same argument about innocent inmates (the &quot;silver lining&quot; type of argument is usually callously oblivious to the horrors of prison life, as well as stigma, trauma, loss of opportunity and health, etc and the fact that this damage cannot be undone, no matter how much one thinks saying &quot;oops, sorry&quot; is good enough). One can flip the silver lining argument as such: &quot;at least he was put out of his misery quickly&quot;. (Again, not advocating for it, just reiterating that side of the debate)<p>A lot of anti-prison folks will argue that the better option is reintegration, which involves skill development, counseling, etc. This gels well with the vast majority of inmates who are in prison for small crimes. The flaw, of course, is that you can&#x27;t really proactively stop the odd psychopath. Trade-offs, trade-offs.')
