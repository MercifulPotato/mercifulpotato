But for the average person the biggest advantage of a mortgage is that it&#x27;s a form of forced disciplined investment.<p>A mortgage requires you to make an upfront downpayment and then recurring monthly payments into a durable asset. You could put them same amount into equities, but 90% of people won&#x27;t have the financial discipline.
