I&#x27;ve always found modern JavaScript frameworks so difficult to reason about because it feels like I&#x27;m always working through nine layers of abstraction.<p>Last year, I read Julia Evans&#x27;s article &quot;A little bit of plain Javascript can do a lot,&quot; and it inspired me to try to push regular JS as far as it would go in my next project. It&#x27;s now 8 months later, I have thousands of users, and I&#x27;m still using plain JavaScript.[1] No babel&#x2F;webpack or anything. I do use Flask to aggregate source files together, but I purposely avoid any cleverness there. Overall, I find the code much easier to debug than any of my other web apps.<p>One nice advantage of using only vanilla JS is that it&#x27;s easier to find contributors. If you&#x27;re a React project, then only React developers can contribute. But if you&#x27;re a vanilla JS project, you&#x27;re not bound to developers of any particular religion. Vue, React, Angular, Svelte developers can all work in a vanilla JS codebase.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvns.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;a-little-bit-of-plain-javascript-can-do-a-lot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvns.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;a-little-bit-of-plain-javasc...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mtlynch&#x2F;tinypilot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mtlynch&#x2F;tinypilot</a>')
