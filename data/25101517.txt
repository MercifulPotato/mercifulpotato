Item(by='marcinzm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605451107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099493, text='The specs say it&#x27;s 78&quot;x75&quot; (98&quot;x75&quot; for large version) when open. How much space you want beyond that is up to you I presume as it depends on your door position and layout of rest of room. If you just have a couch then that&#x27;s probably a couple feet around for entrance and 4 feet for the couch. So roughly you&#x27;d want a 10&#x27; x 11&#x27; room.')
