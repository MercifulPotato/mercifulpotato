Item(by='Closi', descendants=None, kids=[25219944], score=None, time=1606395925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219282, text='The hardware already exists - it&#x27;s the iPad Pro 12.9 inch with a Magic Keyboard.<p>There is very little difference in hardware:<p>* RAM - 6GB (iPad) vs 8GB base (MacBook Air), although memory chips are tiny and Android phones have 12gb, so I do not see there being a significant limit here.<p>* Processor - Approximately the same (M1 is basically the A14).<p>* Connectivity - Both have WiFi only as base, iPad offers 4G.<p>* Disk size - 128 GB base with options up to 1TB (iPad) vs 256 gb Base with options up to 1 TB (MacBook Air)<p>* Battery - 10,000 mAh (iPad Pro), and I cannot find the battery of the latest Mac Air but previous models have had 5,500 mah.<p>So we aren&#x27;t talking huge differences in spec. In fact it seems that the iPad can fit more in - probably because it doesn&#x27;t need to include a keyboard which undoubtedly is responsible for a lot of the thickness.<p>&gt; Building reliable clip&#x2F;unclip connections would be an interesting problem.<p>Apple has already solved this for iPad - the Magic Keyboard is brilliant (although not cheap!). Additionally an iPad + Magic Keyboard is actually somewhat thicker than a Macbook pro, which highlights why the Macbook Air is probably thicker than the base iPad (rather than spec).')
