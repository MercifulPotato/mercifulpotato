The block reward covers miners expenses for the next 100 years or so, THEN, once the block size is large enough and transactions are in the millions, a fee of a few cents per transaction replaces the block reward.<p>&gt; Can you rebut these counter-claims made by one of the Core devs?<p>Yes, easily.
