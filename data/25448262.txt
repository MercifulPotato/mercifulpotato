How is competition affected?<p>What if people genuinely don&#x27;t want an item they bought for reasons that aren&#x27;t initially apparent?<p>Where does buying by machine stop and start? Is the browser part of a machine?<p>For me the most compelling concern though is that it conflates a proxy for abuse with an abuse - why not simply target the abuse and let reasonable people who have some unstated reason to buy using a machine carry on unimpeded.<p>There are also trivially easy ways that companies could reduce abuse. You would allocate people a ticket at random perhaps giving no more than one ticket to each pre-registered payment method and then hold a lottery so only certain ones would proceed - then it&#x27;s no longer about crazy fast reflexes of a machine it&#x27;s about chance and all participants get an equal chance without needing to resort to legislation.')
