The CEO told me to jump on a call and explain to them how our tech worked. I asked the CEO if they&#x27;d signed any form of NDA. Eventually they talked to our investors and they wrote to the company and asked to discuss an NDA. The company&#x27;s reply was &quot;We&#x27;d prefer to proceed without an NDA&quot;. I mean, no surprise there, I&#x27;m sure they would! We insisted on an NDA, no discussions were had.<p>To pretend to be interested in a collaboration and use that to steal another company&#x27;s ideas is totally normal in our industry it seems.')
