Id doesn&#x27;t have to be responsibility of the database. In fact, I&#x27;d argue an identifier is an application layer concern. Orm could still solve this problem by simply cascading, or you can use one of the identity strategies that don&#x27;t rely on database assigning it. You can generate them in either application layer or orm layer through identity generators.')
