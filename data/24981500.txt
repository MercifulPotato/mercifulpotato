Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=[24982535, 24981598], score=None, time=1604423176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979479, text='&gt; [Google]’s scalability is effectively infinite, because serving additional customers is a function of fixed costs, not transaction costs; it really is not comparable to Amazon at all, in this regard, as the companies’ respective market shares demonstrates.<p>&gt; The same reality applies to Google’s marginal costs (including distribution); while Google spends a tremendous amount of fixed costs on its data centers and networking, any one search is “free”, including Google accepting the search term, computing the result, and delivering it to the user.<p>Doesn’t google spend some insane amount on infra?<p>This argument could be made identically for the old  retailer down on the street corner by my house. Once you’ve bought the building and fixed the roof and bought all your merch, handing over that t shirt in exchange for cash is free. It’s better than free, even, since people are literally just giving you money for stuff you don’t have to spend any more marginal dollars on!<p>But if I want to keep doing business, I’ll have to keep paying my mortgage, and paying my sales reps and if I want to grow, I’ll need more space (maybe another storefront per thousand transactions per month?), etc, just like if google wants to grow, they need more sales reps and more land in Mountain View, and for  more customers and queries (maybe a new data center per gajillion queries per month, or per upgrade to costlier search processing expensive neural network layer?).<p>Without commenting on the rest, OP is throwing a lot into fixed costs. You can’t say it’s near zero when the revenue is also near zero. And you also can’t examine the costs in a way justifies zero marginal costs, pointing at the cost of someone who walks into and out of the retailer without buying anything, which is also basically zero (your typical user who never clicks an ad).<p>Maybe the most apt comparison is a nail making factory or even to AWS where, once you’ve bought a data center, renting it to your customers is free, but that’s not a useful viewpoint. The cost of one single marginal call to your AWS lambda is basically zero, but basically zero times basically infinity is a good old traditional number again.')
