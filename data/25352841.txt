I said not to say anything. And why use hyperbole ie &#x27;they would be out of business tomorrow&#x27;.<p>And no it&#x27;s not marketing anymore than if a Karate expert airs that he was beat up in an alley and then says &#x27;but the person was 9 feet tall that&#x27;s why!&#x27;. (But sure to your point if they said &#x27;by a 13 year old&#x27; that would not be better but once again I didn&#x27;t say that.)')
