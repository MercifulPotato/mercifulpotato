First, important differences arise across\njurisdictions in infection levels, death rates, policy implementation, and compliance with policies. These differences have major implications for COVID control. The portfolio of the eleven\ntypes of policies–implemented with different levels of intensity–necessary to drive COVID\ngrowth rate below zero depends on the jurisdiction’s COVID burden and compliance, which\nreflects behavioral and demographic characteristics of the jurisdictions. Second, we estimate\nthat a core set of socially tolerable policies lead to COVID control only in those jurisdictions\nthat have unusually high levels of compliance. The socially tolerable core policies alone are\nmeaningful and significant, but insufficient by themselves for preventing escalating growth in\ninfections in 90% of the jurisdictions analyzed. For these jurisdictions, one or more from a set\nof additional high-impact but difficult-to-tolerate policies must be implemented to achieve\nCOVID control. Third, the impact of testing and contact tracing has been lower than the\nimpact of other policies. Fourth, for the jurisdictions covered in this analysis, the policies with\nthe greatest marginal impact for achieving COVID control mainly involve restrictions on\nadults through workplace closings and stay-at-home requirements, although targeted school\nclosings are also in the group of additional high-impact policies. Altogether, the analysis indicates that, in all but a few highly compliant jurisdictions, relatively significant social costs must\nbe incurred to reduce COVID growth below zero. The model points to significant opportunities for cultivating deeper understanding of the drivers of compliance and of variation in the\nimpact of policies, which are potentially rewarding topics for future research.<p>What I don&#x27;t see is any analysis on the impact of the &quot;high social cost&quot; policies on public health and well being. Why is this so often not included? For example, what are the impacts of school closures on childhood development and isolation on mental health? Are we going to be paying more for this down the line?')
