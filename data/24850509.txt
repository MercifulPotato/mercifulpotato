Humans don&#x27;t receive infinite rewards, either, but we still think about infinite numbers. We typically think about infinite numbers in terms of finite representations, like finite proofs about their properties. Reinforcement learning could in theory do the same thing.<p>The <i>real</i> reason that traditional reinforcement learning will not yield AGI is that the model is too limited. The current state of the art in reinforcement learning relies on representing the entire world and your entire strategy as a single vector. For most RL tasks we haven&#x27;t even gotten deep networks working; RL is somewhat behind areas like vision or natural language processing.<p>The way forward isn&#x27;t to worry about infinite numbers, it&#x27;s to develop better architectures that let RL solve more problems.')
