(And if memory serves right, the US, for mysterious reasons, has about twice as many firefighter per capita as other developed countries.)<p>From a more theoretical perspective, would you think that a mandate for people to buy insurance against fires (and especially against liability for spreading fires) or alternatively posting a big bond to self-insure, and leaving the rest of the workings to the market should work as well?
