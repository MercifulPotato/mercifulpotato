Chrome wasn&#x27;t even a thing then (it forked off of Apple&#x27;s work on Safari&#x2F;Webkit later, just like v8 came after Apple&#x27;s own JSC JIT work).<p>As for Mobile Safari, it took several years for Android browsers to come close: Android Browser in particular was a piece of crap, slower, and lacking more features, than Mobile Safari. Was Google also &quot;scared&quot; of web apps?<p>Also note that, when Apple suggested to developers they make their own web apps in lack of a native SDK, most dissed those and wanted, nay, demanded a native SDK.<p>And Mobile Safari is not exactly some bad browser holding those apps back. You can watch Netflix on mobile safari, on the web, if you so want. Why would you though?<p>And here&#x27;s the 1000 pound argument: do you see many people watching Netflix on Android Chrome, as opposed to using the Android Netflix app?<p>Didn&#x27;t think so.<p>Why would they do it on the iPhone then, if Chrome was available in the App Store?<p>&gt;<i>Phones are general purpose computers for the majority of the world&#x27;s population</i><p>Not even close.')
