And I bet there were similar anti-TV op-eds in newspapers in those days that the author would have rolled his eyes at.<p>The message should&#x27;ve been to create more and consume less. A phone let&#x27;s you do either, the device is hardly related at all. You can&#x27;t see what a person is doing when they&#x27;re bent over their phone.')
