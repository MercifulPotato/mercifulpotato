The JS just iterates over thousands of known fonts in a div&#x2F;span and sees if the browser can render it to build a list. It&#x27;s enough that you&#x27;ve installed a single uncommon font and together with everything else you suddenly became unique just by that.<p>You&#x27;re not going to block all of these &quot;dynamic&quot; prints just by changing browser or installing a single plugin. Even if you run in a VM, unless you actually flush and reinstall that VM every session, you&#x27;re eventually going to amass customizations inside the VM that can be fingerprinted.. :&#x2F;')
