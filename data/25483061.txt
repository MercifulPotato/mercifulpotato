You’re right. It isn’t about legal adulthood or even legality.<p>Children and young adults who still live with or depend on their parents&#x2F;guardians are usually under their authority to some extent, even for completely arbitrary things like “go play”.<p>As we get older and more capable those things usually relax but there’s definitely a transition.<p>An adult who has full autonomy would probably weigh a decision like you described and decide whether to voluntarily go play with their younger sibling even if it wasn’t play for them. Some will do it, others won’t.<p>I’ll put it another way. I’m getting older(ish, I’m 38), I don’t have all the energy in the world, but I have a puppy. She loves to play and she benefits from it. Sometimes I just don’t feel up to it. I could <i>always</i> decide not to, my only strict obligations are don’t abuse or neglect her. But I usually play even if I don’t want to, by choice, because I want my puppy to be happy and healthy too. That’s a kind of decision making that most young children don’t engage, and gradually becomes more common in early adulthood and becomes more solid as we get more of our own autonomy.<p>It’s totally voluntary. It’s just not always play for me. And with that said, my puppy wants a play :)')
