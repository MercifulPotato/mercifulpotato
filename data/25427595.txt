From my opinion it&#x27;s a good way to have high turnover of people I don&#x27;t want on my team anyway.<p>Note I don&#x27;t think developers are bad if they don&#x27;t want to do customer support, but I am particularly interested in hiring <i>product</i> focused developers. That is, developers who really care not just about difficult technical problems, but who care about how solving those problems actually affect the customers for whom we&#x27;re building the product.<p>I have found that, on the contrary, product-focused developers <i>love</i> doing customer support (some small portion of the time). They like to see how their features and fixes affect the customer experience, and they get a kick out of fixing small annoyances that overall build a more polished product, but might get just &quot;triaged away&quot; if it went through multiple levels of CS -&gt; product manager -&gt; engineers.')
