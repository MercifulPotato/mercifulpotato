Item(by='jbotz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609068412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542456, text='There may be some new ideas here, but the basic idea behind this is anything but new... things like this have been around as long as personal computers and are often called PIM for &quot;personal information management&quot;.  I&#x27;m not saying this to detract from this particular software but to help categorize it... no need to invent a new acronym.<p>There is a lot of overlap in this category with the note-taking apps (Notion, Roam, zettelkasten) which have also seen a lot of activity recently... you can think of both of those categories as existing on a two-dimensional continuum of structured vs free-form and statically structured vs dynamically structured data; the OPs app is near the statically structured corner of this space, and &quot;just a bunch of text files&quot; in the dynamic free-form corner.  The other two corners may be defined by more dynamically structured note-taking&#x2F;outlining apps and on the static free-form side we might have things like &quot;private data clouds&quot; (Nextcloud for Open Source).')
