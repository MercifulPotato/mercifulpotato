They are given a choice between A&amp;B then if they choose A they are given a choice between B&amp;C.  The choice between B&amp;C should be 50&#x2F;50 but instead it’s around 75&#x2F;25 and the authors claim this is because in not choosing B the baby decided they liked B less. The evidence for this claim is that if an adult makes the first choice for the baby then the 2nd choice is 50&#x2F;50.')
