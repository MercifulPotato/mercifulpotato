But I think this doesn&#x27;t fit the definition of &quot;Pythonic&quot;. Again, &quot;Pythonic&quot; is highly debatable. But, You can always break down big chain of operations, into smaller chain using good variable naming in-between.<p>Many operations are implemented as iterator in python on list, like filter, groupby.\nLooking at your code, its looks like you&#x27;re not doing lazy computation. (Correct me if I wrong). This could be huge performance impact, depending upon use case of list.')
