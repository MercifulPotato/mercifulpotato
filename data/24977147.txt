If you have a simulation that gives an 80% chance of one outcome, but you only have 75% confidence that the assumptions that the simulation is based on, your actual prediction should be closer to 50%. This is not &quot;throwing your hands up&quot;, it is simply correctly assessing the possibility of model error.<p>There is no such thing as giving a probability and also giving a confidence interval, for an event with a binary outcome. Everything that your prediction can say about the outcome can be said with a single number between 0 and 1. To give an answer like &quot;80% plus or minus 15%&quot; just means you haven&#x27;t finished calculating.')
