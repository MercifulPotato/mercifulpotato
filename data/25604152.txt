In the Perez model, this marks the transition from &quot;irruption&quot; to &quot;frenzy&quot; for the general constellation of 21st century technologies (&quot;the sun, the genome, and the Internet&quot;, to take the title of a Freeman Dyson book).  Perez&#x27;s book doesn&#x27;t really touch on the fractal nature of technological revolutions: published in 2002, it described the WWw as having just moved from &quot;frenzy&quot; to &quot;deployment&quot;, which was true for the specific case of the WWw but missed the bigger forest of how software in general would eat the world.  We&#x27;re now starting to see many of the technological developments spawned by the Internet (cloud computing, AI, cryptocurrency, drones, etc.) get more mainstream attention.')
