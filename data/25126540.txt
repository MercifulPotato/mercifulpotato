You might be able to put together a sentence of that caliber! Particularly if you read a large corpus of great writing.<p>The worry is that <i>young</i> writers will become more machine-like in their thoughts, as part of a broader project to make people more machine like. For example, Google Docs complained to me that the sentence, &quot;We will analyze the ballistics of the South Dakota, focusing on parameterizing the equations of motion&quot; was incorrect because you don&#x27;t put &quot;the&quot; in front of the name of a state. But I was talking about BB-57, the USS South Dakota, a battleship. Google Docs, naturally, doesn&#x27;t have a sense of historical context.<p>I&#x27;m no great writer, to be sure, but the computer just doesn&#x27;t understand what I mean, so it flags my thoughts as being wrong in some way. That smoothing out our thoughts is a long-term problem if our goal is to lead human lives, particularly as it makes it into education.')
