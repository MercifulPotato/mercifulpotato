I was able to find several accounts of the feature using the keywords カーナビ 電話番号検索 - using just ナビ gets a lot of hits for directories of phone numbers (mainly used for identifying spam callers), and using GPS instead of ナビ gets hits for tracking cell phones.<p>I have never used this and didn&#x27;t realize it was possible, but I don&#x27;t drive and rarely take taxis. I can see why this would be popular, especially with tourists - the language isn&#x27;t a barrier to conveying a number. It also avoids issues with address formatting.')
