The crystal fades in and out of existence during the early stages of nucleation.  And even after the structure is established, the boundaries continue to be &quot;fuzzy.&quot;<p>Even the movement of the crystal looks like a wave, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because matter moves as a wave at the atomic level or if that&#x27;s just an artifact from the camera.')
