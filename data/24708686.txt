They don&#x27;t care that the fit and finish is befitting an Aveo.  They care that they&#x27;re driving a sexy new EV from the leading manufacturer of sexy new EVs.  From the perspective of &quot;keep Tesla relevant and financially solvent-ish&quot; it&#x27;s a great design.  They know what the people they&#x27;re selling to care about and what they don&#x27;t and the latter isn&#x27;t getting much attention.<p>It&#x27;s like how the Tacoma has been the turd of it&#x27;s segment on paper for 20+yr but still flies off the shelves.  Clearly the metric don&#x27;t tell the whole story.  In both cases there&#x27;s an emotional value proposition that&#x27;s doing a lot of heavy lifting.<p>And since I know in advance that this comment is gonna piss off a hell of a lot of people here (if I had to pick a demographic that will have both a Tacoma and a Tesla in their driveway HN would be about the perfect fit) I&#x27;ll ask in advance if any of those people would like to tell me why I&#x27;m so wrong.')
