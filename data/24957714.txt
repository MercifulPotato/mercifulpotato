According to the classical sources, -m fully disappears when followed by a vowel. (Though same-word intervocalic -m- does not.) Poetic meter backs this claim up robustly.<p>It&#x27;s actually a little bit weirder than that; the vowel before -m also disappears. But it&#x27;s certainly plausible for some nasalization to remain anyway.<p>&gt;  and&#x2F;or lengthening of the preceding vowel<p>You&#x27;re referring to -ns- &#x2F; -nf-? You&#x27;re also right there. As far as I&#x27;m aware, this doesn&#x27;t happen for -nd- &#x2F; -nt-, though.<p>&gt; Also youtuber ScorpioMartianus has invested some time into training himself into using reconstructed pronunciation and has talked extensively about that<p>While that sounds like a cool project, I don&#x27;t think it necessarily has a lot to tell us about the historical pronunciation. I think you could develop a pronunciation system that matched nearly every documented feature of a dead language while failing to match a large number of undocumented features.')
