This has been true for every interactive system I&#x27;ve ever used (including... the shell).<p>The shell as a REPL for a succinct language is nice for interactive workflows, but for trying to build less ephemeral pieces of code, the editor is the first class citizen I care about. Sending code to a REPL to be interacted with? Cool, and I <i>think</i> this is what a lot of people mean when they say REPL-driven.<p>I&#x27;d imagine convenience around that in a language or its tooling would be what convinces me to do more REPL-style things.')
