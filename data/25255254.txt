The impact of that depends on the unique time constraints of the individual and how well they addressed risk exposure.<p>Add to that, most economists don&#x27;t think the long-term market returns will approach the past returns. Most now think 6% is reasonable, when the past was 10%-12%. This extends the horizon further unless you are willing to increase risk exposure by selecting higher growth stocks.')
