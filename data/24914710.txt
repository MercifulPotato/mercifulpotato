I call them lambdas all the time. Python explicitly uses lambda as the keyword. Java, C++ and Kotlin all use &quot;lambda&quot; to describe closures in the official docs. Rust uses both closure and lambda. All of these languages except python either are new (Rust, Kotlin) or have had lambdas added in the last ten years.')
