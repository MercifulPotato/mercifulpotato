Every single one and more. Also, you can fine-tune any ad-hoc query, even in that magical tool, yeah. You know, your assumption of having a deeper expertise in that area is cute. I think you’ve imagined some dud who played with these magic tools and appointed himself an expert without a glimpse of understanding tech behind it. Well, that’s not true, but if it’s how you’re prefer to fin arguments, I’m fine. Otherwise, pls give me something, maybe some examples where you show how you have a better control of something or a better performance using rest over graphql? Because I don’t know if you understand, that graphql if just a glorified json generator. Yea, it’s much harder to design good resolvers, queries and limits, but it’s worth it. After all, if you have problems quering complex nested data (and you really objectively need it on a front end) in graphql, it can be only harder to handle correctly in rest, please, please prove me wrong.')
