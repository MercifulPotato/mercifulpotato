And of course the elimination of Israel *does not mean the massacre* of the Jewish people in this region. The Islamic Republic proposed a practical &amp;  logical mechanism for this to international communities.&quot;<p>I have a hard time understanding why so many people equate Israel with Israelis. Many people are opposing the Chinese government. Do you also equate their calls to end China&#x27;s government with a call to genocide against all Chinese?')
