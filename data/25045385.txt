There’s some category of purchases for which I still look at Amazon—basically &lt;30$ and doesn’t-matter-if-it’s-fake type items. Anything that doesn’t fit those criteria, and especially brand name electronic items, I’m buying elsewhere. Knowing it’s genuine is worth a higher price.<p>This has basically meant that I went from a Prime member making 5-10k$ worth of purchase per year a few years ago, to a non-prime member spending only a few hundred $ per year at Amazon. I suspect I’m not unique in the HN crowd, but I’m shocked at how often I see friends, family, and coworkers continue to trust this company with large, important purchases.')
