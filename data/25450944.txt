I don’t have time to understand this for you, but think about it this way: if a Walmart employee makes $7&#x2F;hour but where he lives he needs to make $15&#x2F;hour to not fall below the poverty line, you know who pays the extra $8&#x2F;hour? The government. With all of its overhead of managing a social safety net program. Do you want the government to tax you so that Walmart can underpay by $8&#x2F;hour? In what way does it benefit you to be taxed for that money? And remember that Walmart has plenty of money from their current prices already to pay $15&#x2F;hour. Their prices need not go up to pay a living wage to their employees. So really if you are for small government, you are for raising the minimum wage and letting the market sort itself out rather than running social programs for those whose employers fail to pay them.<p>Small businesses will have to raise prices. But owning wage slaves isn’t justification enough for someone to run a small business.<p>Lastly, why this is good for the economy: you are free to do your own research but here is why this works. Give a billionaire an extra $1000&#x2F;month and he will put it into his offshore account and never think about it again, let alone spend it. Give a poor person $1000&#x2F;month and he will instantly put it back into the economy. This is why trickle down economy doesn’t work but stimulus programs do. If it was the other way around all the US government would have to do is hand over a few billion dollars to like five rich guys instead of negotiating stimulus deals every time there is a crisis. If you think that every time the working class is suffering the best thing to do is to prop up the rich then I, again, cannot understand for you why that’s wrong.')
