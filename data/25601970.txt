Instead, you want to sample a <i>band-limited approximation</i> of the square wave (which is what BLEP, etc. do).<p>If you&#x27;re synthesizing, the naive approach doesn&#x27;t work because the interaction that occurs between the square wave transitions and the sample rate introduces energy into the passband as a beat frequency. Yes, this interaction is aliasing, which is what we expect to get when sampling a signal that is not band-limited to our passband. That BLEP oscillator or other polyphase techniques are needed in order to synthesize a correctly sampled band-limited approximation of a square wave.<p>Similarly, if you&#x27;re sampling an analog square wave with a high slew rate, you <i>absolutely must have an analog anti-aliasing filter in front of your ADC</i>, or you will end up with exactly the same beat frequencies in your sampled signal.')
