Clinton ran on &quot;America is already great&quot; and Biden is running on a &quot;return to normality&quot; ticket under which &quot;nothing will fundamentally change.&quot; The Clintons were the center of the DLC, who assassinated the candidacy of Jessie Jackson to bring on an era in which the Democrats would &quot;End Welfare As We Know It,&quot; sign the crime bill, and deregulate everything. Biden got into politics as a New England Dixiecrat, of the kind that was extremely popular around Boston when white children there were threatened with being exposed to black children in school. His VP is a prosecutor who bragged about jailing the parents of truant children. Both supported the Iraq War. Biden championed the crime bill that was passed under a Clinton administration.<p>Yes, they wouldn&#x27;t be conservative for Saudi Arabia, but they would both continue to closely ally us with the Saudis and aid them in murdering Yemenis.<p>&gt; center as &quot;median voter in the country being discussed<p>Both Biden and Clinton, issue by issue, are well to the right of the median US citizen. It&#x27;s pretty dishonest to restrict the people allowed to have their opinions considered to the people who thought that the distinction between Republican and Democratic administrations was important, when the argument being made is about whether both candidates are conservative. The median <i>eligible</i> voter is barely more likely to vote than not.<p>I know typing this is a waste of time.')
