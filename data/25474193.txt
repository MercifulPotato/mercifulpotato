Advocating for overthrow of government seems banned by 18 U.S. Code § 2385 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;18&#x2F;2385" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;18&#x2F;2385</a>) (Thanks to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;crimeaday" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;crimeaday</a> for teaching me this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;91IzF+claGL.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;I&#x2F;91IzF+claGL...</a> — appalling it hasn’t been struck down as unconstitutional).<p>But OTOH, IIRC people can, have, and have won in court after defending certain rights by force — eg. shooting police officers breaking into their homes without clearly identifying themselves and presenting a warrant. Eg. Kenneth Walker IIUC has not been convicted of any of the charges against him, and though the legal drama drags on, there’s precedent in his favor.')
