I made no demands or anything like that (this is HN after all) yet someone chose to basically label me &quot;entitled&quot;... that must address all concerns, right?<p>Anyway, today I woke up and it seems this global campaign to ditch Facebook works, because some contact of mine added me to a group of &quot;friends&quot;, people who &quot;forgot&quot; about me for years (because I&#x27;m not on any social network) and who had no idea what Signal was until now, who never knew or cared about privacy, but apparently decided to start using it this week. Neither he nor Signal asked for my consent, and now I&#x27;m faced with the unpleasant task of leaving that group and possibly hurting people because I never wanted to receive hundreds of vacuous messages every day. Thus I&#x27;m one step closer in my mind to moving to set up Matrix on my own server.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25692885" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25692885</a>')
