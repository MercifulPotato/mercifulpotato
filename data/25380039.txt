I just don&#x27;t believe in deceiving your customers to hopefully rack up a high bill with them.<p>I view not having the ability to say &quot;Shut everything down if I go over $100&#x2F;mo&quot; the same as pre-checked hidden cross sales that MasterCard&#x2F;Visa cracked down on in the adult industry few years ago. Just money grabs.<p>I will definitely be putting such measures in my cloud platform.')
