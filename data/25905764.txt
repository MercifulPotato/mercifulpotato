Item(by='skogard', descendants=None, kids=[25906068], score=None, time=1611594700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905419, text='Thank you, in the video I intentionally positioned Offbase as a &quot;static site generator&quot; and a &quot;blogging engine&quot; just to focus the minimal viable product and avoid confusion, but the actual platform I&#x27;m working toward releasing is really a generic shell that can run anything, the blogging package will be the one thing I will focus on building myself, but since it will be a completely open platform where you can download any git repository into the browser, anyone should be able to build their own package. For example you can build a documentation engine package, or an image editor package. And going further, even the static site generator logic itself is nothing more than a single use case where it simply runs a template logic and writes to the virtual file system, while using the service worker to render the files in realtime, for example. You can think of Offbase as something like Electron, but in a browser. This means a lot of things that you used to need a server for, you can build with Offbase purely inside the browser. Which means, I think Offbase may fit right in with what you&#x27;re trying to build, it should handle a lot of headaches you might otherwise have. Will try to get this rolled out public as soon as I can, it&#x27;s almost there, just trying to deal with some last mile problems and documentation.')
