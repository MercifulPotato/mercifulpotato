For example, my 1Password usage needs to be able to read&#x2F;write DOM element values but you could potentially say no network access or ability to create script or style elements. I’m not sure how much further sandboxing could practically be taken but it really seems like the all data, all sites permission needs to be much rarer than it currently is.')
