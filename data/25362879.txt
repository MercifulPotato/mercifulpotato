This lack of obligation is not censorship -- it&#x27;s private property rights and the free market in action.  If you want to hear a recitation of the Little Red Book while you sip coffee, you are free to patronize a coffee shop that will do so, or even start your own coffee shop.  Likewise, you&#x27;re free to use a different video platform, or start your own.')
