Item(by='joshstrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611166584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25849698, text='&gt; My only wish is they would implement a &quot;family&quot; option where I could easily share my library of recipes with my girlfriend without having to share them one at a time.<p>I normally abhor &quot;social&quot; features being tacked on when they aren&#x27;t useful but I&#x27;d pay for all the apps over again for this feature. Thankfully the API is pretty straightforward. This repo of mine [0] is super dated but it was still working the last time I played with Paprika&#x27;s API.<p>I&#x27;ve toyed around with setting up a little web app that my friends can log-in with their paprika creds (I know, I know, but I&#x27;d tell them to use a 1-off password for this) so that they can use the web app either push or pull recipes from each other.<p>Thankfully you can send the full paprikarecipe file via email and import it but it&#x27;s a little clunky and things like Discord (which my friends use to chat) doesn&#x27;t like file extensions over 12 characters (IIRC) so it just cuts off the rest of the extension characters leaving you with a file you can&#x27;t open (without fixing the extension). I have some initial work to setup an AWS SES address that people can send recipes to that will then drop a preview and link to download (not an attachment, it would be hosted on S3) the recipe into a &quot;recipes&quot; Discord channel we use but it&#x27;s still a WIP.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joshstrange&#x2F;paprika-api" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joshstrange&#x2F;paprika-api</a>')
