If I press &quot;buy now&quot; and it says &quot;success&quot;, I don&#x27;t want to receive an email later saying &quot;oops, we didn&#x27;t actually have any in stock, we&#x27;ll send you a refund&quot; because another order was sitting in a queue. That&#x27;s the failure mode here. The staleness of what&#x27;s in the browser is an orthogonal concern unrelated to the database or use of Kafka.')
