So CentOS Stream is the dynamically updating &quot;thing that will become the next RHEL 8.x&quot; and Fedora is &quot;things that will go into RHEL 9 one day&quot;. Basically CentOS changes from &quot;whatever was in the previous RHEL point release&quot; to &quot;whatever will be in the next RHEL point release&quot;.')
