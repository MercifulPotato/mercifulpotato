Item(by='nbadg', descendants=None, kids=[24794762, 24793968], score=None, time=1602794093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24792805, text='I&#x27;m not sure I would say it has <i>nothing</i> to do with reality; that&#x27;s up to SpaceX to decide. The premise suggested in the post, extremely briefly, is that, because Starlink would be a <i>global</i> ISP (which, to my knowledge, basically doesn&#x27;t exist today), having much stronger encryption on the network would help them avoid needing to comply with a patchwork of differing legal frameworks across the world. Put simply, a truly global ISP exists in a fundamentally different regulatory and legal landscape than traditional ISPs, and the easiest route for them would be simply to sidestep them all by having provable anonymity.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how that premise fares in relation to the actual legal reality of operating a multi-jurisdictional ISP, but that&#x27;s the premise, and I think it&#x27;s plausible enough not to dismiss it out-of-hand.')
