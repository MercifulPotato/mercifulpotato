You don&#x27;t think rednecks in the south play video games or soup up their cars or listen to rock and roll, the same as a Biden voter from Los Angeles?<p>So if you set up a forum for fans of the Atari, you get all kinds. They get to know each other. And then they talk about whatever.<p>But several things have smashed that all to pieces.<p>The first and main problem is that everything is a single site with millions of people now. You can go over to &#x2F;r&#x2F;atari and talk about Atari, but if you try to talk to any of those people about climate change they&#x27;ll direct you to a different sub, which is full of entirely different people who you don&#x27;t know or trust.<p>Then the sites that are independent are often operated by the company that makes the product. Sony might host a PlayStation forum, but they&#x27;re going to boot you out for talking about politics or religion.<p>And then there&#x27;s the fact that everything has become disposable. What do you do with your broken out of warranty Atari? Get a soldering iron. What do you do with a broken out of warranty iMac? Get a rubbish bin. But then there&#x27;s nothing to build a community around, because everything is an appliance that you can&#x27;t improve or repair.')
