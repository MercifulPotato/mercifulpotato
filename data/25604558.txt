In other words they often say one thing, but do something else.<p>Opening the user research would make this more obvious, so that&#x27;s probably why they don&#x27;t allow this visibility, even though it would make sense according to their published principles.<p>Why are they doing this? I&#x27;ve no particular inside information, but occam&#x27;s razor says it&#x27;s follow the money - that Mozilla&#x27;s true reason for existing is as a protection for Google, and that Mozilla&#x27;s published positions are virtue signalling, but their actions serve their real masters at Google.<p>It sounds controversial, right? But if you are ever interested in the red pill, explore this possibility by considering these facts.. (and if you&#x27;re not - leave this post up so others get the chance to think about it for themselves)<p>- Google provides 95% of the money for Mozilla<p>- Mozilla is a lightning rod that attracts and focuses the user centric parts of the ecosystem&#x2F;market, but ultimately fails to achieve the goals of giving users power and instead year after year the power remains with google<p>- Mozilla must play a fine line between virtue signalling to prevent competitors who would truly organize for users benefit, vs actually doing things that would tip the balance of power towards users<p>- Mozilla thus talks about lofty goals to capture the idealist mindshare, but consistently fails on good execution so the pragmatic choice remains to use google products instead<p>- This pattern has been so consistent over the years I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion it&#x27;s deliberate .. and the reason is probably because: follow the money, ie Mozilla is funded by Google<p>- If Mozilla leadership isn&#x27;t doing this intentionally then they are being used&#x2F;played by Google, however Mozilla&#x27;s CEO is now a corporate lawyer not an idealist, who&#x27;s taking home big bucks, so that&#x27;s an indication that Mozilla&#x27;s leadership is in on the game<p>.<p>So in answer to your question, Mozilla&#x27;s user research can&#x27;t be open because that would increase visibility of situations where Mozilla&#x27;s conflict of interests cause Moz to do things that benefit Google rather than general web users, and Moz&#x27;s leadership don&#x27;t want their hypocrisy to become known or their game will be up and the paychecks stop.')
