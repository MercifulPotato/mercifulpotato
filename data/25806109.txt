If you MITM the HTTPS connection the browser can detect that and refuse to use the connection. Many companies are in this situation that MITMing HTTPS is not working very well. I think Google enforces HSTS[1]. Not sure how that works with DOH. I also think that we need browsers that do not have any other means of DNS resolution than the good old operating system wide &#x2F;etc&#x2F;resolv.conf (or similar). I am not going to fight with Google if I have the right to have my own DNS server or not. They are taking the open internet inch by inch. This is the last drop.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security</a>')
