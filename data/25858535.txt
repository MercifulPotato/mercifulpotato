The camera market has really had to keep up with smart phones so there are a lot of good options. Depending on budget, I would look at the Fuji  mirrorless cameras (I think X100F, XT3, etc?). Maybe even a Ricoh GRIII if you&#x27;re into travel, street, or architecture. As others have said, it will depend on what you want to shoot.')
