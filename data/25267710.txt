The goal is the creation of a new tool for analog and mixed signal circuit simulations that can leverage our existing Modeling &amp; Simulation capabilities as well as new and upcoming technologies such as machine learning based surrogates to provide significant improvements in both simulation performance and end user usability. To enhance the team, we are seeking an engineer with strong programming skills and a background in circuit simulation, who can drive the “frontend” (circuit specification, device models, workflows) design of this tool, set requirements, interface with end users, work through benchmark problems (e.g. simulations of open source devices in the Skywater 130nm process node) and overall ensure the usefulness of the tool for the electronic circuit designer.<p>Required Applicant Background<p><pre><code>    - Strong Programming Skills\n    - Experience with mathematical&#x2F;numerical&#x2F;scientific computing\n    - Background in EDA tools, electronic circuit or semiconductor design and electronics simulation (e.g. SPICE simulations)\n    - Strong communication skills (regular customer&#x2F;end user interaction required)\n</code></pre>\nDesired Applicant Background<p><pre><code>    - Experience writing Julia code (Julia will be the primary language for all newly written code)\n    - Some familiarity with machine learning\n    - Familiarity with Open Source IC design tools\n    - Familiarity with open source development flows (git, GitHub, etc.)\n</code></pre>\nWe anticipate that qualifying applicants will have a Masters or PhD in an engineering discipline. However, any qualified applicants matching the requested background will be considered.<p>The team is based in Boston, MA, USA. Julia Computing is a remote-first company with the majority of its workforce being remote and distributed around the world.<p>To apply, please email a copy of your resume, along with a cover letter highlighting your interest in the position and relevant background to &lt;jobs@juliacomputing.com&gt; with CC to Keno Fischer &lt;keno@juliacomputing.com&gt;.')
