Couple years ago I worked in a company in Asia. My boss went to China for work and bought some network equipment for the office: routers, access points etc. We didn&#x27;t really need them, it&#x27;s just so cheap he wanted to see how well it works. After setting them up and got it to work, we continue to use our devices as usual. But when we visit a company internal tool&#x2F;dashboard page that we built ourselves, an ad banners starts to showed up on the page! We were baffled, is our server compromised? Are the computers we&#x27;re using caught some malware? But it&#x27;s happening on all of our devices, computers, phones, tablet. Then we start to suspect it&#x27;s the new equipment that is injecting the ads! Following this, we also noticed it doesn&#x27;t modify HTTPS sites and that was the last clue of the puzzle. We pulled all the new equipment and sworn to never trust anything from China that has a price tag that&#x27;s too good to be true.')
