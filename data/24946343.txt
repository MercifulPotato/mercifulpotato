All while looking out for cars on both sides.<p>The Waymo car stopped just in time and there was no accident. Not sure if this was because of the safety driver or because its algorithm had seen and extrapolated my car&#x27;s motion and actively avoided the collision.<p>(Or if they are advanced enough, maybe they have mapped out all the stop signs in California and have labelled all the intersections that are 2-way stops in which a driver could accidentally think it&#x27;s 4-way, and anticipate the possibility of an accident in advance at these dangerous intersections. I doubt that though.)')
