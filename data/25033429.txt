A person who moves a few miles across the border from Colorado to Wyoming suddenly sees their vote count for 3 times as much in the Electoral College. It gets even crazier once you start considering how swing states play into this. Your vote makes no difference in most states. But there are a few states where your vote might count, for the sole reason that those states happen to be evenly balanced. It&#x27;s a ridiculous, irrational system. It was the best that could be negotiated in 1787, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense in 2020.')
