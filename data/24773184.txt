It&#x27;s absolutely the case that &quot;literally&quot; is often used when the sentence is figurative, but for it <i>to mean</i> &quot;figuratively&quot; it would have to be the intent of the speaker that the inclusion of &quot;literally&quot; makes the utterance more likely to be understood as figurative.  I think it is instead used as an intensifier.<p>All of that said, I don&#x27;t have any principled objection to protest against it on stylistic grounds.  I just think we should try and be clear about what&#x27;s going on.  (And I recognize that I&#x27;m disagreeing, here, with at least one dictionary - I believe they got it wrong.)')
