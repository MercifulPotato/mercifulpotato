What are they made of is just a small part. Do you know how to use the masks you have? Do you have a beard? Or just a one day stubble? Some masks consists of one layer of fabric and even three-layer masks can&#x27;t be worn endlessly, they can be washed but not infinitely. Some people wear the mask just covering the mouth, not the nose. Or upside down so the metal strip that seals around the nose is under the chin. I&#x27;m no expert in how to use masks but I see dubious things the whole time, both in reality and on TV.')
