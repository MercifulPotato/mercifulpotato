I really want to replace my iPad with something that runs linux, for example.<p>All I&#x27;m arguing is that, I don&#x27;t believe that in my lifetime, or the foreseeable future, will there ever be a time where I can&#x27;t reasonably easily get some kind of desktop computer and run whatever code I want on it. (Unless those computers literately become illegal - like some code already is)<p>I might not be able to carry it in my pocket, or wear it on my face, and it might not have some holographic interface that has not yet been invented yet.<p>I&#x27;m also not saying we should ignore the the fight for general purpose machines, and I will continue to vote with my wallet, as well as lobby to have laws that opening our machines.<p>I think its a disgrace that Apple no longer supports my iPad witch functions perfectly well, but I can&#x27;t install anything on anymore.<p>Society would be much better if all our phones were open, I just don&#x27;t think we need to freak out about desktop computers disappearing.')
