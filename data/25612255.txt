MIT2.008 (<i>Fundamentals of Manufacturing</i>) is not bad. Search Library Genesis for manufacturing &#x2F; mechanical and go for the textbooks&#x2F;references. If starting from scratch you can get a long way for personal experience with a home-built wood&#x2F;polymer router, a drill, low end MCUs and scavenged parts. Even if you want to focus on design, you can gain from either outsourcing all your parts fabrication (this will also force you to learn how to communicate designs effectively) or getting a membership of a shared workshop&#x2F;makerspace and learning the machines and processes yourself, which will help you to do better designs.')
