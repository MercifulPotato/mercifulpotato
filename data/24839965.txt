It can also vary based on how solved the game is, for example go vs chess vs tic-tac-toe.<p>It is interesting to see it was a bigger range at a point later in life. But I can easily think of things like formula 1 where the age of the peak performer has slowly shifted towards younger drivers simply because the drivers get into go kart racing and work their way up to formula 1 faster.<p>Regardless, it seems like a promising study to demonstrate that it&#x27;s never &quot;too late&quot; to improve yourself, which is a problem people start feeling in places like the tech bubble where age is intentionally or unintentionally used as a signal for findind a good candidate. And the &quot;too late&quot; sentiment also comes up when people decide to get into things like chess later in life.<p>The the flattness of the curve seems like a double edged sword, it means time to reach peak has no special technique to accelerate when you reach a peak or how long you stay there, but it also means as long as you started with a proper foundation, your performance will decline is a lot less than the lay person would imagine.')
