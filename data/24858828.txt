Item(by='speeder', descendants=None, kids=[24861616], score=None, time=1603379320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858700, text='Here in Brazil people think tax is theft, and that avoiding taxes is moral...<p>Problem is, often they are not wrong, there is massive government corruption, and taxes are often used for unethical and wrong things, meanwhile actual services are often paid by the population themselves.<p>For example: my family pay all our business and whatnot taxes correctly, because we don&#x27;t want to get dragged into a crime spree (if  you are avoiding taxes you open yourself to extortion, and from extortion to other crimes...), yet my parents paid my education until I was 18, I paid my own education after that, the street in front of our house, we bought it, literally (was crazy expensive too since our house is in a corner). The phone lines? We also paid for that, when we moved in there was no phone in the neighbourhood, but since we had a business we needed phone, so we paid people to install the cables for us. Deliveries? All done with private companies, the public service is crap. Police? We often pay private security, all times we had to call emergency, it didn&#x27;t work (in one egregious case: we told the cop someone broken in violently in a neighbour house, the cop replied on the phone, literally: oh sorry, my shift today has few people, and we don&#x27;t want to risk our lives, so we won&#x27;t go), fire? Same shit, calling for the firefighters worked ONCE for me, and was because the road itself was on fire, all otehr attempts failed, many they didn&#x27;t even picked up, my parents house did got damaged because of it (someone tried to burn trash in a field behind the house, it burned our backyard that was full of fruit trees, and burned a neighbour house down, and damaged a ton of other houses). Health? Well, that is one thing that works more or less right... still most of my healthcare I paid for it, the government healthcare is prone to make stupid mistakes and kill people for stupid reasons (for example the hospital nearest my house killed a guy by giving him insulin AFTER he warned them he was allergic, they didn&#x27;t believed him and though he was some kind of conspiracy anti-vaccer nut and was using allergy as excuse).<p>And the list goes on, and on, and on.<p>Whenever I argue against taxes, people reply with a list of: &quot;Oh, you don&#x27;t use X?&quot; and then I reply: &quot;Yes, I use it, and pay it as a private service&quot; the only thing I don&#x27;t pay a private service for, is the military.')
