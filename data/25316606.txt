As a result, we shouldn&#x27;t reward people for this by making them billionaires because:<p>- At best there&#x27;s no behavior to encourage, person A just got lucky. At worst, person A cheated and by making cheaters super rich, we give them outsized influence on our society<p>- creating billionaires creates bonkers, destabilizing income inequality, for which we rarely get anything in return (not everyone starts the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation)<p>- relying on this dynamic entrenches privilege, because it&#x27;s much harder for women and people of color to become the next Steve Jobs (which is a weirdly super rare case to structure a society&#x2F;economy&#x2F;labor theory on, stipulating you think Steve Jobs was actually good at anything substantial).')
