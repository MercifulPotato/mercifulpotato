Really excellent fr enterprise sales, but when I took it the students included two guys opening a T shirt stand on Cape Cod (sales cycle less than 2 minutes) and a saleswoman from KLA-Tencor (sales cycle between 18 and 36 months), a salesperson for ADT, etc.  One of the most useful courses I&#x27;ve ever taken.<p>And for enterprise sales there&#x27;s a whole vocabulary and model to learn: your coach, understanding who has the signoff, when you&#x27;re talking to someone who will waste your time -- and when someone who seems insignificant but is actually the decision maker, how to structure the deals.
