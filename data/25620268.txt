I also imagine it&#x27;s going to be incredibly difficult to process the kinds of trigonometric formulae that length-of-day and twilight calculations involve, using only mechanical gears.<p>On the other hand, Japanese watchmakers don&#x27;t seem to be particularly averse to mixing analog with digital, mechanical with electronic. So I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Citizen, for example, came up with a hybrid GPS&#x2F;mechanical watch that does exactly what the Apple Watch does while the Swiss toil for decades trying to build a purely mechanical version.')
