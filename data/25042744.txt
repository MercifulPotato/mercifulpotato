You can&#x27;t reduce it to zero, but most animal products can be replaced with a similar alternative with a similar price and less suffering.<p>Even organizations like PETA recommend against pestering restaurants about small details and trace ingredients, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more: it makes vegans look nitpicky and rude and makes it harder for most people to want to make baby steps in the direction of reducing animal products.<p>My advice to new vegans: be easy on yourself and others. I&#x27;d rather see ten people who reduce their animal products consumptions by 90% than one extremist who does 99% and alienates everyone else.')
