There was a metric fuckton of preorders, which were delayed because of software issues.<p>After they got the software fixed enough for a release, they &quot;sold&quot; (delivered) a bazillion cars in a few months, boosting them on the top of every chart.<p>It&#x27;s a great car, but the software isn&#x27;t still complete and has obvious bugs, nothing fatal but a bunch of annoyances - they didn&#x27;t even manage to get OTA updates working.')
