E.g. put the syscall id and some parameters on the &quot;stack&quot;, then let the interpreter run the syscall with a new &quot;instruction&quot; e.g. &#x27;!&#x27;. This could even substitute &#x27;.&#x27; (putchar) and &#x27;,&#x27; (getchar), since these  are very much just syscalls. So that would reduce the number of instructions by one (to 7).<p>Oh, getting to 6 would also be fun: One might replace &#x27;[&#x27; and &#x27;]&#x27; with a conditional branch &#x27;?&#x27;. It just needs two parameters: condition and (signed) number of instructions to jump. Adds the bonus (much like normal asm) to write moch more ~~horribly abusive~~ flexible control flow than a structured &quot;while(*ptr)&quot;.')
