Where are they and what do they do now? I think Litecoin came at a time when more people had an awareness of cryptocurrency, it&#x27;s more democratized during the initial phases because of Scrypt and GPU&#x27;s being the dominant mining tool at the time. ASICs shifted that balance again but I still have my doubts about who owns the majority of Bitcoin.')
