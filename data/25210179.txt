These popularized, almost mythical, portrayals of agriculture are uselessly far from reality. If you want to summarize a tremendously complex industry, it&#x27;s more useful to compare in terms of the crop being produced and the region&#x27;s level of economic development.<p>For example, in the US, mechanized row crop farming over large numbers of acres is the norm (growing corn, beans, wheat, etc).  These farms are all small head count family-run operations, sized between a few hundred to a few thousand acres, with a total somewhere in the low hundred-thousands of them.<p>The worldwide number of farms then runs up into the hundreds of millions due to small landholders - subsistence agriculture, locally sold produce, etc.<p>A farmer growing corn in a remote Central American village is completely different from the farmer growing corn in the United States.  A produce farmer at your local farmer&#x27;s market is completely different from a wheat farmer on the Black Sea.  There&#x27;s a living to be made at many points on the spectrum, and humanity needs each of them.<p>Real problems certainly do exist. They have more to do with things like the market pressures of producing commodity products, baseline calorie and nutritional demands, distribution, and structural supply and demand inefficiencies.')
