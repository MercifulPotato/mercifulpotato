But it&#x27;s a tangent from what I&#x27;m saying I think.<p>I&#x27;ve had this position for well over 10 years. I know why copyleft exists, its philosophical history and how it&#x27;s intended to use the copyright system against itself. But I disagree with doing that because I want government out of the business of intellectual property altogether and I don&#x27;t agree with using the copyright system against itself to do it. Fundamentally, I&#x27;m opposed to the ownership of ideas at an ideological level, so I wish to relinquish as much of that ownership as I can in today&#x27;s system. And that&#x27;s public domain.<p>We could have a longer discussion, but like I said, this is totally distinct from the argument I&#x27;m making that it&#x27;s not &quot;common sense&quot; to consider laws and ethics the same.')
