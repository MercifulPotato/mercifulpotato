That is not the case.<p>2. Kubernetes was packaged in Arch in less time than it&#x27;s taken for Debian to discuss the policy disagreement between the previous and current package maintainers, <i>neither</i> of which have been able to deliver a maintainable Kubernetes package in Debian yet.<p>3. This says more about the efficacy of Debian&#x27;s packaging policies and package dev UX than it does about Kubernetes.')
