Or How many of the (generally older) men are bald or have generic male haircuts versus the women. Or wear necklaces. Those might account for why &quot;girl&#x2F;kid&quot; and &quot;hair&quot;, &quot;neck&quot; might exist in the women&#x27;s categories and not in the men&#x27;s.<p>Since you can find out <i>exactly</i> why a label exists just by interrogating the NN - on that basis I&#x27;m disappointed by how shallow this article is, a whole load of speculation about &quot;why&quot;, when it should be possible to find out. I feel like it&#x27;s just playing on the readers biases&#x2F;paranoia towards sexism in the tech industry, leading them to assume what the answer to these loaded questions are without <i>Really</i> trying to understand.<p>Another thing that annoys me is how often articles like this conflate bias <i>in the data</i>, and a poor choice of data by developers, with bias of <i>the actual developers themselves</i>. A NN has nothing to do with the phycology of it&#x27;s creators, beyond choices of dataset, oversight etc. It essentially allows authors to make personal attacks against devs, as if a NN who says something racist was reading out a racist script written by a dev.')
