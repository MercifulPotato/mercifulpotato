Just because you&#x27;re African it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re black (See South Africa and Tunisia for example)...<p>Wikipedia seems to confirm that: &quot;approximately 40% of their autosomal ancestry to be derived from an ancient non-African back-migration from the near East, and about 60% to be of local native African origin &quot;...<p>Not to mention there&#x27;s no single black race...
