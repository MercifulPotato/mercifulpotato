Personally, I don&#x27;t see much value in smartwatches if they can&#x27;t be standalone. The prime benefit for me is that they&#x27;re more portable than phones. I&#x27;d like to eventually leave my phone at home. If I have to carry it, then that means the smartwatch is just more baggage to lug around with almost no benefit since nearly all functions are available in the phone, too.<p>&gt; If you want more than that, you&#x27;d probably want to consider something like an Android Wear device, with the accompanying tradeoffs.<p>Yeah, I got a Gear S3, but same as my Android phone, I hope to eventually replace it with something more open.')
