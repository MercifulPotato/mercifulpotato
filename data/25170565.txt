A non-technical user does not have the knowledge and experience to know whether the warning is legitimate or not. In the worst case, the user learns to ignore that type of warning from then on, which only leads to the warning being made harder and harder to ignore (we&#x27;re in that treadmill already; this warning used to be much less scary and much easier to ignore).')
