Considering costs for cover glass, backsheets, frames, cabling, and racking, that wasn&#x27;t actually true. Crystalline silicon wins both the &quot;premium&quot; rooftop module market and the low cost ground mounted market. Several manufacturers now offer panels for the utility market with efficiencies reaching 20%, like this one from LONGi Solar:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.longi-solar.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attach&#x2F;20200423&#x2F;5ea0f8bb2764c.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.longi-solar.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attach&#x2F;20200423&#x2F;5ea0f8bb2...</a><p>He palmed an even more significant card at the beginning of the book. Instead of starting with actual per-capita energy consumption in the UK, he estimated consumption for &quot;a typical moderately affluent person&quot; living in the UK:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.withouthotair.com&#x2F;c2&#x2F;page_22.shtml" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.withouthotair.com&#x2F;c2&#x2F;page_22.shtml</a><p>Making the whole population &quot;moderately affluent&quot; yields per-capita energy demand 56 percent greater than the actual value at the time the book was written (195 vs 125):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.withouthotair.com&#x2F;c18&#x2F;page_104.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.withouthotair.com&#x2F;c18&#x2F;page_104.shtml</a><p>I thought that MacKay was a clever but not very quiet proponent for nuclear power. His assumptions effectively nudge the reader toward the nuclear solution. Even though some of his assumptions were dubious from the first, and others have been invalidated by subsequent developments, I still love the book for its transparent analysis.')
