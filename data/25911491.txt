Every state has mail-in procedures already in place.<p>Finally - anything that was really problematic would have been made public - as they did with a couple of videos in which they maligned workers essentially doing their jobs.<p>As far as Dominion - there is a paper trail for auditing, there have been hand-counts and the tallies match, i.e. no fraud at the ballot validation level.<p>Dominion is probably one of the more secure elements in the process.<p>The most &#x27;grey and ambiguous&#x27; area of voting boils down to voter rolls. If you look at Georgia legal battles, you see they fight over the policies for purging the rolls. &#x27;If so and so has not returned their mail-in card in over 2 years, they purge&#x27; etc..<p>In 2000, the vote was extremely close in Florida, and it may very well have come down to the degree to which certain groups were purged.<p>That said - this doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of opportunity for systematic fraud. Someone grabbing someone else&#x27;s ballot from the mailbox, forging their signature is well within likely to happen, and surely does happen, but it can&#x27;t feasibly be scaled. The voter rolls themselves are monitored, it&#x27;s not like they are a black box either.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that the initiative was populist. It was not to convince the courts or anyone of integrity that there was fraud, because we already knew the answer. The issue was entirely a campaign of public misinformation to discredit an opponent, to sow distrust in the system.<p>By far the worst &#x27;crime&#x27; in all of this is someone using the legitimate authority of the Office of President of the USA to knowingly spread false information. Or at least a close second to pressuring election officials, state officials, the VP, and senators to interfere directly with the process.')
