The concerns that commercial aircraft face are shared with basically every other self-propelled electromechanical system (planes, cars, robots, spacecraft). Insufficient care in hardening these systems has resulted in (likely) fatalities before - evidence suggests that at least some of Toyota&#x27;s &quot;unintended acceleration incidents&quot; were caused by cosmic-ray upsets in ECUs that weren&#x27;t sufficiently redundant. Note that upsets are well enough understood for SpaceX to fly using redundant aerospace processors rather than the traditional radiation-hardened processors.<p>The political reasons are that no one wants a plane full of people talking on their phones and further distracted from listening to the safety briefing and flight crew instructions. Airlines don&#x27;t want it and passengers don&#x27;t want it. People <i>do</i> want network access on planes, which is widely available albeit slow. The only sincere technical concerns involve legacy radio equipment (ILS and glideslope), but I&#x27;m not aware of any demonstrated interference issues. Plenty of cases of interference from someone parking a large truck or 747 in front of the ILS antenna, though.')
