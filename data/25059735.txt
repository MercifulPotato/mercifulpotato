After all, CQRS boils down to separating the interfaces for queries&#x2F;reads&#x2F;immutable operations and commands&#x2F;writes&#x2F;mutable operations. Unless you&#x27;re bolting on unrelated concepts, like event sourcing, then CQRS is not a significant source of increased complexity in non-trivial applications.<p>Can you shine some light on which aspects led to higher complexity in your use of CQRS?')
