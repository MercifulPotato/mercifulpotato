If they return their own dataframes then chaining follows naturally.\n&gt; I know that isn&#x27;t how dplyr works, but it feels more Pythonic, and this solution isn&#x27;t entirely analogous to dplyr anyway.<p>I think I agree. Pandas has a lot of overhead&#x2F;baggage that I don&#x27;t want 90% of the time. Being able to chain _simple_ verbs on a data frame would be great -- something like mtcars.groupby(cyl).summarize(avg_hp = hp.mean())')
