Because it&#x27;s walled off, I cannot mess stuff up so much. Ofcourse I wish the device ran Linux but with the same container tech which freezes&#x2F;thaws&#x2F;kills&#x2F;reloads apps so it keeps my system fast safe.<p>Then, on the other hand, when the majority of people see their favorite app, album, book, movie, show disappear from <i>their</i> because the &#x27;big company&#x27; decided they can&#x27;t have it anymore, they do get upset, they just don&#x27;t know what happened or why or what they can do to help it.<p>Android is a weird middleground; it&#x27;s both too walled off and too open; you can get yourself pwned (without rooting) while you still don&#x27;t have enough freedom to do whatever you want (without rooting). I like it&#x27;s more open but then I prefer a laptop with full blown Linux (which is what I use most).')
