I have been forced to use Windows for communication, and especially the trifecta of Outlook, Teams and Word opened my eyes as to why a lot of my colleagues weren&#x27;t getting stuff done and were always hung up on weird problems I couldn&#x27;t understand. Like &quot;why is the reply on this email TOFU and doesn&#x27;t even answer half the questions asked below&quot;: well, because writing proper replies in Outlook is impossible. &quot;Why does this document look like crap even after someone has spent a week editing in all suggested changes?&quot;: well, Word doesn&#x27;t do proper merging of stuff or proper templates. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t he answer my chat questions from yesterday?&quot;: well, because no proper highlights or working history in teams chats...<p>I feel for all people forced to work like this. I cannot understand employers accepting the massive suck on productivity this causes. For my own sanity, I will charge a premium or avoid such environments altogether.<p>Btw., if possible a workaround for a lot of the usual driver&#x2F;VPN&#x2F;that-one-special-application headaches that force employees to use windows is to get approval for vmware, virtualbox or something, install yourself a linux VM and use that in fullscreen for most things. But of course that is not always possible.')
