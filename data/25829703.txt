By law, almost universally, guardians serve as the custodians to the child&#x27;s rights. This boils down to the absolute fact that a child does not have the cognitive (or otherwise) capacity to legally represent themselves. And even if they were able to, maybe in their teenage ages, they are still not permitted to do so until they reach adulthood. Case in point, the good old consent-to-sex legal age debate.<p>Google &amp; co. prey on this technical vulnerability so to say.')
