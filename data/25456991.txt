That&#x27;s fine, I do the same in some situations: I don&#x27;t fight people who can cause me great damage like police or air stewards or immigration agents.<p>But rolling over all the time is not an optimal strategy. The more power you have, the rarer you should roll over.<p>And of course many without power will see those with power and say &quot;In their place, I&#x27;d roll over&quot;. Yes, naturally. That&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t have any power. So being a pushover comes naturally to you, you&#x27;ve optimized well.')
