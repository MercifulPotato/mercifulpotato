Git is not a backup.<p>For the questions, what&#x27;s bad with quick help on SO? It&#x27;s maybe less effective than reading the documentation that ships with git itself but for sure much more popular and less to read.<p>Git truly is a command-line utility, little known is that it ships with more than one gui in the base package out of the box. handling the staging area with git gui for example is straight forward unless you have more than 5000 unstaged files, then the gui informs you about it&#x27;s limit and mass handling is far easier on the command-line anyway.')
