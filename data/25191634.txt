Intel’s five comparison systems for itself came from MSI,\n  Lenovo, Intel itself (in the form of a laptop kit), and two\n  from HP. Intel is drawing on a much wider range of manufacturers\n  for its own systems. I don’t know anything about the NUC laptop\n  kit - haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test one - but I would have\n  preferred the fifth system be a standard commercial comparison,\n  and the AMD systems should have been drawn from an equally diverse\n  pool of hardware as the Intel ones were. There are four\n  manufacturers represented for Intel, and two for AMD.\n\n  ...\n\n  When Intel gave its presentation, it made a point of calling\n  out the fact that Cinebench R20 doesn’t show the same behavior\n  as the other benchmarks it had chosen to highlight.\n\n  The &quot;oddly&quot; is straight-up FUD. Cinebench R23 also doesn’t\n  show the 30-48 percent pattern of decline Intel claims. Neither\n  does Corona Render. Neither does Handbrake. Neither does\n  JetStream 2. Neither does Blender 2.90. Neither does the\n  Blender 1.0Beta2 benchmark (not shown, but I ran it).</code></pre>')
