On the one hand, he was a brilliant engineer who I learned a ton from, and who set a really solid technical direction for the team.<p>On the other hand, I was personally unhappy a lot of the time.  On one occasion he pretty much tore apart one of my designs and I felt fairly humiliated (with reason, as a few other senior engineers confirmed in private conversations).<p>Did my design deserve to die horribly?  I don’t know.  The PR had already been accepted, but maybe the accepter was wrong.  In any case it felt really crappy to be criticized so heavily by someone who in theory supports me.')
