The name comes from imagining a gambler at a row of slot machines (sometimes known as &quot;one-armed bandits&quot;), who has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them, and whether to continue with the current machine or try a different machine.[5] The multi-armed bandit problem also falls into the broad category of stochastic scheduling.<p>&gt;In the problem, each machine provides a random reward from a probability distribution specific to that machine. The objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls.[3][4] The crucial tradeoff the gambler faces at each trial is between &quot;exploitation&quot; of the machine that has the highest expected payoff and &quot;exploration&quot; to get more information about the expected payoffs of the other machines. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is also faced in machine learning.')
