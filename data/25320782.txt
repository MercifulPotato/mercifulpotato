Young people want to acquire resources to be able to successfully grow old (i.e. survive). Once they are old (i.e. had gotten the resources to become old), they don&#x27;t need to get these resources anymore - because they have them already! Thus, they are free to want something else (like &quot;sleeping well&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s called survivorship bias, and it means that these very romantic ideas cannot be trusted without compensating for the bias. Those with too little resources died before you could ask them.')
