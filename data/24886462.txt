Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[24887971], score=None, time=1603635519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24885334, text='I&#x27;ve been walking 2-5 miles every day for the last 7 or so years. This is walking outside with no set destination and no electronics.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as being a superpower, but I do find it to be relaxing.<p>My sense of direction is pretty bad tho, especially in unfamiliar places. I recently discovered a new trail system and while I didn&#x27;t get &quot;lost lost&quot;, there were times where I thought for sure I was going back to where I wanted to but I ended up going in the opposite direction.<p>But at the same time, when I walk around areas I&#x27;ve been to I can pick out very specific details, almost like recreating a map in my head but I think this has more to do with repetition and practice that would apply to everyone. If you&#x27;ve walked around a place literally 1,000 times you&#x27;re bound to pick this stuff up. I&#x27;m sure it will happen for me in those trails with enough practice too.<p>With that said I know someone who doesn&#x27;t walk at all and is one of those people who can drive to somewhere in an unfamiliar place once and then know exactly how to get there months or even years later. I&#x27;m not convinced walking by itself improves your internal GPS.')
