Israel has been keeping tabs on this guy for a very long time. With Trump on the way out and Biden likely to restart the nuclear deal, Israel&#x27;s and the UE&#x27;s fear of Iran pushing a clandestine weapons program would be at an all-time high.<p>This actually kills three birds with one stone:<p>- Massive setback in Iran&#x27;s nuclear weapons ambitions.<p>- Hobbles negotiations for any future nuclear deal with Iran.<p>- Iran&#x27;s rhetoric following this will likely be helpful in wooing the Saudi crown prince further to the Israeli side, and possibly help bring more Arab nations over (perhaps even Egypt? They&#x27;ve had softer words of late).<p>But it had to happen before Biden takes office. Now Iran will be isolated for another decade, possibly more, which is exactly what Israel&#x27;s foreign policy has been in this area.')
