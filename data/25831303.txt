Seriously.<p>Reasonably effective stream watermarking happens every day and is done in the human vocal range with almost no listener impact.<p>In radio, Arbitron has a system working well within the lower audio range, even AM radio.  AM is typically 5Khz bandwidth.<p>They use a spectral masking technique able to encode ID bits into streams that can be decoded with portable devices.<p>PPM Portable People Meter<p>Frankly, this kind of thing would go unnoticed by pretty much all listeners.<p>From the PDF I linked:<p>[...]all watermarking technologies use the well-known perceptual principle of “masking,” which \nwas first reported in the early 20th century and is a core technical basis for mp3, AAC, and a host of data-rate reduction \nschemes.<p>In simple language, a loud burst of energy at one frequency will deafen the human auditory system to certain \nother audio components at nearby frequencies for a period of time before, during, and after the loud signal.<p>Consider the following illustration: A tone burst at 1.1 kHz with an intensity of 0 dB will hide (make imperceptible) an \nadded signal at 1.11 kHz with a level of -30 dB for a period of about 10 ms before the burst and as much as 50 ms after the \nburst. However, modern signal-processing techniques can still detect the existence of this added 1.11 kHz component even \nthough the ear cannot.<p>This is the basis of PPM and other similar watermarking technologies that use masking for \ndetermining the frequencies and intensity of the data that can be added for the station-identifying watermark.<p>The PPM system constructs 10 spectral channels in the region from 1.0 kHz to 3.0 kHz. The original program audio \nenergy in each channel is evaluated for its ability to mask an added component. If that masking energy is insufficient, \nnothing is added. Conversely, if the energy in a channel is large enough, a tone is injected, chosen from one of four \npossible frequencies within the channel. For example, the channel centered at 1058 Hz might have one of the following \nfour frequencies injected: 1046, 1054, 1062, or 1070 Hz.<p>Each of the four frequencies represents 2 bits of information. If we assume that this process repeats at a 500 ms rate, \nusing all channels provides 40 bits per second or 2400 bits per minute of watermark code. Let’s further assume that a \nradio station is credited for a listener if any code is correctly detected within a 3-minute interval. With the very large \nnumber of encoded bits generated in 3 minutes (2400 x 3 = 7200 bits) and a station’s identification data needing perhaps \nonly 50 bits, there is massive excess capacity for redundancy, error correction, and for audio that does not have enough \nhigh-frequency content for masking.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogalytics.typepad.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;a-technical-look-at-arbitrons-ppm-system.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogalytics.typepad.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;a-technical-look-at-ar...</a>')
