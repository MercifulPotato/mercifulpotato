For as low as $200 you can have a solid operating system of any flavor. Not an option because you&#x27;re running thing on laptop and is not good to tear the laptop apart to replace SSD? OK, then how about:<p>Run each operating system in it&#x27;s own VM and you can encrypt its folder. Not an option because you want to use games on your Windows and those are notoriously difficult to run inside a VM? OK, then how about:<p>Run a hypervisor on bare metal, like VMWare ESXi. You get now each operating system to be running on bare metal just like if it&#x27;s alone and on Windows you can definitely play those notorious difficult games.')
