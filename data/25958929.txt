It&#x27;d be great if a service like this helps doctors discover treatments for less than common conditions.<p>Side note:  I recently discovered iontophoresis for the treatment of hyperhydrosis without the use of drugs at all... discovered via a Facebook ad for the machine (don&#x27;t ask me how Facebook knew to target me for such a specific product).  I bought it a couple months ago, and wow - it works. I&#x27;ve been googling the studies around it, which date back to 1950&#x27;s -- not something new, but also dumbfounded as to how I wasn&#x27;t aware of this treatment sooner, and why no doctor was aware of it either (or at least didn&#x27;t bother mentioning it as an option).<p>Best of luck to you! Lots of problems to be solved in the health space.')
