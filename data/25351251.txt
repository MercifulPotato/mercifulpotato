I&#x27;d say that youre probably alright, but your state indicates an objective reality which is wasting time on things deemed pointless by your ego or soul, whatever you call it. Whenever we engage in such pointless activities, e.g. chasing money, our egos lose interest that feels as the unexplainable loss of life satisfaction. Activities that are deemed important by our egos are usually considered unimportant by our today&#x27;s society&#x27;s. The famous example is meditation: it seems meaningless, but for whatever reason it instantly brings the ego&#x27;s attention and that feels as an unexplainable satisfaction in achieving something important, even though you can&#x27;t explain whats being achieved. It&#x27;s like lighting up an internal candle. Other activities are research of certain usually abstract topics, but also giving to others (not just money, but also time or knowledge). I&#x27;d recommend studying the bright side of occultism, and start with a short essay called &quot;light on the path&quot; (and to dodge the wrath of the orthodox HN community, I&#x27;m using a throwaway account). That essay has a few important references that will eventually lead you to less known books by Plato, Newton and many others. You&#x27;ll laugh at the idea that Plato was just a philosopher. By that time you wont have lack of internal self validation.')
