I&#x27;m not happy with them but they&#x27;re the only option until Starlink.<p>Bandwidth is around 2-5 mbps on a perfect day. Will frequently drop to 500kbps depending on the time of day, weather, etc. Several times per month I&#x27;ll lose internet completely, and particularly bad storms have knocked out my internet for several days before.<p>I can sometimes watch YouTube on 240p, streaming music isn&#x27;t too bad, and browsing text-based website (ie HN) are slow but palatable. Once the monthly cap is hit, the speed drops to 128kbps which is pretty much unusable (even for text websites).<p>Latency is also pretty bad. Real time conversations aren&#x27;t really possible, but thankfully Zoom has a phone dial-in option.
