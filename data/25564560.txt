Not sure where people are getting lost. This commenter p410n3 is clearly a cynic. Some people think the world is always listening, always watching them. But what they don&#x27;t realize is they blend in with the noise because they aren&#x27;t all that important. No one cares to listen to them. I don&#x27;t think they like that answer though ;)<p>I just don&#x27;t like the idea of a flying high def camera in my face that I can&#x27;t grab and smash against the wall. Because it&#x27;s literally flying above me out of reach.<p>If I had tech to destroy it. I would use that tech. I guess a gun would work if you&#x27;re a good shot. They use hawks in Scotland.')
