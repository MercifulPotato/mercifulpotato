Whether the recipe calls for 360 or 350 Fahrenheit shouldnâ€™t make a bug difference. \nEven when making a roast, one Fahrenheit more or less, does it matter?<p>I suspect that the precision you gain is lost due to ovens and bbqs not being super exact and good at keeping temperatures.<p>What I often hear with Fahrenheit, is body temperature and I agree, 37.5 vs 38 Celsius is meh, while the granularity of Fahrenheit might help.')
