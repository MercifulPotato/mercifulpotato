Interestingly enough, I find that I&#x27;ve &quot;worked around&quot; both of the things you mentioned in one way or another.<p>I use EF, but generally only for migrations, and use Dapper for all the actual access. This avoids a lot of the headache I&#x27;ve had in the past with EF tracking, lazy loading, and foreign keys. I also avoid using views for anything, even at work where I can guarantee with many 9&#x27;s worth of certainty that I will always be using MSSQL. Part of this is because EF doesn&#x27;t support it for Code-First, but part of it is also generally trying to be proactive rather than reactive and pre-generate anything I&#x27;d be using a view for. Being able to more easily switch providers and move to a different RDBMS is just a &quot;perk&quot; that I&#x27;ll likely never take advantage of.<p>I despise the Microsoft DI system. I won&#x27;t bother going into details, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work &quot;right&quot; (that is, the way I want or expect it to). On the other hand, I&#x27;ve used Autofac for years and just seem to &quot;get&quot; it, so I sometimes go to relatively great lengths to use it, even when the Microsoft version would have been a lot easier to get up and running.')
