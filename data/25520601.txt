I have literally done this in interviews that led to an offer - when they get to the point where you ask questions, one of yours can be &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like I got to a great solution here, can you explain what an efficient solutions would look like, or point me to a reference where I can read up on this&quot;?<p>- You can ask your recruiter for feedback, or just suggestions for general areas that you can improve. More likely than not, they won&#x27;t respond or will tell you the policy is not to share anything, but you&#x27;ve already lost out on this job, and one polite inquiry is not going to put a black mark on your record at this company.')
