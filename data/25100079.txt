I don&#x27;t hold with the notion that the head of the NHS has to have been a doctor or the head of the MoD has to have been a soldier - there is value in being about to look at thing objectively with an outsider&#x27;s perspective. But at the same time, I do absolutely believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be someone, from any industry, who has employed people and had to make payroll on payday come hell or high water.<p>It would also benefit everyone if some life experience was required before becoming a teacher.<p><i>The ballot box is not a high enough bar when all the candidates are of low quality.</i><p>Agreed again, voting now is about holding your nose and choosing the least-worst. I want &quot;none of the above&quot; on the ballot paper and if it wins, the real candidates are banned from politics for life. Repeat until some decent candidates show up. But none of our incumbent politicians would ever pass that law for obvious reasons.')
