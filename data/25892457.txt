So its a browser page, takes up real estate, requires the right version of the browser, doesn&#x27;t integrate with your desktop controls (audio, video) tightly, has ~1 second connect times, limits to half a dozen people tops, one video at a time. Which doesn&#x27;t seem terrible until you click into a meeting and the voices come in one at a time over many seconds.<p>So large parts of the &#x27;frictionless&#x27; are gone. You want to share something, get it to the right page, then draw attention to it - there&#x27;s moderator gatekeeping, one-at-a-time rules.<p>Instead of everybody sharing whatever they liked, more than one share per person, all set up so anybody could look at anything they wanted without some moderator orchestrating it. You want to go back and look at Lucy&#x27;s spreadsheet while Alice is talking thru her presentation? Just click on it, then click back into the presentation later.<p>We miss it.')
