I don&#x27;t expect it to be the next reddit, because I don&#x27;t want a next reddit. The internet on social media is big, fast, and dehumanizing. I want the internet to feel smaller, slower, and more personal. I think the only answer is for everyone to build their own website. Unfortunately there&#x27;s not much money to be made in that.')
