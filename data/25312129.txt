Note this study gives us no information on whether taking vit D before you become sick helps or not, it cannot answer that. I think there is very low risk of taking a Vit D supplement.<p>What it does do is give doctors more confidence that making patients take another pill when they are already sick in the hospital won&#x27;t do anything to help them.  This saves unnecessary costs, possible side effects (albeit high dose Vit D is still relatively harmless), and patient comfort (when you are as short of breath as some severe covid patients even taking pills and eating can be a challenge).<p>There are many supplements that people very strongly believe help covid without good evidence beside vitamin D, why shouldn&#x27;t we take all of them all the time? There are people and doctors who are passionate about the potential benefits in covid for: ivermectin, Vit C, Vit D, Zinc, famotidine (AKA Zantac) and hydroxychloroquine.<p>At some point we have to actually look at the data.')
