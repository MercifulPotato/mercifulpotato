Every flat could have been a sharp just the same, knowing which one to pick requires a lot more knowledge than just what key the piece is in.<p>I spent many days working out a compromise that at least isn&#x27;t nonsense most of the time but I know that it will still take much more work to be able to do this reliably. For now my theoretical knowledge isn&#x27;t good enough though. This is very complex, and the algorithm to do this properly already runs to many pages.')
