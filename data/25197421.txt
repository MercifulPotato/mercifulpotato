Aren&#x27;t there popular formats for those?<p>For example, if I want to recognize pictures of animals, with reasonable accuracy, how much space would such neural net take?<p>I&#x27;m not very taught about ML, but in my mind, since ML is generally heavy on computation, it should be possible to distribute neural nets for specific applications and re-use them.')
