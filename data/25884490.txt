These companies are made up of people, who are motivated differently than the entity (entities) as a whole would be.<p>Specifically, any change in public sentiment would be rather small and only accrue over the long term. It would therefore be of little use to, say, some PR executive at Shell.<p>&quot;Big oil&quot; is also made up of a number of companies. Any benefits would be spread out among all of them, while any costs would fall to just the one doing it.<p>As for costs: the big one would be the damage to your reputation, as an individual, company, and industry, that would follow if the public found out. I&#x27;m having trouble imaging a scenario where you run such an operation, certainly involving a dozen people or so, without ever pissing one of them off sufficiently to see them calling a reporter.<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on here. The tobacco industry comes to mind as one that engaged in such tactics even though a lot of the above was true for them as well. But &quot;big oil&quot; seems more diverse, including foreign firms and governments, companies that embrace the future such as Shell as well as more &quot;conservative&quot; donate-to-republicans-and-hope-this-will-blow-over kingdoms of darkness such as Exxon.  Tobacco was a far more like-minded, sometimes family-owned community that would have been easier to co-ordinate in such conspiracies.')
