It was he who had first proposed the MMU, and then he was involved in the design, and in setting up the simulations.  He said the simulations were extremely accurate except for one detail.<p>The sound.<p>The MMU was constantly making little popping noises as it dynamically held position and attitude.  That hadn&#x27;t been included in the simulation, and it was initially very unsettling.<p>But he soon got used to it.<p>Amazing man, I&#x27;m glad I got to meet him, even if only briefly.')
