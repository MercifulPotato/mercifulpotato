School children?<p>Was the original Macintosh easier for beginners to use than other computers?<p>Was the Apple Quicktime Pro one of the first digital cameras that anyone could relatively pick up and start using?<p>Was the iPod the first digital music player that just worked to buy and download music from end to end?<p>Was iPhone.. despite arriving as a smartphone a decade after Palm, etc, was the first usable smartphone for the masses?<p>Was iPad the first tablet that also just worked?  Seems like anyone who can&#x27;t use a laptop can use their finger on an iPad.<p>How about that AppleTV? Can anyone use it? It&#x27;s easier than my AndroidTV.<p>What about that Apple watch, how many people who were new to wearables had it as their first?  Seems popular with the masses.<p>Experts are usually the few, not the masses.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt apple charges a premium.  Their devices on average last 4-6 years, longer than the Android I&#x27;m typing this on.<p>Rather than being first, they do try to get it right for the masses. I&#x27;m not a happy Apple user, or fan with the keyboard fiasco. Apple&#x27;s history though remains what it is.. easier to adopt by beginners.')
