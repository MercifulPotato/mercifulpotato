Best to take precautions when you are in the woods because ticks have other nasty things they bring along which are also quite bad.<p>Treat outer garments, ground cloths, packs, and tents with Permethrin. Wear a DEET based insect repellent. Wear long sleeves and long pants to prevent tick attachment. When in the woods check yourself daily and remove any ticks that you find as soon as practicable. If you are with someone else, check each other as ticks most often attach in places that are warm e.g. skin folds and it is difficult to check all of your own without assistance. Use a smartphone camera if you are alone.<p>Most of my familiarity comes from Lyme disease but ticks that are removed within 12-24 hours are much less likely to spread Lyme disease. It is likely, but I do not have evidence to support this, that a similar fact is true for meat allergies.')
