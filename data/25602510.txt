Both Chrome and Firefox nowadays only allow permanent installation for extensions that are present on the store.<p>I know that both the Mozilla and Chrome stores have become increasingly strict in terms of what the uploaded extensions can do (I&#x27;ve gone through a quite bumpy road to get my extension published), but if you submit the extension to them and make sure that it is compliant with their policies I think that there would be no need to manually load the manifest from developer mode.')
