Sure, they&#x27;re probably dead by now, but they probably left a lot of money.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even relevant that &quot;it was not illegal at the time&quot;, they knew the stuff was toxic, and they chose to release it into the oceans, just because no one had explicitly made a law banning them from doing so.. Common sense should be the first law.')
