It&#x27;s not bad advice, but something the author didn&#x27;t mention was understanding how your worth is determined.  You can do the <i>exact</i> same work for company A and company B.  Company A may be able to extract huge value from your work, and company B may struggle to keep the lights on.  When working for someone else, &quot;your worth&quot; is directly related to how capable they are at operating their business profitably.<p>I&#x27;ve no doubt the author&#x27;s views work for him, and probably many people like him, but as with most posts like this, they&#x27;re not universal.')
