It&#x27;s the exact opposite. In the US sites like Facebook &amp; Twitter routinely refuse to censor conservative content even if it is against their policies because they are afraid of pissing off Republicans in Congress.<p>A &quot;liberal&quot; on Facebook calling for the beheading of a conservative politican would be banned (possibly even arrested) immediately. The opposite can and does happen every day, with no penalty.<p>And all this still isn&#x27;t relevant because we are talking about government censorship.')
