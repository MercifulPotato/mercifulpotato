I was coming from the mindset of DIYing an open source solution rather than building a marketable product.  I&#x27;ve been building a portable 50W CO2 burning system for marking outdoor items and all of the above has been from my experience with the tradeoffs of components you can buy off the shelf.  If you were to design the system from the ground up there is a lot of fat you can trim and leverage the overall system design to compensate for shortcomings in individual components.<p>To me the largest engineering challenge is actually the identification step, where you&#x27;d need to get sufficient return to positively identify the critter.
