If we have a choice prefer the mRNA vaccines as they seem to be more effective.  If you are in a city with cold storage abilities (most have this already, though how much...) the Pfizer is better, but only to reserve the Moderna vaccine for those who don&#x27;t live so close to cold storage.<p>The Oxford is best only if you either live in a very remote place, or are a very poor place. If you rely on the oxford vaccine it will be a little longer to get herd immunity, but overall your costs will be cheaper.<p>But I must reemphasize, the above is only about logistics. Because most people live in cities, all vaccines will be distributed in big cities just to get the numbers they need. What ever vaccine you are offered first is the one to take. You personally are unlikely to be offered a choice other than take it or leave it.')
