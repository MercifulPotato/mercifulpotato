For example, where Hitler rounded up &quot;foreigners&quot; and killed them, british ww2 conservatives merely deliberately let them starve in their colonies from famines. Where he benefited industrialists with slave labor, they merely violently struck down organized labor with incredible police brutality to do the same. And where Hitler built an imperialist military, they funneled money into illegal paramilitary death squads to keep their territories. This is not just a question of degree, they&#x27;re just so fundamentally different.')
