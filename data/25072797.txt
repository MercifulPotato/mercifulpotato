We did a data lab with AWS using Glue and it was an exercise in pain. Then we did a POC with Snowflake and we cried with joy at how easy it was to work with large amounts of data. But our ELT was very light, not true transformation of data, more rearranging. I still think we will need Glue for some workloads and I pray this makes our lives easier.')
