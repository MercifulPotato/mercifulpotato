And I think it is important to keep those notions separate.<p>And I don&#x27;t necessarily see how decentralized has that much to do with the issues described regarding IPFS. The issue there was more with it being more anonymous and resilient. And I do agree with the author on the downsides, I haven&#x27;t really been a fan of IPFS but it is a neat idea.<p>Though I do believe that keeping internet open and away from google et al. is paramount.')
