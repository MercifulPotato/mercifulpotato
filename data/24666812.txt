You can say we are pretty confident that the interior of black holes can&#x27;t be measured now or in the future, given our current understanding. But science is not made of absolutes.<p>&gt; What do we do with a theory that conforms to every measurement ever made, but whose predictions aren’t testable<p>Then it&#x27;s kinda worthless, at last for physics. If two explanations agree with all observations (so far) that means they are completely interchangeable. You might as well use Occam&#x27;s Razor and pick the simplest one. Until such time we find experimental differences, then we can compare again.')
