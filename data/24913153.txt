It&#x27;s certainly not &quot;highly erroneous.&quot; The most useful websites, with the largest user bases, will also have the largest developer bases, and change the most frequently. That&#x27;s just kinda how the internet is. Consider - if a tool like this had been written 20 years ago, are there any websites it would still work on today? What about 15 years ago? You&#x27;re not wrong that some of the smaller websites might take longer to change than the larger ones, but the calling the notion that most websites change over time &quot;entirely erroneous&quot; is just silly.')
