However, in Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck [2019] the Supreme Court found that private companies only count as state actors for first amendment purposes if they exercise &#x27;powers traditionally exclusive to the state.&#x27;&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marsh_v._Alabama#Subsequent_history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marsh_v._Alabama#Subsequent_hi...</a><p>Manhattan Community Access Corp. finds that _public access television stations_ aren&#x27;t subject to the First Amendment, let alone private web hosts.<p>I mean, as an attorney, I think it would be kind of interesting to see what happened if the Supreme Court ruled that private web hosts in general, or Amazon in particular, are somehow state actors. It would be one of the most practically disruptive-to-society court decisions I can think of, about as interesting to watch as declaring that all warehouses are now public parks.
