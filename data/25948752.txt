Item(by='sakopov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611866157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25948492, text='This. It&#x27;s been an incredibly eye opening week. From news trumpeting that Melvin Capital closed their short position [1] -- which is questionable at best -- to all major US brokerages preventing retail traders from participating in securities that they shorted. This is so surreal that it almost seems like a conspiracy, but i think in reality it just shows how corrupt the market really is and how much power these hedge funds hold. I&#x27;m eager to see the fallout from all of this and if SEC will take action. I didn&#x27;t know that hedge funds aren&#x27;t obligated to disclose their short positions on 13f. Maybe, for starters, the SEC could prevent them from hiding their shorts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-gamestop-melvin-idUSKBN29X0EN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-gamestop-melvin-idUSKBN29...</a>')
