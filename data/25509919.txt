Item(by='ballenf', descendants=None, kids=[25510695], score=None, time=1608664242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509453, text='&gt; I have personally spoken with scores of people who will (for example) express displeasure over Ubisoft&#x27;s culture of sexual abuse, and not blink an eye when it came time to purchase Assassain&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla. Or of Rockstar&#x27;s culture of abusive crunch and equally abusive Twitter presence while buying premium versions of TLOU2.<p>You say this as if these people are being inconsistent. I&#x27;d argue they are not. Any individual sale of a mass market good has as-close-to-zero-as-possible impact on the publisher&#x27;s bottom line. But it increases the quality of life of the purchaser who is then better equipped to make a difference through advocacy.<p>&gt; And sadly even bad games won&#x27;t dent their reputation that much, especially if followed up by a good game again.<p>People buy individual games not reputation. Sometimes people buy nostalgia, but often regret it. Giving money to a company based on reputation is a donation. I think it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that buying and donating are separate things with separate motivations.')
