What was it all about?<p>Sometimes the itch is &quot;I like the challenge of finding&#x2F;building a solution for X&quot; not &quot;I need a solution for X&quot;.<p>Different from home automation, but sometimes I find myself carried away researching &quot;the best photo printer&quot;, &quot;the nicest hybrid smart watch&quot;, &quot;the best value tiny PC I can mount on a monitor&quot; or some other gadget. I browse around the reviews, youtube videos, shopping sites, and find the best product for the best price. And then ... I move on because, realistically, I don&#x27;t need the thing.')
