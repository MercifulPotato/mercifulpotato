Item(by='mytailorisrich', descendants=None, kids=[24928712], score=None, time=1603963993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928584, text='Even a book purchaser only gets a &quot;limited license&quot; on the book&#x27;s contents. The property rights only extend to the physical item, not what&#x27;s printed in it.<p>That&#x27;s the whole issue with online consumption. The physical medium has disappeared and so only the license remains. The legal framework has not caught up yet.<p>Amazon T&amp;Cs&#x27; wording is wishy-washy (&quot;on-demand viewing over an <i>indefinite</i> period of time&quot;) and that wording may cause them problems especially where consumers protection is extensive. My limited knowledge on contract law is that this sort of unspecified duration may not be permitted because the parties (especially the consumer) cannot know what he is signing up to when entering into the contract.')
