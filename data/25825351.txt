Don&#x27;t basically all processors have some equivalent of XCHG (swap contents of two registers)? Even the 8086 had it back in 1978. (The z80 doesn&#x27;t have it, but it is a couple of years older than 8086.)<p>I tried searching the LLVM source for any mention of the trick, but couldn&#x27;t find anything. So I can&#x27;t see it having any relevance to modern CPUs.')
