Research from the New York State Office of the Attorney General shows that microbeads can escape undetected into rivers and oceans after being washed down the drain, since their small size means they often aren&#x27;t captured by regular sewage treatment systems. The report found that approximately 19 tons of microbeads are washed down New York drains each year!<p>&gt; The beads can be mistaken as food by fish, birds and other wildlife. When animals fill their stomachs with microbeads, they may spread the plastic up the food chain. This can lead to contamination of the fish we eat, since microplastics soak up pollutants in waterways, according to the Australian Department of Environment and Energy. Once in the environment, microbeads are almost impossible to remove.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colgate.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;oral-health&#x2F;brushing-and-flossing&#x2F;what-are-microbeads-in-toothpaste" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.colgate.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;oral-health&#x2F;brushing-and-floss...</a>')
