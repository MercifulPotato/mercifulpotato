I am just stating a fact. Google has too much power.<p>But you have to realize something about how conservatives get their news. They are extremely loyal to a small number of sources and rely heavily on peer-to-peer amplification of right-wing memes. Google has nothing on the Facebook and good-ole-boy networks. They inherently distrust Google and the internet and any &quot;mainstream&quot; media. All Trump has to do is say &quot;The left-wing Google&quot; and it sticks in their heads like a thorn. They trust people they know in real life, and as soon as their friends are repeating they catchphrases, they believe it.')
