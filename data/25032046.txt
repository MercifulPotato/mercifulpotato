One line of CSS I&#x27;ve come to love is this:<p><pre><code>    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not pixel perfect, and it&#x27;s not always pretty. But it is consistent, loads instantaneously, and always feels familiar to the user.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s quite a different way of thinking about design versus a more classical approach, and I think it&#x27;s often overlooked by designers for that reason.')
