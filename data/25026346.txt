They still exist and they are still making people money. Having a stdlib in JavaScript would not preclude packages like this due to the afore mentioned legacy environments.<p>NPM bashing is increasingly popular, and for folks that haven&#x27;t had to utilize these tiny packages they probably do rightly seem superfluous. Are people abusing it? Probably. Is it being used where it doesn&#x27;t need to be? Probably. Are there long-stable, rarely changed NPM packages created before `Array.isArray` was a thing, which have this as a transitive dependency? Definitely.')
