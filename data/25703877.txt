Looking at Apple’s 2020 annual report, their pretax income was 25% of sales. If you subtract out services, it is 11%.<p>Another way to look at it is Apple’s company-wide R&amp;D and SG&amp;A were 25% of the costs to create products (not services).<p>So the R&amp;D costs are not negligible and the article probably overestimates the amount of exploitation. On the other hand, Apple made $67 billion before tax, so they could afford to pay their workers more.')
