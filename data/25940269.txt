Well, sounds like it should instead be shares and just dividends payed out from any actual ROI, but that&#x27;s not much of a difference.<p>Using spot pricing could both include load-variable fees to the network operators, as well as paying for more expensive electricity sources when the supply is tight.<p>This additional profit from squeezed networks would fund both power plants and distribution infrastructure.<p>It could easily be combined with a futures market, where you e.g. let your car&#x27;s navigation system search for a route to the destination with stops that fit within the car&#x27;s range and suitable locations. You&#x27;d reserve a spot at the charger, along with buying futures for electricity at the expected time intervals. If you stop for longer than you would technically need, you could buy futures with delivery terms that only prescribe delivery during the period at a maximum instantaneous rate. If the market maker that sold you that variable-rate future delays the charging too much, they might end up having to pay high prices to fulfill their obligations to you.<p>But all that is what futures markets are made for: shifting uncertainty and volatility of only partially-predictable goods to financial investors that take some fee in the form of gains, in exchange for absorbing risk.')
