It&#x27;s cargo cult management by the very definition: they see the other people doing the correct incantations and bounty fall upon them. Clearly, we just need to utter those same incantations and we&#x27;ll have the success they did.<p>They never do.<p>I recall talking to someone who was very very happy to brag that his company was doing &quot;everything just like Google&quot; and following the exact same practices he read the company did on various engineering blogs.<p>I asked him what was the compensation like and how he managed to get kids from Stanford to work at his company instead of their startups and he just gave me a blank stare. Said something about how they were not in Silicon Valley and paid median salaries and that he had &quot;no trouble finding Google caliber talent in the local market.&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s not really the local market&#x27;s customs to give stocks to coders&quot;.<p>I think someone ended up buying the whole thing. Not the company but the office furniture they left after going broke.')
