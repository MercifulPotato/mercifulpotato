If It’s ok for them to charge standard market rates for providing a service to a company, if they compete with that company suddenly they have to charge less? That just seems anti-competitive. I just don’t see why it’s ok to charge Spotify 30% before Apple Music exists, but not ok to charge the same rate for the same services after.<p>I realise a lot of people argue Apple shouldn’t be able to charge anything, or should provide features for side loading and APIs and services to third party stores for free, but that’s not what your suggesting. I’m just critiquing your suggestion.')
