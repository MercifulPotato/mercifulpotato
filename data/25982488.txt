Every time I&#x27;m at Kroger I tell them I&#x27;m not interested in a Kroger card and every time they just grab one and scan it.<p>This, of course, depends where you are. Randalls requires the card&#x2F;phone number and the cashier won&#x27;t even prompt you for it; you have to type in the number on the pinpad or hand them your card before paying.<p>I recently moved away from central TX where HEB is prevalent and that&#x27;s one of the things I miss the most- they don&#x27;t use any of this card nonsense and treat their employees well. Up here I&#x27;m stuck with Kroger and Walmart.')
