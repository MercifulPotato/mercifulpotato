But still, Wikipedia could probably get away with days of 1-5 minute cache refreshes if it was required? Especially if some banner informed users about it or something.<p>I think my larger points still stand. In comparison, almost all other services at the scale of wikipedia have critical almost-realtime components, and is almost useless without the possibility to authenticate users (which can&#x27;t really be cached).<p>Not saying that the people who manage to keep Wikipedia so stable are doing an easy task, just that it&#x27;s very different from almost all other things on the web.')
