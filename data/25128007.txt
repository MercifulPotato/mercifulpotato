Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605639421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127357, text='&gt; You are not given them, they are recognized as natural rights not government granted rights<p>They are, in fact, government granted whether or not the theory of granting them is that the government was obligated to because of preexisting moral rights, and its quite likely that there was not universal consensus on the underlying theory among everyone involved in drafting, proposing, and ratifying them.<p>But more importantly, &quot;the right to not be mandated to wear covering over some part of the body to protect either public health or public morality&quot; is not explicitly, or given the history of such mandates and their survival against challenge, on the evidence of legal precedent implicitly a right in the Constitution. You are arguing for a novel right that goes against the well-settled understanding of the rights in the Constitution (whether Amendments 1-10 or otherwise); which is fine, most people would agree things like <i>Loving</i> or <i>Brown</i> were good decisions despite the fact that the rights involved had not previously been recognized in the form those decisions found them. But to argue for such a novel interpretation of Constitutional rights, you need more than vague handwaving at the Constitution in general, you need an argument about how the explicit text in the Constitution supports your novel interpretation.<p>&gt; If someone doesn’t want to wear a mask that is their choice.<p>Yes, but it is not a choice that, either morally or Constitutionally, needs to be free of consequences, including restricting the scope of available activities one may engage in.<p>If someone chooses not to <i>wear covering over their genitals</i>, that&#x27;s their choice, but its fairly uncontroversial that the law may restrict them from being in public places when they make that choice.<p>&gt; Your choice is to avoid situations where you might be in contact with people who don’t wear masks. It’s not to force everyone into your beliefs.<p>I have yet to see a mask mandate that concerns itself with mandate beliefs, only actions in cases where one is exposed to other people (and, invariably in those I&#x27;ve seen, people who live outside of the subject&#x27;s household.)<p>&gt; I personally believe in wearing masks, though primarily feel the value in the typical cloth or surgical masks are keeping you from touching your face.<p>The value of cloth or surgical masks is in reducing the distance (and quantity at any given distance) of droplet spready from exhalation, sneezes, and coughing. They aren&#x27;t as good as better masks, or social distancing, but the general recommendation (and, in many case, mandate) is for them to be worn in situations where essential activities make the recommended social distancing impossible to maintain&#x2F;guarantee.')
