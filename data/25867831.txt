As soon as you say something that the OGs dont agree with you get flagged and censored.<p>It&#x27;s bizarre. How can people be this narrow minded on HN? Maybe they are not hungry anymore, they cashed in their stock options or made their acquisition and think they are infallible.<p>Look I love my Ferrari, its never going to lose value, its gone up since I bought it two years ago because as EVs become more popular, people are always going to value analogue.<p>There&#x27;s a reason the manual version of the same F430 has a 100,000 USD premium. As EVs become no longer just Tesla, ICE cars are going to be even more sought after.<p>Tesla&#x27;s electric cars are boring and Porsche&#x27;s rendition is what the future holds.
