It&#x27;s all boring.<p>All of it has been on a scale that wouldn&#x27;t affect the outcome of elections. For example in Georgia 2 ballots were submitted in the names of dead people. In Colorado they are investigating non-matching signatures on a few hundred ballots.<p>This kind of stuff is routine, and happens in every election. Of course it isn&#x27;t perfect, but its a decent enough system that has worked well in 100s of countries across centuries')
