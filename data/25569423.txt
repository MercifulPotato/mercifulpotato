Item(by='joshvm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609247522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565110, text='I strongly recommend upgrading your GBA if you still have it - you can get an IPS replacement screen (bare minimum, it&#x27;s an enormous improvement), USB-C Lipo battery, new shells&#x2F;buttons,   louder speaker, etc. I think it costs around $100 for the lot, but it breathes a lot of life back into the platform. Personally, I prefer the standard GBA for superior ergonomics, and the lack of moving parts (and it&#x27;s the one I had!)')
