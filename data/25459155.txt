Eliminating Google analytics is unequivocally a good thing.  A strong B+ assessment.  But the blog doesn&#x27;t say anything about eliminating _tracking_.  Personally, I can live with analysis that&#x27;s used solely for product improvement.  If that&#x27;s all github is doing, then the score goes up to an A.<p>But if they&#x27;re siphoning off data for any other purposes - whether passing to the mother ship or otherwise - then the score is down to D-.  The intent of EU cookie regulation is to make tracking and data collection transparent and opt in.  Changing the implementation to server side might comply with the letter of the law but it violates the spirit.<p>It would be good if GitHub would clarify their position.')
