Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=[25189464, 25189675], score=None, time=1606152624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189000, text='Something that surprises me is that nobody ever talks about efficiency, as a trait of a particular piece of regulation.<p>The goal of a regulation, like a project constraint, is to enforce some outcome. This is often a good thing. However, not all implementations of the &quot;code&quot; of that regulation are going to be equal. There&#x27;s a huge gap between the desired outcome and the way it&#x27;s articulated as law; there&#x27;s a ton of wiggle-room there. And that can make a huge difference in how burdensome a regulation is to actually adhere to. And that can have a huge economic impact.<p>The left talks about how important regulations are, and the right talks about how inefficient they are, and both of these things can be true at the same time.<p>What would it look like to ask ourselves how regulations could be &quot;refactored&quot; to achieve the same goal in a more efficient way? Maybe the assumption is that too much political capitol would be required to actually put such changes into action. Though, we should at least be asking ourselves this question when drafting <i>new</i> law.<p>Why isn&#x27;t there a whole field around &quot;regulation engineering&quot; (not actually suggesting this name, but it gets my point across), including best-practices, case-studies, etc?')
