SwiftUI is the latest contributor to never-ending CRUD hell and I am merely informing the young and impressionable, that SwiftUI is not your friend - it is your anti-cross-platform, proprietary, closed source devil spawn (being dramatic for fun :)) and if you ever want to start solving real world problems instead of learning the latest framework that does what we did 20 years ago but 5% better this time, you better listen real careful to annoying debby-downers like me, Joe Armstrong (RIP), Rich Hickey etc who got fed up with the corporate matrix and went a different way.')
