There is a more loose standard (never written down anywhere explicitly I believe, not surprisingly, since who&#x27;s gonna read a phonetic treatise?) in Germany in terms of pronunciation, which is certainly what most people in the media, try to speak, but you won&#x27;t have any such luck in Switzerland, neither with actual Swiss German, nor with the way Swiss people pronounce Standard German (it&#x27;s interesting: I can usually roughly tell where a Swiss person is from when they speak German).<p>Not understanding, or having more trouble with, certain accents doesn&#x27;t make you an &quot;accentist&quot;, but thinking that this is a fault on the other person&#x27;s side is.<p>&gt; In Germany one can grow up and live in the middle of a state for their whole lives, and still heavily struggle with understanding the local accent of a smaller nearby town.<p>Does this really still happen nowadays?<p>&gt; And while that is certainly an enrichment on the cultural diversity side to have that many, and so different, accents, it also makes communication more difficult, more prone to fail, thus ultimately more likely for misunderstandings to happen.<p>Sure, but I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for diversity, one I&#x27;m personally glad to pay.')
