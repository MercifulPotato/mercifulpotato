There’s no reason in-groups should be defined by race...but, at least in the United States, it was quite literally legislated in law for centuries and formed the basis of a slave state and then segregation. So it seems like race has historically been one way we define in-groups and out-groups. Based on current events, I’d argue race is still pretty important to a lot of people. Otherwise our politics wouldn’t be...whatever you want to call them.<p>&gt; Indeed the whole notion of &#x27;race&#x27; itself is largely artificial, historically- and locally-contingent, and thus so is racism.<p>Race is socially constructed but it’s definitely real. Racism is also real.')
