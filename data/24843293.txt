It&#x27;s an incredibly important use case though. It&#x27;s a great store of value.<p>Because of its scarcity, a cryptocurrency soaks up surplus currency created by banks and prevents it from being wasted on creating less-than-useless startups and jobs which harm society. It also stops surplus currency from being soaked up by corporate monopolies that are eroding our personal freedoms and society.<p>Also, PoS and DPoS cryptocurrencies consume very little electricity and don&#x27;t require specialized hardware so they store value very efficiently.')
