I thought it was a bit odd that the story of the damaged Titan-2 was interleaved with the part about protocols and security, which I considered the more important part of the book. Whenever the story switched back to the Titan-2, I found myself wishing that they would just get it over with so I could get back to the more interesting part. However, the Titan-2 story might make for a good movie by itself.')
