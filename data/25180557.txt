I should have written that COVID-19 has been a killing blow for many already-sick companies.<p>Still, if you&#x27;re running a distressed company, your attitude must be, &quot;we are not dead until we&#x27;re dead.&quot; Channel your inner Dylan Thomas and rage against the dying of the light.<p>I have a mid-60s relative who teaches music privately, via Zoom. Her business is more active now than it was when she was teaching in person, due to fewer costs for transportation and less downtime between lessons. I&#x27;m not sure how sustainable that surge in activity will prove to be, but she has at times asked me to help her buy musical instruments online for new students. It&#x27;s anecdotal evidence that suggests music education isn&#x27;t going away just because brick-and-mortar retail is under pressure.<p>School closures aside: if someone is going to sell guitars and drum kits, why can&#x27;t it be Guitar Center?<p>Amazon has put retailers in the position where they have to compete on price, information, ease of returns, and shipping speed. A dedicated retailer (music store vs general store) should be better at competing on price and information. A local store should be better at competing on ease of returns and shipping speed.')
