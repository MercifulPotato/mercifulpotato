Thanks for sharing!<p>Pulled down some of repositories listed and ran the provided Postman collection against them. None of them passes all the tests, so seems it&#x27;s missing a bit of testing infrastructure and possibly centralization, to ensure they all pass the tests.<p>Once that would be in place, it would be easy to add benchmarking to it, to be able to do some honest comparisons.<p>At least it works as a baseline for seeing the complexity of frameworks, so it&#x27;s still useful.')
