Modal editing makes no sense in current year. It and vi were designed for terminals without Pg Up&#x2F;Down keys.[0] Looks like no End either, although there&#x27;s a Home.<p>Times have changed. It&#x27;s so awful to get used to, and the alternative is just reaching for Home&#x2F;End&#x2F;Pg Up&#x2F;Pg Down. Gimmie a break, fam. (What&#x27;s ironic is that most people I know who love vim <i>do</i> use those keys, so they&#x27;re paying the speed penalty of not having to reach for them for nothing -- plus the million penalties of using a terminal editor, and a byzantine one at that.)<p>Also, ever wonder why the movement keys are HJKL and not the home row&#x27;s JKL;, which would be far better and more intuitive? Glance back at that picture; for no good reason, the manufacturer of those terminals decided to put arrows on HJKL. And so, in inertial carryover of dumb design, vi&#x27;s creator decided those should be the movement keys.<p>Sorry, time to eject from this fossilized ride from the &#x27;70s and into the 21st century.<p>0: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vintagecomputer.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;LSI-ADM3A-full-keyboard.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vintagecomputer.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;LSI-ADM...</a>')
