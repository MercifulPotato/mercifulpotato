Having a bird&#x27;s eye view of every single account, transaction, investments, net worth, etc. is &quot;totally useless&quot;?  No.<p>I use Mint and it works quite well for keeping an eye on your financial life at a glance.  I don&#x27;t need some micro-managey software like YNAB (that I&#x27;d have to pay for monthly!) to continually increase my wealth and keep debt in check - here&#x27;s my tricks:<p>* Pay off credit card in full every month (I have one card that I use for gas, etc.)<p>* Invest 20% into company-matched 401k, my Roth, etc. primarily focused on S&amp;P 500 Index Funds<p>* Save roughly $275&#x2F;check into a liquid savings account.<p>* I have no car payment (paid of my 2010 Subaru that I got for $9k).<p>* Everything on autopay.<p>* Don&#x27;t buy stupid nonsense.<p>It&#x27;s worked well thus far. There&#x27;s no real &quot;need&quot; to budget - KISS principle wins the day again.')
