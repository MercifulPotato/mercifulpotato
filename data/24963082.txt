A lot of the confusions came up as I took the default sign up templates which looked too generic.<p>I hope to make up a little bit for my mistakes earlier today with this post.<p>Maybe after fixing this mistakes some of you might be interested in the newsletter after all:\nI will send you a research paper mainly about distributed systems and backend development (as this are my day-to-day topics): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simon-frey.com&#x2F;weeklycspaper&#x2F;<p>p.S. Does anyone of you how the mechanism of getting flagged works?')
