Not to mention there was an existing (employer-employee) relationship between either Van Buren or Rodriguez and the operator of the computer database: the US government.  Compare that to scraping a public website; the person doing he scraping may have relationship with the operator of the website.<p>I could set &quot;Terms of Use&quot; for the data stored on protected computers I own.  I could place limits on &quot;acceptable use&quot; of this data.   But can I really argue that I gave adequate notice to all the tech companies and partners that try to access this data.')
