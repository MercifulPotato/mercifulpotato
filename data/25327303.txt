Yes, vscode is easier to configure and use right away, but that&#x27;s not always a good thing. I was fully dependent on so much tooling which I didn&#x27;t understand in the slightest. When you&#x27;re cranking out react apps that&#x27;s probably fine.<p>With emacs I actually need to read documentation. I need to have some sort of understanding of what I&#x27;m actually installing. It&#x27;s frustrating at first, but overall has made me much more aware of what&#x27;s going on. I&#x27;ve learned so much throughout the process and it has made me a better developer.')
