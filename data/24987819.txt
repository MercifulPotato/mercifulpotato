Item(by='gwd', descendants=None, kids=[24988159, 24989542, 24994067], score=None, time=1604485287, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987631, text='&gt; Slavery is coerced labor, how can you even make the comparison?<p>There are different levels of coercion.  After all, even a literal slave doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to work -- they can just allow themselves to be beaten to death.  But given the choice between being beaten to death and working, most people choose working.<p>But the fact is that even people who aren&#x27;t slaves still have to have a place to live and something to eat.  In the 1800&#x27;s, lots of white people in the North weren&#x27;t legal slaves; but they were &quot;wage slaves&quot; in factories -- they worked 11 hours a day, 7 days a week, for just enough to have a roof over their head and food in their stomachs; and if they got sick or injured they were just out of luck.<p>The idea that all of those people were &quot;opting in&quot; to that kind of life is preposterous.  They were being coerced to work by their physical needs; and the Market, recognizing this, offered them the smallest amount better than &quot;homeless and starving&quot; that they could.<p>Obviously things are better now than they were in the 1800s, but only because we have laws against &quot;opting in&quot; to bad jobs.  As soon as those laws are taken away, the Market will ensure things go back to the way they were.<p>Uber and Lyft have done many things differently than traditional taxi companies; but one of the things they&#x27;ve done is make an end-run round the labor laws that stop the Market from coercing people into dead-end jobs.<p>The only other way to prevent that kind of coersion is Universal Basic Income.  If employees can walk away from a job that&#x27;s dangerous and pays poorly, then the Market will make sure employers offer more reasonable conditions.')
