It isn&#x27;t necessary. I&#x27;m fine with not calling &quot;the later&quot; a free market. It is not, strictly speaking, a free market. But that term is also not used uniformly. Some use it strictly to refer to a hands-off market, others use it more generically to refer to something like &quot;market forces&quot;. If you don&#x27;t like that loose usage, it would be perfectly acceptable to say &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s not really a free market, that term means something else.&quot;<p>Or do you take issue with me saying there is a concept of a &quot;free market&quot; and another concept of a &quot;(not pure) free market&quot;? Honestly I don&#x27;t know because you haven&#x27;t taken the time explain your point of view before resorting to personal attacks, and calling someone a liar or irrational because they use a term more loosely than you&#x27;d prefer is an excellent way to shut down productive conversation. You have taken that path, so I won&#x27;t bother to converse further unless you&#x27;re willing to back off the flame-war rhetoric and explain your point of view without insults. If don&#x27;t want to take the time for that, that&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;m not entitled to your detailed explanations, in which case I wish you well, and ask you simply not to respond if that response will consist of insults.')
