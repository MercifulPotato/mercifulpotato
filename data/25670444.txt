And to be honest, an average person really has no way of <i>truly</i> knowing this. They&#x27;re not virologists or spies. They can only judge based on a gut feeling whether China is&#x2F;isn&#x27;t evil, and that is likely based on other things they&#x27;ve heard, which may include rumors, propaganda and Bond movies.')
