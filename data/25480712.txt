Jeff Bezos is powerful because he controls Amazon. He is also powerful because he has 200 billion dollars. He has 200 billion dollars because he owns a large portion of Amazon. If Bezos had only 1 billion dollars, he&#x27;d still have a lot of power, but much less of it. Further, the rest of his wealth could go to other good things (to the people living in the state&#x2F;country or to Amazon workers, who I believe are more deserving (collectively) of it than Bezos.')
