The Pebble Time had a 180 MHz processor, and I think as a smartwatch, it was a much better product than the Apple Watch.<p>When you have a powerful processor like the Apple Watch does, your power draw is pretty high. This is why the Apple Watch only gets 1-2 days of battery life, while the Pebble has 7 days, and the Apple watch just got a display that is always on, while the Pebble has had a always on display since day 1.')
