It can clearly be used for to traffic drugs, humans, blackmarket weapons, etc.<p>This is a good thought experiment actually. I think typical Americans support policing all roads and highways, especially where stretches of road are known to be frequented by bad actors. If private corporations owned highway infrastructure and unilaterally decided to shut down segments of road in order to stop those bad actors, it should raise a lot of questions.<p>I think this highlights the need for better legislation, not <i>only</i> to limit corporations ability to shut down services, but but to replace that with policing put in place by elected governance and based on laws that apply equally to everyone.')
