But that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m  a developer, and it&#x27;s why I&#x27;m happy to purchase multiple Yubikeys (one for my desktop, one for laptop, backups including one that is on a keychain, etc.)   Perhaps you were reading web sites that was giving advice for developers as opposed to for consumers?')
