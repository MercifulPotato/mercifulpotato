Rust’s borrow checker approaches this, but the abstraction leaky or nonexistent. Additionally, many high performance computing applications (e.g. Tensorflow) abstract away expensive mutable operations, so at least in theory, it should be possible to isolate mutability to small segments of code where mutability is opt-in.')
