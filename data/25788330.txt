The massive groups that form via today&#x27;s internet do not reflect human nature in the real world.  People usually are only part of small groups, family, friends, colleagues, teammates, etc.  People usually keep the groups isolated from one another, for the most part.  The internet has been hijacked to become primarily a broadcast medium that serves the interests of advertisers, marketers, promoters, etc., those who deal in hype, and a relatively small number of companies (middlemen) that enable them.  The hijackers all want internet users to join large groups that can be targeted through a central point with commercial&#x2F;political mesaging.')
