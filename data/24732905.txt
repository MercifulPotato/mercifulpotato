I will defend the rights of any non-monopoly (Apple doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly on the phone market) that created their own hardware, software platform and digital market from scratch, to define their own rules governing said digital market whatsoever.<p>However, do not confuse defending Apple&#x27;s right to impose their rules with &quot;liking&quot; or &quot;approving&quot; what they do. Just because I believe Apple is in full rights to do all of this I do not like it so as I consumer I vote with my wallet, which is my right to do so just as is their right to impose rules on their platform.<p>A lot of the people riling up against Apple seem to want to have the cake and eat it too. They want partake in the value of the Apple digital platform (both as consumers and developers) but then they want to force Apple to play by their own rules, not Apple&#x27;s rules. That doesn&#x27;t seem right to me plus it&#x27;s just contradictory as it&#x27;s very likely that Apple being able to enforce their own rules is what created the value of their platform anyway.')
