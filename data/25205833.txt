Does earth rules apply to life from other planets? And what if the extraterrestrial life are magnitudes of order stronger and technologically advanced than us? I mean we could demand it but in effect it would be nothing but words. The only reason that laws work is because of the threat of what happens if you donâ€™t obey. If we are not in a position to threaten the extra terrestrials then we are also not in a position to dictate rules for them to follow.')
