They’re just expensive certification programs at best, in terms of utility. The actual teaching&#x2F;learning (which I feel they do a bad job of) and the testing&#x2F;certifying can be separated from each other and democratized (opened up to competition, made more available). The current costs of college are ridiculous, and a minor 10% tuition cut from the $70K&#x2F;year cost mentioned in this article isn’t going nearly far enough. I also feel there isn’t a good reason to limit the number of students who can be certified to a Harvard or MIT level, for example, and we can change that.<p>Moreover a lot of college seems like activities the public shouldn’t be subsidizing. A jobs program for overpaid administrators. A portfolio of majors that are not rigorous and seem more like hobbies. Pet research projects for tenured professors that often has low return on investment. Local college town economies. And so on.')
