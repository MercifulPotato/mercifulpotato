Their open calls for violence were far more consequential and severe and serious than anything on Parler<p>The question is a good one. In the hope of avoiding a similar fate, I&#x27;ll state the original implicit question explicitly: Where on earth does the authority come from, which authorizes Amazon, ostensibly a private corporation, to arbitrate ANYTHING to do with public speech? Beyond just, say, their raw power and the inability of anyone to stop them.<p>It&#x27;s truly shocking to me that so many people are <i>celebrating</i> this. Not just, &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s an overreach but these are weird times,&quot; or something like this, but just totally, brain-shut-down, unwilling to think through future implications, etc. This sets a precedent for the very, very small number owners of core tech infrastructure--not just media platforms, but physical server infrastructure!--to decide what we all get to see, and ultimately what&#x27;s right and wrong (right: endless war, wrong: right-wing insurrection, however inept).<p>Even if you think it was a necessary move (I don&#x27;t, but surely reasonable people will), if we want to be adults about politics, we have to grapple with it and take these kinds of questions very seriously, not just heap censorship on top of censorship, avoiding the question.')
