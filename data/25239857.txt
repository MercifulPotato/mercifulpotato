From what all I&#x27;ve seen I am taking the public comments at face value: Amazon wants to use Rust long term, so they are putting resources into ensuring Rust&#x27;s long term viability. I think that there are exist few things that Amazon could possibly want that from this effort that wouldn&#x27;t also be desired by the ecosystem at large. Changing the language isn&#x27;t something that is done in the dark, the RFC process is as transparent as it could be (although it is not actively promoted to the entire community, which does produce the &quot;why wasn&#x27;t I consulted?&quot; reaction from time to time) and that process will not be changed to become more opaque.<p>Rust the project is resilient because although it was significantly shepherded by Mozilla, it&#x27;s been years since it relied on any single company or even individual for advancing (although there are many people whose contributions are very important).<p>Rust the language is stable, if &quot;incomplete&quot;, as there are many language &quot;features&quot; that are still needed (by &quot;features&quot; I don&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;adding new things&quot; as some might be worried about, but rather &quot;making existing features work in more places&quot; which although they complicate the <i>implementation</i> of the language simplify the <i>usage</i> of the language).<p>Rust the ecosystem has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past couple of years but is still green, particularly if you want to use anything outside of the beaten path trail blazed by hobbyists and early adopters. Writing new crates people might want or bringing existing crates up to production quality requires resources: people, money and time. Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google are four large companies that are providing some of those resources. Lots of other companies and individuals are as well. I see these developments as a good thing.')
