The upside of this is that Ingram is a logistics specialist and has the ability to ship very quickly and reliably---and so bookshop.org is in a way the best of both worlds, as it pays the local bookstores via their Ingram contract while also leveraging Ingram&#x27;s order fulfillment business to get things shipped quickly and reliably.')
