Not being a significant contributor to the spread while parents are freed up to do important work. It’s been the goal all along to keep health care capacity above demands.<p>I agree with that and wish more people were thinking this way in the U.S.<p>&gt; Last I heard it is still believed that there is no scientific basis supporting masks as an effective measure, if beneficial at all. (It’s often mention with a reiteration that the primary measure for any person with symptoms is to stay at home)<p>I believe this is correct. Masks only work in sterile environments and only if they are truly medical grade. I see people sniffling all over their masks and they are probably hosting tons of bacteria for the wearer. And people touch them and then touch other things.')
