(shudders)<p>#2 The author makes the point that a two-person team would be unable to finance the certification regulations and that would be a valid point except that trust me when I say that if your fledgling company had a fully working, well tested and well crafted&#x2F;coded application and that all that you needed was some seed money to clear the regulatory hurdles then the VC cash would flow, especially these days.<p>Which leads us on to the issue of documentation. As part of due diligence, good documentation will help clinch the deal. As a small crew the documentation part of it would almost write itself in a weeks worth of everyone contributing if done at the point of serious VC interest.<p>So given that, I disagree with the author because any App, API, $thing is going to need a lot more QC than say Candy Crush and Iâ€™m happy for that to remain the case.')
