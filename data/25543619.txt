I also think people rightly expect a perfect experience from Apple. It&#x27;s the bar they themselves have set.<p>With that said, what part of the failure mode was user-hostile? I have an ATV, various Chromecasts, and Amazon streaming devices, and the ATV is by far the best, most reliable experience. My only complaint is the price, and if they were cheaper they would be on every TV in my house.')
