I just kind of lump them in as makers. Most of the people I&#x27;ve met at my local makerspace fit this bill - they&#x27;re just tinkering with something or taking up a hobby. But as I mentioned, most of these people I&#x27;ve met are&#x2F;were engineers professionally. I think it&#x27;s just that on their personal projects they were more relaxed about &quot;process&quot; than they would be at work.<p>When I was in doing my Engineering degree in college, one of my professors once tried to make a spectrum of technical ability. One the low end he put &quot;tinkerers&quot; and on the high end he put &quot;engineers.&quot; I think that&#x27;s where a lot of my perceptions of technical ability are coming from. Like I said, it&#x27;s just my opinion')
