I&#x27;m not judging you, because trust me, expensive areas like New York City (I love living there) are great, but blow during a pandemic since you&#x27;re unable to enjoy what the actual city has to offer.<p>When I relocated back east, I made it a point to a) not live in the city since it&#x27;ll be overpriced and I won&#x27;t be able to enjoy the surrounding area and b) Price per square footage wouldn&#x27;t make sense if I&#x27;m at home 24&#x2F;7.
