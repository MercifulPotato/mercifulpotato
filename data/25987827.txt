Fungibility is merely how easily the medium is broken into smaller parts that <i>may</i> be exchange for convenience, and not the regulated use of third parties, unless you&#x27;re really talking about liquidity. The latter can easily be solved with waivers or contractual agreements (such as an opt in). As far as I know most brokers already do that, but the implication is that some don&#x27;t or are somehow able to sidestep such regulation.')
