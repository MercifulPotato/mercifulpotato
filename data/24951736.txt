Which was.... Uncomfortable.<p>Have I ever been beaten for turning up late? No.<p>Has someone somewhere in the world, in the last year, been beaten for not showing up to work on time? I&#x27;d probably bet Â£10 on that one.<p>Edit...<p>just to clarify, I don&#x27;t agree with the original parent comment&#x27;s comparisons to sexuality etc.<p>But I also appreciate that sleep issues are a problem in our society that we are yet to deal with.')
