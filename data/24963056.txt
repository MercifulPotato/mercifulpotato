PRISM ingestion happens long after a system can be wiretapped but presumably contains data from the when the FBI first started wiretapping these systems. I&#x27;m referencing documents the Guardian claimed to have seen that said wiretapping work began in November 2010. Also, 2&#x2F;6&#x2F;2011 means February 6, 2011 in the American system. According to The Guardian:<p>&quot;According to the NSA documents, work had begun on smoothly integrating Skype into Prism in November 2010, but it was not until 4 February 2011 that the company was served with a directive to comply signed by the attorney general.<p>&quot;The NSA was able to start tasking Skype communications the following day, and collection began on 6 February.&quot;<p>It is not rude to point out misinformation, and your comment fits the definition of &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot;')
