I would think the difference in time of sunrise between them varies during the year (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sunrise_equation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sunrise_equation</a>). If so, repeated appointments would have to move for at least one of them. In itself that isn’t problematic, but if one also has appointments with people on the same latitude, non-overlapping events might start overlapping over time.<p>Also, why stop at sunrise, and discriminate against sunset? Do what the Romans did: always have 12 hours between sunrise and sunset and 12 between sunset and sunrise (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roman_timekeeping#Variation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roman_timekeeping#Variation</a>) :-)')
