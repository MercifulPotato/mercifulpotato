Get a supported Android device - there are hundreds of those by now - and install an AOSP-derived distribution like LineageOS. Leave out the Google bits, i.e. no &#x27;gapps&#x27;, no Google account, no nothing. If you need &#x27;apps&#x27; which rely on the Google Services Framework use microG [1] but be aware of the fact that even this free software implementation of GSF needs to connect to Google to do its thing, i.e. try to find &#x27;apps&#x27; which don&#x27;t rely on GSF to start with. Use F-Droid or another alternative repository for you &#x27;app&#x27; needs and something like Aurora Store (which you&#x27;ll find on F-Droid) for those &#x27;apps&#x27; which can only be found in the &#x27;Google Play store&#x27;. Install a firewall (available on F-Droid and elsewhere) and set it to block all traffic by default. Configure it to allow selected &#x27;apps&#x27; and system services to access those parts of the network (LAN, WAN, Mobile Data and VPN) you think they need. You can use the Log service to monitor which apps try to access the network.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got something like this set up the way you want it you&#x27;re mostly there. The radio firmware will still be outside of your control and probably open to exploitation by the Three Letter Agencies of the world, for now there is not much that can be done about this other than to get a device with totally separate baseband processor, i.e. not integrated into the SoC. These used to be common but are as rare as hens&#x27; teeth now. There are some - e.g. the Librem 5 - but most devices come with an integrated baseband subsystem. Then again, for the purpose of circumventing the duopoly this is irrelevant so it can be ignored by all but those who also want to limit access to their devices by TLAs.<p>I&#x27;ve been using AOSP-derived distributions for as long as I&#x27;ve been using Android - close to 10 years - and have never found reason to regret my choice. LineageOS has OTA updates just like vendor distributions, the user experience is that of &#x27;clean Android&#x27; - no bloatware.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microg.org&#x2F;fdroid.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microg.org&#x2F;fdroid.html</a>')
