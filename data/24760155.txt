It takes a conscious effort, and even then I find it difficult.<p>That&#x27;s why I enjoy taking support calls every now and then, looking at screenshots or viewing the customer reproducing an issue over Teamviewer and having the customer explain what they think should happen and what actually happens. I might prod a bit, ask about why they do things a certain way, or to discover more about how they work and what they need our software to do.<p>Invariably I learn how we can improve some area of our application, making it more intuitive, less error prone or simply improve the workflow.')
