Item(by='aeturnum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612208434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25991563, text='&gt; It&#x27;s impossible for EVERY tool to be good.<p>What does &#x27;good&#x27; mean? Gcc is a good C compiler and a bad Java compiler. It&#x27;s even worse at being a document database.<p>I don&#x27;t think 01acheru was saying that all tools are equally able to do all tasks. I read them as saying that people have used tools with recognized flaws to make good stuff and that being snobby about whether tools are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in a general way isn&#x27;t super useful for anyone. Instead, we should say specific things about specific flaws and let others decide if those flaws matter to them.<p>In particular, this post isn&#x27;t really saying that MongoDB doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s saying that the MongoDB data model isn&#x27;t useful for what the author was using it for. Even if you are sure that your app was &quot;the perfect use case for MongoDB&quot; all you can really speak about is your use case. The real headline for this article is &quot;we couldn&#x27;t make MongoDB work and we&#x27;re skeptical anyone can,&quot; which is totally fair, but shys away from the grand claims that 01acheru (and I) are critiquing.')
