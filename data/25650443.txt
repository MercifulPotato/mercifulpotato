Certain parts are great, because those teams seem to be great and are blockers, such as the kernel or the silicon.  Other parts closer to the surface that aren&#x27;t in quite as critical a path, all the way up to documentation... not quite as much.<p>Overall they do a decent job, and are certainly moving in a good direction security-wise (although not privacy-wise).  It&#x27;s just clear that many of their teams are stretched extremely thin.')
