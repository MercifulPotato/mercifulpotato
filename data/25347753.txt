I cannot stand the company, their fans, or their products, but you got to give credit where credit is due.<p>They have managed to turn a tech company in to a luxury fashion company. That is every entrepreneur&#x27;s wet dream. \nYou keep getting away with customers like a bandit and people will still happily buy it. \nJust look at the people commenting in this thread where people are honestly admitting to paying a $200 markup just because it is Apple and they &quot;trust&quot; them, for a product they don&#x27;t even know if they need.<p>Amazing, to be able to achieve something like this is really wow...')
