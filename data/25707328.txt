Many voices &quot;on the left&quot; have always been under surveillance since we started surveiling our citizens, and were often economically blackballed on the free market as well.<p>Also this seems like false equivalences between people saying we should change how policing works vs we should overturn the results of our election through force.<p>We have actual armed insurrectionists on one hand storming the capitol with zip cuffs and illegally carried firearms. You are asking how we would feel if we treated BLM, the people who want their tax dollars to go to alternatives to policing, like we treated those people inciting the capitol riot. Honestly it would probably be an improvement.')
