Remember him when he was Chief Software Architect? He started Azure &#x2F; Microsoft transition to the cloud. He created that shift in focus that Microsoft now rides on. Had he not gotten that brief period as BillG&#x27;s replacement, Microsoft would have continued to live in the past where windows and on-premise office suite was king.
