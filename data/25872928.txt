Nuclear power systems present novel failure mechanisms that don&#x27;t exist in everyday technology, such as the corrosion mechanisms caused by coupling of mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiological stresses, and MSR&#x27;s present a new set of these that are poorly understood. Additionally, MSR&#x27;s exhibit thermal shocks in normal operations orders of magnitude above what may be produced in a water-cooled reactor.<p>It&#x27;s just not that simple - it looks simple to you.')
