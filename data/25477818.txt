First:<p>&gt; <i>It’s an unfortunate quirk of the English language that</i> free as freedom <i>and</i> free as in beer <i>are very different meanings of free. But when you see an ad headlined “Apple vs. The Free Internet”, most people would assume they’re about to hear an argument about</i> free as in freedom.<p>&gt; <i>Not Facebook. They’re arguing about</i> free as in beer. <i>I mean, they’re alleging that Apple is taking away freedom — the freedom of small business advertisers to benefit from unrestricted tracking for ad targeting — but their argument to the public is that such privacy initiatives will cost users their free beer.</i><p>Second:<p>&gt; <i>Apple clearly has no control over anything related to the advertising on websites, other than whatever privacy controls are built into Safari. Apple isn’t limiting the ability of</i> apps <i>on iOS to show personalized ads, either. They’re also not limiting the ability of ad-tracking technology to track users. What they’re doing is giving users awareness of and control over that tracking. In broad terms, changing tracking from opt-out to opt-in.</i>')
