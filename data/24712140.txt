Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[24712293], score=None, time=1602101188, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712011, text='&gt; I think a lot of it is that in-demand, well paid workers don&#x27;t have patience for the BS work rules that unions are notorious for. It might be unfair characterization, but &quot;you can&#x27;t change&#x2F;test that code, that&#x27;s role X&quot;, and other such bureaucracy can be really draining.<p>Some existing blue-collar unions have work rules like that, but I think it&#x27;s a fallacy that a tech worker union would necessarily work exactly the same.  To say so would be like  condemning (say) Apple (as a business) by using examples from Radio Shack.<p>I think the main reasons for tech workers historical opposition to unions was:<p>1. Tech workers had rare, in-demand skills which gave them market power not enjoyed by most workers who have unionized.  This is by far the biggest reason.<p>2. The influence of narratives different genres of free market propaganda.  I think the concept of a impersonal self-regulating free market has a special intellectual appeal to the kind of people who like to design technical systems, and a lot of the mass-market works that espouse it are written for the benefit of the capitalists that benefit most acutely from that system.  This is a secondary reason, but makes the first reason far more effective.<p>3. The influence of startup culture, which (temporarily!) creates jobs that blend worker and capitalist.  Relatively few people find themselves in these kinds of roles, but they&#x27;ve gotten enormous amounts of publicity relative to other tech jobs.')
