That means the entire universe, including time itself.<p>&gt; Would non-human intelligent life have souls?<p>Catholic teaching is that all life has some manner of soul. Humans have rational souls. Intelligent life would therefore have souls.<p>&gt; Why wasn&#x27;t this mentioned in the Bible? Doesn&#x27;t this mean that both creation stories are inconvertibly false?<p>Why would it? It doesn&#x27;t claim to be comprehensive or complete.<p>&gt; how could they square away the fact the vast majority of all life could exist without knowing salvation via Christ? Being ignorant of Christ doesn&#x27;t automatically mean you are damned, but this now means belief in Christ is optional and kind of just a localized thing some humans choose to do<p>Many, many human begins lived and died without knowing Christ. Why would aliens present a problem? Perhaps they wouldn&#x27;t even need it. CS Lewis wrote science fictions with un-Fallen aliens. Maybe such a thing could exist.<p>&gt; if for example aliens claimed their savior was the &quot;real&quot; messiah, how could you dismiss that?<p>Catholics don&#x27;t seem to have a problem dismissing other messiahs. Why would an alien messiah be different?<p>&gt; events the Rapture essentially cease to make sense or will have to be radically re-imagined.<p>The Rapture as depicted in something like Left Behind is not how the event is generally understood in Catholicism or other sects. There&#x27;s no reason it would have to change at all.')
