However, as you rightly said we are currently focused on the backend API building problem.<p>As we&#x27;ve been pivoting to be a more citizen-first non-tech friendly platform, frontend on Canonic is something we have been discussing and debating frequently.<p>The main concern with a frontend builder for us is the need for it to truly be as close to a design tool as possible. The frontend of an application frequently ends up being unique to accommodate branding and creative freedom and becomes hard to fit in a traditional drag-n-drop tool. We just want to make sure, we are truly solving that problem and not just making another frontend builder that people have to wrangle to get their designs to fit.<p>As for lock-in, we do want to avoid it all costs and our working on strategies and features that would allow you to migrate in and out of Canonic with ease.<p>Currently, Canonic is a great fit for anyone who wants to build a backends quickly and without writing code. Some level of technical know-how is, however, required. We do hope to eliminate that soon.<p>P.S. Canonic plans to have a free forever plan for getting started and hobbyist projects')
