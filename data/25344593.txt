She does it herself. She&#x27;s working pro bono on behalf of herself. A lot less expensive to do it that way.<p>Maybe she&#x27;s bored? Maybe she&#x27;s developed a bad rep and can&#x27;t make enough money as a real estate attorney? Maybe she just enjoys the lulz? At any rate, all it&#x27;s costing her is some filing fees. She&#x27;s probably not paying an attorney by the hour to advise her.<p>This type of shit would go away if there was something approximating true &quot;loser pays&quot; in USA court. Right now the guy would have to file a counter suit, hire an attorney, and hope he wins the counter suit. And then hope that the judge awards significant damages.<p>In the meantime he could wind up spending the entire worth of the treasure on legal fees. Too bad he studied to be a doctor instead of a lawyer. :)')
