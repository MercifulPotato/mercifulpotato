I would even wager that the risk for themselves is getting increased over time because of people freaking out more and more seeing a cop with a gun in the US.<p>And let&#x27;s not pretend that cops in the US are well trained, they are so afraid and completly unable to de-escalate a situation that I would have 0 confidence in a cop pulling a gun on me in the US (not saying I would like it anywhere, but I would sure be less freaked out in Europe).<p>This is just plain stupid, it&#x27;s not a necessity of life like you paint it.')
