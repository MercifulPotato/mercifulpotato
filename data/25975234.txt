It&#x27;s also not a legal one, because legal enforcement of anything is completely irrelevant for the time scales that matter.\nThe EU is in a position where none of these things can be fixed now.<p>The fact that the vaccine was developed in the UK and is produced in the UK can not be an argument. In light of the UK&#x27;s reliance on the EU vaccine, all this does is show the UK contract with AZ as ethically deficient.<p>After all, the EU is currently the only supplier for the UK for the Pfizer vaccine - the one that kickstarted the UK&#x27;s early success. How would the UK&#x27;s vaccine program look now, if the EU had acted similarly from the start?<p>Sure, the EU could have mandated exactly this last year. But they shouldn&#x27;t have. It would have been wrong and morally despicable.<p>The EU SHOULD now deal with their choices with grace. They don&#x27;t, which is the real shame.<p>But if you are British and feel smug about your government&#x27;s cunning, then I seriously doubt your moral compass.')
