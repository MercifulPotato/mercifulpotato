And I&#x27;m not condoning what happened in the slightest (even if I do agree that the government no longer represents the people). But destroying and looting small businesses is not a constitutional right either, but that behavior wasn&#x27;t denounced en mass like the behavior at the Capitol; rather, the former was encouraged by politicians, the media, celebrities, and even the public. It&#x27;s a double standard. We should hold all people to the same standard regardless of their political affiliation. I personally think it&#x27;s a bad precedent to ban POTUS, but alas.')
