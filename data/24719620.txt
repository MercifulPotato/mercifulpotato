A well constructed syntax is certainly a nice feature of a programming language. One might say a language like brainfuck does not have a syntax which makes the code easily readable, and therefore is the worse for it.<p>Similarly, one might say that a strong type system is a useful tool. That doesn&#x27;t make it a panacea (and I don&#x27;t think that this was the claim), but that doesn&#x27;t mean one can&#x27;t appreciate it as a good tool.')
