It&#x27;s significantly better than relying on speakers.<p>As for helping people orient themselves in the station... I have no idea.  Using an app is the only way for tourists to figure out which direction to go.  You have to know the terminal station to know which direction a train is going.  The apps will (usually) tell you that.  Having digital information inside the train would at least make people more immediately aware that they are on the wrong train.')
