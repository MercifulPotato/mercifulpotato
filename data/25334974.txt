Innovation came from Silicon Valley because of a more innovation-friendly regulatory climate.<p>Guess which won out?<p>US reached economic supremacy in part due to a weaker IP scheme than Europe, and China is doing likewise right now. Innovation requires a mixture of economic rewards (which doesn&#x27;t happen in the absence of any enforcement), and building off of the work of others (which doesn&#x27;t happen with strict IP laws). Massachusetts went off of the deep end of more is better.<p>Coincidentally, Boston is doing better for big business, like biotech, in part because there, the balance falls in a different place. It&#x27;s very tough to start a scrappy biotech, so the number of employee leaving to do a competing startup is pretty darned low in either case. The downsides of strong IP are smaller, and the upsides of weak IP are greater.')
