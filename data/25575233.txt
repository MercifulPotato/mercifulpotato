I&#x27;m not opposed to people coming up with variants, it&#x27;s just that the current crop of variants don&#x27;t fix real problems.<p>Like fix the stupid I2C clock stretching bug. Reverse engineer the Broadcom chip, clone it, and fix the bug, because the lazy asses at Broadcom won&#x27;t do it.<p>Or make an RPi with a rich plug-and-play CSI camera ecosystem with hundreds of sensors and lens mounts to choose from, all connected via the camera connector.<p>Seriously, screw the RPi &quot;high quality&quot; camera and it&#x27;s teeny useless sensor -- I want 35mm full frame, 20-50 megapixels, in CSI with a python library for exposure control, and I&#x27;m willing to pay maybe half the cost of a full frame DSLR to get that.<p>Nobody sells such a thing at the moment, and it would be an awesome thing to have.')
