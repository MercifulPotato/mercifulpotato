Item(by='nappy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608267810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463904, text='&quot;liars in practice&quot; is uncharitable at best. A headline has some maximum number of words, and there is only so much that can be conveyed. &quot;Technically true&quot; is strong standard to meet in under a sentence. Is this purposefully misleading? I would say no.')
