It&#x27;s the example you provided. In reality, no normal person on my side of the aisle thinks that opposition to the ACA is racist, nor do I think you can find credible mainstream Democratic sources saying that.<p>Who is a normal person? The Forbes article I posted is from a Duke MD. The article appears to be based on Senator Jay Rockefeller’s contemporaneous claim that opposition to the ACA was because Obama was the “wrong color.” It looks like no other Congressional Democrat backed that idea, so you’re right in that respect.<p>On the broader trend, Jonathan Chait, himself a liberal pundit, has clearly noticed it. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;obama-presidency-race-2014-4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;obama-presidency-race-2014-4...</a><p>&gt; One of the greatest triumphs of liberal politics over the past 50 years has been to completely stigmatize open racial discrimination in public life, a lesson that has been driven home over decades by everybody from Jimmy the Greek to Paula Deen. This achievement has run headlong into an increasing liberal tendency to define conservatism as a form of covert racial discrimination. If conservatism is inextricably entangled with racism, and racism must be extinguished, then the scope for legitimate opposition to Obama shrinks to an uncomfortably small space.<p>Though in the same piece he writes:<p>&gt; America’s unique brand of ideological anti-statism is historically inseparable (as I recently argued) from the legacy of slavery.<p>Chait, at least six years ago, correctly observed that these arguments are fallacious:<p>&gt; And yet—as vital as this revelation may be for understanding conservatism, it still should not be used to dismiss the beliefs of individual conservatives. Individual arguments need and deserve to be assessed on their own terms, not as the visible tip of a submerged agenda; ideas can’t be defined solely by their past associations and uses.<p>More recently, however, Chait has embraced the trend he was skeptical of in the above passage.<p>In August 2020 he wrote: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;senate-washington-dc-puerto-rico-statehood-filibuster-obama-biden-racist.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;senate-washington-dc...</a><p>&gt; The Senate is a bulwark of white power.<p>A few months later he writes, without a hint of irony:<p>&gt; Why Are Conservatives So Angry Biden Denounced White Supremacy?<p>Now maybe I read too much Jonathan Chait. But I truly find his rhetoric truly perplexing, for someone I perceive as being maybe solidly left wing, but within the Overton Window. I thought that anti-statism was something the left and right broadly agreed on. (During the Obama era, polls showed that even half of Democrats listed “big government” as the “biggest threat to America.”)')
