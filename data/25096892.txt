It is absolutely 100% animal cruelty to release a domesticated animal that cannot survive on its own into the wild.  I&#x27;ve seen multiple cases where people release pet rats, dogs, cats, even a rabbit once.  Other than cats, those animals don&#x27;t survive well in the wild.  And, cats do it at the expense of whatever local bird population there is in the area.')
