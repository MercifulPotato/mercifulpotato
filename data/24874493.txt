Saying http is decentralized is... stretching the definition. With this logic a USB cable is decentralized because &quot;you can use it against any target you like&quot;. USB mass storage dead drop devices can be connected to by anyone. And USB &quot;is a protocol&quot;, just like the examples you mentioned. But I doubt anyone would claim USB is decentralized.<p>Though git is also not really what people would usually mean by decentralized (as it doesn&#x27;t, by itself, try to connect to a pool of servers, DHT network, or something like that), it&#x27;s definitely closer to it than http.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure &quot;for real?&quot; helps the conversation.')
