It&#x27;s not a great experience as a customer, but if I combine ReviewMeta and Amazon reviews and search I still get pretty good products.  My basic guidelines are that it needs at least 4 stars (preferably closer to 4.2-4.7) and the product can&#x27;t be a &quot;fail&quot; on ReviewMeta.  I also am wary if ReviewMeta is a &quot;warn&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t trust Amazon reviews without a review checker anymore, they used to be much better.  The highest reviewed products are often some of the worst.  Any product with a 4.8 or better is immediately suspect (though some are fine, especially if they don&#x27;t have as many reviews).')
