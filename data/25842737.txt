I use an app called Pushbullet, which mirrors notifications but also enables text and file sharing between all your devices. Sharing is instant. I also enable &quot;open immediately on browser&quot;, meaning if I send a link from my phone to my computer browser then it&#x27;ll automatically open a new tab with that link. It&#x27;s pretty neat, it&#x27;s really two or three taps away from any web browser tab on my mobile (open menu, hit Pushbullet shortcut; or open menu, open sharing menu, push to all devices).')
