This requires more cognitive effort (for example, I have to explicitly or implicitly assert that XYZ people are all liars, or idiots, or both).<p>It&#x27;s much easier for me to accept your story because even if I don&#x27;t believe it to be true or representative, my rejection doesn&#x27;t require much effort, and doesn&#x27;t require me being overtly negative towards you.')
