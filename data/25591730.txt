I ask because while there certainly are a lot of soda products here (central europe), we&#x27;ve been thaught from a young age that it is reserved for special occasions. For example, when the parents drink a glass of wine for some occasion, the kids get to drink a glass of soda.<p>But the thing is, I haven&#x27;t had much soda since I was a kid. I drink tea, oj and milk but most importantly, I always have a big water bottle that I take absolutely everywhere... This also seems to be really common. I always see lots of people in public transit drinking from their own water bottles.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because tap water is clean and cheap here...')
