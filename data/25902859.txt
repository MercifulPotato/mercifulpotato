You could try to pack as many characters as possible in a computer word (or in a big int data type), say <i>P</i> characters, and then use the PGM-index to find the strings that share a prefix of <i>P</i> chars with the given query string. I discussed this solution in a GitHub issue (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gvinciguerra&#x2F;PGM-index&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8#issuecomment-743433253" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gvinciguerra&#x2F;PGM-index&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8#issuecomm...</a>). \nIt may work in practice, but it&#x27;s far from being adequate if compared to trie data structures (and their recent advancements).')
