The reason why statisticians and ML folk like to get huge datasets is that it helps them refine their models. Elections occur every 4 years and often reflect very different political circumstances from previous races. Perhaps if we had continuous polling, then pollsters and models could become more accurate, but as it stands now, most of these models are based on historical data.')
