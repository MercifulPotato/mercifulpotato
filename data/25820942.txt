Not even among healthcare professionals, of which a part refuses to be vaccinated.<p>That is exacerbated by statements &quot;threatening&quot; mandatory vaccination, which don&#x27;t help the cause at all.<p>Of course, also the EMA is to blame, because it is far slower than MHRA or FDA when looking at market authorizations for vaccines. &quot;Perhaps&quot; we&#x27;ll see a decision by the end of the month on AstraZeneca.')
