Another spate of changes peaked between 1977 and 1979<p>But lets make you a favour and consider 1972, it makes C a 48 years old systems programming language, only surpassed by NEWP (1961) as oldest systems programming language still in use in 2021.<p>Maybe it is about time to start talking about C the same way people talk about COBOL.')
