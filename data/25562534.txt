What sufficient justification, and justification of what and to whom? What could be worse? What could be more anticompetitive, and competing with what exactly? I said nothing like this, your &quot;equivalents&quot; are from an entirely different world.<p>I said we should be happy Apple decided to open their platform - because they didn&#x27;t have to, at all. It&#x27;s entirely their right to not open anything, not write any documentation, or not even allow 3rd party software at all. If you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t buy their overpriced premium products - it&#x27;s not for you. I wouldn&#x27;t want my own company to be forced to do&#x2F;not do stuff, so of course I don&#x27;t wish that upon Apple. There are enough entirely open computing platforms that are VERY cheap to obtain and easy to use, perhaps that would be a better choice for you.')
