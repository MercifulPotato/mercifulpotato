One thing contestants seem to overestimate is the use they&#x27;ll get from a bow. I saw someone suggest that unless you are going to get 30ish squirrels with the bow, you&#x27;re better off taking a ration pack.<p>I watch it with my 6 and 8 year old kids, and they love getting ideas for building shelters or creating elaborate traps (that will never work). Leads to many great discussions about whether you should forgo paracord and get double duty from the fishing line, what combo of axe&#x2F;hatchet&#x2F;saw&#x2F;multitool&#x2F;etc is best.<p>There have been some hapless contestants but also some seriously capable ones (winner of S3, 3rd place in S2, top 5-6 of S6).<p>I see they&#x27;ve tweaked the target for S7, but from what I&#x27;ve watched, I think a strategy for the mental side would&#x27;ve been to target 100 days as a personal thing, rather than the dreamers in early seasons expecting to be out there for a year and then that going out the window at the first bear or storm.')
