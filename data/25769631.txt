They were popular I think in the 80s-90s.<p>In his books, an enlightened species &quot;uplifts&quot; an inferior one that has potential and after being helped...they sortof serve a period of time as pets&#x2F;servants until they demonstrate that they can be part of galactic civilization.<p>Humans blunder into all of this by accident when they begin exploring space.  Normally the knowledge of physics required for space travel is a side-effect of being uplifted.  It&#x27;s not discovered, it&#x27;s taught.  But we didn&#x27;t do it the normal way.<p>If I remember correctly humans after learning this is sortof how it&#x27;s done begin &quot;uplifting&quot; dolphins.  The uplift process involves genetic engineering and education, etc.<p>One of the core mysteries in the books for the other enlightened species out there is did someone uplift humans?<p>It&#x27;s been a while so I probably butchered that.')
