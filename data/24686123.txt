But Tesla isn&#x27;t living of subsidies, that is just a nonsense claim that gets repeated by uninformed people. In fact, of US automakers they have had the least amount of help in the last 10 years.<p>Tesla has been operating without the EV tax intensive for a while now, while all their competition (outside of GM) still have it. So if anything the US government is helping VW, BMW, Daimler, Nissan and so on MORE then they are helping Tesla (or GM) at the moment. A pretty insane policy if you ask me but I guess the US government didn&#x27;t really think it threw.<p>Ford hasn&#x27;t even payed back the credit from the 2008 crash to the government. And GM clearly got the most help this century.')
