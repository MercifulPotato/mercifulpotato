But anyway I still wonder if something like RISC OS could work on RISC V.<p>I saw a youtube demo of someone running RISC OS on Raspberry Pi and it was very snappy.  Something older like that has had less time to acquire features (that can slow it down or just be bloat).<p>Besides eliminating bloat, I feel like RISC V is an opportunity to start with some new assumptions.  So I am interested to hear how operating systems and software evolve for it.  Linux is great but I believe that there is always room for a fresh approach after a few decades.<p>So I wonder if things like Fuchsia or MirageOS or new Rust things etc. will be targeted to RISC V.')
