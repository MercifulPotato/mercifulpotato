This is part 7 of my Python behind the scenes series. Each part of the series covers how some aspect of the language is implemented in the interpreter, CPython. This time we&#x27;ll study how Python attributes work. You&#x27;ll learn:<p><pre><code>  - What CPython does to execute statements like value = obj.attr and obj.attr = value.\n  - Why attributes of different objects work differently.\n  - How attributes of most objects work.\n  - How the __getattribute__(), __getattr__(), __setattr__() and __delattr__() special methods customize attribute access, assignment and deletion.\n  - How built-in types get their attributes, e.g. __dict__, __dir__(), __base__. What these attributes are.\n</code></pre>\nI welcome your feedback and questions. Thanks!')
