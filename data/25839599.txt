Item(by='jolmg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611094284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832915, text='&gt; In an ideal world the concept of TUI would not exist.<p>I have a hard time imagining that ideal world. TUIs have their own advantages that can&#x27;t really be met with GUIs without restricting them and giving up some features of GUIs.<p>1. Being able to use it through SSH and other sorts of connections like a serial connection through the headphone jack on the PinePhone.<p>2. All text can be copy-pasted, guaranteed. Devs don&#x27;t have the option to prevent that.<p>3. Its use is very simple to automate.<p>3.1. Don&#x27;t need random sleeps while the interface is updated, just read and write to the terminal and let those calls hang if they need to.<p>3.2. No need to guess pixel coordinates of inputs to emulate clicks on them because the interface wasn&#x27;t thought for keyboard use.<p>3.3. Sometimes you can even encode interactions in a stream of bytes that you can then paste into the terminal to execute on the TUI.<p>3.4. It&#x27;s very simple for a script to pull text data from a TUI, but it&#x27;s near impossible to pull it from a graphical window.<p>4. Terminal features like rectangular selection or keyboard-navigated copy-paste can be used for all TUIs.<p>5. Encourages more efficient use of screen real-estate.<p>6. Simpler themes, controlled by terminal settings. Simple to set the use of favorite font for everything.<p>7. More consistent look across TUIs because of terminal restrictiveness.<p>8. Can call a subprocess to take control of the terminal to do something and just come back when it finishes. This allows for simple ad-hoc multitasking through the terminal connection without special support of something like termux which requires foresight.<p>9. The fact that the application doesn&#x27;t need to handle frivolous things like re-rendering after the window is moved or handle every mouse movement over it, makes figuring out what it actually is doing that matters quite simpler. I&#x27;m referring to the output of strace. It&#x27;s largely more readable on TUIs than GUIs because TUIs don&#x27;t need to do the frivolous things GUIs do.')
