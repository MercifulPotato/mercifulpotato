I was too short to reach the back of the microwave, so if I put something in the front, and it finished in the back, I&#x27;d have to call my mom over to help me. I figured out how long the microwave took to do a full circle, and how long it would take to do a half circle. So when I knew it would finish with a half circle, I&#x27;d push the food in as far as possible, I&#x27;d nudge it with my fingertips. When it was done, the food would appear in the front and I could grab it.')
