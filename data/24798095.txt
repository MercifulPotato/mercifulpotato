The ToS will get updated so regular people agree to indemnification via forced arbitration and you&#x27;ll only be able to post content that&#x27;s widely seen if you&#x27;re verified.<p>TLDR;  It would be Digg v4, but mandated by the government.<p>Also, a lot of the current content is created by companies that are already considered publishers and nothing happens to them when they publish misleading news.  So how does considering Twitter the publisher instead of Fox or CNN improve that?<p>IMHO the big media companies would love to see some type of alternate publisher label affixed to big tech because it would detriment big tech to the benefit of big media.')
