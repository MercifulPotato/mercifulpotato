You&#x27;ll find some interesting insights:<p>* Electronic technology makes it impossible to guarantee equal access. Hackers in other countries could easily disrupt the supply chain<p>* A &quot;temporary socialism&quot; emerged to disparage the scalpers and middlemen -- the public at large was incredibly unhappy<p>* Existing middlemen (retail stores) were completely overwhelmed, as there was a gigantic information asymmetry between production, distribution, retail, and consumption<p>* A completely totalitarian rollout (e.g. Sony sells on its own without middlemen) seems feasible, and might have actually been more efficient, even if delayed by a month. More people would have a PS5 now if the solution was totally vertically integrated.')
