Does it have a limit to how many people can occupy a space?  can you control how far your voice projects?<p>I am thinking of something like a work christmas party where everyone breaks into groups and then walks away and tries another group for a bit and talks to different people.  Then someone gets everyones attention and talks loudly or into a microphone  for a bit, then it goes back to normal.<p>In any case, good luck, it sounds great, I cant wait to try it.')
