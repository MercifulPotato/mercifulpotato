When I first saw it I realized how poorly designed all the side loaders I saw while growing up in Europe were in comparison (nevermind not being able to throw something you forgot in after starting, also the risk of a problem leading to water not draining properly, and a flooded room when you go take the laundry out... been there).<p>I do wonder what it does if I pull the plug with the door locked though. I should try it.')
