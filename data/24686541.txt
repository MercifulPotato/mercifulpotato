They just get it from their parents and don&#x27;t have any further contacts to whom they could spread it. The statistics during lockdown are pretty solid: <i>Children don&#x27;t spread it!</i> (As long as you lock them inside with their adult parents - but the statistics may overlook that.)<p>Therefore we must always keep a close eye on the circumstances where the data was taken and what we can and cannot conclude from that.')
