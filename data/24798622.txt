There are reliable processes by which a holder of capital can turn $10 million into good production and $100 million into great production, and you can parallelize this as much as you want. There are enough serviceable directors, editors, camera operators, etc. to scale up your production volumes to dozens of shows and billions of dollars.<p>There is no such repeatable mechanism for original writing. You can find great writing for nothing and pay through your nose for terrible writing. You can find a great writer who delivers a great concept but then she has nothing else in the tank. Or she does, but you can&#x27;t find another one of her.<p>You see billionaires buy their way into being big-time movie producers but you never see them buy their way into being big-time screenwriters.')
