Item(by='hilbert42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604487360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969370, text='Yeah, and converting old mail wasn&#x27;t easy even when Thunderbird had an importer.  10s of GB were a problem as the importer often broke at about 2GB. Even TB&#x27;s own native boxes broke when about that size.<p>So could Eudora&#x27;s for that matter. Crashes were a particular problem with large boxes (.MBX files) as they often had crosslinks from users shutting down too quickly. Trouble was that when the mailer reindexed&#x2F;compressed the box it would often stop at the crosslink and the remaining mail lost (I used to advise everybody never to reindex unless they&#x27;d backed up immediately beforehand). No doubt if you were in the IT at the time then I&#x27;m preaching to the converted. ;-)<p>I often use this example to illustrate bad design and the need for data hardening.  If the time you&#x27;re mentioning was before Qualcomm announced an end of Eudora then this may have been one of the reasons to move away. That said, mail clients haven&#x27;t progressed much since.  The MBOX is simple and still predominates but that&#x27;s a mixed blessing when we need separate index files. Essentially, those who&#x27;ve many GBs of mail still have a problem. Little wonder many have turned from POP&#x2F;IMAP to web mail.')
