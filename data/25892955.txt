I got hit on the ehad by a frisbee two years back, was diagnosed with a concussion, and had post concussive symptoms  for about nine months until I found a therapist who did vestibular and visual rehab.<p>Funny thing was, I had some of the symptoms to a lesser degree <i>before</i> the blow. So was it brain damage, or did the blow merely worsen my visual and vestibular systems and cause more fatigue? I’ll never know.<p>But a key thing is that in the two years prior to the blow I had some burnout, seasonal cashflow issues in my business (thankfully resolved), and worse sleep. I fixed those and I have my old energy back. But for months leading up to the blow I hardly felt able to go to the gym, and old tasks felt tiring. Fatigue, some headaches, etc')
