You can run Linux in a VM guest on Mac mini, but some limitations remain:<p>- The project was obviously started before the Mac mini was available<p>- Linux guests are still rather experimental and might not behave the same way as a real machine.<p>- 32-bit Arm applications do not run on the M1, it is a 64-bit-only CPU<p>- Nested virtualization is said to not work yet under MacOS, so you cannot run KVM guests inside of the Linux guest<p>- If you need to spin up lots OS instances simultaneously to test various setups and each of them need 8GB, you can have at most 2 instances on a Mac.<p>For most use cases, none of those apply, so you would be better off with a Mac, a Graviton instance or an off-the-shelf PC.')
