But here we&#x27;re talking about a platform - you can&#x27;t fault Microsoft for caring about performance! .NET is absolutely not meant only for small sites, my current employer is heavily invested in .NET and we&#x27;d probably be dead (performance-wise) without async. Definitely couldn&#x27;t run our services with PHP (not without Facebook-like investments), we already outgrew that kind of traffic.')
