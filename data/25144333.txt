Now that anybody can reach anyone with any information, bad actors use these techniques to control people to their advantage. Governments&#x27; are now in an awkward position - ramp up education in these areas and forever give up a tool that worked for ages, or censor the information in hope that bad actors will not influence the public.<p>That is by FAR the best summary of the issue I have read.<p>Analogy:<p>It&#x27;s as if we&#x27;ve been living behind castle walls and now those walls are gone. We can now be directly attacked by enemy armies, whereas before we could only be practically reached by our own government&#x27;s police and military. Having been sheltered for so long, we don&#x27;t know how to hold our own without those walls.')
