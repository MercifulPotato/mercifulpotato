I&#x27;d really like to see an internal cord&#x2F;line between the &#x27;solved&#x27; position (where it should be) of each color square to its place in the scrambled position (where it actually is) in order to get an idea of how &quot;tangled up&quot; a position is. Who knows, it might even help with solving strategies!<p>the solving animation is too fast (which can also be a good thing but not always) ... maybe add a slider.<p>also depending on your idea of fun, this allows for making a rubik&#x27;s cube of rubiks cubes :^)')
