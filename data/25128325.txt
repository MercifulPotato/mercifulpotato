Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605640725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127588, text='The first Rust component in Firefox was the URL parser, followed by the MP4 metadata arser for audio. Then the charset conversion component was rewritten in Rust, and then some other tiny components. And then Firefox imported Stylo (the CSS parsing and rendering) from Servo as the biggest Rust component yet. The Web Assembly portion of the JS engine is shifting to cranelift (written in Rust) as its backend, another massive component, but I don&#x27;t believe it has done so in a released browser version yet.<p>In general, a lot of text handling, and parsing in general, is moving to Rust, although some code is moving far more slowly than others. Additionally, APIs that had been implemented in JS that are too slow (or memory-heavy) are being moved to a Rust implementation instead, such as the l10n implementation.')
