Realistically you can do the entire learning with QEMU&#x2F;VM and not be restricted by the hardware at all?<p>At some institutions they teach how OS work by students implementing Pintos, a full x86 OS.<p>In my first year I had to build a full raspberry pi emulator from scratch and then code an assembler for it. These programs would then run natively on the raspberry pi. People wouldn&#x27;t even touch the hardware until much, much later into the project when the emulator has confirmed to be working.<p>I disagree with the view that you need a full FOSS hardware to understand a platform. You can do a lot with a VM&#x2F;QEMU.')
