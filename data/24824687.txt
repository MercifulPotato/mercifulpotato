What matters is the effective rate, and even California, which is one of the highest taxed states in the US, and so misleading if you want to talk about the overall US tax burden, is lower than a lot of Europe.<p>I agree with you they&#x27;re not particularly low, though, especially when factoring in what you get or don&#x27;t get.
