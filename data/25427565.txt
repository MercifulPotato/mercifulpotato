I&#x27;m a JS developer with no experience in statically typed languages. I&#x27;m not able to figure out what exactly is the way to do things we usually do in JS ecosystem. I mean things like a package manager, build system. These things are confusing. I&#x27;m pretty sure that there are tons of people turned away from Reason for this very same reason.<p>Also OCaml in Windows was hard to configure and get right. The barrier to entry into the ecosystem is huge and it has to be resolved. The language is beautiful but anyone needs to be able to get productive in it very quickly.')
