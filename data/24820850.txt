They are a policy and incentives problem.<p>This statement is so broad that it cannot be true and here is an obivous counter example: A high percentage of doctor visits (think 4&#x2F;5) does not involve physical checkups and could be done remotely - independent of policy and incentives.<p>Identifying these 4&#x2F;5 (say) patients is a trillion dollar technology problem that is currently being approached from many different angles: symptom checker and triage, telemedicine and online doctor appointments, etc.<p>Notable teams working on it are ada and Babylon, among many others.')
