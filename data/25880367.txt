I put it in the washing machine, turn that on to wash twice a week, put washed clothes on the line then take in when dry. I like to cook, have done since teens and before I can remember was tasked with food prep and washing dishes after a meal. Clean the house once per week engaging passion in various areas in this. And not viewing these as chores but simple things. For sixth-form and university, get to bed by 11, get to school by 8; not a super fan but appreciative of classes so sat in the school &#x2F;uni library with books.')
