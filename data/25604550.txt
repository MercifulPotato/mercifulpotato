Of course that’s a unidirectional transfer rate - you won’t be able to simultaneously both send and receive at that rate, but you can alternate symmetrically between the two.<p>You won’t be able to bitbang at those speeds, so you’ll definitely have to drop down a layer in your stack&#x2F;abstractions but since you mentioned I2C I figured you’d probably be OK considering this.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winbond.com&#x2F;resource-files&#x2F;W25Q128JW_DTR%20RevD%2004272020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winbond.com&#x2F;resource-files&#x2F;W25Q128JW_DTR%20RevD%...</a>')
