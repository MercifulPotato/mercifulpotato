There was a group of people arrested in Michigan (?) for the kidnapping of the Governor (?), so it&#x27;s possible.<p>But either way, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s relevant. If you want to boot someone off social media because they espouse a cause that others take too far, then there&#x27;s a lot of BLM people who should receive the same fate. Anything else is rank hypocrisy.<p>It&#x27;s worth adding that I think Trump is a puerile moron and &quot;the election was stolen&quot; people are loons (even the ones who didn&#x27;t break into the Capitol or attend a protest). I&#x27;m not even an American, I have no dog in this fight.<p>But the double standard is so painfully clear, even from thousands of kilometres away. Applying these rules&#x2F;bans&#x2F;etc in such a blatantly partisan manner is only going to increase this divisiveness, the USA will tear itself apart from the inside.')
