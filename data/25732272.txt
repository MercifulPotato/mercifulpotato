But you can&#x27;t document every step of your life.<p>For example, imagine that some friend tell you that his brother is currently working in Singapore and that everything goes well for him and all. But so far you have no relation to Singapore and don&#x27;t travel so much.<p>Then 1 year later, you will unexpectedly be sent to Singapore for work and you would highly appreciate a contact there. At that point you remember that the brother of someone is there, but who was it?<p>You just have to search for &#x27;singapore&#x27; in Telegram and you can get easily the reply to your question and so recontact the relevant friend.<p>Same thing when you are suddenly thinking about buying a Xiaomi phone, and you are wondering who was the friend that told you that he bought one 6 months ago to get his review.')
