Increasing focus and task salience is only <i>one</i> of the many factors constitutive of human potential. They never give the answer for <i>what to focus on</i>, or whether a task is worth it or not, and rob the person of the opportunity for developing <i>frustration tolerance</i>. They turn people into indiscriminate <i>doing</i> machines, with little wisdom to guide it. Makes one think if prescription amphetamines being as widespread among plumbers as software engineers is truly a coincidence.<p>I will argue this is because our bioeconomics, our <i>not wanting to do things</i> is also part of our wisdom machinery. Having used for half a decade myself, I can spot some collogues who are on amphetamines; unnecessarily assertive, obsessed with orderliness of code, constantly in need of refactoring, huge bias for action with diminished wisdom to temper it (Well, also pees a lot.). There is a reason they are not being used by fighter pilots anymore because they can get too cocky and make decisions that kill their own.<p>No wonder everything looks like a good idea when your brain is swimming in dopamine and norepinephrine, but when everything looks like a good idea, how do you find what is the right thing to do in the medium&#x2F;long term? Is that really the human potential? I would argue far from it. I think it is just enhancing the potential for a particular job description that requires you to sit on your bum all day and plumb boring stuff someone else tells you to.')
