In practice it&#x27;s more that PyCharm and WebStorm are both IDEA&#x27;s base framework + language extensions. In the case of WebStorm you get IDEA + the HTML5&#x2F;web dev extensions and in the case of PyCharm (commercial edition, anyway) you get IDEA + both the Python and the web dev extensions.<p>I believe RubyMine is the same, if not all of the other paid IDEs in the Toolbox. They all include WebStorm&#x27;s functionality since you can build a web app in pretty much anything, at least on the back end.')
