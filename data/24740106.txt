But it ends up in fewer job opportunities, causing further unemployment.<p>This looks like a great policy at face value but in the end, it&#x27;s going to mean many fewer H1B&#x27;s. This is a win-win for the Trump administration because it looks like they&#x27;re doing the right thing and perhaps they are, but it&#x27;s also keeping foreign workers out and providing Americans with more jobs, which is exactly what they want.')
