This does not represent who we are, but what do you expect when the media claims not a single voter fraud case was won in court when in fact almost all of them never went to trial? They are lying.&quot;<p>Nearly half the nation voted for Trump. I don&#x27;t believe half the nation is full of hatred and disinformation.
