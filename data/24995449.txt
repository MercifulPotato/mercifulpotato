Even some war hawks could understand the unfairness of continuing to draft kids under 21 when they were still politically powerless.  The dogs of war still despised the draft dodgers and their supporters who were constantly pointing this discrepancy out though.<p>Pressure on legislators eventually won the vote at 18, and while there was momentum plus a new decent size voting block overnight, the push for _Initiative Referendum_ got underway.<p>Before citizens can put something on the ballot themselves without necessarily having any politicians or political parties involved, their legislators often had to pass a law restoring the right to that type of freedom.<p>Due to the unprecedented pressure, many states chose to no longer deny this liberty to their people.<p>They then codified the hurdles that must be overcome for mere citizens to make things right without having to wait for sluggish politicians who may not be interested, or who could act as obstacles until more responsive representatives got into power.<p>Too bad not every state got this, especially now that it&#x27;s needed more than ever, but that&#x27;s what we were planning at the time.<p>It was plain to see that the 21st century was going to be pretty ugly, but there definitely needed to be some hope.<p>Texas is not a free state in this regard, remaining more like the Spanish monarchy that ruled when Texas was still a state in Mexico before it joined the USA.  The legislature by design still has no provision to quit denying their subjects the full liberty to vote on items of their own initiative.<p>Oklahoma&#x27;s lawmakers have presided over a free state by comparison, and their citizens have enjoyed one of the fundamental elements of democracy that Texans can only dream about.')
