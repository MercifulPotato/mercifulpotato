At the end of the lengthy application we got rejected by Stripe because our business falls under the &quot;regulated&quot; category. Even though we didn&#x27;t need credit card processing, just ACH, and the former is seemingly where these list of prohibited businesses come from.<p>We ended up going full steam ahead with Dwolla instead. Although the developer experience is not as polished as Stripe, they don&#x27;t discriminate against fully legal businesses that should be allowed to bank and transact like any other.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;restricted-businesses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;restricted-businesses</a>')
