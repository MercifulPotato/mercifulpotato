The immune system is incredibly complex and nuanced, and there isn&#x27;t a knob (or 10) that you can tweak to turn it up or down. It exists in a continuum of largely understood configurations, and it can learn and adapt (not always with good results). If anything, &quot;boosting&quot; it as in turning up immune activity is usually terrible (think auto-immune disorders, inflammation, cancer).<p>The &quot;misinformation&quot; people are battling is about a) unsubstantiated health claims and b) the fact that supplement manufacturers don&#x27;t need to provide any evidence or follow any regulations regarding what&#x27;s actually in the supplements. That means they can say they&#x27;re selling e.g. Vitamin C but it&#x27;s just sugar.<p>John Oliver has a good video on it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WA0wKeokWUU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WA0wKeokWUU</a>')
