But I&#x27;ve been doing this long enough that I&#x27;m not embarrassed about telling clients what <i>I</i> think and what I&#x27;d do if I were in their shoes, and my clients aren&#x27;t the sort to just passively do what I tell them.<p>(It also helps that I&#x27;ve been a solo public-company general counsel â€” meaning that for a number of years I worked very closely with sales people and became acutely aware of the importance of getting deals done, as opposed to just identifying and flanging up risks.)')
