Take the iPhone for example: small, insignificant iterations that demand a premium. Consider the litany of software flaws that line BigSur and Catalina? What is the end consumer truly gaining  with this new iteration? Would you respond &quot;product experience&quot;? Yet Apple appears to be doing well YoY with their returns on these products.<p>I&#x27;m particularly fond of your phrasing though: &quot;cargo cult&quot;. Again, ironically applicable to Apple.')
