Item(by='gist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605810041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25149351, text='&gt; But at the same time, there are people who have so heavily invested into the YouTube ecosystem with certain expectations for a very long time, and pretty much have their entire business on there, so they can&#x27;t very easily take their business elsewhere if they&#x27;re unhappy with the change.<p>Anyone who has invested in creating content and thinking that it would be the way it was forever is naive and has learned a lesson. Most &#x27;old timers&#x27; would realize (I know I would) that any business situation can change.<p>Likewise I fully expect Amazon once they have killed off the competition to raise prices on many items. Sure they will have loss leaders and sure they are already doing it. But it&#x27;s business no expectation that they won&#x27;t do what is in their best interest. And this is not a &#x27;shareholder&#x27; thing it&#x27;s a business thing. Same thing would happen if it were a small pizza shop that decided to lower prices and drive others out of business. As long as no rules are broken it&#x27;s not any worse than a sports team doing whatever they can to win the game.  They are not &#x27;in the business&#x27; of making it good for others to win. (Same with online gaming).')
