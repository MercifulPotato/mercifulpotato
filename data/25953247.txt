UX should, by and large, be staffed with deep experience in User Psychology<p>Maybe if you&#x27;re trying to convince people to part with money. Most applications just need UX designers that understand the users workflows and what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish. When a person comes to this screen of the app why are they there? What data to they need? What are their next steps? Are the doing it for 1 item or 15?<p>Programmers want to create generic, do everything CRUD interfaces with 15 layers. &quot;UX&quot; people just want to make it pretty. No one is left to understand what they users are actually doing with the software.')
