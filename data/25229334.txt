Observe <i>how they talk about</i> their opponents.  See if any patterns (in talking, and thinking) emerge, and whether some of the patterns <i>are the same in both communities</i>.<p>From TFA:<p>&gt; You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from automatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. <i>When you hear someone say something, stop and ask yourself &quot;Is that true?&quot; Don&#x27;t say it out loud.</i><p>Or, sometimes, <i>do</i> say it out loud, and watch hilarity (to the unconventional, at least) ensue.<p>&gt; Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you&#x27;re told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene. And you&#x27;ll be surprised, when you start asking &quot;Is this true?&quot;, how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If you have any imagination, you&#x27;re more likely to have too many leads to follow than too few.<p>&gt; More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your head unexamined, and things don&#x27;t always enter your head in the form of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit. How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how other people get their ideas.<p>&gt; When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas spreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are in fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt, and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing the same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are intellectual fashions too, and you definitely don&#x27;t want to participate in those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own thoughts, but because unfashionable ideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting. The best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is looking.')
