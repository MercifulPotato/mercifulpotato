Suppose I were to break down your door.  In many states, you would be justified in defending yourself (Castle doctrine).  If I return fire and kill you, I would be guilty of murder.  You had a right to defend yourself, and I did not have a right to return fire.<p>That&#x27;s the a huge point of the outrage, that whether or not the police announced themselves is in question, and witness reports vary.  If the police didn&#x27;t announce themselves, then there is no way for somebody in the house to determine whether it is a valid warrant being served or a violent home invasion.  (Or both.)')
