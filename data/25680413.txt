What I did see was communication breakdown between major teams.  Some interface features were mutually assumed to be owned by another team and fell through the cracks. MCAS in response to unstable thrust vector is commonly cited as an example of this.<p>But I think it&#x27;s worth noting to the (mostly software oriented) HN crowd - aerospace projects have massive manufacturing cycle times.  Some things literally take years to manufacture for the proof-of-concept stage, let alone production.  You can&#x27;t NOT be incredibly schedule-oriented in this environment.  This can cause some perverse incentives for management (which must be mitigated), but there are always going to be somewhat risky last-minute changes that could seem ill-advised in hindsight if you want to deliver something.')
