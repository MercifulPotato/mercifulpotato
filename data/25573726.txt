Instead it spends most of its time in a declarative, historian&#x27;s voice.<p>But while the author drops a few implications along the way, it&#x27;s not really until the fifth or so paragraph from the end do they finally reveal a more concrete suspicion:<p>&gt; A robust press is essential to a functioning democracy, and a cultural turn toward journalistic individualism might not be in the collective interest. It is expensive and laborious to hold powerful people and institutions to account, and, at many media organizations, any given article is the result of collaboration between writers, editors, copy editors, fact checkers, and producers.<p>Dunno, it kinda seems like wondering if there can be room for a multi-million dollar HBO special like Game of Thrones in a world where niche Patreon creators are making thousands of dollars. I guess we don&#x27;t even need analogy: how do paid niche blogs (which is a far more accurate description of Substack than &quot;premium newsletters&quot;) threaten large publications?<p>But to answer their question: yes, I think Substack is definitely part of the future we want. For years we&#x27;ve wondered if we could back out of our ad-driven internet economy where small players had no shot at making a living if they couldn&#x27;t attract ad dollars.
