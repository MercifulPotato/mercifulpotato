Sadly, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any levels.fyi data from any of the studios. Anecdotally, film, like the game industry, has a history of paying less than the overall market rate for software engineering because there are a lot of people who love it.<p>Some of the [animation] studios (e.g., Pixar, PDI) have also historically issued annual bonuses based on how the films performed. Visual Effects, however, isn&#x27;t like that because the work is done for other studios. For example, MPC did much of the visual effects for both Jungle Book and The Lion King, both of which were produced and distributed by Disney.')
