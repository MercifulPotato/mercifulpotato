Migrants roam in and work but really have no rights as they are undocumented. People can intimidate them or worse largely with impunity because who would bother investigating? Sure technically it’s illegal to abuse migrants but nobody’s watching.<p>Migrant work is something that really demands a coordinated international effort to reform.<p>Then you have Uyghur forced labor in China.<p>Slavery has not been abolished in anything but name.')
