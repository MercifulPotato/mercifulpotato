It is. Look at San Francisco: yes, stay-at-home orders were clearly effective there, but what once was a bustling city now has boarded up storefronts everywhere, it&#x27;s depressing.<p>And for what it is worth, taking the opposite stance and being lax in the name of freedom or whatever can also be devastating, e.g. read anything about covid ravaging the US mid-west in the past few months.<p>As for the statistics, I think they are great for a 10,000 miles view, but at the same time, they can really support whatever narrative we want. 0.5% may seem like nothing, but if we instead point out there are 80 million people dead worldwide, it now sounds pretty darn scary.
