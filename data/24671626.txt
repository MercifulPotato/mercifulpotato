I hate this, because it makes the maintainer look like a cantankerous prick, and it also puts me off using what might be a great project (and of course others will read it to).<p>IME, if I&#x27;m not familiar with the maintainers&#x27; temperament, I&#x27;m most successful using something like this template:<p>&quot;Hi! First let me say how much I appreciate this library, it really helps with X.<p>I&#x27;ve found what I believe is a bug, whereby X (provide logs, stack trace, whatever is relevant).<p>You can reproduce this by X (provide repro steps or code snippet as appropriate).&quot;<p>For projects I&#x27;m familiar with, things can be more business-like and to the point, and I can also offer to send a PR.')
