Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[24736073], score=None, time=1602275626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733920, text='&gt; Some people get burned out<p>I&#x27;d say if management routinely burns out programmers and prevents them from having long careers, that in itself is a form of age discrimination.<p>&gt; If the industry now is 10x the size it was in 2000 (arbitrary number), then 40 year old developers should be 10% of the workforce, even discounting any other factors.<p>IMO this seems to be an ageist assumption. If an industry is growing, why should the newcomers to the industry be overwhelmingly young? Why shouldn&#x27;t &quot;older&quot; people join in large numbers too, especially if there&#x27;s a lot of money to be made? I personally switched careers and didn&#x27;t get my first tech job until I was over 35.<p>&gt; I have never had so much clout during job hunting than I do now, with 20 years of on the job experience.<p>What do you make of the pervasive &quot;quiz show&quot; style job interviews that favor recent CS grads and discount job experience?<p>In any case, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s more empirical support for my position than the claim I was arguing against, that people work 80 hours per week and then retire early because they &quot;value their time&quot;. Just not their current time, only their time later in life (if they live that long), I guess.')
