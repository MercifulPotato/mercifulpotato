But it doesn&#x27;t look like the problems were with the server part; if your machine had only been a server you could have avoided all the stuff about needing to pull from unstable. So I don&#x27;t think &quot;don&#x27;t put all the server stuff on one machine&quot; is the real takeaway from your experience; I think the real takeaway is &quot;don&#x27;t use the same machine as both a server and a dev workstation&quot;.')
