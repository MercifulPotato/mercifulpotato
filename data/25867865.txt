How are you different to Flightpath, Baremetrics etc?<p>I&#x27;ve recently spent time following an excellent Google Docs financial model from Baremetrics[1] put online for free. I&#x27;d be remiss not to share here as an alternative. I agree, it does take some time to set up, and monthly some work. I believe founders without a finance background would find it fairly daunting (but can follow along with the blog post).<p>I think you&#x27;re offering the simplicity aspect and that&#x27;s your main value prop being solved. Where do you see the products going in the future? The base modeling I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pay for, but curious to see what network or flywheel effects you think might be there for users?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baremetrics.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;saas-financial-model#model-template" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baremetrics.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;saas-financial-model#model-temp...</a>')
