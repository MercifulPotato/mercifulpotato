Just because someone (a child or young adult) developed symptoms first doesn&#x27;t mean they actually got infected first, they might have actually gotten infected at the same time as their supposed contact. When the South Korean study removed cases of shared exposure, the new study found those children did not in fact transmit very much. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;apsmunro&#x2F;status&#x2F;1311616493445165058" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;apsmunro&#x2F;status&#x2F;1311616493445165058</a><p>This Twitter discussion does not make me think they did anything differently than the South Korean study that was later corrected: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;apsmunro&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312301601156194304" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;apsmunro&#x2F;status&#x2F;1312301601156194304</a>')
