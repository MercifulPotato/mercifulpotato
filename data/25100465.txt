Making C integrations available with nice syntax and managed memory is such a huge win for Python. This POC glues together a hashmap implementation, async event loop and redis protocol parser (all in C) into a very readable (and quite performant) program. You could probably add pub&#x2F;sub support in another 50 lines as well, since asyncio is already present.')
