When I was young (late teens to early 30s) I found that laying on the carpeted floor on my stomach, with a pillow under my chest, and my head tilted back (think of Superman flying and you&#x27;ll get the picture) with my computer in front of me worked great.<p>This probably wouldn&#x27;t work out well nowadays with a desktop computer because desktop monitor sizes are usually way bigger than they were back then so you would have tilt your head too far, but it might still be fine with a laptop.')
