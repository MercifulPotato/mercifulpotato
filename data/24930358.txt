I feel like linux distros are going down dark paths. I have had figlet on my computer for many years, and on this distro for at least two years. TheDong notes that Toilet is another really cool tool. I install it on my Linux Mint box here, and boom, figlet is not only removed, but it now links to toilet:<p>ls -l &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;figlet\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 24 Oct 29 08:15 &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;figlet -&gt; &#x2F;etc&#x2F;alternatives&#x2F;figlet<p>ls -l &#x2F;etc&#x2F;alternatives&#x2F;figlet \nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Oct 29 08:15 &#x2F;etc&#x2F;alternatives&#x2F;figlet -&gt; &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;figlet-toilet<p>Note the dates on the above, the fact is that I have had figlet on this computer for at least two years, but I just did an apt-get install toilet and it replaced figlet.<p>ls -l &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;toilet \n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 23064 Mar 13  2018 &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;toilet<p>And the figlet --help gives toilet output and the output is from toilet. I had to remove toilet and re-install figlet to get figlet back.<p>I feel that is odd behaviour for a distro.')
