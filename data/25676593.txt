Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610050018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674553, text='&gt; Let me understand this. Gumroad raises $8m from VCs, isn&#x27;t able to grow fast enough, so the VCs agree to give up any claim on the company. Sahil fires all of the employees<p>VCs don&#x27;t simply give up claims to companies that look like the might be profitable. The writing on the wall was that Gumroad wouldn&#x27;t survive without additional infusions of cash from investors. If they couldn&#x27;t find any investors willing to put money into the company, it would have gone bankrupt.<p>In other words, those employees wouldn&#x27;t have had jobs anyway. Their equity would be worthless while the company went through bankruptcy.<p>Normally these companies are sent through arduous bankruptcy proceedings, the assets sold, and the investors recoup pennies on the dollar. The VCs could have gone this route and Sahil could have bought the assets at some nominal amount, but the VCs decided that ceremony wasn&#x27;t worth their time and just gave it to him. Or at least that&#x27;s how I read this.<p>It might have been more fair if the VCs had given the company to the employee equity holders as well, but I assume Sahil would have simply bought out their &lt;1-2% holdings for pennies on the dollar.')
