The NIH has since set impossible conditions for restoring the grant, ensuring that this research will never resume.<p>Maybe the next place to go is learning more about the initial results from the EcoHealth Alliance grant referenced in the above quote. Still, it&#x27;s a pretty unsatisfying review.<p>[edit, fixed typo: containement -&gt; containment]')
