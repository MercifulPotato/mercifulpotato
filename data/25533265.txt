If you&#x27;re an entertainment personality you can have a stage persona and I accept that.<p>If you&#x27;re a politician, then I reject your desire to have a stage persona. Politicians pretending to be something they aren&#x27;t is a massive problem, and treating politics exactly like another form of entertainment is a massive problem with our society and our politics.<p>So I am doing exactly what your criticize, but I do it proudly, and I actually return the opposite criticism to you.')
