I think you misunderstood or I didn&#x27;t explain correctly. The people working on this case should get a job, instead of going after a bunch of hackers. I have a basement and really I was envisioning some really cool space with all sorts of computers, rom chips, LED&#x27;s, monitors and all that. IDK if I ever become a super notorious, evil, DANGEROUS, absolutely insane video game console modifier,  you can bet your butt that I&#x27;m gonna be doing it in style, in my basement.<p>EDIT:\nSome people work for a living...others have a suspect board on their wall with pictures of people that modify video game console, thinking that they&#x27;re doing good in the world by putting these people in prison. If someone on this case walked by my house, I&#x27;d lock the door. You have to be a straight up psychopath to want to throw these people in prison.')
