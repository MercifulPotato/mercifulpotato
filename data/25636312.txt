Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609787278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635658, text='&gt; Anybody buying the 2% inflation number doesn&#x27;t recognize the actual 15-20% hurdle they have to jump over every (non-covid) year and will inevitably get poorer unless they are directly tied to a &quot;cantillon channel&quot;... in which case they will only stay rich thanks to what amounts to fraud.<p>You have absolutely no evidence to support this.<p>The only reason the cost of living goes up in the major metros listed there is because housing went up there, and that&#x27;s not inflation or the cantillon effect (which I concede exists but is nowhere <i>near</i> as big as you make it out to be) -- that&#x27;s because city councils aren&#x27;t permitting new construction.<p>Your comment is a manifestation of proportionality bias. You think a big change in the affordability of housing in SF has to have a big cause like the global economy string pulling illuminati cantillon magic. The reality is far more banal. It&#x27;s straight-up simple supply and demand. Strong economy in and around SF creates demand for living in SF. The city council doesn&#x27;t permit new construction. This limits supply. Low supply, high demand, big prices - which the well paid tech workers can afford. That&#x27;s it and that&#x27;s all man.<p>Naturally when demand fell as a result of the pandemic prices went with it.')
