Made $5,000 total on it mostly begging for users to make a &quot;donation&quot;.<p>Drove myself and my family into the poor house for something people enjoyed using for free but wouldn&#x27;t pay for... made plenty of mistakes.<p>I thought if I didn&#x27;t quit on it I wouldn&#x27;t fail, but looking back it started failing the second I launched it as a generic product... you need a big marketing budget to launch i ended up giving it away free just to see people use it.')
