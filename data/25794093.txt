I demand it be made easier!&quot;) so much as musings about possibility (&quot;How much better could this be? In what ways?&quot;). I think the tone is a little bit exaggerated on purpose, for effect, as if one is imagining a future world in which we&#x27;ve progressed so much that 2020&#x27;s status quo really does become unacceptable.<p>I think as a set of musings it&#x27;s totally valid: there really is a ton of yak-shaving that still stands between &quot;coders&quot; and &quot;non-coders&quot; which actually has very little to do with code itself. It&#x27;s a good exercise to brainstorm which speedbumps are unnecessary and what we could do to remove them.')
