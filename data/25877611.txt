I get a lot of &quot;look here&quot; for errors, but there are still times I set breakpoints on the internals to try and figure out what is going on. Usually in combination with some babel plugin messing things up, or some webpack caching issue, etc. I still think more could be done here, but adding the necessary debugging stuff would bloat the core.<p>&gt; Redux is king<p>Redux is quickly going out of fashion. Interested to hear your thoughts on how long you think it will remain around though or evolve. When I look at redux-saga&#x2F;redux-observable projects, its incredibly verbose for such simple things. And there seem like very simple solutions on the horizon with suspense resource fetching stuff.')
