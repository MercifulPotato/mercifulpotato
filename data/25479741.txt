The fact that slogans like “eat the rich” have been normalized by Millennials and Gen-Z on Tik Tok is clear evidence of it. Imagine the irony of an entire society having leisure time to burn on Tik Tok (or other social media) via a handheld space age device that we couldn’t even imagine 15 years ago, and yet whining about how life is tough and the system is broken. The greed isn’t in those creating value and accumulating wealth - it’s with everyone else, who are enjoying an amazing life in an amazing time and yet are greedy enough to complain about not having more for free.')
