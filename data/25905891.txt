Item(by='exikyut', descendants=None, kids=[25906562], score=None, time=1611595264, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903012, text='Oooh, so they actually throw a number down (32TB), nice to know. (Others just say &quot;unlimited&quot; everywhere and let you figure it out, yay.)<p>In amusing timing, I was literally just looking at the homepage and specs sections myself - my 2CPU&#x2F;6GB&#x2F;500GB&#x2F;€6.99 plan is kind of getting a bit old, although I do admittedly have 100GB more storage, hmm.<p>My thinking is that Contabo is located in areas where the peering and power are reasonably inexpensive. Also, based on the tour photos and webcam views they publish, they&#x27;re using tons and tons of desktop-form-factor systems they presumably assemble and maintain in-house, as opposed to ordering more traditional rack systems (with $$$$ server boards&#x2F;proprietary SKUs inside). For a small-to-mid-scale operation, it would appear this offers better value for money (ironically), including compute&#x2F;heat density considerations etc.<p>As for the price disparities... the sad thing <i>I think</i> is happening is that, by pricing themselves into the corner of the market (which they&#x27;re basically dominating), customer perception may be &quot;oh they&#x27;re the cheap&#x2F;low end&quot;, which... they are and they aren&#x27;t. They offer dedicated (whole machine) for €150+&#x2F;mo and semi-dedicated (CPU+RAM reservation, not sure about storage IOPS reservation though!) for €35+&#x2F;mo, but these are fairly new offerings and I wonder if Contabo is trying to balance out customer perception about where they sit in the market. (As an aside, I kind of take those prices as vague hints about how much oversubscribing is (cough) <i>technically</i> going on with the low end offerings... ahem.)<p>An environment like Vultr seems to hold a position similar to eg DigitalOcean et al, where customers have learned to expect &quot;it costs this much&quot; and just accept the pricing. Sigh.<p>I guess the only way to really know is to actually order a VM, generate an eye-watering amount of traffic (which might be a project in and of itself), and see what happens.<p>As for 10TB of storage, that&#x27;s a tricky one.<p>Naturally the first thing that comes to mind is Amazon :) which reveals that this size hovers around the US$260-$300 mark. Get two, mirror them with ZFS, add a small UPS, and you&#x27;re done for a steep but once-off total cost of around US$1000.<p>Second to that is the Hetzner Server Auction, which allows users to bid for rental of currently-unused custom configurations. Filtering for &gt;9TB, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hetzner.com&#x2F;sb?hdd_from=9000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hetzner.com&#x2F;sb?hdd_from=9000</a>, currently returns a box with a Xeon-E3, 32GB ECC :) RAM, and 4x10TB (yes) HDD, for €82&#x2F;mo. (With &quot;unlimited&quot; traffic (&quot;yay&quot;), apparently at 1Gbit.)<p>Second option: much more accessible, both in terms of price and &quot;other people using it&quot; :)<p>First option: would be paid-out after one year of Hetzner rental (1000&#x2F;82=~12).')
