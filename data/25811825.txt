If you know something I don&#x27;t, then let me know - but don&#x27;t accuse me of making a strawman if you can&#x27;t correct my viewpoint of the opposing argument. <i>Why</i> is it a strawman? Do people have reasons for not taking the vaccines other than amorphous distrust of billionaires? If I&#x27;m wrong, explain why, I genuinely want to know. Otherwise I&#x27;m led to believe that <i>you</i> aren&#x27;t being intellectually honest and you are only acting as a foil to provide an air of legitimacy to dangerous arguments; which is also a form of misinformation.')
