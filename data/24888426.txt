Yes you can use a profile in Graphhopper and the Heidelberg University did a large project as well.<p>When talking with wheelchair users I learnt that they often improvise on the routes they take, for example crossing the road even without curb-cut because it is quicker for them or trash bins blocking the sidewalk.<p>We plan to integrate a base layer design like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessmap.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessmap.io&#x2F;</a> which can help with basic orientation (eg. red-colored streets if they have a steep incline for example).<p>At the same time it would be great to have very detailed data about sidewalks in general. Apart from OSM I think this is an interesting definition: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharedstreets.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharedstreets.io&#x2F;</a>')
