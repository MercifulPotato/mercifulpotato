If not a success of TSMC with EUV process, Intel would not be in a such troubled spot. Few years ago a reasonable assumption in the industry was that EUV would not be production-ready for quite some years. So Intel made a reasonable bet that they would be better with pushing  existing technologies further.<p>But then a company in The Netherlands solved the extreme ultraviolet generation and optics problem and Intel failed to push their existing process to 10nm allowing TSMC and Samsung to overtake it as a technology leader. And Intel now has to deal   with a situation that it had no experience for the last 40 years when the company was a technology leader.')
