Few people own desktop computers anymore. Apple is locking down MacOS to signed binaries. Soon we&#x27;ll all have thin clients and will write software in the cloud for the cloud. Few will be able to learn how to engineer at home anymore - you&#x27;ll have to go to a university or trade school. Building a simple website will require JS package management, kubernetes, and AWS. The &quot;free tier&quot; will fall away.<p>Employees aren&#x27;t excited by what they do: People job hop for promos, raises, and resume fodder, not because there&#x27;s an actual interest in the product. The majority of software projects are mundane glue, pipes, optimization tweaks, or migrations.<p>Companies don&#x27;t care about employees: Wages are adjusted for cost of living. Companies are trying to hire more outside of California in order to lower wages across the board. Employees at &quot;passion project&quot; companies (gaming, SpaceX, Tesla) are overworked and underpaid.<p>Incentives are wrong: Google bestows promos on launches, not KTLO. Google kills products that make customers and engineers happy and doesn&#x27;t spend enough effort to make them better.<p>The industry is eating the commons: The web is turning into shit. Devices are being locked down. Ads and tracking are everywhere. Open source is being co-opted, but the benefits are not returned. The cool things to hack on and integrate with (remember &quot;mashups&quot;?) are all siloed up, full of ads, and dumbed down to the most basic products.<p>The Internet now treats everyone using it like we&#x27;re all brainless idiots to be injected with dopamine. Like we&#x27;re not smart enough to choose how to consume it. And working for companies in this field now feels like working for the insurance industry. Optimize for the average.')
