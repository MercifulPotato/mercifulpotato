If you had to divide philanthropy into just two camps, you could consider one camp is direct relief of societal symptoms and the other is advocacy to fix the underlying societal problems. For example, giving a man a fish to eat versus teaching fishing lessons.<p>It&#x27;s easy to think that direct relief is ineffective compared to systemic change. When you get into the details, though, implementing societal change is a lot more complicated. You have the Koch brothers and George Soros both trying to improve societies through public advocacy, in opposite directions, with lots of failed projects along the way. While direct relief may not create long-term solutions, the real world benefits are more directly measurable.<p>In a plague year (followed by new crises in the new year), regardless of critiques of her approach, I hope we can all appreciate her compassionate giving.')
