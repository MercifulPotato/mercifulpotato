Compared to how long it takes to load and use Jira on the web, it’s just a bit snappier and nice. The dark mode support is also appreciated, though aesthetics could still improve to be a bit more mac-native... and because of Jira’s design, it’s possible the app will always lag in functionality compared to the website. But still— progress! :)')
