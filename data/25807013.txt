At least that one made it to master now, and will be in 1.16!<p>Another gripe is the lack of a <i>proper</i> parallel safe map (no, map[interface{}]interface{} like sync.Map is just not acceptable) which would be a godsend and should honestly just be the normal map implementation. Maybe eventually with generics... (This is more of a language gripe than a stdlib gripe, though, and I&#x27;m sure that once generics come out we&#x27;ll see a sync.Map that doesn&#x27;t use interface {})')
