I mean they got everyone rallied up and used their in game propaganda machine and everyone believed they are the good guys. By the end of the day, all they saw was 30 % loss of income. In a few years time their prices would have increased to their old level.<p>Also about that amazing fact that Epic has given part of the previously paid commision back. It&#x27;s interesting to note the time of that decision compared to the popularity and online spending on Fortnite. Epic basically changed its business model, creating a precedent in the process. Using it two years later. If we can charge less, why can&#x27;t you?<p>I mean I still think myself the 30% are too high, but Epic lining up your kids in front of a virtual stage to make them all hate Apple? It concerns me quite a bit!')
