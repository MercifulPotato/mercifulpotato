When you&#x27;re older, it&#x27;s different of course.<p>You can&#x27;t really get any real trading experience unless you work as an instiutional trader, so no, you don&#x27;t need to have traded.<p>You also don&#x27;t need to know anything about finance, though it helps. With a math+CS degree from a top school, I wouldn&#x27;t imagine you have trouble getting a S&amp;T offer at a bank (maybe not a specific bank like Goldman tho).<p>The other path you could take is to go straight to the buy-side: prop shop, hedge fund, etc. These jobs are significantly harder to get.<p>The money won&#x27;t be as good at the sellside, but it&#x27;s a lot less risky. Also having a big bank on your resume never hurts. Probably the most common career path is:<p>summer bank internship -&gt; 2 year analyst stint -&gt; mba&#x2F;mfe&#x2F;PhD -&gt; associate role at bank or buy-side fund')
