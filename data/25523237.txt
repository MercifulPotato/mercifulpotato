You don&#x27;t realize how hard it is to buy (mostly digital) Japanese content online. I believe it is due to 20th century pre internet zoning regulations. On several occasions I spent a lot of time trying to buy some stuff legally but it was so hard or impossible that I ended up consuming pirated content.<p>Google apps store does not allow you to buy an app in Japanese from the UK,  Amazon.jp requires a different account than amazon.co.uk (which is not the case for amazon.com), Netflix does not provide Japanese subtitles for animes, same for steam, some games are in many languages but not Japanese.')
