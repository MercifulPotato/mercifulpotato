Obviously it would be impractical letting it get to maximum height indoors (around three metres, if I recall correctly), so we probably won&#x27;t provide it a bigger pot once it reaches the limits of the current one, but seeing it grow has been quite nice.<p>I attribute part of its success to keeping the plant in the bathroom such that the steam from the shower provides a more tropical climate than the rest of the house and helps moderate its water requirements. I&#x27;d like to move it outdoors at some point and let it get to maximum size, but I don&#x27;t think it would do well in the harsh Australian summer.')
