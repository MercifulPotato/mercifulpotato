Retail investors are buyers usually. So whether the shorts are hedgies or banks, they&#x27;re not retail as a group.<p>Everyone knows that GME will eventually crash, but the question is when. If retail is smart and coordinated about it, they can definitely cash in massively when shorts cover. They would need to keep buying which looks increasingly made difficult and monitor % short of float.<p>Will they succeed, idk.')
