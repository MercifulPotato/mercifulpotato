I&#x27;m trying to make a simple fast-booting instrumentation display.<p>I picked up a Pi zero and muddled my way through what I could in C&#x2F;C++ from piecemeal guides, and from text boot mode managed to initiate a graphics mode and draw a spinning triangle.  Think I threw darts at the board for linking libraries in the compilation.<p>I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing, and of course, the level of scaffolding that had to be put into a simple spinning triangle was just astounding.  My prior experience was using three.js and BabylonJS, and poorly.  Is there something convenient to use library-wise in text mode, or is a safer bet doing windows -&gt; firefox -&gt; three.js?')
