Is it legal to have a camera on your house pointing at the street?<p>In some countries, yes. It is illegal to point a camera at a public place without alerting people that there is a camera there.<p>Here in Sweden our version of the FCC (I gues, PTS) have actually written permission to apartment owners that they&#x27;re allowed to have peep hole cameras in their doors. For example a lot of senior citizens have this so they don&#x27;t have to get up to see who&#x27;s at the door.<p>So that was an exception they had to make because otherwise you&#x27;re not allowed to point a camera at a public place willy nilly.')
