If 40-something me could go back in time and tell 20-something me what Iâ€™d learned in my career so far, one of the first lessons would be that simplicity scales and endures like almost nothing else and is probably the most underrated virtue in software development. (Composability would be #2.)<p>That is not to say that complexity is never necessary. Sometimes we are trying to solve inherently complex problems. But there is a disturbing amount of <i>accidental</i> complexity in modern web development. To make things worse, because web development is such a huge part of the software industry now and how so many people have come into that industry, a whole generation of developers is growing up believing that the accidental complexity is necessary or even desirable.')
