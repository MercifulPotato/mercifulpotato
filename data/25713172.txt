Why can’t I just walk away from social strata to begin with, and live my life happily as a “lower class” citizen living in the woods if I want? What if the goal of changing social strata is actually just a larger scale version of the Peter Principle?<p>Last year I saw a chart posted on imgur with habits and traits of lower, middle, and upper class people. I’m sure many saw that and thought “oh I need to act like X so I can stop being Y.” What I saw was contentment that I am in the social tier that feels right to me. I don’t need “more,” I would struggle with “less.”')
