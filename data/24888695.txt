Item(by='screye', descendants=None, kids=[24888903], score=None, time=1603651065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887323, text='I disagree with the author on the idea that tail is too fat for isolated anomalies. There are most certainly events that can happen, which may lead to a red California or a blue Alabama.<p>Presidential assassination, war, video proof of something incredibly heinous (pedophilia?), etc. can absolutely lead to these outcomes. You don&#x27;t even have to go that far back. Nixon and Reagan flipped states like no-one&#x27;s business.<p>I do however agree, that 538&#x27;s state-state correlation model seems weak.<p>California and Alabama would only flip during a wave, and that wave would consume any and all states. The fact that 538&#x27;s model doesn&#x27;t strongly show that pattern is a failing of it. But, it is not clear if a model that inaccurately models the unlikeliest of events (california flipping while Florida stays blue), does not necessarily mean that it is terrible predictor of it&#x27;s primary target (Presidential likelihoods).<p>As a data scientist, I can totally understand Nate&#x27;s hesitation. Do you impose strong priors on the model to reflect strong domain intuition or do build a model that best characterizes the data it is based on. In the presence of infinite data, you should abandon all domain based priors. For single digit data points, priors are essential. For any number of data in between, it is anyone&#x27;s best guess.')
