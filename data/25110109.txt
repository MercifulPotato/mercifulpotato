Did they carefully knock out part of the foundation and placed the jackscrews there? What about the parts of the building that were not at the edges; did they place the jackscrews at the edges and then dug under the building and placed the other jackscrews there? The Briggs House illustration from the bottom of the Wikipedia article, seems to shows beams of wood or concrete&#x2F;stone at the bottom of the building. Wonder if they were there from the start, or put there when the jackscrews were inserted?')
