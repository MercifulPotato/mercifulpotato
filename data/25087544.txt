There is <i>no mechanism</i> that exists now nor in the past to make the statement literally true as written.<p>I don&#x27;t know how they managed to get that statement, but it&#x27;s misleading. Many misconceptions begin with an element of truth. I&#x27;m guessing the element of truth here was the &quot;certification&quot; process. (<i>Maybe</i> it was something else, like a mixup having him as an advisor accidentally caused him to not be hired into the engineering group and thus there was a wait before he got engineering credentials to view&#x2F;edit code. But that kind of thing is just silly paperwork and clearly fixed promptly.)<p>I just checked. He had literally written some C++ code before that snippet was published.<p>It was not the absurd statement it&#x27;s been made out to be. It sounds unbelievable for a reason: It is unbelievable because it didn&#x27;t happen.')
