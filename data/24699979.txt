Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602003669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24698660, text='Ultimately this is a bit of a rant about why MySQL didn&#x27;t bother changing the TIME type to support an elegant maximum value of 1,024 hours instead of 838.<p>But, seriously? Who cares? It&#x27;s not even close to an extra order of magnitude of range. The type is obviously meant to be used for time values that have a context of hours within a day, supporting a few days as headroom... so supporting 1,024 instead of 838 is pointless -- if you&#x27;re getting anywhere even close to the max value, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be using this type in the first place.<p>And yes, it&#x27;s probably <i>best</i> not to change it for backwards compatibility. Can I imagine a case where it could break something? No, not off the top of my head. But it <i>probably</i> would break some application somewhere. And for such a widely deployed piece of critical foundational infrastructure, being conservative is the way to go.<p>Nothing about this seems WTF at all, except for the author&#x27;s seeming opinion that elegant, power-of-two ranges ought to trump backwards compatibility with things that probably made sense at the time.')
