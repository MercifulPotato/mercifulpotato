Item(by='EpicEng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610394684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733399, text='&gt;For the first link, there was just one upvote in 23 hours. For the second link, there was 6 up and 3 down votes in 2 days. The third link has all information removed, to the point it can&#x27;t be verified. The fourth link had four upvotes probably in 1 day or more.<p>I don&#x27;t see how upvotes or views are relevant.<p>&gt;There&#x27;s no doubt the material is objectionable, but it was only up for a short time and got very little reach, even getting negative reactions within their own circles. And bare in mind, these aren&#x27;t exactly random examples either - this is supposed to represent the very worst - and it&#x27;s just some random people with little reach who get negative reactions from their own followers.<p>It&#x27;s only supposed to represent the 15 seconds of work I performed in going through the dump of parler data. There&#x27;s plenty more if you&#x27;re interested. Again, whether or not it reached a lot of people is hardly relevant.<p>&gt;Meanwhile over on Twitter you&#x27;ve got people sharing a picture of Trump&#x27;s severed head, you&#x27;ve got &quot;Hang Mike Pence&quot; trending as a hash tag, you have people celebrating the death of the lady who got shot in the capital, etc.<p>And that shouldn&#x27;t be allowed either. What&#x27;s your point?')
