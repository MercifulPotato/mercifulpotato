And the design would usually accommodate a bit more than that.<p>Overnight light pole charging won&#x27;t be delivering 100kW fast charging to a car, it will be for longer term parking, like overnight.<p>Averaging 12 hours at 1kW delivers enough charge to cover the average distance driven in the US. Non-average driving days will require using a fast charger or work place charging or charging at any number of other places.<p>Charging will be as ubiquitous as the rest of our car infrastructure.  Personally, I&#x27;d rather we get rid of so much car infrastructure and devote it to transit and parks and bikes and walking, but I&#x27;m far outside the Overton window when it comes to that. However, being outside the Overton window also lets me see how we spare no expense when it comes to creating car infrastructure, and how charging infrastructure is a tiny tiny fraction of the massive amount of spend on the rest of car infrastructure.')
