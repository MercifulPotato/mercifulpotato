But it sounds like we actually agree about this.<p>We disagree slightly in that I think even in the world where everyone is taken care of people should be allowed to accept bad jobs. It&#x27;s actually useful for us to allow this! If more people start accepting bad jobs again it&#x27;s a sign that the safety net is failing and should be improved.<p>But if that world was not an option I would mostly happily live in the world you&#x27;re describing, where bad jobs were banned but there was a robust safety net.')
