Is the code organized to be easily readable? Java is very expressive but that&#x27;s a good thing from a maintainance standpoint.<p>Also, the ecosystem is very young so you don&#x27;t know which libraries will still be around in 3 or 5 years. You might find yourself reworking large parts of the code for betting on the wrong horse.')
