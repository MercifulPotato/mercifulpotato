I don&#x27;t really give a #$!@$ about your profits as an iPhone developer. I care that google isn&#x27;t sniffing all of my personal data, that I don&#x27;t get viruses or phished, and that my phone just works.<p>Compare Apple to PCs.  Windows is, has been, and always will be a security sh*tshow.  Linux isn&#x27;t interesting enough to scammers to be a security target yet, but it sure is ugly and chaotic.   Apple just works for me.<p>By forcing Apple to be open, you&#x27;re trying to both turn it into Linux by taking away the quality and usability of the apps available, and into Windows by .. making it a security shitshow.<p>Nobody has ever given me a real argument as to how Apple harms consumers in the iPhone.  The only argument seems to be that app developers want a free ride. They want full access to do whatever they want, consumers be damned, without paying into the infrastructure which made their market available.  (techno-libertarianism strikes again?)')
