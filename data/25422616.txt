It implies that something real is happening, though not that the OP&#x27;s interpretation was accurate. It often happens in such cases that the observation is right but the interpretation is wrong [1]. It&#x27;s when the interpretation rushes into angry denunciation, and especially a campaign using baity tricks to rile people up, that fair-minded readers start to have adverse reactions.<p>A discussion oriented more around a question (what explains this odd phenomenon?) could be a good thing. A more neutral submission, with a less baity title, might get a different reception from the community. But the combination of overstated claims and baity denunciation is usually going to trigger an immune response.<p>[1] I have no idea if it&#x27;s wrong or not, just that a lot of informed commenters reacted that way.')
