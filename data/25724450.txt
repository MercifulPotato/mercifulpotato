He sees exactly what they&#x27;re doing and knows where it leads.<p>All big tech has to do now is tighten the screws further, and they can use their new standard to wipe out any challenger from the right half of the political spectrum before they ever gain traction (whether in media, with payment processing, social media, news, tech platforms &amp; hosting; it&#x27;s all controlled by the same political group now).<p>This approach by big tech would have prevented Trump from ever having a shot at getting elected in the first place, they would have turned down the volume so nobody could hear what he had to say. Which tells you all you need to know about what&#x27;s coming next.<p>The US is a unified structural dictatorship of the left now. Tech. Academia. Hollywood &amp; media. Social media. News. Payment processing. Thought police. Speech censorship. Tyranny will obviously follow. I&#x27;m non-partisan, I&#x27;ve never voted for a Republican, but it&#x27;s obvious the left has acquired a dangerous amount of system power over the country.<p>Here&#x27;s a prediction for you: in the next few years big tech will use this same conspired approach to begin behavior &#x27;encouragement&#x27; for the wider population. Fat shame someone? No more Gmail account for you. Say something hateful? No more PayPal account for you. Already you&#x27;d have 1&#x2F;4+ of the left wing nodding their heads in agreement that this is exactly the kind of social engineering that should happen (a US form of what China does to its population). It&#x27;s inevitably what big tech is going to do, because it&#x27;s very hard to legislate behavior control to pursue the politically correct dream they have in mind (safe spaces for all, so long as it&#x27;s their type of safe space, by their rules, and their ideas), but it can be achieved through aggressive coercive action using the platforms, and now with these moves they&#x27;re officially on the political playing field. It&#x27;ll arrive in the guise of wrapping society in bubble wrap meant to keep everyone safe, and it ends in societal death by suffocation, narrowing and revocation of practicable rights as ever increasing numbers of things become wrong-think (and come with punishment).')
