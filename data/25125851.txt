I&#x27;ve found the device sufficient to replace paper entirely.  Due to the eink technology, the responsiveness depends on how much visual update there is on the screen. When you&#x27;re writing it&#x27;s very responsive, but if moving a complex drawing it may be slower.  The reMarkable 2 should be more responsive though, especially since it has two cores.')
