The mRNA vaccine method does mean that you can design a vaccine this quickly, just based on the sequence and some general knowledge about the virus. But what you don&#x27;t from this are safety and efficacy, you still have to determine those the hard way. Which the article of course also mentions at length.<p>As far as I know Moderna and Biontech tried different variants of their vaccine. And to determine how well those work you have to do some animal experiments, and that is always much slower than designing and synthesizing mRNA sequences.<p>The mRNA vaccines were the fastest ones, and they worked better than expected. So I think there is a lot of promise in the technology, but further speedups are hard because they&#x27;re in the clinical study part.')
