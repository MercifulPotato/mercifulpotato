The researchers are not a party to Facebook&#x27;s terms of service. The user installing the add-on may be, but that does not bind the add-on developer.  (This is called &quot;privity&quot; in law; contract constraints do not obligate third parties who didn&#x27;t agree to the contract.)<p>Facebook could disconnect Facebook users using the add-on, if they can detect them. That would be a bad PR move.')
