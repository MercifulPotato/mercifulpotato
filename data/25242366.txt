However, you can buy digital music from Amazon, the iTunes Store, Bandcamp, and other places that give you DRM free audio files. I personally think this is a fair trade off because when you pay for a streaming service you are just renting access to their library while if you really want the music for keeps you can simply purchase the music.')
