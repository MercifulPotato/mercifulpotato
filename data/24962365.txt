If you accept the premise that liberalism has failed and that re-establishing it is impossible, then as a bourgeois you have two choices.<p>Either you do accept the socialization of your property, and live the life of an ordinary person, which is morally by far the best thing to do, or:<p>In an attempt to maintain your capital, you decide that you&#x27;d rather see fascism with you in a privileged position.<p>As far as anyone is concerned, if you decide that fascism is good for you because it helps you maintain your privilege, you are a fascist.<p>No one has ever said that all bourgeois are hidden fascists, but history tells us that, when (if) liberalism collapses, most bourgeois follow their class interests and support fascism, instead of trying to maintain liberalism and becoming neutral when that fails.<p>Why is this? Because the issues that historically led to the collapse of liberalism can always be linked back to economic issues. Therefore, trying to install a system that provides democracy, peace, and equality for all if&#x2F;when liberalism collapses will necessarily require the revision of the economics that led to such an issue. This is why, in this event, there really isn&#x27;t much of an alternative between severely limiting the private ownership of capital and fascism.')
