There are protocols for these things but they live in multiple places.<p>Every Wayland window-manager-compositor-hybrid invents their <i>own</i> protocols for these things. This basically means that you can&#x27;t write a program that does these things -- you need three different versions of every API call you make, and that&#x27;s just to support the popular desktop environments that people happen to be using this week. So no one has, so the only Wayland protocol features you need to support are the basic ones to open a window, draw into it, and get mouse and keyboard input.<p>&gt; Keep in mind either way you&#x27;re talking about using a custom compositor<p>No, I suspect the &quot;top-level compositor&quot; could be any off-the-shelf Wayland compositor that supports XWayland and can make a window full-screen.')
