Management creates friction but some of it is necessary.  Too much causes problems, but too little causes a different set of problems (at least beyond a pretty small scale in terms of goals and people).<p>I guess one way to look at is management as an activity - at some scale you have enough of it it makes sense to have someone(s) specialize in it, rather than distribute amongst the group.  But once it is a specialized role, it&#x27;s harder for the person in that role to do other things.  So if there are too many of them, or their time is not directed the right way, it&#x27;s a net negative.')
