I can choose between umpteen providers or run my own mail server, it&#x27;s a standard protocol with many different clients to suit one&#x27;s needs, I can&#x27;t get banned by a faceless FAANG corporation for no reason and with no recourse, I&#x27;m not locked into some walled garden and dependent on the benevolence of corporate overlords and I don&#x27;t need to worry about some intern at Google suffering from NIH syndrome deciding to make completely unneeded &quot;improvements&quot; that negatively impact my UX.<p>Email is old but that doesn&#x27;t mean it sucks.<p>Internal &quot;semi-spam&quot; is a social problem and needs a social solution. Changing protocols won&#x27;t change the spam problem at your company.')
