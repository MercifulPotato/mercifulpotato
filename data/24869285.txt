Never underestimate how many people just don&#x27;t show up or try at all.<p>Look at average screen time for Americans as a data point. It&#x27;s a ridiculous 12 hours a day of media usage. Just think about that. People are basically staring at their phones&#x2F;tvs for 12 out of the 16 waking hours.<p>As I get older I realize more often than not most successful people are not special, but simply were normally people that didn&#x27;t screw up badly, showed up to work every day, and took better opportunities that were available. They graduated college with reasonable degrees, they didn&#x27;t stay in bad jobs, or in dead-end cities. Eventually if you do that you will get a break, land at a successful company, get a big promotion, ect.')
