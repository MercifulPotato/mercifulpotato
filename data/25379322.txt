Quite the opposite.<p>Your entire argument is refuted if Apple isn&#x27;t allowed to  abuse it&#x27;s market position and you&#x27;re allowed to have &quot;Apple Pay +30% price&quot; &quot;Stripe Payment&quot; &quot;Payment X&quot; - you would quickly see the real value of App Store and Apple Payment processing convenience - that 30% would probably come down to 10% where it provides the convenience value.<p>If consumers weren&#x27;t harmed consumer choice would have no effect.<p>This &quot;users are idiots and they need Apple to tell them what&#x27;s best for them&quot; is like Stockholm syndrome with Apple fans, it&#x27;s especially entertaining to hear it so often on a &quot;hacker&quot; newsgroup. Good thing papa Apple decided you can&#x27;t have that dangerous Fortnite scam tricking you in to using a different payment system, you&#x27;re better off not wasting time on games anyway - really if you look at it that way they are saving you from bad choices two times - win&#x2F;win for Apple users I&#x27;d say.')
