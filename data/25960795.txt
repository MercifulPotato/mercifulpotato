I’m having a hard time understanding the problem, but the game does have a learning curve. Suggestions: The majority of my belts carry one item. The remainder carry only one type in each lane. Those are neatly merged at the beginning, and consumed indiscriminately at the end. That is, the consumer wants both items so they can be transferred by one inserted.
