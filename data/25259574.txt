I want a banana but in order to get the banana I must recreate the gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle the banana is sitting in.<p>If &#x27;banana&#x27; is dependent upon &#x27;gorilla&#x27; then you&#x27;re doing OOP wrong, or maybe you didn&#x27;t need to reuse &#x27;banana&#x27; in the first place and took some shortcuts while coding and now that you need you will have to refactor the code and extract that functionality into a new class.<p>Even in the case of inaccessible logic hidden into classes it&#x27;s entirely possible to extract that code into, say, an utility class that can be reused across several classes. In this case the resulting code may resemble a combination of higher level OOP classes wich take advantage of lower level functional modules for implementing their behavior.')
