Then to unhide, you have to click through to your preferences to get to the &quot;hidden&quot; link.<p>Reddit uses this order:<p><pre><code>    N comments | share | save | hide | give award | report | crosspost\n</code></pre>\nI guess my preference would be for HN to use a similar order:<p><pre><code>    N comments | N points by &lt;user&gt; &lt;time&gt; | hide | flag\n</code></pre>\nOf course, if you make this change, half the readers will hate it and insist you change it back. :-)<p>I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;flag&quot; and &quot;hide&quot; need to be on the main page at all. You could show those only after clicking through to the submission?<p>(The right solution is probably for me to use one of the many HN reader apps.)')
