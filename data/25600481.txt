He had a varied set of collaborators, and just so many artistic achievements. So much of his work is now seminal in underground hip-hop (Madvillainy, Operation Doomsday, King Geedorah are just the first to come my to mind). Itâ€™s hard to overstate the impact he had with his meticulously constructed rhyme schemes and lyrics, and his unique tone and artistry in production. I also greatly appreciated the humor and liveliness he brought to his work.<p>I have to admit that this was really hard for me to process at first, and it will probably be that way for a while. I think this is the first time an artist I love so much has passed away. His music buoyed me through hard times and gave color to happy times.<p>Best wishes to his family, and those who knew him and worked with him closely. Undoubtedly he has left a beautiful and inscrutable mark on this world, and the world is better for it.')
