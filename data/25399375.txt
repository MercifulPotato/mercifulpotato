There&#x27;s some consensus that it&#x27;s perfectly fine for e.g. Apple to prevent you from installing something outside the app store, or to put up major hurdles to installing anything unsigned on MacOS, because Grandma and Grandpa can&#x27;t be trusted not to do something silly and get pwned. &quot;It&#x27;s not a hacker device!&quot; is the usual refrain.<p>Yet the consequences of having your brain be pwned are so much worse. There are people who believe the Earth is flat and that vaccines cause autism; some of these beliefs can cost lives. Maybe YouTube shouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;hacker platform&quot; either, but a place where people can watch videos without fear of being led down a rabbit hole.')
