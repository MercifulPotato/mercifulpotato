In fact it was misleading for you to suggest it was <i>&quot;just moved to other pages under the about tab and the wording refined over time&quot;</i>. According to the archives, this is completely false.<p>The entire page I mentioned in my second comment was &#x27;removed&#x27; and almost no edits to the About page were made after its removal. The page itself and the reasons for its removal is the &#x27;obfuscation&#x27; by BLM. Who knows, perhaps you know?<p>We could have a conversation, but perhaps you need to answer the question and actually come with actual evidence rather than misleading suggestions.')
