Item(by='Natsu', descendants=None, kids=[24995159], score=None, time=1604539020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993945, text='&gt; is it unreasonable for me to think there&#x27;s no good medicinal depression cure<p>There can be, but only for some people and not others.  I&#x27;ve seen esketamine make a night &amp; day difference.  Sadly, it has horrible side-effects as well, as in someone nearly died from that and had to discontinue the trial.<p>There&#x27;s some hope that a particular metabolite of ketamine that works on AMPA may offer relief without the side-effects, but I haven&#x27;t seen it actually in a medical trial yet and even if it was, I don&#x27;t know if our doctor would go for it or not, though it allegedly does avoid the psychosis.')
