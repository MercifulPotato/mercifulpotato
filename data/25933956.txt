Air is relatively cheap to heat up. I&#x27;d wager the combustion process, once fully started, won&#x27;t suffer much if the ambient temperature is -30C or +30C: the fire is still on a temperature scale that&#x27;s an order of magnitude higher.<p>Even on a summer day a good breeze of wind or just blowing into the fire too hard yourself will put it out but only if it was just starting. Once the fire is rooted in something more solid, combustible material it will easily heat up any fresh air that is conveyed into the fire.')
