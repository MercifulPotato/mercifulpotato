The only time a consumer chooses to pay for something is when it&#x27;s as entrenched into their minds as MS Office is, or when their employer&#x2F;school demands it (also MS Office).<p>HP&#x27;s ink is so successful since you can now just have it show up at your door when you&#x27;re low on ink instead of having to make a trip to best buy. The extortionate price of unit-sold cartridges is only extra motivation.<p>And Tesla is only big because they have an appealing product; if other car manufacturers could offer the same (EV) range, software experience, and minimalistic design, they&#x27;d blow Tesla out of the water with superior service and build quality.<p>Now this cheap Wi-Fi router isn&#x27;t something people are buying because it&#x27;s comparatively better or offers some features, it&#x27;s just a cheap Chinese wifi router that some corporate Wal-Mart manager decided to stock since it would be high-margin and, as far as they know, offered basic wifi functionality.
