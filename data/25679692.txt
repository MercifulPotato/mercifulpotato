But for me, I’m sitting in a house that’s paid off. If I lose my job (or have to quit for medical reasons) and I can’t get a new job, I’ve got shelter. I can live Indefinitely where I am right now just paying utilities and property tax. Granted there is the reality of things just break on houses and require $$$.<p>Maybe it isn’t the best strategy. But there’s a nice feeling to know that I’ll have my house even if something bad happens.<p>And by bad I mean less than societal collapse. All bets are off in that situation.')
