I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even necessary that this person&#x27;s account got swept up when looking for similar transactions. It&#x27;s very easy for the nuances of complicated situations like these to get lost as they pass through the organization.<p>Eventually the issue could&#x27;ve been forwarded to a lower level employee who spends 99.9% of their time reversing fraud caused by unrelenting fraudsters, and so they figured that must be what&#x27;s going on here too. So they closed the account, closed any connected accounts, and sent a generic sternly worded email.<p>But equally likely is that Chase deliberately and short-shortsightedly thought, &quot;this sort of shit just isn&#x27;t something we want our customers to be doing; get rid of him.&quot;')
