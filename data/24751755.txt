Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602481871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24751635, text='I originally wrote ADSL in the comment, then realised that was misleading because it wasn&#x27;t old-school ADSL to the exchange.  There&#x27;s a fibre component and it&#x27;s still worse than 4G for my needs :-)<p>So I edited the comment to FTTC for clarification.  When sold it was probably just &quot;Superfast Broadband&quot;.<p>Looking at marketing now, I see &quot;Faster Broadband&quot;, &quot;Fibre Broadband&quot;, &quot;Superfast Fibre&quot;, &quot;Ultrafast Fibre&quot;, &quot;Fibre Optic Broadband&quot;...  It&#x27;s impossible to tell from marketing whether it&#x27;s FTTC, FTTP or something else.')
