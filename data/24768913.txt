You are supposed to be able to extract plaintext secrets with the Data Protection API if you are logged in as the user who the secret belongs to. That is the whole point.<p>I’m not sure the author knows this. He points out that this is useful for <i>post</i>-exploitation data gathering. That is, you’ve already compromised a machine&#x2F;account and are looking to gather as much potentially useful information as possible. But he puts “securely” in scare quotes, which is not honest because this <i>is</i> secure storage: if you’re not authenticated, the key can’t be read. The encryption key is derived from the user password, so it can’t be defeated by offline reading either.')
