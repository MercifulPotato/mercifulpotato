After conception, chymerism could occur, where XX and XY twins become conjoined  and a single fetus develops having both XX and XY chromosomes in different parts of the body - the sex will mostly be determined by which DNA is used when forming the gonads. It could also end up developing both kinds of gonads. But even if the fetus develops testicles, there is a chance that it has some kind of testosterone resistance and ends up with a completely female phenotype. Of course, there is also a possibility that no gonads are developed. This is all staying well in the realm of biological sex, and disregarding other hormonal complications that could happen based on what the mother is doing and her health, and disregarding any morphological abnormalities that could cause surface-level confusion between biologically male and female sexual organs.')
