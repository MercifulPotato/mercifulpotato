So the developer fixes the bug and makes the code prettier and push it as a single commit. I am then left with figuring out which changes are related to the bug fix and what is related to the cleanup.<p>If I tell the developer to first fix the bug and then cleanup in a separate commit, it may be inefficient since the fix after cleanup may not be the same as fix before cleanup. It may also lead to the cleanup being skipped because his work is technically done after the fix.<p>If I tell him to cleanup first and fix later, it&#x27;s also seem to lead to issues since the developer has typically already figured out how to fix it since he came into the code with the mindset of fixing the bug.<p>Of course I like the code being cleaned up, and I like the idea that you improve the code as you work with it. But I&#x27;m not sure what the best method is. Maybe the issue is with me, that I want the cleanup and fix in separate commits for easier reviewing.<p>Personally if I spot ugly code when fixing a bug I add unit tests, fix the bug and then add another ticket to improve the code. I then plan that code cleanup for this or the next sprint. But it feels tedious and is probably inefficient as well')
