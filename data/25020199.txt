Item(by='erichocean', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604787999, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25020022, text='I can give you the background on the change CA made.<p>Imagine a district with the following breakdown: 35% Progressive D, 35% Liberal&#x2F;moderate D, 25% Republican, 5% Other. So overall, 70% D.<p>CA used to mandate that on the final ballot, you got one choice per party, e.g. one D, one R, and <i>N</i> &quot;Other&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s what would happen: the D primary would have a Progressive and a Liberal&#x2F;moderate. But because Progressives were a lot more &quot;activist&quot;, they got out and voted in the primary and their candidate would win. So the final ballot would be: Progressive D, moderate R, <i>N</i> &quot;Other&quot;.<p>In the election, enough Liberal&#x2F;moderate Ds would NOT vote for the Progressive D, so the moderate Republican kept winning, despite only being 25% of the electorate and not voting with Democrats in the legislature, even though 70% of their district were Democrats.<p>The change was to have the top two candidates of <i>any</i> party on the ballot. This resulted in a Progressive D and a Liberal&#x2F;moderate D (and no R). R&#x27;s (of course) vote for the Liberal&#x2F;moderate D in this scenario on the final ballot, and they win (and vote with the Democrats in the legislature). This, more or less, is why Democrats have a supermajority in CA, but it&#x27;s really two wings of the same party, and they have to negotiate much the same way that Democrats and Republicans in the US Senate have to get along.')
