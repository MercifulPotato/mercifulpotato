With all the fracking oil sources now available to tap in the US at relatively short notice, the world of oil is very different now. OPEC used to be able to control supply, demand was inelastic, and thus they could control the price. Fracking is expensive, but you can produce a huge amount of oil by just spending more $&#x2F;barrel to get it out of the ground. A lot of the oil is owned privately in west Texas and will be available for extraction for the foreseeable future. For the first time since the 1970&#x27;s(maybe earlier&#x2F;never?) oil pricing will closely follow classic supply and demand curves.<p>Another interesting thing is that the US is now producing more oil than it is consuming. It will probably be a net exporter going forward. This changes the realpolitik view of the Middle East. The US could definitely get the hell out of there militarily and just keep a lookout for nuclear weapons production projects (or even just leave that to the Israelis who we already massively support). This is a huge deal that I don&#x27;t see discussed at all.')
