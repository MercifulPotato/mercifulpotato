Especially with market pressures like price comparisons made available. This kind of care is fairly fixed in cost and has predictable demand so the business risks are much lower. Additionally government could provide tax incentives for things like getting an annual exam for example.<p>For point #2 you have this backwards. Insurance is meant to guard against risk. When you have situation like the current one where insurance is used to pay for routine or predictable care that whole idea of spreading the risk around with insurance is moot as the risk of costing the plan money is 100% for everyone.<p>Finally, fully single payer medicine is bad for all kinds of reasons as well. We need balanced solutions not ideologies.')
