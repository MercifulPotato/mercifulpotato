When you said:<p>&gt; you&#x27;re right in that normally package definitions specify the exact dependencies it the code (they&#x27;re hardcoded).<p>I thought that meant that package X might specify a dependency on A version 2.4.2 exactly. So if you want it to use A 2.4.3 instead, a new release of package X would have to be created, specifying 2.4.3.<p>But I think this is not in fact what you mean? In which case I don&#x27;t yet understand the system you are describing and what you mean by not doing dependency resolution.')
