This strengthens their neck and spine so they can stand properly once they get out. Otherwise there&#x27;s a risk they&#x27;ll compensate by splaying their legs, which becomes a permanent disability if you don&#x27;t give them splints in time.<p>Chickens are sturdier overall, so it&#x27;s possible it doesn&#x27;t matter for them. Curious, though.')
