People need time to hear themselves think or they&#x27;ll go nuts. Politicians haven&#x27;t been terribly helpful either.<p>I personally find it hard to get too worked up over it anymore.<p>When my neighbor caught it in July, I was very concerned for him. He was the first person I knew personally to catch it and  I was worried for his health. Thankfully him an his wife and kid got through it fine.<p>Then in September another neighbor caught it, I checked in with him daily to make sure he was coming through it okay.<p>In October, my 98 year old grandma caught it. I thought great, this is finally the time. She&#x27;s going to die from it. And then she got over it just fine.<p>In December, I had an aunt and uncle catch it, both in their late 60s. Both got over it just fine.<p>I learned the other day the reason I hadn&#x27;t heard much out of one of my best friends is that just before Christmas him and his wife caught it. They also got over it just fine.<p>Heard this weekend that another of my neighbors had it in their house. Also getting over it perfectly fine.<p>I don&#x27;t say all that to discount the tragedy for those who have died from it. \nIt&#x27;s a terrible thing and I wish it hadn&#x27;t happened.<p>But we were sold Ebola by the media, and we got an unusually deadly seasonal flu.')
