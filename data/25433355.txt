Just pay a regular average salary and people will be lining up.<p>&gt;&gt; Why would it be impossible? It&#x27;s pretty easy in fact - diplomats have immunity in order to carry on their jobs.<p>Clearly it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a slippery slope. For example, even corporations today have more rights than people, they can move to a new country and not have to apply for citizenship like people do. Corporations also pay lower taxes in many countries, also they can commit crimes and get away with only small fines; they are never jailed or terminated. By extension, corporate executives often get better treatment than regular people when it comes to certain crimes. It&#x27;s also well know that rich people pay much lower % taxes on average. Nobody is equal under the law because we&#x27;ve allowed ourselves to diverge from this simple principle.')
