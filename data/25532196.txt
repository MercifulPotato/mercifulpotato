QEMU, it turns out, is very &quot;forgiving&quot; even when emulating real HW (i.e. not virtio). That can make it challenging when the code meets real clock-synchronized circuits for the first time.<p>I do like the VM-based OS approach for hobbyist OS&#x27;s, though. Unless one is specifically interested in the challenge of supporting actual hardware, I think the &quot;QEMU first&quot; approach is the way to go. It simplifies the otherwise-vast problem space and encourages other hobbyists to try out your system or join your development effort.<p>My first hobby OS project (~2000) was done by repeatedly writing a floppy image to 3.5&quot; disk and booting it on an old junk laptop I had. It was painful and since then any hobby bare metal programming that doesn&#x27;t involve microcontrollers I will happily do from the comfort of my modern machine and a VM.')
