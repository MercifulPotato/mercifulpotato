Just look at all the research on various medicines...that 20 years later it turns out they were only as good as placebos.<p>Facts:<p>1. Microplastics appear to be everywhere now.<p>2. There is evidence that they are not inert molecules, passing through, instead they are chemically active.<p>Assumption: microplastics are bad for you.<p>Now if that causes debilitating fear to you that&#x27;s a different issue, but sticking your head in the sand won&#x27;t make the problem go away.<p>Also, your utalitarian logic is flawed.')
