And, as the saying goes, there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.<p>Just because an argument is logical and has facts doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s correct. There are multiple ways to shape, work with, or interpret data.<p>But, speaking of data, is the guy who&#x27;s tweets you referenced - Ernie Tedeschi, a reliable source? Better or worse than, say, Alan Greenspan? What are his general biases? Same with the Bloomberg article. That article itself said &quot;A rising but uneven tide - the late &#x27;10s weren&#x27;t equally beneficial to all Americans.&quot;<p>Plus, let&#x27;s use Occam&#x27;s razor. Which way does it cut?<p>- Rent prices in major cities &#x2F; economic hubs for non-tech workers.<p>- Cost of healthcare in the US<p>- Cost of higher education in the US<p>- Cost of home ownership by major cities in the US.<p>- Job security and availability of well-paying work for non-tech workers?<p>- Is the economy benefitting those who need it most?<p>- How equitably have the fruits of economic growth been distributed?')
