In practice, rising real estate prices <i>even in the absence of rent or price controls</i> has <i>not</i> seen corresponding increases in construction, the effect of which would be constant housing costs, adjusted forbinflation.<p>The business of real estate is <i>not</i> to increase <i>housing supply</i> but to increase <i>housing value as an asset class</i>.  And, given an inherently inelastic supply and rising demand, the best way to do this is by artificially constraining supply:  keepin unnits off-market, limiting construction, density limmits, setbacks and separations, height limits, restrictions on multuple tenancies, and some aspects of building codes.<p>This isn&#x27;t new:<p><i>When recently the mechanized industries, particularly in metal, entered the housing field with the production of “prefabricated houses”, they were met by the resistance of property holders, especially of the banks, who hold mortgages on about 58 percent of all 1933 value of all urban real estate, and who fear that an influx of cheap modern dwellings would subtract substantially from the market value of existing structures. These banks and loan companies have been unwilling to finance prefabricated houses except in rare exceptions and then on a limited basis.</i><p>-- Bernhard J.
