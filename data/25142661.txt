Whether quasi-legal in the shape of various kickbacks to outright illegal gifts of cash and goods. It is sadly endemic to the industry.<p>In part I think it happens more commonly because there is so much &quot;other peoples money&quot; in healthcare. Everyone is spending from someone elses checkbook and so transactions seem very distant.')
