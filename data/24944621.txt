Item(by='wait_a_minute', descendants=None, kids=[24944774], score=None, time=1604078699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943913, text='The retort about &quot;private companies&quot; is usually a dishonest one, because whenever I drill into the views of the people making that retort I find that they are leftists (even far leftists) who only pretend to care about private companies when it&#x27;s convenient to do so. The aim is clearly censorship at all levels of information distribution. We must end the trend now before it is too late.<p>If their views were the ones these companies were shutting down, they&#x27;d be up at arms about it. The evidence is in the response to Coinbase recently instituting a No Politics policy. Plenty on the left construed that as being censorship, ironically enough.')
