Which in turn is leading to expensive and unpredictable page faults. In contrast, C++&#x27;s default is to allocate objects on the heap unless you knowingly call new&#x2F;malloc.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s possible to write Java in such a way to minimize this type of heap-thrashing. But by that point, you&#x27;re already doing the equivalent of C++&#x27;s manual memory book-keeping anyway. It&#x27;s not like &quot;just provision a ton of memory and turn off GC&quot; is a free lunch.')
