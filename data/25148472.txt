The US education sector is like the US health sector - a device for increasing shareholder value among parasitic corporates, not for providing an effective public service.<p>As a result it provides vanishingly poor outcomes which keep the US below the OECD average, in spite of some of the highest per-student spending in the world.<p>Education is highly politicised, managed by school boards which seem to attract religious kooks and other low-quality authoritarians with eccentric ideas, and which does almost everything it can to discourage good teachers and other suspiciously well-educated and competent individuals from joining or staying in the profession.<p>Widespread poverty in the US population doesn&#x27;t help.<p>Changing how math is taught won&#x27;t address the essential dysfunctional broken futility of the system as a whole.')
