A few floors of underground parking under every building)<p>Have you actually thought this through?<p>For example - 6,000 people work at the Gerkin.<p>Can you guess what area is needed to park 6,000 cars? How many underground levels you&#x27;d need? How long would it take cars to filter in at the start of the day and filter out at the end? How much road space you&#x27;d need for everyone to get to the building in the first place?<p>It&#x27;s 90,000 m^2. That&#x27;s about 90 underground levels you&#x27;re building there, or digging twice as deep as the building is high.<p>Your idea is insane.')
