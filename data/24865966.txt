Not primarily, anyway. If you pay attention to the way Adobe communicates in recent years, it&#x27;s all about the &quot;democratization&quot; of design tools. They want their new tech to look like magic to regular consumers. It doesn&#x27;t need good UI. It doesn&#x27;t need to help professionals work more efficiently. It just needs to help Joe Everyman use content-aware fill to remove the unwanted thing from his next Instagram upload. If they can do something in that vein once a month and keep the subscription rolling, then they&#x27;re golden.')
