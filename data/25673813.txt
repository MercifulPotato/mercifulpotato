This is just another case. He was pushing Pence to use power he didn&#x27;t have. His allies all pushed the fraud narrative. And he provoked a riot that proceeded to follow his orders and storm the capital.<p>This is what a weak coup looks like in 2020 America. None of the action above were based on preserving order or upholding the constitution or fullfilling his oath of office or protecting our democracy or being in the right. It was a power grab doomed from the start, but never the less, a power grab and a sorry attempt at a coup.')
