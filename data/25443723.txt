The bad outcome is that they bit off more than they can chew and CP2077 takes too long to get to a good state or the “good state” is not good.  The good outcome is that they make a decent looking product by the end of 2021 and gamers (maybe) forgive CDPR for releasing an unfinished game.  There’s a large expectation of goodwill from both sides.  Both sides have consistently demonstrated that goodwill, but that goodwill could sour.')
