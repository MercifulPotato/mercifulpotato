My own experience (particularly in online communities) is that once groups achieve a certain momentum, the average participant in the group cares very little about policies that impact a tiny minority of users no matter how draconian they are.<p>If it were true in general that people would &quot;vote with their feet&quot; we wouldn&#x27;t have autocrats in positions of power or much injustice in the world at all.<p>I love Matrix and have been running my own Synapse instance for friends and family for years -- I appreciate all the work that has gone into it. And further, I appreciate that this is a challenging problem to solve in general, and that you&#x27;re unfortunately being forced to come up with &quot;lesser evil&quot; solutions to counter all of this talk of E2E encryption being the &quot;tradecraft of terrorists and child pornographers&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m just deeply disappointed to see it -- social credit styled systems like this penalize people for having bad mental health days, or who have unusual interests or points of view, or who are LGBTQ+, or belong to some other vulnerable minority group, and I think generally have a chilling effect on communities -- or rather on these specific subcultures within those communities, clearly not all of whom are &quot;bad faith&quot; actors.')
