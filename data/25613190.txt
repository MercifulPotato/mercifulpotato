Why would there be more of these without a lockdown than with a lockdown?<p>&gt; collapse of existing health systems<p>Yes, that seems to be a material and important factor.<p>&gt; loss of essential skilled people at all levels<p>Perhaps, but would the impact be material? In particular, how would the number of skilled people lost to unmitigated Covid compare to losses due to natural factors (retirement, non-Covid health issues, moving to a job where the skills are no longer relevant, etc)?<p>I am not necessarily arguing against your point, but I do feel that your arguments need more refinement to be persuasive.')
