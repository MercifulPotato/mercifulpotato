Those people do not exist. Look at the data.<p>There’s currently 18 million unemployed Americans. The majority of pandemic related job losses are low wage retail, hospitality and restaurant workers.<p>There’s a total of 500k H1b visa holders in the US, the vast majority of which are in IT.<p>There is very little (if any) overlap between those groups.<p>You aren’t suddenly going to make more money by kicking out all the immigrants. That’s not how the economy works. Those H1b holders are also consumers who spend a majority of their salaries on taxes and products&#x2F;services in the US. Kicking out 500k people would further <i>hurt</i> unemployment in sectors hit most by the pandemic.')
