That is unlikely to happen if the dislikes are bulk spam.<p>We&#x27;ll be told it&#x27;s &#x27;spam&#x27; or &#x27;bots&#x27;, and Youtube will rely on this as the plausible explanation should they bother to address it at all, but the inconvenient truth is that the most likely explanation for the dislikes is viewers.
