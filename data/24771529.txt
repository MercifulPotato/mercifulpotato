Some great stuff under there, including the ranting review of the first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation on TV from 1987: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usenetarchives.com&#x2F;view.php?id=alt.flame&amp;g=224&amp;p=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usenetarchives.com&#x2F;view.php?id=alt.flame&amp;g=224&amp;p=0</a><p>Amazingly, you could replace most of the content of that post with &quot;Star Trek Discovery&quot; or &quot;Star Trek Picard&quot; and it&#x27;d be just like a recent post!<p>I think The Next Generation fared well despite the slow first series. Fascinating bit of internet history.<p>At least this &quot;review&quot; is worded better than many of the suspect (paid for?) reviews of films on IMDB these days.')
