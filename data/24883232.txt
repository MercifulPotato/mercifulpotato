If you can&#x27;t explain some part, then you will quickly discover which parts you are following by rote.<p>At that point you need to go back and understand the process. It will be a process of writing and writing, revising, and understanding. It&#x27;s not an instantaneous process and may take a few months to a year, but it is a rewarding process.<p>You may find you will have to think about certain concepts you thought you knew, even basic ones. Don&#x27;t worry about that. It took centuries for mathematicians to even write down precisely what a set is for example.')
