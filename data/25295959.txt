A &quot;Good&quot; UX can have a disastrous effect on backend and architecture. It may put undue focus on glitz and cost the performance or reliability of the application greatly. Those LEAD to a bad UX, but that&#x27;s typically not in the UX focus up front. Most probably think it&#x27;s an obvious default, but unless focus is put there, it doesn&#x27;t come for free. Zero-sum game, paying the glitz tax will cause a debt somewhere else.')
