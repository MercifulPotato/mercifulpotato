This is very rarely a matter of something silly like &quot;Russian IP = Russian intelligence&quot; and more like sloppily re-using an ostensibly non-attributable network or nameserver they didn&#x27;t realize was already burned.<p>We&#x27;re still kind of in the infancy of cyberwarfare. Attribution will probably be harder in a few decades.<p>But, yes, it&#x27;s generally a matter of TTPs, target selection, goal analysis, and style.')
