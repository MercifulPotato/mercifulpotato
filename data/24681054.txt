So for my friend and I it started on a Saturday afternoon spent typing code into a ZX Spectrum.<p>A year or two later my dad would let me play on his PC at work on Saturdays. Found myself in a large bookshop around then and picked up a book on GW Basic which had listings in it for things like text boxes, sort&#x2F;search, input&#x2F;output, COM ports and so on. I was hooked.<p>In &#x27;89 I was consripted and wrote some software to order incoming messages by priority and recipient or something. Wrote that up in my first resume and was hired after my first interview in &#x27;90.<p>Since then I just kept wanting more, and so I worked my way through stuff like tariffing and billing for cellphone operators, building a frontend for online banking, and so on, which led to a job at Microsoft, then Nokia, and on and on... until today.')
