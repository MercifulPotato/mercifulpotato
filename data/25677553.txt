Maybe 5 of them.<p>We are currently organizing via 5-7 WhatsApp groups, and in a couple of months we need to switch, by my estimate. This is only India, but the rest will follow, and the change is not acceptable at all.<p>So I&#x27;m preparing now a slow switch to Signal, which seems to be most acceptable here. So far nobody took the initial bite, so I&#x27;ll have to prepare a longer massmail.\nTelegram not, this stores all messages centrally.<p>It will be longer process, esp. since our groups are Corona affected and we are doing nothing. But in about 2 months I hope to have everybody switched over.')
