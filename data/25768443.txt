Coming to work for a big company the only chance of getting a higher salary is to be above the union negotiated margin. The companies generally don&#x27;t really want you to get there and it can be really tough to negotiate this. You are really well protected and basically unfirable in union but there is a top margin to your salary. If outside the margin of union salaries you&#x27;re on your own with your own responsibilities. I really did not like working on a company that had a union as I&#x27;ve seen lots of people with zero motivation and nothing that a company could do about it.')
