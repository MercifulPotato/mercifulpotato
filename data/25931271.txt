You&#x27;re not creating new money</i><p>Nitpick. We have no evidence minimum wage increases are inflationary. (We have evidence it is not [1][2].) But something doesn&#x27;t have to create new money to be inflationary.<p>Increasing money velocity causes inflation as much as printing bills. The poor spend their dollars in the real economy (as opposed to the wealthy, who buy GameStock calls). That increases demand for those goods and services, which <i>can</i> result in a price spike.<p>Again, we don&#x27;t have evidence of this happening. But theoretically, it&#x27;s sound. (And less theoretically, it&#x27;s why central banks can print pots of money while still fighting deflation.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;36750&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_36750.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;36750&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_36750.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econstor.eu&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;10419&#x2F;20104&#x2F;1&#x2F;dp861.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econstor.eu&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;10419&#x2F;20104&#x2F;1&#x2F;dp861.pdf</a>')
