Siemens simply has no reason to care, so they don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they build an ICE or a Transrapid, it&#x27;s not like the DB could switch suppliers.\nThe problem in Germany is not to travel between major cities. The real issue is if you have to reach a city which is not big enough to be connected to the ICE network, since missing your connection often times means waiting for an hour.')
