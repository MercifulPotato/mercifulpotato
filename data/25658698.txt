I think it&#x27;s a bad proxy. Mostly because I&#x27;ve read and studied CLRS at school. And I don&#x27;t use the fun parts much in the wild. I&#x27;m also not expected to be able to recall things that you can look up.<p>One &#x27;slightly&#x27; shameful things I noted about myself reading that list of system design interview questions is that I actually don&#x27;t use most of those systems or know their features well enough. Other than YT of course.<p>I feel like the simpler interview process would be to just take a person and do a hand wavy system design interview. Then if they pass, hire em on probation for 2 months and slam them with work. They get paid, you maybe get a feel for them.<p>They sink or swim. You keep em&#x27; or toss em&#x27; away at the end of the two months.')
