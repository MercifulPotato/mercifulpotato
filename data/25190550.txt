There are <i>tons</i> of cultures in which child raising is communal. Including various parts of Western cultures at various times.<p>They&#x27;re not saying &quot;nuclear families suck.&quot; They&#x27;re saying, &quot;nuclear families are one approach among many which humanity uses to raise children, and it&#x27;s not necessarily always the best.&quot;<p>&#x27;Disrupt&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;Destroy&#x27;.<p>They also said &#x27;to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.&#x27; Meaning, IMHO, &#x27;folks should make their own choices for their own families.&#x27;<p>Considering how incredibly destructive slavery was to <i>any</i> form of family institution (father sold or killed, mother sold, child not, etc), and how that has echoed down to the present day in the black community, I can understand why black folks would want to have that discussion.<p>Which is not just a discussion being had by black people, either.<p>What exactly is your beef here?')
