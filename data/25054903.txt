The issue isn’t that pollsters couldn’t quantify the problem, it’s that they didn’t even realize the problem existed:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;shy-trump-voters-myth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;shy-trump-...</a><p>&gt; Trump voters are not liars. As a Democratic pollster and campaign strategist, I feel strange typing these words. But it is required to debunk the “shy Trump voter” myth.<p>This was written days before the election.<p>My post isn’t about “Shor’s personal HR problem.” It’s about a culture that caused very smart people to misperceive the facts on the ground, and misallocate funding as a result, in the middle of a high stakes situation.<p>People in Silicon Valley should understand better than anyone that culture matters and bears on organizational and institutional effectiveness.

Political polling, news, academia, and the like are areas where free discourse with respect to sensitive issues is particularly important for the effectiveness of the institution. This is less true if you’re running a food delivery business.')
