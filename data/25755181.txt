One that is painting the side you consider yourself to be a part of as morally clean and just, while the other side is reprehensible and shameless.<p>It has little to do with reality, and it&#x27;s obvious that you haven&#x27;t spent time with conservatives. It&#x27;s not useful to only learn about those who think differently from yourself by listening to what those who think like you say about them. Your perception seems heavily based on shrill far left voices. It&#x27;s essentially a mirror image of what somebody on the far-right thinks about progressives after hearing about what they do&#x2F;did&#x2F;want to do by listening to shrill far-right voices.')
