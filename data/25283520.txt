Culture is a software that controls what people do, and what their country becomes (to some significant extent).<p>For some purposes, such a culture is very restrictive and discontent-inducing.   But for other purposes, this culture might help you survive through long problems and dangerous situations that might kill off a people who believed in doing whatever you want and bailing when things get hard.  It really depends on the environment that it operates within -- this is not a statement that a particular culture is &quot;better&quot; in every case.<p>Side note, this is why, as a visitor to Japan, you get to enjoy all the benefits of seeing the examples of what discipline (and inflexibility) can bring -- but you would go crazy and not be happy if you had to live there.')
