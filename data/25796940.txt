Despite this blog post showing no sharing icons at all - they ARE sharing and now lying about it by not showing a single icon to reflect this sharing.<p>Oh wait, we need your phone number for 2FA? Sure. Bam - now you&#x27;ve given us permission to spam you! They lied about that.<p>Check out signal and get away from the lies. This blog post is such a good example of it, all the things not showing as not shared are probably SHARED! So despite EVERY icon saying nothing is shared, they no doubt are pumping your phone number over to Facebook family of companies.<p>They are trying to do the fake apple privacy label thing - but only including non-sharing labels, not the sharing labels.<p>Totally disgusting. I&#x27;m signing up to signal today and pushing hard for my network to switch.<p>Now if only signal used go or something lighter weight instead of a monster java stack they could probably scale a lot better.')
