Private citizens shouldn’t be shielded from privacy violation by hiding behind the plausible deniability of no DKIM verification. The communications of public officials should be subject to traceability and authentication as having actually come from them, even if they have gone rogue and used non-government-approved communication channels. If corruption is suspected because communications are discovered on the receiving end, say at a company that gets audited or something, it should be simple for investigators to verify the authenticity of those emails. Establishing ownership of the sending email address is another issue, but I imagine that’s possible via regular investigative routes.<p>This has nothing to do with “blackmailing public officials” and for you to imply that I have such a desire is both uncivil of you to say here and says a lot about your world view. Blackmail is when you use evidence of illegal activity in order to coerce someone to do something against their will. Transparency and audit ability of our public servants is not blackmail.')
