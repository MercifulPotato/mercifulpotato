But if you have a fixed amount of time to compute the answer (such as 1 screen refresh interval,) you can run the CPU slower so the efficient language finishes at the same time. CPUs get more energy efficient at lower speeds. For a given process, energy&#x2F;op is roughly linear with clock speed.<p>So if you have a fixed deadline, a 2x efficient language can save you 4x the power.')
