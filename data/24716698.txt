Electric planes will fly higher and thus have far less of a sonic boom problem. Even some shorter range over the ocean routes are possible.<p>Battery technology is improving fast and electric planes have inherent operational cost advantages.<p>I also think Starship without a first stage can compete in this already not very big market and with a first stage they can do routes that would be impossible for Overture.<p>Boom often compares itself to SpaceX, but I don&#x27;t know if you can replicate SpaceX in the air domain. Space was much less sophisticated and much less commercial. And as I said, SpaceX is now going after the same market with rocket technology, so the difference between air and space domain is shrinking.<p>I wish them luck but who knows if any of these are gone work out anytime soon.')
