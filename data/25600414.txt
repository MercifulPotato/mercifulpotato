It almost <i>looks</i> like part numbers with the pattern (at first glance).<p>As this calculator is 20+ years older than me, can someone enlighten me as to why the dates would be like that? The only thing I can think of is that the manufacturing runs were done sequentially instead of all at once. Was that a common thing for ASICs back then?<p>I’m also curious why calculators were such a common thing then, yet they still cost over $1000 (in today’s money). I get it makes calculations quicker, but $1000 just seems excessive. Was it just the cost of manufacturing justified by the cost savings (in time) for businesses who bought them?')
