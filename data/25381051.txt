Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=[25381897], score=None, time=1607648765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380796, text='&gt;But I donâ€™t think the goal should be to attack 230, but a desired goal would be stop platforms like Twitter and Facebook and YouTube to stop acting like a publisher. They are simply abusing 230 privileges while still acting like a publisher with editorial muscle.<p>The term &quot;publisher&quot; has no <i>legal</i> meaning in the context of section 230.<p>I (and at least a half-dozen other folks) have explained this <i>repeatedly</i> in this discussion.<p>I won&#x27;t do so again, but in the interest of expanding knowledge, I&#x27;ll point you over here[0] so you can understand the deal as it stands.<p>If you (or anyone else) would like to see changes to Section 230, that&#x27;s perfectly fine with me.  I suggest you write your congressperson&#x2F;senators and demand the changes for which you advocate.<p>That said, what you are describing is not the law <i>as it is now</i>.  Whether you (or I for that matter) agree or disagree, that&#x27;s irrelevant to current jurisprudence.<p>But we have ways to change our laws and we should take advantage of them where we feel it appropriate.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello...</a>')
