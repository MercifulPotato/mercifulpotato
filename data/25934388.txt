People seem to loose perspective. In the U.S. we have lost 1 out of 750 people to covid, mostly older and mostly with comorbidities. I assume this number will increase to 1 out of 500 when this is finished. Many countries are in this same range.<p>From a personal perspective it is a tragedy to lose someone close to you. From a population perspective this is not as big as deal as some people make it out to be.')
