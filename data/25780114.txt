The white collar&#x2F;upper class is doing just fine, hasn&#x27;t been laid off, and has been minimally affected by COVID. This group is also responsible for most of our economic output - which is turn driving a disconnected wallstreet.<p>The lower&#x2F;working class has been completely obliterated. Though these people represent a larger chuck of the population their economic output is less impactful. In other words, Wallstreet is unaffected by bunch of unemployed service people. It&#x27;s no wonder these people are angry and rallying behind a psudo-fascist like Trump.  We need to do something about these inequality issues, otherwise we&#x27;re on a slippery slope.')
