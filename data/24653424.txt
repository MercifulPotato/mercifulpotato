I&#x27;ve also worked in cloud infrastructure such as software defined networking, object storage, etc.<p>I&#x27;m looking to join a team with smart, friendly people who want to tackle interesting or hard problems in areas under-served by technology or to make technology itself better. I&#x27;d prefer to join a team with a strong IC career track that&#x27;s on par with the management path. I believe strongly in reliability, understanding, diversity, and generating value for users.<p>I enjoy functional programming, formal methods, teaching, and mentoring. I live-code my side projects on twitch where I&#x27;m presently building a key-value database from scratch in Haskell to learn about its memory management capabilities, application architectures, and patterns. I have experience in distributed systems, systems programming, and have even done some game programming for fun.<p>If you&#x27;d like to see my resume and chat send me an email and tell me about yourself and your company.<p>Cheers, have a nice day!')
