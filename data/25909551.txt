I grew up in the boonies, spent loads of time outdoors, had no video games until I was in high school, and was allowed very little TV time.<p>I still needed glasses by 2nd grade and finally leveled out somewhere around the -8.50 range in my mid-late 30s.  Hasn&#x27;t really gotten too much worse as I got older, but as a lovely side note, I&#x27;m in my early 40s now and am getting the slightest bit of trouble on the other end of the spectrum where I can&#x27;t always focus on small, close-up things if I have my glasses on.  Guess it&#x27;ll be time for bifocals soon.')
