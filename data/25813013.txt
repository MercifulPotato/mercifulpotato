And instead of thanking and trying to integrate (and understand) the way you live in your home, these people start thinking that they own your home and YOU should be the one who should be tolerant of their actions.<p>You even cook food for them and provide them a safe space. They insist on getting particular cuisines and criticize you for being closed-minded if you don&#x27;t know how to cook individual dishes. They find books in your home which do not align with their thought bubble, so they start tearing them (or burning them). They find rooms which they find do not follow the &quot;correct&quot; architectural patterns, so they proceed to &quot;renovate&quot; your rooms and windows. They see your taste in art absurd, so they take markers and start scribbling over the paintings on the wall. They start forcing you and your relatives to do a particular set of actions because, according to them, that&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; way to live.<p>What&#x2F;When will be your tipping point? (if any).<p>Contrast this to a situation where those people realise the rules of the house, and just change themselves to integrate and live peacefully or realise the failure in doing so and just leave.<p>Will you think that the rules in living my house are somehow &quot;superior&quot; ? Of course no. These are just some set of rules and ideals which makes the most sense for you. There is no value proposition on the superiority of one rule being better than another. Just whatever works for YOU.')
