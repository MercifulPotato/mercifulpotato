But it&#x27;s also likely to slow down innovation or even kill it in its tracks. Maybe a producer wants to mix up the ingredients because they&#x27;re making a substandard product. But maybe they discovered a way to deliver higher quality or lower price with an iteration on the original. In the long run, consumers will mostly discover the shitty products and stop buying them anyway.<p>For example if such a law was in place for desktop computers, it almost assuredly would have required x86-compatible CPUs. It&#x27;s highly unlikely that Apple would made the investment to produce the incredible gains in the M1, if it was forced to market the MacBook Air as &quot;not legally a laptop&quot;')
