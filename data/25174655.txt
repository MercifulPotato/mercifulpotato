Sometimes it’s easier to just keep using what you already have. What I do have a problem with is when the antiquated computer systems make an entire country’s banking sector move glacially. ACH is <i>so</i> slow, and other countries (EU especially) have payment systems like SEPA and Faster Payments which are universally used, and clear pretty much instantly. I don’t know why the US doesn’t have something like this (I believe the fed is working on it), but it’s definitely created the room for the myriad of p2p payment apps like cash app and Venmo in the US, which really need not exist in a more developed banking system.')
