They differ primarily in that <i>Fire</i> has a hand-wavy way of allowing for impossible technology like FTL.<p>Personally, I think <i>Deepness</i> is the better work, but <i>Fire</i> is pretty good too. If you read <i>Deepness</i> first then, because it was written second, at least one character may seem a little off for reasons that will become obvious.<p>[0] The characters we follow the most are human anyway.')
