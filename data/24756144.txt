If 50% of your yearly car ownership costs stem from gas and other variable costs then &quot;paying for the 95%&quot; is a strawman since the variable costs won&#x27;t decrease by renting a car (and in fact are often many times higher), so you can only reduce your total costs by at most a 2x factor.')
