While you may not have intended it to be, this question is more philosophical than technical.  Extended conversations I&#x27;ve had on this topic eventually drift toward subjects like the Ship of Theseus [0] and essential vs accidental properties [1].  For the sake of conversation, lets say your preferred distro is Fedora.  If you replace Fedora&#x27;s web browser with one from Arch, are you still running Fedora?  What if you replace the kernel with one from another distro?  And the init?  Are you still running Fedora if you swap out every single file that is unique to Fedora?<p>Bedrock does not currently support being &quot;uninstalled&quot;; it has to be formatted over, like traditional distros.  This is for two reasons: (1) I currently have no way of ensuring any one slice of the system is functionally complete such that removing the rest of the system would leave something bootable.  (2) I don&#x27;t want to advertise support for something active Bedrock users do not themselves regularly exercise, and by its very definition active Bedrock users won&#x27;t uninstall Bedrock.  In theory with enough effort Bedrock could be made uninstal-able, but I don&#x27;t plan on investing effort there.  If a user is interested in testing Bedrock out, I recommend using a VM or spare machine.<p>In every other workflow I can think of, Bedrock can functionally mimic being an alternative packaging system on top of whatever it supports.  You can get most of your system - including the install process - from some distro, then use Bedrock to get features from other distros in a way that &quot;feels&quot; like it is &quot;on top&quot; of your original distro.  Whether it <i>is</i> &quot;on top&quot; is a matter of semantics rather than practice.<p>With the next major release (0.8) I plan on supporting running Bedrock in something akin to a container.  This would let users uninstall it and be less ambiguously &quot;on top&quot; of a traditional distro, but come at the expense of not integrating with the host environment.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ship_of_Theseus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ship_of_Theseus</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;essential-accidental&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;essential-accidental&#x2F;</a>')
