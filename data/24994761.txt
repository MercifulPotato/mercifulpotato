I fell for the nvidia hate because of its propritory drivers so upgraded with an AMD Ryzen Apu instead of just getting a new nvidia graphics card. It&#x27;s not even a recent APU it&#x27;s almost 1+ years old. Now I am still using the my nvidia card as the Ryzen Apu can&#x27;t output 4k and need to upgrade my graphics card anyway.')
