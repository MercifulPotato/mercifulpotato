There are nuances that go into writing browser interaction tests that the less-experienced will have to work through.<p>2. There&#x27;s a weird functionality implemented in such a way that makes testing difficult. This could be something like a modal that has a fly-in animation and if you try to click it while it&#x27;s animated it won&#x27;t fire the onClick action.<p>If you want e2e tests to be successful, you have to write testable front end code, which is pretty dang hard for a lot of reasons.')
