I hope someone else has good advice around this. I&#x27;m in a similar situation. I used to love this field so much but I&#x27;m finding myself disenchanted with it this year.<p>Last year I started a company that crashed and burned. That was a pretty painful process but one that was ultimately worth it I think. I&#x27;m still kind of recovering from it but I&#x27;ll try it again and don&#x27;t feel too burned out in that respect.<p>When I came back to the field after the failure of the company I found that I had an even easier time finding jobs. Higher paying jobs even. But I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t enjoy the work. It&#x27;s more &quot;senior&quot; and just so many more meetings and so much less doing anything that feels useful or interesting.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about trying to step back down to more technical and fun roles. That might wind up being a money hit but might actually be worth it at this point if I can go back to writing code.<p>I&#x27;ve also thought about trying to move into a different field. VR is one that is really compelling to me. It&#x27;s still part of &quot;tech&quot; but feels new and untamed in the way that tech used to. This field used to feel like blazing a trail and lately it has felt more like an arbitrary part of business, like accounting or something. Even if my perspective is warped and it hasn&#x27;t happened yet - it&#x27;s bound to happen someday. It&#x27;s not even a bad thing. But what I loved about this field in the early days was the sense of adventure and rebellion. Nobody knew what was going on and it felt like there was a lot of opportunity for creativity. Now it feels more like implementing a bunch of boring standards made up by other people.<p>I feel jaded about it and I&#x27;ve considered that might be the issue too. I came off the biggest failure of my life into covid when I thought I was going to be taking 2020 to get back to normal and regroup. It could be that this year just kind of sucks and I&#x27;ll go back to loving tech when the world gets back to normal a bit.<p>Hard to say. In any case I&#x27;ll be keeping my eye on this thread for anybody that has advice or has been through a similar experience.')
