I&#x27;m not saying you won&#x27;t find kids like that everywhere, but generally, the higher the income of the parents (up to a point), the likelier the parents are to have taught their kids to value education and other things that will help them succeed.<p>And so to maximize this probability, people stretch themselves to live in neighborhoods bidding against other people also stretching themselves to live in the &quot;best&quot; neighborhood they can afford.<p>I teach my kids that it might be a poor ROI to work for material stuff, but I do teach them the importance of wealth in being able to obtain resources in the future.')
