It is common to type 1-2 passwors into a computer to before getting to the browser, so why isn&#x27;t a trusted device a reasonable threat model?<p>I think it is a personally reasonable threat model to consider anyone capable of stealing a token off of my device as capable of stealing my password because if a website has other vulnerabilities allowing credentials to be stolen or misused without my device being compromised then it is a defense in depth technique and it is to cover the ass of the website operator and not me. I shouldn&#x27;t be liable for a website owner&#x27;s screw up there.<p>Now, a genuine two factor authentication changes the picture there and actually adds some security for ultra risky scenarios (like transferring money). But instead of invalidating my session, just ask for a token on every risky transaction. There I can understand a bank wanting to cover their liability a bit more.')
