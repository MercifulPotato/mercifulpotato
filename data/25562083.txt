Buttplug <i>only</i> cares about accessing hardware, so while it may sound like a cop-out, our security model is &quot;whatever the hardware gives us&quot;. Multi-user control systems would be built on top of the library, and that&#x27;s where a good bit of the security work would happen.<p>That said, there are some security&#x2F;privacy features built into the architecture to reduce metadata dissemination, I&#x27;ll be outlining those in the developer guide at some point.')
