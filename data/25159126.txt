I wasn&#x27;t very succesful at it. Nobody offered me $1000&#x2F;hr) most of the jobs were very small and there was a surprising amount of overhead between getting different jobs (maybe not that surprising, i was probably just naive). Decently big $$$&#x2F;hr translated to less than i thought it would in practise.<p>&gt; Maintainers can handle this problem however they like, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for someone who&#x27;s not getting paid<p>What exactly are you feeling sorry for, and would $$$ alleviate the issue? People don&#x27;t go into open source software to become millionaires, and money will not fix burnout.<p>&gt; with the bonus that the expectation to do other people&#x27;s shit for free is gone.<p>People will always try to get you to do shit for free, even if its a paid project by a company. Not being paid at least means you can tell off the people you don&#x27;t like really easily.')
