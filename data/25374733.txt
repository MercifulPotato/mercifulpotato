I bought an oculus CV1 used on ebay a few years ago when there was a lull in demand.  It&#x27;s fun, but the second they demand a facebook login it permanently goes on the shelf.  Rather unfortunate, but hey maybe one day VR toys will be accessible to non-elites without having to buy into a cyberpunk dystopia (ie if a more benevolent competitor releases cheaper hardware).')
