Item(by='nucleardog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608627715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25503477, text='&gt; Reason: You still have to type it sometimes. Like on a device you don&#x27;t have the password manager on.<p>Assuming a standard typeable character set (letters upper&#x2F;lower, numbers, symbols you can type on a standard US keyboard), you&#x27;ve got 92 characters. (Safe assumption given you&#x27;re planning on typing this on all sorts of devices.)<p>Your randomized eight character password has 52 bits of entropy. Twelve characters takes it it to 78 bits. Not really enough if you&#x27;re up against an offline attack.<p>Assuming you choose 5 random English words (which will probably take you about two seconds to type on something like a phone), you&#x27;ll have a more secure password.<p>I agree typing on devices that don&#x27;t have your password manager is annoying, but in my experience it _really_ doesn&#x27;t come up that often. Yours is the exact reason I use 32 character passwords rather than the 64&#x2F;128&#x2F;etc some people I know use.<p>But 12 is.. short. The trade-off between the added security and the inconvenience makes it a pretty obvious choice for me. (And you&#x27;re wrong--having a database dump full of password hashes does not &quot;already owning that site&quot; make.)<p>Typing 32 characters on a game console to log into Netflix taking an extra minute every few years is really not that inconvenient relative to the added security. And it&#x27;s something like 2^130 times more secure than your 12 character password for the inconvenience it brings. Or about 1,361,129,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times (I can&#x27;t actually find the SI prefix for how big this is) stronger.')
