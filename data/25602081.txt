Item(by='mkl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609494715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601741, text='&gt; - Google search results will start becoming way better and super personalised as their data efforts start showing results<p>This one is very surprising to me.  I think Google&#x27;s results have been getting worse for me every year for a long time.  They used to supposedly have the goal of getting people off the search page as quickly as possible, but it seems to me their recent data efforts have the goal of making people spend more time on search pages where they can see and click on ads.  I.e. worse search results, caused by ignoring search terms and showing unrelated things instead.  Why would 2021 be any different?')
