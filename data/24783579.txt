Item(by='floatrock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602723441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24780301, text='&gt; Three lives is pretty challenging on larger fields with lots of unavoidable guess by the way<p>Agreed. On boards like Flower where there&#x27;s a long thin strip of tiles, it&#x27;s very easy to get to a point where it&#x27;s pretty much a 50&#x2F;50 guess, no way to logic out of it.<p>I like the idea of the unique board shapes, but if there&#x27;s no practical way to win because you just keep hitting wall after wall of 50&#x2F;50, well, that kinda takes the fun out of it.<p>Maybe need to think beyond classic minesweeper mechanics for a way around this to keep it interesting?')
