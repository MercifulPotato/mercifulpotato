And maybe writing them gives me better recall than typing and maybe it doesn&#x27;t.<p>But, yeah. I rake notes to remember things I need to do, to capture some key points, or to be able to &quot;play back&quot; a meeting&#x2F;talk&#x2F;etc. to others in either verbal or written form. This is one reason I usually type notes for anything that I&#x27;ll want to play back in any detail; it&#x27;s faster and easier to capture more or less verbatim than writing notes by hand. To the degree that recall is helped, I find it&#x27;s mostly by &quot;processing&quot; the notes in some form.')
