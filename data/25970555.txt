If all Texas cars, or 9 million, were Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), the wind turbines (at the 20,000MW rate) would end up supplying 46% of the electricity to those cars if they plugged in last night.<p>Now, last night was exceptionally windy.  However, wind turbines generation is growing by about 10-20% annually.  Accordingly, in a few years 20,000 MW overnight wind generation will become the Texas median production rate or even will fall among the lower percentiles of production.<p>The article that the NY Times references [2] shows how the 100% electric fleet demand compares to the current daily load profiles in Texas and California.  The Texas grid, as depicted, shows a peak at 3PM -- for now.  However, if there were 100% EVs, that peak would shift to 3AM.  Then, in addition to the typically abundant wind energy, natural gas (peaked) generators could come online to easily deliver more power.<p>Something like 60-70% of Texas daily wind generation occurs between 9PM and 9AM, because of the diurnal wind patterns.  This means that the usually strong nightly winds allows Texas to outproduce electricity at 3AM as compared to 3PM.<p>In contrast to the habits of California EV drivers, Texas drivers get 80-90% of their annual charge needs by plugging in overnight at their homes. So, the Texas grid is uniquely suited to host a rapidly growing EV fleet.<p>[EDIT] 9,000 MW would provide 1 kWh for 10 hrs for each car of 9,000,000 EV cars to get 30+ miles of range. So, yeah, last night the Texas grid could accommodate <i>all of them</i>.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ercot.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;cdr&#x2F;html&#x2F;CURRENT_DAYCOP_HSL.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ercot.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;cdr&#x2F;html&#x2F;CURRENT_DAYCOP_HSL.htm...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;switching-to-electric-vehicles-could-save-the-us-billions-but-timing-is-everything-106227" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;switching-to-electric-vehicles-c...</a>')
