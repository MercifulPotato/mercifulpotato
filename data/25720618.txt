For me, my biggest input issue is the lack of customisation around trackpad deadzones, i.e. the 15% or so deadzone on the left and right of the trackpad. My trackpad is exactly in the center of my laptop but my palm is usually offset slightly to the left. This means my first interaction with the trackpad often happens in this deadzone area on the left-hand side of the trackpad, so no input gets registered until I lift my finger and &quot;enter&quot; it more towards the center.<p>There are a huge variety of laptops with different size trackpads, different positions, varying levels of palm rejection etc but there&#x27;s zero customisability around this seemingly simple behaviour.<p>My Windows dualboot has no such issue and macOS of course (using a MacBook) works fantastically without this limitations.')
