I&#x27;ve just always assumed most of the people in crypto worked together to build a better product which seems to be constantly under attack from governments. This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen one group call out another group simply because they didn&#x27;t do it &quot;the FB way&quot;?<p>Is this just some healthy competition between two competing products or is FB actively trying to undermine Telegram&#x27;s product??')
