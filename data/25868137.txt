Would more frequent samples would provide a better signal?<p>For example, perhaps the read errors number increases about once a week.  But in the week before a failure, it increases once a day.  Or in the day before a failure, it increases once an hour.<p>OS-level metrics could also be predictive: write latency, i&#x2F;o queue length, communication errors, and checksum errors in read data.')
