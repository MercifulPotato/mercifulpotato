Even though I actually saw how well it worked, I somehow had no faith in the technology as it seemed like a toy due to the hopelessly slow processors we had at the time. I did implement back propagation on a Connection Machine CM2 but found it too complex and ultimately wound up running my code on a bunch of IBM RS 6000 workstations instead.')
