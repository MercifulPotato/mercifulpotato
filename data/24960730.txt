Need to update the URL to the outlook API because microsoft is changing it every now and then? Need to send a new icon&#x2F;logo because reasons and the client doesn&#x27;t know how to update an icon himself?<p>These are dumb things that can be easily sorted out.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s super risky because you don&#x27;t control the environment of the client (dude can&#x27;t open a firewall port to make the application work, security department needs 3 weeks of ticket to open the firewall). One unlucky client and you will be in a world of pain.<p>I think the OP is working on small projects of a reasonable nature&#x2F;domain or he would have learned the hard way to not promise upfront. (Well, it&#x27;s possible to do and thrive, never getting burned by a dysfunctional client)<p>Benefits: You can double the project price to factor in the bugfixing&#x2F;maintenance included. The client is okay with it because it comes as a great deal, project and maintenance guaranteed. The only reason to work per project as a consultant is to bill wayyy more, because you take on more risk, gotta manage the quality the scope and the client tightly.')
