More often, the window moves based on a much more complex and dynamic phenomenon, one that is not easily controlled from on high: the slow evolution of societal values and norms.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a description of why politicians will advocate for some policies; it&#x27;s not a theory of change. (Such a theory would be unevidenced and obviously false).<p>The quote says &quot;rare&quot;, but i&#x27;d say, &quot;essentially never&quot;. The &quot;slow evolution&quot; is also not really of norms.  The public do not &quot;Accept&quot; ideas within some &quot;Window&quot; that you move by &quot;Advocacy&quot;.<p>Almost all &quot;beliefs&quot; are grounded in technological, incentive, preference and practice structures. They are symptoms of much larger mechanistic forces that regulate behaviour (, belief, etc.).<p>The significant majority of &quot;belief change&quot; is caused by technological and economic change.')
