The TPMS light came on one day and inflating tires didn&#x27;t help - I used the reader and found that one sensor&#x27;s ID had changed. When I compared the ID (it was in hex) to the last programming - it was a single bit off. I couldn&#x27;t reprogram the sensor itself, but I was able to update the ECU with the changed ID using the ATEQ.<p>I live in Denver but spend a lot of time skiing around 11k feet, maybe the higher elevation means more radiation.')
