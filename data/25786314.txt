Now, arguably more so than back in 2016, technology is playing an ever larger role in how we interact with one another.  I fail to see how not acknowledging and discussing that is going to help anything.<p>In short, good luck sticking your head in the sand.  If you ignore it, things won&#x27;t get better.  And you&#x27;re free to not read any of links or the comments at any time.')
