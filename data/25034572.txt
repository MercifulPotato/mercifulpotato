The stock market is fundamentally a long bet (if you want to short the entire market you invest in things outside it).  Of course the market is exited at the long term prospects of that.<p>Also, you&#x27;re being a little disingenuous when yo say &quot;These are the same markets that cheer when job cuts and redundancies are announced.&quot;  When one under-performing company cuts jobs it tends to go up because costs are decreased.  When a well performing company announces a mass layoff it tends to be a toss up because signals are mixed.  When a ton of companies announce layoffs the market tanks because the signal being sent is things are getting worse all around.  You&#x27;re comparing a positive reaction to a single entity event (company announces layoffs) to a positive reaction for a market wide event (potential for covid to become less of a burden on the economy as a whole).  You can&#x27;t cross compare as if they&#x27;re 1:1 like that.')
