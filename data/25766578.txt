I wanted to have client contact and also contact with potential suppliers&#x2F;business partners.\nAt one of our business partners back then, I met a guy who brought last year up to 200k of business for me. \nThat was 5 years ago and we are friends since then, working together since 2 years.<p>So long-term relations are key. And patience. When I first met him he was just a great drinking buddy with whom I could talk about politics :P')
