Item(by='selykg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611755544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927995, text='&gt; I ordered a couple accessory boards off Amazon, a high precision ADC and a real time clock. Both were fakes. They had swapped out chips with lower grade components. When I ordered from Adafruit I got the real things.<p>sort of off topic, but, I never buy anything from Amazon anymore unless it&#x27;s a last resort. The convenience is no longer there if I end up having to send stuff back due to it being fake or damaged in shipping (particularly books that are put in large boxes with no packing material, which is sucky given Amazon used to be the primary way I&#x27;d buy books).<p>I&#x27;m excited to give MicroPython a try with the new Raspberry Pi 2040 microcontroller. I have a couple project ideas lined up and really looking forward to getting into this space a little as a hobby.')
