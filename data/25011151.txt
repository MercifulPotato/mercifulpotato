Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604696823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003736, text='&gt; The above article is from Australia, but the manual is used internationally so I&#x27;m assuming it would be the same for the US:<p>As with all legal topics, not a good assumption.<p>&gt; Essentially once they have court approval and know where the wallet is - hard drive, USB drive, digital wallet. They will confiscate the wallet (similar to physical property seizures from a drug dealer) then just transfer the BTC to an account or wallet they control.<p>You know this requires them having access to the private key. There is no &quot;just transfer the BTC&quot;, there isn&#x27;t even a guarantee that they are the only custodians of it as the wallet itself can be replicated and the &quot;physical location&quot; being in many places at once. There is no way of disproving that, only assuming based on most people&#x27;s poor operational security.')
