The contribution to spacetime curvature the ball&#x27;s mass brings to the table is <i>extremely</i> small compared to that of the earth, and the contribution that comes from the (massless) photon&#x27;s energy[0] is smaller still, but they both influence the spacetime curvature.<p>[0] Photons bend spacetime according to GR, although as far as I know this has not been proven experimentally. We&#x27;ll probably need a theory of quantum gravity to be sure.')
