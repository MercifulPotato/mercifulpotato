At the extreme end you have a corporation that owns all the land in your nation and you have to abide by their arbitrary rules to be on their private property. Yes, they cannot physically assault you the way a government can, but you may be left with few options but to sign a contract you may otherwise not have wanted to sign (and then the government can physically assault you for breaking that contract).<p>We are sort of approaching a standard argument between classical and modern liberals, so it would be pointless to just repeat the same tired arguments. Having said that, I would love to see more of thoughtful debate between classical and modern liberals. Usually you tend to see both sides just preaching to their choirs or a very shallow debate at best.')
