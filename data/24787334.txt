We now know that there were people that, if they had followed protocol, would have taken that extra step to nuclear deployment. The only reason they didn&#x27;t is sheer, dumb luck.<p>If the lessons we learn from history are to deify the actions of men like Reagan, then I truly hope that we have more of that luck in our future.')
