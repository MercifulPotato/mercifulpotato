Obviously that&#x27;s not how Amazon interprets it, but I wonder if the courts should interpret it that way: if you say buy, and pay a greater cost to buy it, they you should have it as an asset. Of course, what does having it as an asset mean now? I personally think movies from Amazon should be downloadable, but then how do they prevent piracy.')
