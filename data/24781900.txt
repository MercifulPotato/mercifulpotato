I cook for them (I don&#x27;t mind unsalted food myself). I think I understand a thing or two about such a drastic change to one&#x27;s lifestyle. It&#x27;s not an easy thing. My relative was mad for everything salty - cheese, cured meats, chips, everything. But they have found the discipline to cut it all off. Unfortunately, cutting salt from one&#x27;s diet doesn&#x27;t bring kidney disease into remission. I don&#x27;t believe anything does :&#x2F; Anyway, more power to you and all that.')
