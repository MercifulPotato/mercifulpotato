Yes, they do test negative when PCR can return positive, but (according to the doctor there) the PCR can often return positive when the person is no longer infectious.\n    * at-home tests could easily be produced now (with some government investment) for a couple of bucks apiece (possibly even less). The low price would allow the government to send some number of these to each household and suggest that they self-test twice a week which would be enough to catch people during the actual infectious period.</code></pre>')
