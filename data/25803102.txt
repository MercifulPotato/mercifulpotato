It&#x27;s almost impossible to diagnose ANY internet problems (not related to your own equipment of course) and the ISP has tools and access to do it. In any case, it&#x27;s much easier and faster to contact support.<p>In my experience, even if I discover what is the problem, if it&#x27;s on their side I still have to go through support to get it fixed, so I just wasted my time. And in most cases the lowest level of support doesn&#x27;t even write down the information I give in the ticket, even if I send an email.')
