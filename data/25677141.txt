I was kind of the one and only person in my Signal contacts then. Most people didn&#x27;t understand why I left WhatsApp and convincing didn&#x27;t really help. By the time more and more people started to use Signal too so today I miss no one. I think the topic behind it is way deeper than the technical stuff or which app to use. Use what you are confident of. Important people will use whatever is available to stay in touch with you, because communication is not about technology but about relationship. Thats why there is no point in convincing people to switch the app. That happens by time, or not.')
