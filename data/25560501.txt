The point of a &quot;graph database&quot; in the more general sense is simply to be a database that uses a graph paradigm.<p>This is a silly pedantic point to make, but it is not necessarily trivial. E.g. it may be the case that a particular use-case scneario does not require massive efficiency, and has a lot to gain from the simplicity of sqlite. In which case this kind of project is an amazing thing to exist.<p>And if there is a way to get a valid benchmark comparison against a more traditional &quot;efficient&quot; graph database, then informed decisions can be made.<p>As a personal anecdote, a friend and I based a graph-based project on neo4j and were very happy ... until it was time to deploy. We then realised the installations involved were highly complex, rarely supported on traditional webhosts, and costs involved for adopting &#x27;formal&#x27; commercial solutions were highly prohibitive. Had we known about this project at the time we would have definitely used it instead (at least as a proof of concept; you can always switch to a more efficient database later if you really have to)')
