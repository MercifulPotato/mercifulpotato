And reading about ActiveRecord at that time I also had the feeling that its authors had worked with EOF before.<p>All in all, NeXT built great stuff. I still own a NeXTstation Color that I got in 1992 (one of these days I should try to turn it on again). And it&#x27;s a testament to the quality of that software that some pieces that I&#x27;m still running today, like Apple Mail, trace back almost directly to tools I started using back then (NeXTMail).')
