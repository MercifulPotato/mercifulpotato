The drill went into thermal cut out and wouldn&#x27;t budge. I was at a loss of how to get the bit out without destroying the stud until I remembered I had a hand drill in the shop. It came from my great-grandfather. It&#x27;s solid and well maintained and I was able to hand crank that drill bit through the rest of the wood. That&#x27;s not the first time a simple hand tool has saved the day when a power tool let me down.<p>I agree that IDEs and the tools that accompany them are powerful and can make you more productive. Learning them is an investment that can pay dividends. On the other hand, most of the IDEs I took the time to learn in school are now obsolete. I still use the shell today because those skills are still relevant and have gotten me out of a jam plenty of times. I&#x27;ve chosen to prioritize learning tools that are reliable and lasting even if it costs me some productivity.')
