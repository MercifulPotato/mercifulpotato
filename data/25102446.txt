An end-user expecting free support for open source software is a jerk.<p>2.) A project maintainer expecting people to pay to submit <i>actual</i> bug reports is a jerk. bug report != support. You don&#x27;t have to act on each bug report, but it&#x27;s laughable to suggest that a bug report is a support request.<p>Support requests are requests for help in implementing or configuring something. Perhaps asking for an additional feature. A bug report is letting you know your code is broken.<p>3.) Miss me with the whole &quot;I write open source software to solve my problem&quot; attitude. That&#x27;s why you write software. You open source it to so that others can use it. Some authors open source stuff to pad resumes, some to better the community, and some to stroke their own ego. But by publishing and open sourcing your software, the author implicitly broadens the scope beyond their own problem.<p>---<p>Reading that screed, I could feel the entitlement and ego dripping from the page. The author mentions the cost of a webserver. If the cost of a simple webserver is such a drain on your resources, then don&#x27;t self-host. There&#x27;s places to host open source projects for free.<p>The author made a choice to open source their software and self-host. That&#x27;s a nice, egalitarian thing to do. But telling someone they have to pay to help you fix your broken code is... something else.')
