The bike -Rodillo- Has been out of stock for several weeks.<p>While coding it it was briefly on stock but I was too slow with my card input hahaha and so I neeed to now automate the buy part as soon as it&#x27;s available, or make that run every 5min and mail&#x2F;notify me if available...<p>Btw this was super easy, playwright as a puppeteer successor really rocks, another thing hard to hate from MS like TS or VS Code<p>PS: I brought down script execcution from 7 secocnds to 2 seocnds, by not loading any unneeded stuff css images external js fonts.<p>I felt like a good scraper citizen doing so, it was just two linnes to block by request type on the network level, and it worked like a charm to speed up the process.')
