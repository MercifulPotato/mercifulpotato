On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen people on skilled visa who never actually worked a day in their nominated occupation.<p>My previous comment is more related to the fact that some migrants that follow the rules, may suffer from the fact that other migrants don&#x27;t - for example at first my wife could not join me in Australia, because she comes from a country which had a high number of irregular applications in the past and for this reason that country is now considered &quot;higher risk&quot;.<p>For this reason, many migrants are actually in favour of stricter regulations.<p>This fact is often not evident if you&#x27;re not a migrant yourself, that&#x27;s why I wanted to bring it up.')
