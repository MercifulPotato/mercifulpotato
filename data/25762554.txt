This indeed caps the length of possible games.<p>The threefold repetition rule doesn&#x27;t have an equivalent (there&#x27;s no, say, &quot;fivefold repetition&quot; draw that could be enforced despite the players&#x27; will), but it&#x27;s really irrelevant from the perspective of solving chess, because there&#x27;s no point in analyzing what happens if game goes through the same loop 1, 10 or 100 times.<p>And the 75-move rule sets a hard limit anyway, so you couldn&#x27;t loop infinitely, even if it mattered.')
