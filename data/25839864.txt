In this article [1], Greg Nuckols describes how, intuitively, the standard deviation increases with the average size of a measure of strength [2], which suggests that otherwise significant changes in small lifts could get overshadowed by statistical noise in the big lifts, so it would make more sense to analyze the effect sizes for individual exercises.  The relevant part is under  The whole article is also a fun read to get a sense for the statistical&#x2F;experimental design considerations in exercise science, and looking at research results with a critical eye.<p>[1]Improbable Data Patterns in the Work of Barbalho et al: An Explainer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongerbyscience.com&#x2F;barbalho&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongerbyscience.com&#x2F;barbalho&#x2F;</a><p>[2] The relevant graph - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongerbyscience.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;image18.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongerbyscience.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07...</a>')
