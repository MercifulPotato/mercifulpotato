Item(by='mdifrgechd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606071911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179379, text='I think part of the tension is that advertising (and other data harvesting) attempts to monetize content that has virtually zero value for a lot of people: take any of the articles on a typical HN front page - right now the top two are &quot;Booting from a vinyl record&quot; and &quot;Exotic programming ideas&quot;. These sound interesting (and are already somewhat well targeted to me as a HN reader), but the content is still worth almost nothing to me if I have to sign up for something or watch an ad to view it. Now apply the same reasoning to most web content that I value even less, like random medium articles or Forbes techcrunch or something that are pretty much designed just to get people to  click on them. Most  internet content that we are considering here is just there to get you to look at ads, and so ironically not worth &quot;paying&quot; for in any way for most people.<p>So ad blocking puts the user in a funny position. It let&#x27;s them continue to look at things they don&#x27;t value much. And I think content creaters looking for views probably would rather complain about ad blockers than give users an ultimatum that could result in them just going somewhere else.')
