That would both slow me down and give me torque to accelerate around the corner. The transmission can&#x27;t see. So I will have to brake quite solidly to burn off my speed, wasting energy.<p>And so on. I used to love those twisty mountain roads when I had my SAAB and 5 gears. Now my automatic Merc isn&#x27;t anywhere near as much fun.')
