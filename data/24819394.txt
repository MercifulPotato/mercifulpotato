Sometimes military&#x2F;defense applications is one of the best ways to guarantee funding. DARPA is even considered &quot;defense&quot; because it was decided that something like &quot;those damn commies&quot; being first to orbit a satellite happening again was unacceptable, and a technological lead was deemed a critical cornerstone of the United State&#x27;s national defense strategy.<p>That that lead has been completely sacrificed in the last 60 or so years to foster increasing globalization in the foolhardy belief of winning over the communist bloc through capitalist flexing notwithstanding, the people who have been pushing the envelope have not by any stretch been some sort of series of diabolical Dr. Strangelove&#x27;s. Quite the contrary in fact. It&#x27;s just so easy for techies to get caught up in the pedantism of historical record they completely lose sight of the rest of humanity going on around them.')
