But you didn&#x27;t answer to the overall fact that there are central points of failure in most electronic devices&#x2F;infrastructure that are even more critical than a vacuum cleaner. Yet we still rely on them. That doesn&#x27;t make the whole &quot;electric&quot; infrastructure &quot;a mess&quot;.<p>And BTW not every blackout can be solved with a generator. For instance a city-wide blackout, in regard to streetlamps etc. Also, not everyone can install a generator. Not every landlord allows a generator etc etc. Even if you had a city-specific generator, that can just as well fail. Now, if your not concerned with a backup system failing you shouldn&#x27;t need to be concerned with Amazon&#x27;s system failing as they also have multiple backup systems in place.')
