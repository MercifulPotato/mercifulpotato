That&#x27;s only half as much as SpaceX Rideshare for the same size payload, today. If Starship works out, then SpaceX costs will drop enormously.<p>Fuel is a minor portion of launch cost. SpinLaunch is saving fuel but throwing away rockets; it&#x27;s going to be hard to compete with someone who throws away more fuel but saves the rockets.')
