Typically, it is an illegal, unconstitutional seizure of power by a political faction, the military, or a dictator.

Five people died, including a police officer.<p>3. The capitol storm was illegal and unconstitutional. Many stormers have been charged with crimes by the federal government.<p>4. The stormers wanted to seize power on behalf of the far-right&#x2F;MAGA political faction.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Wikipedia&#x27;s definition has not changed since the Jan. 6th events [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat&amp;oldid=995559658" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Coup_d%27%C3%A9ta...</a>')
