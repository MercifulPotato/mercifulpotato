The launched script expects environment variables and other stuff from Steam, so it won&#x27;t work without Steam. On the other hand, no other launching script is provided, but if you call the wine executable with the correct options and environment variables, it should just work.<p>On average I don&#x27;t expect specific merits using Proton vs using vanilla Wine for non-game applications. As far as I know, Proton-specific patches are usually hacks targeted either generally at games or at specific titles. Actually, using Proton could be worse than vanilla Wine, because Proton is based on a past version of Wine which only gets updated every now and then (last Proton is based on Wine 5.13), so you are missing some development (on the other hand, sometimes developing features breaks stuff, so this could also go the other way around).<p>Ideally, we always want as many patches as possible to go into vanilla Wine instead of Proton or CrossOver; first because we love free software and second because maintaining forked versions is time-consuming like mad. However Wine rightly has strict code quality requirements, and sometimes developing a proper fix for some bug is either impossible or too long; those cases are handled with patches in Proton (perhaps shared with Wine Staging or CrossOver).<p>Disclosure: I work for CodeWeavers on Proton.
