Its open source on my Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daniel-bytes&#x2F;rps-scala" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daniel-bytes&#x2F;rps-scala</a>, the backend is Scala and Redis and the frontend React + Typescript.  I have a live version of it up at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rock-paper-scissor-battle.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rock-paper-scissor-battle.com&#x2F;</a>, although I have a feeling any real level of traffic will topple over my $5&#x2F;mo Heroku dyno.  Also don&#x27;t mind the goofy font landing page. :)<p>I&#x27;m overall happy with the backend code, except for the &quot;AI&quot;, which can use some real work and research.  Right now just some basic semi-random rules that make it pretty easy to beat.')
