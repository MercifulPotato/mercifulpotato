Who cares about Windows and their mess!?<p>But in retrospect that has been a great decision. The ecosystem has followed and supports Windows without friction. Cargo solves the &quot;pile of unpacked library directories&quot; problem. Crates that use system dependencies know how to use vcpkg or build from source. They will even read Windows registry for you to configure MSVC, so you don&#x27;t need to run vcvars.bat.<p>The effect is that I can just write stuff on Mac, and my Rust projects mostly &quot;just work&quot; on Windows.')
