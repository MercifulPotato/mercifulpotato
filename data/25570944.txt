Anyways “Narco culture” has influenced a lot of people (mostly on poor neighborhoods) and therefore it has influenced kids, it’s really sad to see boys playing with guns pretending to be narcos. The government has tried to ban those kinds of toys, I don’t know, does that really help? I guess I don’t have a strong opinion since that doesn’t look like a solution, but in the other hand it’s sad to see those boys aspiring to be narcos.')
