And if I wasn’t already laced up and out the door for the gym, no way I’d still follow through after I vaped.<p>Recovery makes a lot of sense and that was part of the routine for later workouts, but didn’t exactly do wonders for my nutritional choices ;)<p>Btw, anyone who is considering dabbling, I’d, uh, highly recommend looking into the Pax Era cartridge system. No mess, gross paraphernalia, smell, safe high quality product, etc.')
