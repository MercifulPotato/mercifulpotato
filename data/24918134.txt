In any case the opinion you hold of me is not representative of my attitude towards security.<p>Of course I want to know about security issues. Actual security issues. I don&#x27;t want some script kiddie pinging me about a port that&#x27;s open trying to fish for a few grand because <i>I&#x27;m the cunt that opened it</i>! It&#x27;s not an open printer or whatever nmap is telling you, it&#x27;s probably a non-standard SSH port. Something someone with skill would figure out in a second.<p>If you find an open printer on my networks - send a printout to it. Say hello.<p>Have a good day.')
