For example, if you openly want to make small changes to social welfare programs that make them more sustainable -- the kind of changes that would be a part of negotiations on any social welfare reform bill anyway -- you&#x27;ll get crushed by ads saying you want to destroy social welfare.<p>It&#x27;s the same with drug policy. On an individual level, most voters would probably understand drug policy liberalization if you sat down with them and showed them data around how it affects use, recidivism, et cetera. But if you vocalize support for it, you&#x27;ll be risking your opponent taking a soundbyte and turning it into an ad for how you&#x27;re soft on crime and you want to let dangerous criminals out of prison. So unless you have a lot of politicians in safe seats, or voters have had a lot of time to learn the nuance around these issues, it&#x27;s a risky undertaking.')
