The rest of the film is disorganized, lacks a coherent angle&#x2F;point of view, and just kind of meanders along. Some of the acting was also off (Oldman playing a New Yorker but seems to have a slight British accent, etc.)<p>Overall, it felt like a worse version of <i>Hail Caesar</i>, without the Coen Brothers’ mastery of ‘pointlessness.’')
