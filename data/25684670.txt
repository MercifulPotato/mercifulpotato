Disagree as this implicitly assumes working 40 hours won&#x27;t produce relatively more negative feedback on one&#x27;s personal life than a 32 hour week would. Once you start accounting for that, the  &quot;net loss&quot; story becomes a lot more vague.<p>Given if the requirement was &quot;you really have to work this number of hours to get that total income&quot;, I would prefer longer days + fewer days over the 9-5 mentality most countries have. Unfortunately, the last time I requested 9x4, it got denied. Let alone more extreme variants, 4x10, 3x10 or 3x12. Ironic, since 4x10 would also have less overhead, despite still being a 40h workweek.')
