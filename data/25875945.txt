There is no getting a little bit interested in something and just engaging with things casually for me. If I get into something it gets extreme. That can last 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months, or 3 years. I tend to like it when it&#x27;s 3 years as the short duration hyperfocus tends to lead to a lot of impulse buys related to the obsession that then become useless once I&#x27;m no longer interested. The times when it goes for years I wind up outstripping my peers as most noone can match the time and intensity I put in.')
