See 8Chan post gamergate or Voat post-banning of r&#x2F;fatpeoplehate. Not saying it&#x27;s wrong to be pro-all-kinds-of-speech-allowed-on-platform-that-you-run, but those kinds of platforms usually only surge in popularity when a bunch of people get banned from a more mainstream platform where being a dick is against the rules.<p>Edit: don&#x27;t want to make it sound like big tech companies like Twitter &#x2F; FB and Amazon are &quot;good&quot; for doing this. They&#x27;re only doing this because they feel pressure to do so. If the execs had a moral compass, they would treat every user the same, and ban people based on the same set of rules.')
