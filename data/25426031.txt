And likewise horses can be smelly when you&#x27;re <i>right</i> next to them.<p>But if Paris were really that stench-filled, surely there would be third-world places today that are the same? But I&#x27;ve never encountered <i>anywhere</i> anything like that.<p>Feels like urban legend to me. Just like the myth about how spices were used to mask the smell of rotten meat.
