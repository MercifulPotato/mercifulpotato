Item(by='dilDDoS', descendants=None, kids=[25304651], score=None, time=1607100102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303485, text='&gt; Given the area of a circle is given by Pi times the radius squared, write a function to calculate the area of a circle.<p>&gt;  Amazingly, more than half the candidates couldnâ€™t write this function in any language<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. Or, they were interviewing candidates fresh out of college who never really paid attention in any classes. Or, the problem was presented to the candidate in an overly complicated fashion (which is weirdly common in technical interviews) and the interviewee was confused, although that seems unlikely.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to get wrapped up in this mindset of &quot;oh we need super complex algorithm whiteboarding because candidates nowadays don&#x27;t know how to code!&quot; when you hear stories like this, and it&#x27;s just not true -- at least in my experience of interviewing candidates. Maybe I&#x27;ve just been lucky.')
