It&#x27;s in memory of Nobel, and it&#x27;s awarded based on the same rules as the other prizes.  But it wasn&#x27;t actually established by Nobel.  So, is that a Nobel prize or not?  Technically, no... but everybody doesn&#x27;t want to be technical all the time.  And the full name of the prize does have &quot;Nobel&quot; in it.  So people call it &quot;the Nobel in Economics&quot; for short.  And then other people get all huffy, because technically that isn&#x27;t quite accurate.')
