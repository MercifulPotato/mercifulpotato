The fallacy isn&#x27;t in the assumption of error, but rather in attacking a characterization of the process by which the opponent arrived at their argument rather than the argument itself. That one might infer from someone engaging in that fallacy that they have also assumed the opponent wrong and sought an explanation is, well, a reasonable conclusion but to highlight that as the fundamental issue is, ironically, making the same mistake that is at issue with Bulverism: focussing on the process by which one gets to the argument rather than the flaws in the argument.')
