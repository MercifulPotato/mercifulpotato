Which made it clear there was a market for people watching others play video games.  As a teen I had multiple times had a room full of other kids watching me play video games so it wasn’t just a question of competitive sports. Finally, the focus was different many people had been making money for years entertaining over webcams, it’s ripe for stalker behavior.<p>I will agree with you on Uber though for economic and regulatory reasons.  Taxi medallions where created because of the external costs of operating a Taxi so just ignoring that system seems unlikely to work.  Similarly without subsides drivers and passengers are going to be willing to jump ship.  That said, carpool lanes and Taxi where a thing which covers the stranger angle.<p>Economically CitySprinter (much earlier startup) and Uber had the same basic issue in my mind, the overhead of operating internationally needs some significant economies of scale to work out.')
