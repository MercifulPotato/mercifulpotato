Using spectroscopic measurements of 5 stars, we obtain a constraint on the relative variation of  the fine structure  constant  below 10^−5.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escholarship.org&#x2F;uc&#x2F;item&#x2F;5185m01m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escholarship.org&#x2F;uc&#x2F;item&#x2F;5185m01m</a>')
