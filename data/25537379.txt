It is uncertain that any non-corporately maintained Linux distro could qualify (per the opengroup page) as the kernel is developed outside of the distro.<p>The BSD&#x27;s on the other hand could probably apply as they are one system (kernel and userland) with one governing body.  But I doubt they really care to play the corporate standard mark game. They are UNIX and have always been so.')
