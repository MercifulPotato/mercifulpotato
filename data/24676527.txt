The known way to embed an entire XML doc into a SOAP message was to use CDATA, which isn&#x27;t a general solution because it means the embedded doc can&#x27;t have ]]&gt; in it anywhere. You could also base64-encoded the included doc.<p>Both of these solutions and all other known solutions to this problem are, as I&#x27;m sure you can see, just awful.<p>You can&#x27;t just paste XML in XML because of the &lt;?xml?&gt; thing, because of entities, and because of half a dozen other misfeatures of XML.')
