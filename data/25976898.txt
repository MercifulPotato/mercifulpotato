R&amp;D is a sunk cost and the technology gained from it can be applied beyond the original scope. I get it because bean counters want to point fingers when it comes to penny pinching.<p>It&#x27;s not as if GM goes back and adjusts the R&amp;D % applied to the 97 Corvette when they sell an LS engine.  The R&amp;D cost of every subsequent vehicle that reuses something off the shelf is going to be cheaper.')
