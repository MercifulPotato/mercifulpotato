Item(by='Mvandenbergh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603216304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836743, text='&gt;People (including journalists, politicians... high stakes stuff) assume that unemployment captures most unemployment.<p>Is that the case? A journalist covering an economic story will know and be familiar with U3 and U6. Maybe a local politician like a city council person, mayor, or potentially a freshman state rep in some American state <i>might</i> not know, since some of them are really just used car salesmen or local lawyers who&#x27;ve convinced their local party to put them in as their candidate but even then I suspect that they learn the conceptual if not the technical difference very quickly. I am not familiar with the political systems of all countries of course but I think you would struggle to find, say, a Dutch of British MP who would not know this.')
