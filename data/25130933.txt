Have the usual official results... then have an option to go to level 2, level 3, level 4 etc (lvl 1 is not included in lvl 2)<p>You can have really biased technically terrible filters that for example put a site on level 4 because it is to new, to small and any number of other dumb SEO nonsense arguments. (The topic was not in the url! There was poor choice of text color!)<p>I think wikipedia has a lot of research to offer on what to do but also what not to do.
