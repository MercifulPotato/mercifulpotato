The other one is a legacy server run by a former moderator who was banned for using the &#x2F;r&#x2F;WSB for personal gain. It&#x27;s much less active these days (although people are flocking to it now that the active one is banned). It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re talking about two equal servers where one is offensive and one isn&#x27;t.')
