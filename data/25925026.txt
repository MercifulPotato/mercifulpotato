As I understood it, you were arguing otherwise.<p>&gt; We are allowed to say [...] even if we don&#x27;t have the exact step by step plan on how to implement it that we can share on HN.<p>And other people are similarly allowed to <i>argue</i> with you on anything you might say if they so choose. That&#x27;s the point of a free exchange of ideas, I think.<p>&gt; And sacrificing my privacy doesn&#x27;t have to mean that it&#x27;s open to public<p>But... Something is either public or it&#x27;s private....<p>Anyhow, not only you suggested that I was attacking you for no reason, but you also brought up &quot;wars&quot; and &quot;hunger&quot; and I don&#x27;t particularly understand why, and this now seems like an attempt at equivocation. Hopefully I&#x27;m just misinterpreting, but I don&#x27;t feel like you are trying to argue in good faith.')
