(I discovered Ratpoison many moons ago and found the tiled approach an efficient way to use a laptop.) My configuration is nothing special, but here are a couple things I&#x27;ve found helpful:<p>1. Opacity follows the focus (see compton&#x27;s &quot;-i&quot; option). If I look at a window and see my wallpaper showing through, I know that whatever I type won&#x27;t be going there.<p>2. A generously sized terminal window lives in the scratchpad. Since I&#x27;m on a laptop, I sometimes find myself bouncing among workspaces fairly often--yet the same terminal is always a keystroke away.<p>Also, not i3-specific, but having a key binding for opening a specific notes file in an editor ensures that I make notes much more often.')
