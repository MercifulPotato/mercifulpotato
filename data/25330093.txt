Item(by='prawn', descendants=None, kids=[25339400], score=None, time=1607326373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25328129, text='I&#x27;ve run and moderated a forum for 15+ years (not dissimilar position to your role here) and think I&#x27;ve developed a pretty good instinct for picking the truth from fiction in anonymous posts of that sort. I was very confident that it was close enough to the truth. That said, I don&#x27;t think the average reader can &quot;smell&quot; the difference in the same way; they haven&#x27;t approached a forum daily with a moderator&#x27;s eye. I&#x27;m always amazed when people mistake a troll for someone genuine or the reverse, when it&#x27;s been obvious to me.')
