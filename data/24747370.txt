Maybe it&#x27;s a flaw of Nuclear that you have to stuff its waste in a giant pit inside a mountain.<p>Uranium mining often uses leeching techniques, similar concerns to fracking and groundwater contamination, along with general mining hazards.<p>Additionally rare-earth minerals are needed for a variety of things, even including components within a nuclear plant. I highly doubt a Nuclear plant could be built &quot;rare earth metals free&quot;. Fuel rods also may contain a mix of rare earth metals. Rare-earth metal mining and refinement practices need to improve, but they will never go away.')
