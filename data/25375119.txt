Seriously, having a western look and speaking English are marketable skills. There are people who literally make living out of it.<p>When it comes to Easter Europeans, they need to have the skills to get the job in first place(Polish don&#x27;t get the jobs because of their Polishness), they must be able to speak some English in addition to one or two languages that they already know and they must have the capital to move to UK(Usually means years of savings).<p>If the British are having hard time to compete with Eastern Europeans they need to look into their education system. The government as the first step in HR will help with reducing the competition but in the same time that means that UK companies will have less options in hiring which is likely to reduce the output.<p>In my opinion, companies should be allowed to hire whoever they want and work visa or nationality is not a skill, just blunt regulatory barrier for voter distribution.')
