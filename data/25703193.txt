It has a unique way of exposing people&#x27;s (myself included) fallibility to motivated reasoning and confirmation bias.<p>I agree that Democrats pinned Russian election interference (which did happen) to Trump (which probably did not) in an attempt to undermine his presidency.  I also think this is not too far away from the norm.  Remember the birther movement? The stolen 2000 elections?  How do you rank claims of widespread voter fraud in that list?<p>However, I&#x27;ll contend with you on your claim 1).  OP did not say &quot;Democrats haven&#x27;t undermined democracy&quot;.
