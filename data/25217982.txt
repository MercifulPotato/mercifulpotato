Sometime in late July it started exhibiting a game breaking bug. AFAIK there is no way to contact the devs. I went through the &quot;proper channels&quot; and silence.<p>I remember back when FogBugz was a thing and Joel claimed that the correct way to provide customer service was track bugs, have one owner, and only allow the original reporter of the bug to mark it as closed. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not completely feasible but It&#x27;s surprising to me how I know of ZERO software developers that follow anything even remotely close to this practice except for a few open source projects.<p>Want to report a bug on Windows? Photoshop? Almost any game ever? Good luck finding out if a dev ever saw your report and that it didn&#x27;t just get dropped by some underpaid customer service center rep.')
