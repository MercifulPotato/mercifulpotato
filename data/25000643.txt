It is a problem of language.<p>Or more specifically, of dynamically typed languages (DTL) vs&#x2F; statically typed ones (STL).<p>We know for a fact now that DTL&#x27;s simply don&#x27;t scale to large code bases. And before dozens of people tell me there are a lot of large apps written in DTL, this doesn&#x27;t mean it was a good idea in the first place nor that these large apps are easy to maintain and improve (they&#x27;re not and they would be much easier to maintain and improve with type annotations).')
