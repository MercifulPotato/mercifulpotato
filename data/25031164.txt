These workers cannot do the right thing without taking a hard hit.<p>This isn&#x27;t the only snag those very sensible measures hit in our economic system.  We really need to just hand individuals money a few more times and help businesses cover upkeep.  The $1200 check early on was a great idea.  No complex applications, no oversight of how banks handle loans, no unexpectedly unused piles of cash, no need to negotiate for months about what concerns should be covered and how.  Money goes out, people spend it as needed, keep an eye on the budgets of critical things (hospitals, local governments) to plug holes if not enough of the cash flows to them.  Maybe reinstate the paycheck protection program and make sure nobody worries about paying it back. Done.  And it&#x27;s not going to be done beyond a year, so there&#x27;s little reason for landlords to jack up rent and vacuum the cash.<p>This is a short term crisis, so we just need to use a crutch until we can run again.')
