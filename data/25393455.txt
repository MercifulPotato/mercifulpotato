Yes you need to spin up the high-output staff in the low cost-of-living area before you fire the high-output staff in the high cost-of-living area, and yes you need to do knowledge transfer, the devil is in the details.<p>This has happened to me before, the location I worked in shut down and the jobs were moved to a lower cost location. Many years later, they seem to be doing fine. If it was up to me, they would have kept the people in the high cost location but not hired replacements when people left while adding people in the low cost location, but they didn&#x27;t see it that way.<p>Also, the longer I work in software development, the more I disagree with &quot;People are not interchangeable parts&quot;, at least with respect to developing software. People come work on a code base for a while, they leave, other people get hired on, the code base lives on. If a code base can&#x27;t be handed off from one group of developers to another group of developers without much trouble, something is wrong. And yes, I know that is an unpopular opinion and the role of a good development manager is to pretend like it isn&#x27;t true, but there it is. In a well run software shop, you should ensure the people are interchangeable parts.')
