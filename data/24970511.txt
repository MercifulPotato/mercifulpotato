It&#x27;s happening at the level of space itself, so it would change the way parts of molecules will relate to each other. It passes fast, but potentially you could fall apart at the molecular level.<p>I am not a physicist so I could be completely wrong about that. And I&#x27;m not sure if it matters since it&#x27;s probably accompanied by photons and probably neutrinos in sufficient quantity to wipe you out at that distance. (Not from the merger itself, but from any matter in its halo.)')
