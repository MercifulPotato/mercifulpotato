It&#x27;s hard to convey the nuance without seeing it. If you want to skip the talk itself, just focus on the demo (timestamp 11:56).<p>Server Components are very different from what Next.js does today (traditional SSR). Here&#x27;s a few differences:<p>* Server Components code is <i>never sent to the client</i>. By comparison, with traditional SSR all of the component code gets sent to the client anyway in the JS bundle.<p>* Server Components let you access the backend directly <i>from anywhere in the tree</i>. In Next.js, you can access the backend inside getServerProps(), but that only works at the top level page level, which means componentization is very limited. E.g. random npm component can&#x27;t do that.<p>* Server Components can be <i>refetched without losing the Client state inside of their tree</i>. Because the primary transport is richer than HTML, we can refetch a server-rendered part (e.g. a search result list) without blowing away the state inside (e.g. the search input text, focus and selection).<p>That said, it&#x27;s not a dig at Next.js -- the whole goal is to enable Next.js and similar frameworks to be much better.<p>Happy to answer specific questions!')
