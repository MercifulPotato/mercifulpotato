Is it the hope of getting on some &#x27;hall of fame&#x27; which might land a job offer?<p>Like, If I found a exploit for something random like skype&#x2F;slack&#x2F;etc.. that let you run code on any targets machine with zero interaction, there is zero chance my first stop would be the bug bounty program. For serious exploits, I believe you can get up to 2 million bucks with zerodium. Just seems like a no brainer.<p>Now that said, I would definitely use the bug bounty program for boring&#x2F;low impact stuff like XSS and whatnot that has limited value&#x2F;impact as nobody else would likely ever buy it for that much higher of a price.')
