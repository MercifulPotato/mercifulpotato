Ubiquiti doesn&#x27;t know how to make a serious radio.<p>For something like the af5xhd, it&#x27;s a great little thing for its price, and with good quality antennas at both ends can make a very effective bridge. But for more serious things? No. It&#x27;s so bad they haven&#x27;t even been able to implement snmpv2 on their $1000+ radios. The af11 is so bad it only uses a 56MHz channel mask in an 80MHz channel.<p>No matter what manufacturer, serious ptp radios can be distinguished by two things: the presence of terminals for a direct -48vdc wiring connection and sfp&#x2F;sfp+ ports.<p>At the very low end of cost, ubnt&#x27;s 802.11ac chipset ptp bridge radios are great and very cost effective, I&#x27;m talking about the powerbeam ac series, nanobeam and similar. For when you want to buy a few hundred bucks of stuff on your credit card to link a few buildings together quickly. For anyone looking at that category of stuff they should also look at mikrotik and mimosa radios.')
