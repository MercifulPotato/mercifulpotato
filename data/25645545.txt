To take a historical example, The publication of Bell&#x27;s inequality motivated a successful program leading to its experimental verification; do you have in mind some potential experiment to distinguish between models that is being wrongly ignored on the grounds that it is too hard to persue?<p>An alternative explanation for quantum foundations being in limbo is that it is extremely difficult to come up with alternatives that offer a possibility of verification.<p>Update: writing this reminded me of [1], in which a simple experiment by Shahriar Afshar, that arguably challenged one tenet of the Copenhagen interpretation, provoked a disturbingly over-the-top response - it seems to support your position on how work on quantum fundamentals is opposed (though, personally, I doubt it succeeds in challenging the Copenhagen interpretation.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;mg19325915-400-quantum-rebel-wins-over-doubters&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;mg19325915-400-quantum-...</a>')
