I have had a maximum of 6 in the past but decided to increase the flock since 6 birds is pretty much the same effort as 30 birds. I now have 33 in total and at this point in their life get one egg a day. They average something like 300+ eggs a year. I have sold enough to buy an automatic egg washer and now mainly worry about selling enough to cover feed costs. I do it because chickens are very therapeutic and I find them relaxing to be around. I have young kids so they are also learning the value of food and can eat all the eggs they want. So I wouldnâ€™t really call it much of a business it is more of a hobby that I reap little reward other then my eggs and to help out a few others near me. I think if I ramped up to a few hundred birds I could make a bit of money but at the small size it keeps me from getting overwhelmed with too much work and I can just share my harvest with those around me. I have learned that making money is nice but I also get a great deal reward from helping others in need.')
