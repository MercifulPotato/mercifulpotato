To successfully ride on top of this unstable equilibrium, it is necessary to (1) establish false dichotomies, a la the Arthur Finklestein school of electoral politics, and (2) to crush dissent that tries to pick apart the false dichotomy by controlling speech and silencing anything that is actually dissident against any concrete part of the narrative that is really open to attack.<p>Not that I think this Hunter Biden stuff is particularly noteworthy; if anything it&#x27;s just more fuel for the false dichotomy, and a banning like this one for the NYP is perfect in terms of making it into a lightning-rod issue. Focus on this, people, and not any of the actual things happening in the world right now (like, say, the Middle East, or the flyover-state opioid crisis, or climate change, or inner city crime, or anything else that seemingly stops existing and has no interesting events when we don&#x27;t pay attention to it, right?)')
