(Honest question, as you may be an employee of Parler, for example. HN is an interesting place).<p>I ask because contracts typically, despite their duration, contain a variety of exit clauses. In this case, Amazon could argue they were exercising a &quot;compliance with laws&quot; clause (if it was in the agreement) such as,<p>&quot;&lt;Licensee&gt; will not use, or allow its products to be used, in violation of any laws or regulations.&quot;<p>It becomes a legal argument as to whether Parler&#x27;s members that advocated violence against the government caused Parler to violate the clause, and whether that amounts to a material breach that triggers contract termination.<p>That is very different than a blanket statement that Amazon &quot;breached that contract and bowed to the mob.&quot; In fact, Amazon can sue Parler for breaching the agreement and exposing Amazon to significant liability for (at the most extreme) aiding and abetting terrorism.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not arguing either way, simply stating what lawyers are likely discussing behind the scenes.')
