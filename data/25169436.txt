I was considering that path myself in university, but ended up going more towards science and doing several years of research in nuclear physics labs instead.<p>I&#x27;m very glad I didn&#x27;t end up doing nuclear engineering.  The nuclear industry stagnated and failed to address cost problems and bad project delivery (cost overruns, delays, etc).<p>And then between 2010 and 2020 renewable energy scaled up and became incredibly cheap, in fact the cheapest source of energy in most countries: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scale-up-of-solar-and-wind-puts-existing-coal-gas-at-risk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scale-up-of-solar-and-wind-puts-...</a><p>Between 2010 to 2019 wind energy become 70% cheaper and solar became 89% cheaper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451082&#x2F;lcoe-8.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451082&#x2F;lcoe-8.png</a><p>Battery costs have dropped 75% over the last 6 years: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;report-levelized-cost-of-energy-for-lithium-ion-batteries-bnef" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;report-levelize...</a><p>&gt; I think there&#x27;s a perception problem.<p>Somewhat, but the nuclear industry did a massive PR campaign to address that.<p>Blaming perception or &quot;green activists&quot; or &quot;fear of scawy radiashun!&quot; is an easy straw-man for them, but the real obstacles are more practical and harder to address: the economics of nuclear are not good.  This is compounded by a problematic history of delivery problems.')
