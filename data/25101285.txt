And most people likely do in normal life:<p>&quot;Hey Bob, can I give your phone number to Alice ? She would like to buy that furniture you re selling.&quot;<p>Yep people will just give their full phonebook to a third party so they can see who else is one the service (and betrayed their thrust by giving it their phone number!). I really hope this is just UX dark patterns, where the apps ask for phone book access but don&#x27;t explicitly tell users how they are doing this matching. Users doing this willingly would be much worse...')
