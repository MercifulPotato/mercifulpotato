No only is it not gold or silver, but it&#x27;s not event backed by it.<p>Based on this definition, nobody in the US earns any money so nobody should have to pay any income tax since basically everyone&#x27;s income is 0 ounces of gold and 0 ounces of silver. Yet this argument would not stand in court even though it&#x27;s 100% logical.<p>We&#x27;re all just a bunch of monkeys. The implementation of the law always comes down to what the most popular monkeys think it is.<p>If the most popular monkeys think that the definition of &#x27;gold&#x27; actually means &#x27;feces&#x27;, then before you know it, we will all start throwing feces at each other as a means of payment.<p>What&#x27;s the point of defining the law using words if people will later distort the meaning of those words to suit their purpose? you may as well rely on gut feelings and majority rule to decide what is right or wrong.')
