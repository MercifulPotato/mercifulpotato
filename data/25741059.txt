Facebook&#x2F;YouTube or any social media provider will still send you one video that is not based on your profile under certain circumstances. Have you ever stumbled upon a video where you have comments like:<p>1. I don&#x27;t know how I got here. I was watching some [insert something innocent here]<p>2. Thanks [service] for recommending me this video after 10 years of it being uploaded<p>3. Is [service] trying to tell me something? Am I going to die? Why am I being recommended this [horrible&#x2F;violent&#x2F;repugnant video]?<p>4. I am on the wrong side of [service] again.<p>And many more.<p>If you have ever come across such comments on any videos you watch it just is the algorithm deciding to show you something completely unconnected to the profile it built about you. Why? Because these services don&#x27;t like creating silos of information where users with affinity to that silo flock to. They can&#x27;t make money that way because the number of advertisers for that niche may be very less. The algorithm then decides that you need to be shown other niches too. Keeps trying until you see multiple videos in a particular niche. Then it builds a new profile about you with that niche added in. This is the rabbit hole which is so hard to avoid. Once you fall into it, it is not easy to come out of.<p>Now if your feed is filled with only animals and math jokes that is because you fall into a big enough bucket that these services don&#x27;t bother showing you anything else. Even if you occassionally click on something political, violent or clickbaity. There are enough advertisers in your bucket for them to make their moolah. You are just lucky... For now. But if popularity for animal videos tanks tomorrow don&#x27;t be surprised if these services recommend videos titled &quot;Shocking accident caught on tape! You won&#x27;t believe what happened next&quot;. That&#x27;s how the downward spiral begins!')
