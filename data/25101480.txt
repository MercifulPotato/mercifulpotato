But banning anyone supporting antifa is a pretty clear breach. The parody ban (especially the selective application) is another clear breach of free speech.<p>I&#x27;d be content enough if they were upfront and said this is a place for &quot;Conservative opinions only&quot; rather than &quot;free speech&quot;. I&#x27;d even agree that&#x27;s their right and that they might get more open and productive discussion that way at least in some cases. But it&#x27;s just not free speech.<p>I think that&#x27;s what frustrates me about this: it&#x27;s the hypocrisy.<p>I actually hold a few Conservative opinions myself. But i wouldn&#x27;t ban people from disagreeing with me AND claim to support free speech...')
