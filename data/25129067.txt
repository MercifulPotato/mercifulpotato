Also, what is the cost you speak about? How many minutes of Bezos income? How many F35? How many days of US budget deficit?<p>I mean avoiding lockdown is possible at a certain time. After a certain threshold of infection it becomes unavoidable. But lockdown or no lockdown, this must be done right. A few places have not done it right, for example Spain letting people party in the summer or France with packed cafes.<p>A friend of mine explained it well. When treated, COVID has a mortality of .5%. We are doing better than in March because for example elderly care person wear masks and isolate properly the risk population. If they wouldn’t, the mortality would be in the low percents, which would already be a lot. But when you are running out of ICU capacity, then you land in the 10% deaths. That’s what everyone is trying to avoid at the moment.')
