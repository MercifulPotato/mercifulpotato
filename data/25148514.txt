The thing is, at any given time I either don&#x27;t have an actual project I&#x27;m eager &#x2F; able to start, or if I am motivated to &quot;get stuff done&quot; then I don&#x27;t want to complicate the effort with something new so I reach for more familiar tools.<p>I&#x27;ve considered building a simple CRUD REST API or small CLI script in haskell. Do you really suspect I&#x27;d learn much more than I would with Advent of Code (which I have done before)?<p>On the one hand, stuff like learning Hesod, database interaction, and I&#x2F;O generally would be a real skill. On the other hand, one time I attempted to hack Postgrest to work for Redshift. It mostly worked (read only, no bells and whistles) and that was cool but I didn&#x27;t really feel i learned much')
