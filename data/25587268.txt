That is why we talk about defunding police.&quot;<p>Where is the evidence that the police budget is what is preventing social programs to be funded? That is a fiction driven from the inane sloganeering around &#x27;defund the police&#x27;. You can fund any program you democratically pass and that has nothing to do with police budget. That&#x27;s the false choice you&#x27;re putting out there .. that somehow you have to choose between &#x27;funding the police&#x27; OR funding social programs.<p>Here&#x27;s the reality, we&#x27;re spending billions on social programs. There are no silver-bullet social programs that we know will lower crime rate.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly common.<p>Uh huh. Care to quantify that? Because I think you&#x27;re basing this on nothing.')
