As Hobbes said, without government to help organize us, life is &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot; Obviously there is such a thing as too much control, but there is also such a thing as too little.<p>Situations such as this are extraordinary. We have a virulent and serious disease we&#x27;re trying to control the best way we can. The best leaders are making difficult decisions using the best science we have to guide them.<p>Protecting the innocent and the vulnerable -- and valuing life in general -- is a tenet that our society has chosen to adopt. How do we do that? By balancing freedom with measured restrictions that are consistent with that tenet.<p>We can argue about whether the measures taken are effective, or whether they restrict too much freedom. But to just say &quot;Fuck it all, absolute freedom for everyone! Everyone toss out their masks and get together indoors!&quot; during this crisis goes much too far in my view.')
