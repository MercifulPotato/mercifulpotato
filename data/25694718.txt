Most people on the right are against abortion for the reason that it is against their particular religion, which declares it as murder and murder is wrong.\nBut, the others don&#x27;t care at all about a woman&#x27;s right to choose, they just don&#x27;t want their tax dollars paying for that choice instead of other things they want. It really is that simple.\nAs far as the court goes,  that is completely different.  The saying goes &quot;you can indict a ham sandwich &quot;, and that is largely true. Courts all over the nation entertain frivolous actions on a daily basis, people love this (Judge Judy), but when cases are preliminary dismissed without the &quot;day in court&quot; faith in the court will be quickly lost by those who believed win or lose, it should have been heard.\nEach person reading this was raised in a time when they were taught every vote counts, your opinion matters, and to stand up for what you believe in while respecting the opinions of others. The opinion of one side is no longer even listened to, let alone respected.  How many of you have ever genuinely tried to explain to someone with a different opinion why you disagree with them? I  don&#x27;t see that much anymore. Not everyone with a different opinion is set in their beliefs. Some may welcome your perspective and shift their viewpoint to yours. It&#x27;s worth a try, right? Apparently not for most. Instead, the right is vilified, insulted, and they believe they are treated differently and unfairly from the left. Their voices are being systematically taken away through deplatforming. They are being stereotyped and lumped into a single category along with extremists. So, the logical conclusion is that if you isolate, disparage, and discourage someone enough,  they will become you&#x27;ve now convinced them they are. Multiply that by 70 million. Instead, try talking to people with the goal of explaining your point of view and why you feel that way. It certainly can&#x27;t hurt more than what&#x27;s happening now.')
