Youtube recommends children&#x27;s videos to me because sometimes I let my son watch children&#x27;s videos, which is a pretty reasonable proposition.  The problem is that the very same system can become harmful when it starts recommending more and more misinformation after a person watches one conspiracy theory video; Google has been trying to address this by displaying truthful information when certain topics are detected, but obviously there is work left to do.<p>The real problem here is that we are focusing on the way that these algorithms can send people into rabbit holes of misinformation, without stopping to consider what the same algorithms do in general or the fact that people actually like recommendations (which are in most cases harmless to society).  Again, the response to &quot;HIV propagates via the immune system&quot; should not be &quot;we should get rid of the immune system to prevent the spread of HIV.&quot;')
