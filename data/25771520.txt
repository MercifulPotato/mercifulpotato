That is way out of whack. I am certain it only got worse because all the 1&#x2F;40’s I knew left.<p>They are going to have to go and get people who have modern skillsets and mindsets and those people don’t want to live in Hillsboro. And it’s going to be expensive.<p>And those people don’t tolerate dead weight.<p>My take is that Bob Swan was only ever a placeholder. The board needed to be put in the worst possible negotiating position: Literally on their knees begging because they are getting their asses kicked in every single competitor category.<p>A smart guy like Pat wouldn’t take the CEO job until they (a) are crawling on all fours and (b) give him the latitude to clean house as vigorously as he wants and (c) a preposterous paycheck.<p>No one intelligent would want that job without all three.
