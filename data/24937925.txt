There&#x27;s lots of other designs that should go larger, but require further advancements in things like carbon nanotubes, etc. to be possible.<p>As for why it would be better - control. No worries about pollution. No worries about earthquakes, volcanoes, or other natural disasters. No droughts, no hurricanes, no tornadoes.<p>No one is talking about living on space stations like the ISS - we&#x27;re talking about building purpose built large scale structures that are designed from the ground. And these aren&#x27;t things that are the realm of science fiction authors and futurists with no grounding in reality or physics - they&#x27;re things that have been and continue to be seriously researched by NASA and other space agencies.')
