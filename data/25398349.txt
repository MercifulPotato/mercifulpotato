Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=[25398470], score=None, time=1607782759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370822, text='One question that&#x27;s been bugging more with regard to these older encumbered standards as we get into the 2020s: does anyone know if there has been an exhaustive search of when they go patent free? H.264 Version 1 was 2003, and Version 3 (which added the high profiles, so it&#x27;s probably by far the most common by this point) was 2005. So worst-case scenario, we&#x27;re 3-5 years from any possible patent being expired. But in most cases standards patents have priority dates at least a year or two before, because negotiations happen well before standard official finalization (first draft in this case was sometime in 1999 or 2000 IIRC) and patent holders who try to keep it a secret and apply at the last moment risk getting cut out or having someone else come up with it and neutralize them.<p>I remember a lot of people were watching for when MP3 went patent free, and it&#x27;d be interesting if there was a site keeping track of when some of these other still commonly used standards did the same. Patents last relatively way too long in the tech world, but even here it&#x27;s not forever.')
