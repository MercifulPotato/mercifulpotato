It&#x27;s more so the cycle. I&#x27;ll stop taking Zolpidem&#x2F;Zopiclone for several weeks&#x2F;month (the first several days -- terrible shakes, chills, nightmares, several days without sleeping etc. Zopiclone&#x2F;Benzo withdrawal is far worse) After a while, I&#x27;ll eventually adjust but I have insomnia&#x2F;poor sleep so I&#x27;ll eventually cave in due to sleep deprivation then I&#x27;ll pick back up.<p>For the past year, I would roughly take 90mg of either Zolpidem&#x2F;Zopiclone in a single night. On average, I roughly go through 100 pills a week (I have pharmacies that sell to me...I know sketch).<p>It wasn&#x27;t always like this, when I first started taking medication after going to Stanford Sleep Clinic, I would just take a pill or two a night and have fantastic sleep. It was like this for several years but eventually my tolerance increased and my work stress&#x2F;insomnia got worse with age.<p>I want to reiterate that I&#x27;ve destroyed&#x2F;damaged every meaningful relationship in my life. I state this all out because I&#x27;ve realized that people have a strange fascination with Ambien.')
