Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24758410], score=None, time=1602479877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24751096, text='&gt; Tolkien and Madeleine L&#x27;Engle wrote novels in a similar vein (that are also excellent children&#x27;s books).<p>Tolkien very much did not write Christian allegory&#x2F;apologia in the guise of fiction, though he did remix Christian themes. So I wouldn&#x27;t say Tolkien’s books were much at all in the same vein as Lewis’s.')
