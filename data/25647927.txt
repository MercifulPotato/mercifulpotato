The inability to admit failure, limitation and falibility. This is why Fauci and friends always couch their responses to criticism with dismissive explanations.<p>I&#x27;m constantly frustrated with the unimpeachable self-confidence that&#x27;s so pervasive now. It&#x27;s only worse when their failures are so apparent.')
