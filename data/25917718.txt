Presumably they had a plan for getting that return prior to the purchase. Obviously it&#x27;s not going according to plan now - they had a plan for CentOS and instead it has been destroyed. If I were IBM, I&#x27;d be taking a step back to understand things better before screwing things up more, because there is obviously a disconnect.<p>I think the IBM Redhat purchase could have been a very good thing if handled properly. CentOS was actually a feature of RHEL in a way, but no more.')
