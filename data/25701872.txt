Item(by='ChrisLomont', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610210746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25690104, text='&gt;if another state isn&#x27;t going to verify signatures to make sure there are no fraudulent ballots<p>Because states don&#x27;t have that right, in the same way France cannot reject an election in the UK. States are independent in this sense.<p>Next - all this claim of fraud is simply ignorant nonsense. Every state has public records of who voted. Every election lots of govt agencies and research groups sample these to find this claimed fraud ignorant people keep claiming. Trump and co immediately went through these and found no fraud - how do you know this? Because immediately they started releasing names of a few they claimed were fraudulent votes, such as claiming a voter was dead but voted, and in each case the media showed the Trump team the claim was wrong - there was another with the same name, or the voter voted then died, etc. They got these names from looking at the lists of who actually voted and trying to find discrepancies. They could not. They likely even polled people on phones or email or whatever, and again found none. Otherwise they would have reported that statistical sampling shows the claimed outcome does not match statistical samples. This would be proof, easy enough to demonstrate, and irrefutable. But it didn&#x27;t exist.<p>So, after team Trump didn&#x27;t find any fraudulent votes from sampling, which is the correct and the most reliable way to demonstrate fraud, they turned to the smoke and mirrors claims, which you keep repeating.<p>Now, if you want to continue those claims, why not simply demonstrate fraud from the state voter lists? It&#x27;s pure math that you can sample these, then poll people you sample, and see if there was fraud.<p>There was not enough fraud to remote affect the election. This is the proof, and it was tried (and is still being studied by research teams like after each and every election).<p>As a final point - Trump raised around $200M on the back of his fraud claims, supposedly to help fight legal cases, but the money went in to Trump pockets instead of cases. If he thought there was really fraud, why didn&#x27;t he use this money for the cases? Because he knew it was a lie, but one that would raise money for him.')
