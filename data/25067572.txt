Was using Linux for quite some time before that.<p>I still run Linux on servers and some old computers (my 2011 MBA runs Linux and is probably sitting next to the sofa).<p>I don’t miss much. There are some things initially I had that I wanted to recreate.<p>I missed conky showing me info on the desktop and I tried to use... geektool? for that. But now I just have a widget on the menu bar with system info and I have some scripts I can run that give me whatever else I need easily enough.<p>Moving OS after a long time, you’ll want to figure how to do things the same way as you’re used to. That’s the only major thing.<p>But how do I feel? No driver issues, no battery issues, no performance issues.<p>Honestly, on a laptop at least, there are so many drivers and a MacOS supports theirs great. The trackpad is amazing and I miss it when I use someone else’s Linux machine.<p>I don’t miss much. The transition was simple. Using homebrew to install the GNU tools is a must but remember this if you build tools to share with other coworkers on macOS. That’s a big one. BetterTouchTool is a must for me.<p>If you have an iPhone, the integration is great too.')
