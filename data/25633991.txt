Vaccine production for both the US approved mRNA vaccines is highly specialized and those companies are heavily incentivized to deliver vaccines as soon as possible since they have a de-facto duopoly for an unknown amount of time. Testing supplies are a probably a lot more scalable, but I haven&#x27;t heard about supply shortages with tests in months.<p>The areas where executive policy <i>could</i> make a difference are timelines for approval of additional vaccines and optimizing vaccine delivery to hit the highest number of individuals as soon as possible. Prioritizing quick approval and distribution of the Oxford&#x2F;AZ vaccine and doing the same for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine when data becomes available would likely save thousands of lives over the next few months, but neither the current nor future US administrations seem to be taking an interest in this.')
