I was just &quot;too smart&quot; to sit in class bored all day or whatever. I&#x27;m trying to question that narrative. The burst of focus and creativity might be great, but I wonder if the sibling commenter is right that I could be missing out on vast, untapped potential and I might not lose the upside.
