The author also comes dangerously close to Lysenkoism where he says that &quot;we evolved by interacting and adapting to our environment&quot;. An unforgivable sin in my book and sloppy beyond belief.<p>Then there is the missing data. Aaron Brown&#x27;s review on amazon [1] puts it best:<p><i>&quot;Another chart shows number of heartbeats per lifetime of &quot;animals&quot; versus weight. It looks constant, because the range seems to be about 30 million to 150 million, but the vertical scale runs from 100 to one trillion. &quot;Animals&quot; turns out to be a few selected mammals (whales are listed twice with different values). If you go to the paper, the author emphasizes that the interest is in the deviations from the typical relation shown by the animals on the chart; the chart only shows the typical animals. So far from a universal constant in nature, we find that a subset of mammals happen to have values within a factor of five, with other mammals and non-mammals outside that range, but missing from the chart even though the vertical axis is scaled to accommodate them.<p>A better chart shows metabolic rate versus weight (here labeled &quot;mass&quot; despite being the same scale as the previous graph). This includes selected mammals and birds, and does illustrate rough linearity in log-log space. But here the main interest is in the slope of the line rather than the linearity. Metabolic rate increases not linearly with mass but at about the 3&#x2F;4 or perhaps 2&#x2F;3 power. This is key, because a lot of things also go up with powers of mass and people disagree on which ones of them are important for setting the metabolic rate.<p>Finally, there is a chart purporting to show that net income and assets of companies are linear in log-log space with number of employees. This is clearly nonsense. Technology companies often have hundreds of thousands of dollars of net income per employee, and few assets, while retailers have an order of magnitude lower profits per employee but much higher assets. There are companies that own and lease things with huge assets and few employees, and service companies that own nothing but a few desks and computers with many employees. It turns out if you read the notes at the back of the book that the 22 points are actually averages of over 30,000 companies (by the way, page, chapter and figure numbers are wrong in the notes, but I assume this will be corrected before publication). So all the chart tells us is when you average over large numbers of companies of different types but similar size, you get similar relations of employees to income and assets as the average for large numbers of companies of a different size.&quot;</i><p>These would be de-rigueur for a journalist without a science&#x2F;math background but Geoffrey West is a physicist, albeit a theoretical one.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;customer-reviews&#x2F;RQT3GP7W8NUFL&#x2F;ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;customer-reviews&#x2F;RQT3GP7W8NUFL&#x2F;ref...</a>')
