For example firewalls used to be kernel extensions. Now they use explicit APIs and no longer run in kernel space. One could say that it allows for more stable operating system. But on the other hand macOS now by-passes firewalls for its own services and this feature was abused to by-pass firewall with ordinary programs.')
