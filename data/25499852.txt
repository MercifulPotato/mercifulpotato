If I watch Tintin because it’s a cozy throwback to my childhood, that does not mean I would like every single Studio Ghibli movie in my recommendations.<p>Similarly, if I play Blacklist in the background as basically noise, I don’t want to see a bunch of related shows. I guess I could give it a thumbs down but I only do that for actually terrible movies.<p>Also Spotify and Apple music seem to have okay recommendations')
