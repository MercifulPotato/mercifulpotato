Neither of those two tweets encourages violence in any way. What am i missing? The two listed tweets are:<p><pre><code>   “The 75,000,000 great American\n   Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA\n   FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT\n   AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE\n   long into the future. They will\n   not be disrespected or treated\n   unfairly in any way, shape or\n   form!!!”\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>   “To all of those who have asked,\n   I will not be going to the\n   Inauguration on January 20th.”\n</code></pre>\nSo where do those encourage violence? First one lists how many people voted for him, and his idea that they support the country more than those who did not. Asinine, but not more inflammatory than most politicians say. The second is an answer to a question many have been asking. Also pretty harmless. Honestly, what am I missing?')
