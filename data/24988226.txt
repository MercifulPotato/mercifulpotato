Computer vision master students have been implementing ball tracking algorithms in first year courses since years. You usually combine some kind of feature detector (in this case probably a convolutional neural network, thus the &quot;AI&quot; naming) with some kind of state tracker like a Kalman filter. Getting the kinks out of the system is the hard part of course, which also pixellot seem not to have solved completely yet.')
