Especially in emerging markets.  You can&#x27;t create on these devices, they are designed only to consume.<p>No more curiosity driven discovery of programming.  You&#x27;re not allowed to extend your device, that is reserved for silicon valley elites who can afford an additional $1500 device.  So stop asking and just consume what they produce for you.')
