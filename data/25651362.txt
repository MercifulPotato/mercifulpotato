It cost $61,000.  My mortgage was at 9%.  Two years later, mortgage rates had dropped to 7%, and my house was worth 90,000 (state appraised value).  If I had bought the exact same house two years later than I did, I would have had the same monthly payment.  That stayed constant, and the interest rate change drove a change in total price.<p>Part of the reason is:  What is your alternative?  Typically, renting.  What&#x27;s rent?  A monthly payment.  So if you&#x27;re looking at a buy vs. rent decision, a big part of the decision is monthly expense of renting vs monthly expense of buying.')
