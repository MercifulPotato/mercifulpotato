I do wonder if there is a fundamental difference between applications and infrastructure. Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that applications tend to involve a greater share of non-engineering users (and therefore a greater reliance on someone else to host and manage the service)? Food for thought. GitLab is a great company, and I&#x27;ve read a lot of your strategy documents; it&#x27;s a wonder you publish so much in the open, and I&#x27;m grateful for it.')
