My linux subsystem is as stable as I want it to be, I have full control over it. It takes a bit of time to get used to the Windows world and find the good GUI tools, but once you get more familiar with it things work ok. And Windows doesn&#x27;t break my system with every upgrade the way macOS does (the things that change over time are mostly UI updates, not fundamental changes).<p>That&#x27;s not for everybody, but after ~1.5 year I can say I&#x27;m satisfied with my choice, WSL has really been a game changer.')
