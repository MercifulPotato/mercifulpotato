My point is that with Go, I just have to execute my single binary and I&#x27;m good to go.<p>I don&#x27;t see how your point is relevant. I mean, with interpreted languages you need to run the interpreter, but if having to write an additional word or line of code bothers you that much then you should not worry about it if you dockerize the app or, god forbid, use a launcher script. I mean, in non land no one ever complained about how hard it is to add scripts to mom&#x27;s start and prestarte targets to launch a server by doing mpm start. So why is this suddenly relevant with Go?')
