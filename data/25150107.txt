This is unheard of in a mass-marketed personal computer; I&#x27;m not sure this has ever happened before. Commodore used the 6502 CPU from subsidiary MOS Technology in its computers from 1977 onward, but I don&#x27;t think MOS ever produced RAM, and certainly not integrated into the CPU like this. TI used its own CPU in the 99&#x2F;4A, but not sure if TI ever produced RAM and, again, there was no RAM&#x2F;CPU integration like M1.')
