Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611686442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916948, text='&gt; even in Saudi Arabia, the government officially disapproved and tried the people who did it for murder.<p>So that it could save MBS&#x27;s ass when his people questioned why the rest of the world was hating on him. A lot of people in Saudi Arabia were shocked by the gruesome nature of the murder (which American media deftly used to sling shit on them, since Khashoggi was one of their own). If Khashoggi was some ordinary low profile Saudi citizen, and not distantly related to the Royal family and being from a wealthy family himself, his death would have been pretty routine in Saudi Arabia. It&#x27;s an open secret that Prince Bonesaw ordered the killing, and that the later execution was a farce. Even then, I suspect the execution was disposal for a sloppy job.')
