I prepare dinner from my family every night from scratch like I was a medieval artisan.<p>No you don&#x27;t. You go to a store and buy processed ingredients that have satisfied numerous legal requirements and inspections to ensure product safety, which are enforced by a vast bureaucracy. The store you bought your ingredients from offered many product options, including food from other countries. In the medieval period you would not be able to afford anything that was not grown further than a few miles from your home unless you were rich.<p>You prepared those ingredients in your home, which has electricity and running water, and a stove and oven that you can turn on with a knob instead of starting a wood fire. You don&#x27;t share your home with livestock.<p>If you are unwilling to prepare your meals with a knife (even though all of the meat has already been cut into &quot;cuts of meat&quot; for you), you can buy food processors, blenders, meat slicers, and other contraptions to make things as easy as possible.<p>To say that your food preparation is similar to the way people did it before the Industrial Revolution is ridiculous.')
