This isn&#x27;t new territory: we&#x27;ve contained infectious diseases before, like SARS and ebola, and average Joe didn&#x27;t need a mask then, either.<p>The CDC (and frankly every major government in the world) believed that covid-19 could be contained, and that no major outbreak would happen inside their country. This was incorrect. But if you hold this assumption, the CDC made the correct recommendation: N95 masks, properly worn, are the masks that protect against covid-19, and average people don&#x27;t need them.')
