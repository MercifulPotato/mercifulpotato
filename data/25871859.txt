If they hadn&#x27;t, many likely wouldn&#x27;t and the nation would not be what it is?<p>Anything else is &#x27;changing the terms&#x27;, and that is very likely to result in a lot of chaos - since it would be unconstitutional, unless you got 3&#x2F;4&#x27;s of the states to go along with it.<p>Pretty unlikely, since most of the states benefit from this arrangement?')
