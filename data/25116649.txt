Is there proof getting covid grants lifetime immunity? If not, how does that effect the plan if we assume that everyone gets covid at least once a year? Every year you now have a chance of dying from Covid, and overall life expectancy is chopped globally. Are you ok with 250k deaths a year from covid every year going forward? \nWhy would people spend more if the virus just keeps going?\nAgain, my state has no restrictions in place that I am aware of and no one is spending and businesses are closing.\nThat does not seem like a great plan.<p>I think a better plan is to keep the virus under control, prevent needless deaths and then get vaccinated, especially now when we are so close to a vaccine release. Why risk the lives of tens of thousands of people when we can just all wear a mask and get vaccinated?')
