If anything I&#x27;d love more posts like this from people who are tinkering with things.<p>If you remove the DigitalOcean part though and add in a home PC you do then get the benefits of being able to just connect. No port forwards, no faff.<p>If we&#x27;re really really unironically asking why.. because Tailscale wants more customers, it&#x27;s what companies do.')
