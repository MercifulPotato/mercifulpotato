A study done 100 years ago is likely to be even worse.<p>But even were it not, we have to ask:<p>- What study?<p>- Was it published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal?<p>- How large was the study?<p>- Was it double-blind?<p>- Were the results statistically significant?<p>When even very recent studies are mentioned on HN, they&#x27;re often torn apart for not having met one or more of these and other criteria.<p>Yet at other times mere mention of &quot;a study&quot;, some anonymous study done 100 years ago, published who knows where, of completely unknown quality is supposed to be given credence just because it&#x27;s &quot;a study&quot;?')
