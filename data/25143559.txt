I, a fully-formed and functioning adult, <i>feel</i> the pull in my brain.  I was addicted to cigarettes in my 20s and I&#x27;ve had unhealthy relationships with numerous other drugs and video games that I&#x27;ve (mostly) managed to pull myself away from, after years.  The feeling of &quot;checking your notifications&quot; and &quot;scrolling through twitter&quot; on your phone are <i>remarkably</i> similar to the compulsion for drugs.  This is my personal subjective experience and I believe objective research confirms it as well.')
