Every service in question is a private company. Every service used had a TOS. Freedom of speech does not extend to private establishments. Just as you cannot come into my home or business and be racist, without me kicking you out, these businesses are allowed to do the same. Failure to recognize this is intentionally ignoring a key component of reality and seems to be counter to the claims of supporting a free market that those screaming the loudest always say is important. Your argument is not sensible, it is either naive or intentionally misleading to support a narrative of victimhood.')
