To their credit at least it was a bit better than war games, where it just locks in one character at a time. Where this one could maybe construe that it started with some hash of the pin stored on the machine and accessible via the card reader in reverse..., and they were maybe factoring it. Still an awesome scene and by far my favorite james cameron movie.')
