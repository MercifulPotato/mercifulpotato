What is the relevance of this project? While it is always great to see Linux DE&#x27;s&#x2F;projects living on, this is just another project which sadly fragments the Linux desktop ecosystem even further. I agree, we need more Linux apps (Before electron apps take over the entire Linux DE), not distro&#x27;s or DE&#x27;s (checkout <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makealinux.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makealinux.app&#x2F;</a>). And if you are still adamant on creating a new DE, make it interoperable between other DE&#x27;s. Remember <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;</a> ?<p>Also, things have changed:<p>- KDE 5 plasma is lighter than GNOME.<p>- GNOME became a project with zero regards to the community. But is breaking less since the last few releases.<p>- You have so many &quot;traditional DE&#x27;s&quot;. XFCE, Mate, Solus DE, Cinnamon, Deepin DE.<p>I agree with someone who have said that none of the new GUI have made him&#x2F;her&#x2F;they productive. My progression for productivity through DE&#x27;s has been GNOME for 10ish years, KDE 5 for 1.5, Another 1.5 years in XFCE and now I use i3wm. Looks like you focus more on functionality as you become a mature user and less on the bells and whistles.<p>- Moved from GNOME after using from 3.0 till 3.22 because of crashing. It is better now.<p>- Moved from KDE because every update on my rolling release distro was a panic attack due to the bizzilion dependencies each software depends on. Not to mention it could be a security disaster. just install Okular or Korganizer to see what I am talking about. Krita has been the only exception I have noticed.<p>- Window managing has been the bottleneck in XFCE, it is the best for a rolling release distribution. So now I use i3wm. I only see a gradual transition to Swaywm now since Xorg is breathing it&#x27;s last few, so I will have to move from i3wm.<p>So I ask again, what is the point of Trinity? What is it bringing? We need to start seeing Linux as the future since big corporates are moving to Linux more. I would like to see Trinity resources going to KDE which is so much better now. But hey, that is just me.')
