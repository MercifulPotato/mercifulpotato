If your experience has been that they are missing, then that is most likely because no one has added them to OSM for the area&#x27;s in which you have looked.<p>But the good part about OSM is that anyone, including you, can add those details, and they appear in the main map within seconds to minutes of someone adding them.  So you could help rectify the missing situation by adding some of that missing data.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to learn all the OSM details, and provided some background details are present (generally building outlines for address data questions) one easier way to help add the data is via StreetComplete (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;StreetComplete" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;StreetComplete</a>).  It asks simple questions, you enter the answer, and the app handles the low-level OSM tagging changes based upon the answer given.')
