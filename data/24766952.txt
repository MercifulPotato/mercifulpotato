The goal of fallowing is to allow the land to recover and store organic matter while retaining moisture and disrupting the lifecycles of pathogens by temporarily removing their hosts.<p>Fallow fields also tend to be good habitat for small mammals, which in turn draws in birds of prey and stuff and provides habitat for them.<p>These guys go a step further<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deltafarmland.ca&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deltafarmland.ca&#x2F;</a><p>They work with farmers and pay them to actually plant native grasses and nitrogen fixing cover crops for a couple years to allow natural habitat to develop.<p>As far as I remember, those farmers tend to have a couple fields they rotate every 4 years or so.
