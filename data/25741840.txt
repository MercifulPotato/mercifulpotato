Use public key signature tech to stop worrying about mistakenly logging a secret. If you never had it, you can&#x27;t lose it.<p>If you were to log literally every byte of the plaintext traffic when I sign into GitHub (e.g. maybe you&#x27;re a GitHub ops person), you don&#x27;t get the ability to sign into GitHub as me. There&#x27;s a WebAuthn signature step, my signature is authentic, and you can even verify that from your log if you want, but you&#x27;d need to make a <i>new</i> signature to sign in, and you can&#x27;t do that because the key needed to make my signature never left my hands.<p>Even better, GitHub defuses their liability because as well as a (presumably hashed) password that could be broken by a hypothetical attacker they&#x27;ve got a public key for me, and learning that public key doesn&#x27;t help the attacker do anything, at their site or anywhere else. Even - unlike with the SSH public keys GitHub holds - to identify people, since WebAuthn public keys are deliberately uncorrelated you can&#x27;t match my GitHub key against a Facebook key for example.')
