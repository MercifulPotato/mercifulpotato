That is, I think it seems more natural to say that for each x in the collection, that x \\in (B(y_1) intersect B(y_2) intersect B(y_3)),  \nrather than saying that ({y_1} union {y_2} union {y_3}) subset A(x) .<p>Or, if we give the name W to the collection we are talking about, we could say that &quot;W subset (B(y_1) intersect B(y_2) intersect B(y_3))&quot;.\nThis seems to me a fairly natural way to say &quot;all the W , y_1 , y_2, and y_3&quot; (&quot;each of my 3 pokemon can do reading, writing, and arithmetic&quot;) .<p>The other way would end up more like, &quot;({y_1} union {y_2} union {y_3}) subset (the intersection over all x in W, of A(x))&quot;.<p>This works, but seems less natural to me.<p>Also, especially in the case where you expect X to be substantially larger than Y.')
