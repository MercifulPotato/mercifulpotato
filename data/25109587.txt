Doctors are particularly unaware about gout. Despite having extremely painful and long attacks (during one attack, spent more than a month in bed unable to walk), all the doctors I saw had no idea despite endless tests. Finally based on my own research I suggested gout and they were like &quot;oh yes, I suppose it could be that&quot;.<p>Once diagnosed, doctors are quick to get you on daily drugs for the rest of your life. While these help, there&#x27;s a price to be paid in liver damage from chronic medication.<p>I spent the next ~8 years bouncing from attack to attack despite the drugs, sometimes every few weeks, sometimes months would go by. Finally around 2012 I stumbled on the work of Robert Lustig (UCSF medicine professor) and particularly this talk (not about gout, but touches on it):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dBnniua6-oM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dBnniua6-oM</a><p>Fructose is processed by the body into: uric acid.  Finally light bulb moment! I hardly ate any of the things traditionally associated with gout (red meat, shellfish) so couldn&#x27;t modify my diet based on those. But fructose? Yes, turns out I was consuming way too much.<p>I drastically cut back on fructose, limiting myself to no more than 10g&#x2F;day. I have been gout-free now for 7 years. I don&#x27;t take any gout drugs anymore. Just avoid fructose at all cost.')
