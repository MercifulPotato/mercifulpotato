Gta has cars, motorcycles, helicopters, planes, blimps, atvs, and iirc bicycles. Cyberpunk has cars. I&#x27;ve seen motorcycles but I haven&#x27;t seen that I can ride them yet. I&#x27;ve seen flying car type things too but again no evidence I can drive them. Same for blimps.<p>Gta lets me enter buildings and do things like bowl, play darts, pool, whatever. Get a drink at a bar, iirc. Strip clubs. Again, not too far at the game, but I tried going to a bar in Cyberpunk and it was like buying a drink in skyrim. It simply appeared in my inventory and that&#x27;s that. I visited a hooker and he fucked me and that was kinda fun I guess, but not as interactive as a gta strip club.<p>Cops. I&#x27;ve seen a funny video in Cyberpunk where someone sniped someone from a roof and cops teleported behind him (nothing personel, kid). In GTA the cops have to actually arrive in some form of transportation to respond to your crimes.<p>So those are my main complaints, but only because we&#x27;re comparing to gta here. On its own I actually enjoy Cyberpunk more than gta, but I do so fully cognizant of its flaws. I still have fun though.')
