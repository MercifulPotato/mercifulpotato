Maybe not a hard science, but there are honest ambitions to understand the world. Much of it is historical, since it is based on narratives that are taken to explain observed phenomena. The models are then vague and unprecise.<p>However, government officials and their experts are not pursuing science. They are literally trying to change the state of a system by intervening. The use of academic language is more of an instrument in this, rather than anything to do with science.<p>I even find the phrasing &quot;the economics profession&quot; (referring to government officials) problematic since obscures policy making in language that sounds scientific.')
