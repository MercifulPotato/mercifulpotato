I believe it will take years of engineering-driven investment (upgrade lines; trim trees; clear flammables from the transmission corridors) to make power reliable in California again, but the California energy companies are bankrupt (again?) after judgments in recent years&#x27; wildfires.<p>I believe the reliability problem is worst in California and is less of a problem in other states and countries. (But offset in part by the large number of charging stations in metro areas, at least in SFBA.)<p>That said, a replacement doesn&#x27;t need to be as reliable as its predecessor, it only needs to be reliable enough. Cell phones, for example, will go down a few hours after a power outage, whereas POTS phones were engineered to stay up (and provide power <i>to</i> corded phones) during power outages and weather events. Cell phones are more convenient.<p>EVs have two nice properties: faster acceleration than gas cars (which some view as a safety feature), and they&#x27;re cheaper to fuel than gas cars. This can tip the balance in favor of an EV for day-to-day use.<p>If you are prepping, I think it still makes sense to have at least one conventional gas-powered car. Just make sure to keep the tank at least 3&#x2F;4s full; gas pumps tend to go down during blackouts.')
