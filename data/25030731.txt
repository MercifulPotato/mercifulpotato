Item(by='k32', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604887088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030546, text='&gt; Any widely used distros do this.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to encounter another distro that deliberately breaks 3rd party software the way Nix did it to rebar3 (before it was reverted).<p>&gt; Plus, the statement that you have to patch all packages is false.<p>IIRC `patchShebangs&#x27; script runs for any package using stdenv.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d also like to add that nixpkgs has the most extensive testing for packages compared to any other distros I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Which distros? Can you share a comparison in number of tests&#x2F;coverage?<p>&gt; Dramatic, but again, simply not the case.<p>As other commenters mentioned, software written for GNU\\Linux often assumes FHS. NixOS breaks FHS, and has to patch soft to work around that.<p>&gt; This is a good thing.<p>How so?<p>&gt; This is a good thing. Manual patching for the most common problems isn&#x27;t sustainable, especially if you maintain a large number of packages. Just ask packages maintainers of any major distros.<p>Other major distros don&#x27;t break FHS, therefore they don&#x27;t need to patch trivial things like shebangs.<p>&gt; All packages in nixpkgs has a mandatory review process as you should very well know. As scary as you make it sound, I&#x27;m pretty sure at least one committer have taken a look at your code to see if there was anything malicious in it.<p>It depends on your threat model. Mine is stricter.<p>&gt; If this is the case, it wouldn&#x27;t be a security problem at all because the dependencies would have to be prefetched and their hashes precomputed.<p>Once again, it breaks the cryptographic chain of custody set by the upstream. In my threat model that&#x27;s not acceptable. I tend to trust the upstream more than the distro.<p>&gt; Why not store secrets in a private location, just like you would on any other distros???<p>Secret provisioning is by far the most difficult DevOps problem, and it can go catastrophically wrong for all too many reasons. Nix not only doesn&#x27;t help, but also introduces additional footguns with world-readable configuration files.<p>&gt; What is it that other distros have that Nix is missing?<p>Other distros have FHS. FHS accounts for secret management, among other things.<p>&gt; Yes, it saves me from having to do a clean install of my system every few months.<p>Ok, though I never had to do a clean install of GNU\\Linux either on my dev machine.')
