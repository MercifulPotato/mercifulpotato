Until you think about it a little bit and if they were faster there would not be multiple versions.<p>Real-time versions of products are created because sometimes performance is achieved by means of stochastic processes or amortizing costs and you need to remove these optimizations to be able to support deadlines.<p>Real-time programming emphasizes ability to calculate how long an operation will take as more valuable than raw performance.')
