Right here in this commend edit form.<p>&gt; delete everything from the cursor to the next closing bracket<p>This seems slightly interesting but not really. Many good text editors would highlight the matching bracket and it usually is just a tiny bit more slow to delete everything to that point.<p>&gt; &#x27;dip&#x27; to delete the whole paragraph around the cursor(&quot;delete in paragraph&quot;)<p>Hardly ever needed this in my entire life.<p>&gt; And of course you can tell it to repeat those operations by entering a number beforehand, or just repeat the last operation by pressing &#x27;.&#x27;.<p>I know but can&#x27;t imagine a use case for this.<p>I actually want to master Vim, let me be sincere, just to look more cool and professional, impress the boss and feel more of a hacker but that&#x27;s not enough of motivation for me and I&#x27;m desperate to find anything in it which would actually feel handy.')
