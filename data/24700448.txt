Communication Skills - Clearly understanding what others are saying and expressing one&#x27;s opinion in a polite, and respectful manner is a skill one must master. Most of the time it&#x27;s better to listen first rather than talking first.<p>2. Prioritization - Learn to prioritize and sometimes to say &quot;NO&quot; to people.<p>3. Delegation - One cannot do everything by oneself. Learn to delegate and get help from others.<p>4. Whenever you do some task, always question why am I doing this, why this needs to be done in a certain manner and learn all the background(domain specific) knowledge related to the task.<p>5. Learn how to debug - I cannot stress enough how important this is. Most of the time you would spend maintaining, coding, and changing, legacy&#x2F;existing code written by someone else. If you do not know how to debug and follow the trail like Enola Holmes, you&#x27;d always have to depend on the help of others which is very inconvenient for you as well as for others.<p>Apart from that as mentioned in the other answers it&#x27;s always good to be a smart cookie, but it&#x27;s not essential.')
