Some foods will trigger my inflammation (many of the ones on your list), however it often requires multiple overlapping stressors or triggers. So on any given day, eat one bad food item it&#x27;s a yellow flag. Eat two bad food items I&#x27;m on a red flag condition. Or perhaps it&#x27;s work stress and food, etcetera.<p>The reason for the yellow&#x2F;red flag system is to not impose a strict limit, but as a way to inform myself I&#x27;m in a danger zone. Primarily because many foods I love (<i>ahem</i> brownies!) are a flagged food. Telling myself &quot;no&quot;, when I&#x27;m stressed or foggy state, often fails. However a &quot;red&quot; flag state helps bring out my inner engineer: “Can&#x27;nae take any more, Captain!”')
