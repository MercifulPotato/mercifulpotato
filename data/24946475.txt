I can&#x27;t really speak to his career before he came to UT Austin in 1984, he was already very famous (Bjarne Stroustroup at Texas A&amp;M&#x2F;Columbia or Brian Kernighan at Princeton famous); if I remember, his chair was created for him as a full professor and without many of the usual duties of a professor. (One of his stipulations was that he not be made Chairman of the department.)<p>According to the article, as a young researcher, he was<p>* A &quot;programmer&quot; (something like a research assistant, perhaps?) at the Mathematisch Centrum (Mathematical Centre) in Amsterdam.<p>* Professor in the mathematics department of the Eindhoven University of Technology from 1962-1973. (As I understand, the &quot;external funding&quot; thing is less of a problem in mathematics. Also, I have no idea how tenure works there.)<p>* Finally, research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation.<p>It&#x27;s true, he didn&#x27;t have many direct PhD students (two?!), but his collaborations were many. (I don&#x27;t know if the Tuesday Morning Group at UT is still active,[1] but it was rather well known and its members produced a great deal of what is now &quot;theoretical computer science&quot;.)<p>If you&#x27;re trying to compare Dijkstra to J. Random Young Researcher, J&#x27;s gonna have a hard time any way you look at it.<p>[1] UT no longer requires automata theory or formal logic for CS undergraduates. They&#x27;re dead to me.')
