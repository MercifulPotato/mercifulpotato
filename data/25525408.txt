If it went over ethernet it wouldn&#x27;t be airdrop.<p>Long answer:<p>Airdrop does discovery via bluetooth. To send a file, the two devices connect via bluetooth to negotiate the details of a new ad-hoc wifi connection, which they then create, connect to, and use for the transfer.<p>The discovery does not rely on a shared network, and once connected, the devices never &#x27;discuss&#x27; whether they already share a network, so it&#x27;s WIFI or nothing.<p>This gives some security guarantees that wouldn&#x27;t exist otherwise. EG: Airdrop won&#x27;t go through Starbucks&#x27; WIFI, even if both the sender &amp; receiver are connected to it. Honestly I&#x27;m not sure how important those guarantees are -- but they&#x27;re there.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a fundamental barrier stopping Apple from:<p>1. Having devices advertise an &#x27;airdrop-box&#x27; through Bonjour as well as though bluetooth LE,<p>2. Including these entires in the Airdrop UI<p>3. De-duping entries where it figures out that a network device is the same as a bluetooth device.<p>4. Running same-network transfers through SMB rather than using [what they currently call] Airdrop to negotiate an ad-hoc WIFI network.<p>...but they haven&#x27;t done so.')
