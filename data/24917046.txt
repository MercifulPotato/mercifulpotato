I was so surprised that the vocal commenters thought it best to return all artifacts to their rightful owners. I tried to point out that one person&#x27;s rightful owner is another&#x27;s despot, and what about all the examples of things being destroyed at the hands of poor stewardship? The main retort was &quot;New Zealand is not some backwater country&quot; which of course I agree but where do you draw the line? That&#x27;s when I backed away slowly realizing the frothing mob was not interested in preserving shared history as much as revenge&#x2F;retribution for colonial slights.')
