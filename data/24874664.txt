It comes down to the legal definition of &quot;abridged&quot;, &quot;denied&quot;, and &quot;crimes&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, in the present political climate, any reasonable interpretation of these words that hurts the representation of states with regressive voting laws would be seen as an act of politics.<p>The nice thing about my proposed hack, is that it also incentivizes decriminalization, or at least allowing a broader class of humans in your state to vote. In this way, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the 14th amendment is well-enforced, because it changes the goal posts.<p>So, while it might not give felons the vote (this would violate the 14th), it will encourage the dissolution of our current &quot;justice&quot; system that arbitrarily incarcerates people.<p>If your state incarcerates people for &quot;driving while black&quot;, it is effectively diluting its representation in the congress and electoral college.')
