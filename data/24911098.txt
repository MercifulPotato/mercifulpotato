FPGAs are much more promising for real-time systems, particularly those with very large incoming datasets to transform or otherwise process in parallel. Thinking about FPGAs in terms of how &#x27;quickly&#x27; they process data is really missing the point IMO.<p>One common, and very good application for FPGAs is for use in Active Electronically Scanned Array radar, sonar, or camera image processing. You can perform parallel filtering and transforms with various frequency and phase settings, which would be impossible for a similarly-sized processor to do.<p>FPGAs have the potential to revolutionize sensor arrays, by making them much more useful and affordable.')
