It would know when to take the rubbish out, to keep the lights off if I&#x27;m sleeping in, and if I want some coffee.  It would do all of this offline, without dialling home and without my life collapsing if the system fails or the power goes out.<p>If this sounds too far fetched, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s really smart!')
