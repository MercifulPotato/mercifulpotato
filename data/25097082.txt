I find the whole thing pointless. I&#x27;m uninterested in personal details or meta aspects of the conversation. I am only interested in the topic.<p>Your initial comment was on the definition of the word &quot;powerful&quot; your subsequent comment was on meta aspects of the discussion which I find very tangential.')
