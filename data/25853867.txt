They are populated still but the architecture points clearly to a time when there was so much more going on in the area.<p>My grandmother lived in Llandudno, and the town is the acme of that. So many incredibly grand hotels, arcades, and so on, all now tatty and grim. Some cousins were staying at the Grand Hotel, the biggest and boldest hotel, up on the side of the peninsula. The bedsheets were dirty and the rooms stank.<p>I have no idea what you could do about any of this.')
