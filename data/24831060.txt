Would Signal really be better if, instead of having a secure messenger available to the masses, it spent massive amounts of time implementing the things these people want? No. I would be comfortable recommending Signal (or WhatsApp) to a nontechnical friend and communicating with them on it, with the expectation of a certain level of privacy. I spend a lot of time on Hacker News and consider myself a very technical person, and I&#x27;m not sure I trust myself to use Matrix in a forward-secure way where it&#x27;s at right now. If everybody spent the time they spent complaining about Signal working on getting Matrix or whatever to a point where it was usable... well, frankly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be much better off than it is right now, but it seems more likely to bring about results to me than endlessly lobbying to have Moxie do _the thing he thinks cannot be freaking done right_. Right now, Signal exists and can be used securely (given certain common threat profiles) by the typical smartphone user. I&#x27;m really tired of people comparing the security that Signal offers to the security of imagined hypothetical messengers.')
