Cuddling a cat could evoke a man as nurturer, where standing with a dog (a real doggy dog) is evokes the hunter&#x2F;protector.<p>Comparing a tiger to a cat would require the person having knowledge of tigers which wouldn&#x27;t be universal if you go back a few centuries, so that would have to be a learned&#x2F;cultural idea.
