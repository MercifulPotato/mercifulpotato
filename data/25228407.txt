It&#x27;s a good design idea to use a declarative language for this, as it helps with GUI design tooling (drag-and-drop editors), and eliminates the bugs that could arise from doing the work &#x27;by hand&#x27; in a programming language. Most solutions end up parsing XML (or something similar) at runtime, rather than compiling down to an optimised binary. It&#x27;s possible to &#x27;have it all&#x27;, in this instance.')
