Nobody that I saw were actually suggesting people do it - they were quoting (or referring to) what was being said by those at the Capitol, and then commenting on it.<p>I don’t see a double standard for those cases, although they did subsequently remove it the trend.  Possibly because some people might have been calling for it in the “latest” tab - not a fun place looking at tweets outside the featured tab...')
