Like if you posted a ton of helpful comments and zero posts, you wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to post a link you made yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with promoting blog posts or apps you&#x27;ve made yourself unless it&#x27;s really excessive. How are people supposed to get started otherwise? It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re a huge tech site, a big newspaper etc. because people will auto-post your new posts to try to earn some karma but who is going to do that when you&#x27;ve only got a handful of readers?')
