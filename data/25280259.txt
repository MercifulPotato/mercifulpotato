From the article:<p>&gt; α = 1&#x2F;137.03599920611. (The last two digits are uncertain.)<p>Implications: this constant underpins much of why the universe is the way it is. A tiny bit higher or lower would result in drastically different universes. Measuring it more precisely allows scientists to make more accurate predictions and hence rule out &#x2F; refine potential models of our universe.')
