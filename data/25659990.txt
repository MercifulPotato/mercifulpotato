I inherited my mom&#x27;s phone number years ago and recently had to dump it when I swapped my data plan. It honestly feels like the best thing that ever happened to me b&#x2F;c I used to get daily spam calls and since getting the new number have gotten maybe 1 spam call total in the past two years, so had planned to change my number more frequently going forward.')
