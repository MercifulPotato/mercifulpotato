Different life stages (I’d be surprised if the author is over 26).<p>Maybe that style of dry humor is off-putting and associated with a specific age to you, but I find it to be timeless.<p>The author&#x27;s in her mid 30s, and there are numerous other older people who use a similar sardonic wry sense of humor well, from David Sedaris to the kindhearted kvetching of old jewish grandmothers.<p>What you&#x27;re doing with this comment is both similar and different. You&#x27;re effectively saying &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t like it because I&#x27;m more mature; I can recognize that there&#x27;s a grain of truth in her self-depreciation, and by recognizing that, I&#x27;m better than her&quot;. Effectively, you&#x27;re aggrandizing yourself in the same way you accuse her of doing so, but without any of the humor.')
