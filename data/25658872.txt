Write up your approach and results in a nice digestible way on some project you found personally interesting and there are plenty of people here that will enjoy that.<p>Note that the difference between &quot;Here&#x27;s code I wrote that does X: &#x27;...&#x27;&quot; and what appears in this blog post is bigger than what you&#x27;re giving credit for. Documenting the process you went through from having an idea to arriving at a solution in a relatable and amusing way takes real effort. If you disagree, please, prove me wrong. Since if you do, you&#x27;d be a blogger I&#x27;d happily add to my regular reading.')
