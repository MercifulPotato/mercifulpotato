I happen to know quite a few of these folks that obsessively forward ugly politics, it is a real problem.  But I know quite a few incredibly smug folks from &quot;extreme&quot; left that do practically the same thing.<p>An example:  Many are the kind of folks that complained bitterly that people were going to California beaches early in the Covid crisis, &quot;because science&quot; (that they apparently didn&#x27;t understand).  They were clearly superior to those other folks and forwarded articles with carefully chosen photographs (taken at a 15-degree angle) which made the beach seem much more crowded than it really was.  A little applied spatial reasoning could see that the groups were several yards&#x2F;meters apart or more.<p>The first days the subject came up in the news I said, &quot;no one is getting this sitting alone in the ocean-breeze and sunshine&quot; and was attacked for it.  Guess what, a few months later that rule was rescinded, because it didn&#x27;t make sense.  Any apologies over the hysteria and name-calling?  Of course not.<p>Another example would be the housing crisis.  In every facebook thread regarding a new apartment building lefty nimbys come out of the woodwork to make comments that even an a high-school economics class graduate can see are backwards, regarding cause and effect.  I have other examples, but that&#x27;s enough for now.<p>TL;DR: Lefties don&#x27;t have a lock on reality, and your piece would be better recognizing that.')
