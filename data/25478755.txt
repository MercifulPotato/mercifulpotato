Wealth tax gathers funds from past and future actions, income tax only from future actions.<p>If you believe laws were totally fair in the past, then a wealth tax should be unfair now. Is that your stance? Has taxation been fair?<p>My stance is that the notion of private property is ingrained, we went to civil war due to private property of slaves, the french revolution was fomented due to financial problems due to untaxed private holdings of the church and wealthy people. Does having private property from the past mean it&#x27;s ours and no one can touch it?<p>History has shown that oligarchies and massive wealth disparities lead to negative societal outcomes. IMO, Taxes should generate revenue for public works and lower negative societal outcomes due to negative externalities, therefore wealth tax is fine with me in principle.')
