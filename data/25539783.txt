And that&#x27;s okay! The zen of Rust is not to eliminate unsafe code. That would require a compiler so ludicrously sophisticated that it would be borderline magical. The zen of Rust is to reduce unsafe code to the minimum, to have only 1% or 0.1% of your code that is unsafe and needs to be reviewed extra-super-duper-rigorously.')
