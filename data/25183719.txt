Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap is ~350b, which is about the same as JPM&#x27;s market cap, which is exactly what the purported utility aims to replace. Doesn&#x27;t seem far off to me. Bitcoin aims to make paper money obsolete, which aims to make banks obsolete. Bitcoin is therefore undervalued, assuming it is a valid replacement. $100k per BTC in 5 years is not unreasonable. 5 years ago, if someone said $20k per BTC in 5 years, you would call them crazy.')
