Defining champagne to be made in a specific region of France is a cop-out.  That is almost a meaningless definition because even within  the region there are different types and recipes being used. It’s not like they have magical grapes. Sure it might taste a little different due to regional differences but that doesn’t make it worse or even not champagne. Whether it’s quality has to do with the vineyard rather than the geographic region.<p>If it’s bad because it cuts corners and uses cheap ingredients then <i>that’s the problem</i>.')
