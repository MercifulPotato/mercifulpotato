In a wealthy area with a lot of stuff going for it, maybe a desalination plant makes perfect sense. Everyone in the city drinking non-potable water does so because they have judged it more practical than moving to a place with better water infrastructure.<p>If you get a million people to build a city in the Sahara and don&#x27;t build any infrastructure to get water to this city, of course they are going to have water shortages, but this does not suggest some global water crisis nor is a limited birth rate going to fix the problem. Likewise if someone sticks their head in a plastic bag they may run out of air, but that doesn&#x27;t mean air is any less abundant. There are some resources of which there is an actual scarcity such as arable land and energy sources, but water is not one of them.')
