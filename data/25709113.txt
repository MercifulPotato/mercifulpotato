So I feel that there&#x27;s some hypocrisy here, Twitter could probably let go of him as well if they for their own reasoning believe that Trump has incited violence. I feel that we often use different standards for internal politics than we do for geopolitics (we often look the other way when people do stuff elsewhere) Twitter might want to reconsider.')
