Kubernetes has reached that point for many folks.<p>I no longer have a detailed mental model of how my compiler or LLVM works, I just trust that it does. When was the last time you needed to (or were capable of) debugging a bug in your compiler? A couple of human generations of work went into making that happen.<p>Note that it turns out compiling code well, or making a reliable orchestration system, is an enormously <i>complex</i> problem. At some point, the complexity outstrips the ability of even generalists in the field to keep up, yet the systems keep getting more reliable.<p>So in these types of cases, you can either do it yourself poorly (you&#x27;re an amateur), do it yourself well (congrats, you&#x27;ve become an expert), or delegate.<p>This isn&#x27;t really limited to computing. I delegate maintenance on my car to a mechanic, while I&#x27;m pretty sure a generation ago, everybody (in the US) changed their own oil and understood how the carb worked. Times change.')
