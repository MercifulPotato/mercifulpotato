Not returning deposits).<p>The London metropolitan police jailed him, plenty of evidence and testimonies.\nHe was released nonetheless, he escaped to Dubai (where he has family), he came back to the UK and opened another real estate company doing the same scam under another name. I fished him using LinkedIn and checking his old LinkedIn contacts.<p>Metropolitan police was aware of everything as I was in touch with a detective.\nHe had the entire story, the new office location of the scammer, the website and photos showing the entire scam repeating itself and dropped the case.<p>The police has zero incentive to do anything about criminals, they just get more funding the worse criminality gets.\nA bail system is not perfect, but prevents people escaping, or at least collect some money from people who want to escape law.<p>This could be used to compensate victims, but I don&#x27;t have high hopes for the government ever doing that.<p>If we want to prevent innocents ending up in jail we could just make victimless crimes legal. Weirdly enough, nobody seems to get behind that.')
