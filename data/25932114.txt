There are numerous examples of software that has a successfull business model, and is GPL or GPL compatible. From WordPress to MySQL, and from ProtonMail to PostgreSQL (GPL compatible). Used in enterprise, and other large organisations, just fine.<p>It sounds like they are making up excuses for not wanting to fully Open Source their code; which is fine. But don&#x27;t blame upstream for your reluctance or inability to adhere to this.')
