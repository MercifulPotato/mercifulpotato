The Gods are really encoded symbols and personifications for various aspects of Cosmos (creation, maintenance, destruction, etc).<p>Some people seek into the mystical. Other people seek into science. Some people don&#x27;t seek, and for them there&#x27;s less logic. Logic though, can also be something that binds you to falsehoods. Revisiting first principles again and again is healthy, but really tough work.<p>Science and meditation should go hand in hand. Being brilliant is no safeguard against personal angst and delusions.<p><i>We don&#x27;t know yet</i>, is the perfectly fine answer. It&#x27;s OK to seek too, which is how people find new solutions.')
