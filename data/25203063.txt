The &quot;brine and dry&quot; part and the oil are the thing that really make a french fry; double frying isn&#x27;t <i>truly</i> necessary but that gives a point where mostly prepared half cooked fries can be frozen and finished whenever, which is nice.<p>Home frying in a stovetop pot is much harder than real kitchens with gas fired, dedicated fryers with multiple liter oil reserves. You dont keep temperature so much as have a wildly swinging temperature curve over and under the ideal range.')
