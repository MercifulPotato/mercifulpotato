One point to clarify on my post:<p>&gt; I find it interesting that you frame income inequality as &quot;wealth polarisation.&quot; Are you implying a bimodal distribution of some sort?<p>I wasn&#x27;t intending to equate distribution and polarisation.  By the latter, I meant the steady shift of wealth to a smaller population who have become progressively wealthier.  While, at the other end, the majority have beome comparatively less wealthy compared to equivalent social cohorts over time.<p>Perhaps more succinctly, it&#x27;s the _change_ in distribution, not the _presence_ of a distribution.<p>I&#x27;m no economist and I know there are a variety of opinions on distribution, but I understand there&#x27;s reasonable agreement that globalisation has increased polarisation [0].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Economic_inequality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Economic_inequality</a>')
