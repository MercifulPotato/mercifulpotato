(The abjectly lazy aside.) But we should also be free to work as hard as we want. And to freely associate with those with similar preferences.<p>I used to love burning both ends of the candle. It was invigorating. I didn&#x27;t ruin my health for it. And it gave me life lessons I could not have learned any other way. The fruits of those years, as well as finding other interests, nudged me to a different preference. Which involved new (or changed) colleagues. I don&#x27;t see why, to be satisfied with one arrangement, we must denigrate the other--they&#x27;re just different solutions.<p>Work and life don&#x27;t balance on a scale. The dynamic is more like homeostasis. One&#x27;s stable ratio depends on a variety factors, extrinsic and from within, and what makes one person happy will be ruinous or lethargic for another.')
