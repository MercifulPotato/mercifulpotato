It may feel good momentarily, but you&#x27;ll look in the mirror and wonder who&#x27;s in control of your life.  And why a couple months down the road you&#x27;re trying to slap lipstick on a pig and sell it to anyone who knocks.<p>It may be harder, but make that choice earlier and be what <i>you</i> want your company to be, not something else.')
