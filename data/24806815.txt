What they recommend is using Musescore to convert the MIDI to a score, fixing it up in Musescore and exporting as MusicXML. Musescore did a creditable but not perfect job of the conversion, but fixing it up was easy. Then you import both files into Piano Marvel. I&#x27;m actually not sure why they need the MIDI at all once you have the MusicXML, given that Musescore can play the music from the score directly.')
