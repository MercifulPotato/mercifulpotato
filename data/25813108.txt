Great DAC implementation. I use mine all the time.<p>I just don&#x27;t believe most people think the device is better without the headphone jack. It&#x27;s not a &quot;special use-case&quot;. Deleting the jack has definitely driven some sales for wireless headphones to people who don&#x27;t want to use the dongle, rather than a desire to get rid of the wire.<p>For some reason it&#x27;s very hard to find a cheap and solid way to charge via Lightning and use wired audio at the same time. My workaround is to charge after I&#x27;m done listening. Probably good for reducing phone use, but it can be annoying on occasion.')
