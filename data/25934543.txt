It won&#x27;t only be hedge funds left holding the bag.<p>Also, there is a worry about multiple hedge funds going bankrupt and causing a cascading effect when they are forced to close out other positions which would hurt average people. I&#x27;m not blaming WSB for this, the hedge funds got caught being greedy and deserve everything they&#x27;re getting, but we do need to try to prevent their failures from affecting the market as a whole.')
