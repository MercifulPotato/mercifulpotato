Files can only see types, values etc defined in files above them (and the same within files, with some caveats). This sounds really weird and annoying but turns out to have some surprising benefits (because it limits the mental&#x2F;real search space for definitions as well). In practice it&#x27;s just something that is surprising at first, then totally fine.')
