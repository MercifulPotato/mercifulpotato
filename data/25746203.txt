Item(by='GekkePrutser', descendants=None, kids=[25748115], score=None, time=1610456366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25744912, text='Yeah Matrix is great (I don&#x27;t like the Vector&#x2F;Riot&#x2F;Element client much though, I wish the other clients were a bit comparable in terms of their development as Element seems to take up most of the attention). It&#x27;s not very efficient with screen space, if you have a LOT of chats open (many bridges!) it&#x27;s hard to find what&#x27;s what.<p>But the E2E verifications I do find troublesome. I constantly have to re-verify contacts, it&#x27;s way too much in the way of smooth communication. I wish there was a way to auto-enable (but warn of a key change) them like Whatsapp does. It&#x27;s not as secure, but you really have to be a crypto geek to constantly compare fingerprints whenever they change or get added. I often log in to different devices (different browsers on machines at home, work, test phones etc). And everything has to be validated. Whatsapp and Signal handle this way way better. This way it just won&#x27;t make it to the mainstream. I can&#x27;t expect my contacts to click buttons every time I log into a new browser or clear my cookies.<p>In the end I just got sick of all these crypto warnings and I ended up switching to something else again. I re-try Matrix every once in a while but it&#x27;s still not there. Also, for me E2E crypto is not a major thing as I run my own server anyway (which I trust). But some of my friends want it switched on as they also use it on other chat apps.<p>PS: Not trying to blast Matrix here, but I do find this a problem for adoption. Otherwise I think it&#x27;s way better than any other chat app.')
