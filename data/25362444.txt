I&#x27;m very anti-censorship and I&#x27;m right there with you. It&#x27;s hard to not acknowledge that we have a serious problem - half of the political establishment is hallucinating a different reality, far beyond the normal out of touch hubris pushed by both teams. I believe the raw energy is coming from being fed up with the looting and control by the plutocrats (like everyone), but they&#x27;re being goaded in a completely nonsensical and destructive direction.<p>Every semi reputable editor (even Fox!) has put the brakes on this disinformation campaign, but it seems that doing so just makes the people believing it move on to even less credible feeds. Ultimately I think the hallucination can only die down on its own, but on the timescale of several years. Meanwhile the damage is being done right now. I just hope it&#x27;s all just so Trump can continue grifting and developing political capital to try avoiding jail, rather than some larger plan like deliberately inciting a civil war.<p>Previously if one ventured into Internet conspiracy theory land, their new belief would be tempered by their social circle. Now whatever wild thing manages to get enough attention also creates its own social proof. We&#x27;re essentially dealing with a violent mixture of the old and the new where digital non-natives are tuning into raw memetic noise while giving it the trust of the 1990&#x27;s evening news.<p>I would be curious to see how this played out in a parallel universe where section 230 had never existed, the MITM business never gained popularity, new media (&quot;tech&quot;) companies had to editorialize more like old media, and the anti-establishment action stayed on p2p nets with a higher barrier to entry.')
