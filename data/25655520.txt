In my opinion the only issue with UUIDs is that their standard textual representation can be very verbose and cumbersome in some scenarios.<p>A single ID takes over around 40 string characters in a line. That&#x27;s half the width of a default terminal&#x27;s width.<p>Thus the solution is obviously to use other textual representations. Instead of base16 then let&#x27;s ramp up the base to shorten up the text dump, and while we are at it let&#x27;s pick a readable format.')
