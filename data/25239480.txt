It’s disappointing to me that so many here simply can’t conceive that some people don’t share their priorities, and make conscious choices that reflect their own priorities.<p>I <i>don&#x27;t care</i> if the inevitable future of the Mac platform is more locked down. In fact I welcome it. Does it limit what I can do with my device? Of course. Do I lament some of the control I’ve already given up? Sure. But the trade off is a safer and smoother computing experience that allows me to focus more on what I want to achieve with what the platform does provide.<p>I spent some time on Linux, I got into hyper-customizing every minute detail, I swapped out third party RAM and even early adopted SSDs by mounting them in the optical drive bay. I built a PC tower from personally selected components. I triple booted Windows and Linux on my first Intel Mac with community built boot loaders well before Boot Camp was a thing.<p>I can’t imagine spending my time that way anymore. I learned a lot, but now I just wanna get stuff done. I <i>like</i> having some of the system out of reach. I <i>like</i> knowing that it’s readonly and I <i>like</i> the kind of hardware advances Apple’s vertical integration has enabled.<p>It’s okay if we value different things, and it’s okay if we make different compromises to experience them.')
