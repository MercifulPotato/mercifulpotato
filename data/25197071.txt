I remember trying out a samsung phone and the software they put on it was awful so I went straight back to an iphone at the time.  But yes, it was annoying that I had to jail break it in the first place and that they kept trying to block it.<p>That being said, my current and last phone are the pixel 4a and 2 and they feel just as snappy as the iphones I haved used, I can install any software I want, and the 4a is really nice as it is only $350 with a fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack so I don&#x27;t plan on going back to iOS any time soon.')
