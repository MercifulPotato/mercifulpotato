If Amazon had it first, Apple didn&#x27;t make it up. If not having it impresses you then it shouldn&#x27;t be a point that Alexa had it first, that would be bad. If having what Alexa has impresses you, then Apple should be adding it, and adding it is not bad. You can&#x27;t have both.<p>&gt; Not to mention that other device like Alexa already have this.<p>Then don&#x27;t mention it. What on earth do Android or Lisp or Linux users think will happen when they say &quot;X had it first&quot;? The only sane conclusion is that X is not the reason people avoided Android&#x2F;Lisp&#x2F;Linux. That was already clear because people were not tempted over by the presense of X. So if the only point is show gloat or be dismissive and&#x2F;or scornful, who would want to move to a system which has the same feature but has a public facing community that&#x27;s more about gloating and scoffing than being welcoming or helping?')
