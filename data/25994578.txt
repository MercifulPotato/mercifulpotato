Item(by='wiredfool', descendants=None, kids=[25996621], score=None, time=1612216597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25990702, text='I&#x27;ve just put together a couple of APIs, pretty simple things, but FASTApi made the first one (a bunch of selects) go together super quick (except for matching a legacy query parameter structure that is only questionably legal), and the second one (call outs to subprocess.check_foo) was going well until I tried to access a raw post body from a sync context. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s just not possible with Starlette, so after spending as much time as I spent on the rest of the API, I ripped out FASTApi and dropped in flask.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more messing with parameters, and it&#x27;s not as clean, but it does work without dropping subprocess.')
