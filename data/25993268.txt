He worked v hard at Sony PlayStation to get a Facebook style platform off the ground way before FB ever existed, got shafted in the 1st party game dev worldwide studios politics wars, joined MSFT to try and resurrect Xbox and is now presumably not doing well with Stadia at Google which has broken a lot of very hard ground to enable cloud gaming. The games always come before the platform (People bought Sonic The Hedgehog, not the enabling Sega hardware). Assuming Stadia doesn&#x27;t disappear someone else will probably profit from all this.')
