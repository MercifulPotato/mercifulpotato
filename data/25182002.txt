I&#x27;m currently in remission so my day-to-day work isn&#x27;t impacted, but there&#x27;s always a risk that my cancer may return.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if pre-existing conditions have an effect on investor interactions, recruiting, burnout etc., and if anyone has such experience. At present, I&#x27;ve never mentioned my medical history in a professional setting, for fear that it may have repercussions if I pivot my career.<p>FAANG also has great benefits, so I&#x27;m wondering how people handle insurance for early startups (I can&#x27;t take the chance of being uninsured).<p>Thanks.')
