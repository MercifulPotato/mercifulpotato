It is a bit of a apples-to-oranges comparison though. We can&#x27;t resolve solved problems.<p>The starting point for, dunno, 1970, is a world where people don&#x27;t have to plough fields by hand &#x2F; oxen, at least in the developed world. This is the shoulders of giants we are standing on. The information revolution that happened since is enormous.<p>The societal changes, where expectations on women went from make-babies-and-stay-at-home to forge-your-own-destiny is massive (WIP sadly, but going in a good direction). Access to education and real access to democracy have hugely improved in the last decades. Internet revolutionised information access. How crazy it is that any aspiring teenager, in US, India or Tonga, can buy a Raspberry Pi for a few dollars, download state-of-the-art programming language frameworks, follow free tutorials on-line, do courses on Coursera... that is, to me, as liberating as the farmland-to-downtown transition, just in a different sphere of life, and, well for people who live &quot;far away&quot; - doesn&#x27;t make it any less impressive...')
