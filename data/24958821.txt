It&#x27;s not just ISPs, can&#x27;t we arbitrarily nest networks? And you might foreseeably desire privacy on one of these interior LANs. Or perhaps your ISP is abusive and you can&#x27;t switch for some reason. I dunno. (I know, it&#x27;s not expected to be an issue in practice, but edge cases bother me.)<p>At what point (if any) will a scheme relying on NDP begin to break down due to collisions becoming unacceptably expensive to resolve? 16 bits of address space? 10 bits? Or is the algorithm behind NDP so robust that it will work right up until the network is completely full, with every last available address in active use?')
