No one does that when it comes to opining about the cause-and-effect of an event in the past. If you&#x27;re &quot;the winner&quot;, anything you say about why you won, would be taken as gospel. &quot;Winner is always right&quot;. Rigorous analysis is very hard, and costly, and to what end? Just so you could say &quot;my reasoning is based on analysis&quot;? That&#x27;s a very boring thing to say. Unless rigorous-analysis finds utility in applications like decision-making for future startups, and is shown to work over and over again (maybe we&#x27;ll need AI for that), no one is going to bother with it.')
