In fact, we have the smallest patent hoard of our competitor group. If they sue us we might not have enough patents to sue them back! We must have more patents! Everyone who gets a patent gets a bonus! ( Exit CEO, trailing exclamation marks. All the engineers file their pet idea as a patent, hoping management will be interested in building it).<p>(Some years later) Okay, some of those patents we filed are a bit silly. But at least we now have a huge, intimidating patent pile! No one will dare sue us now! Mua ha ha! But let&#x27;s be a bit more careful what we give those patent bonuses for. (Meanwhile at company X: our company has fewer patents than company Y!...)<p>The above is a true story, happened to me. Well, apart from the moustache twirling. My name is on some not very practical patents. So I&#x27;m not very convinced by stories which read the tea leaves from patents as to what a company intends ( Or economists trying to infer innovation rate from patent filing rate). Another problem is that the patent office is slow. Unless the company is General Fusion, most probably the product will be out before the patent.')
