Developers are far too used to having to do things like &#x27;make clean&#x27; because their build didn&#x27;t work quite right.  Efficiencies are then gained by doing things like ccache&#x2F;Gradle build cache, which trace their dependencies better than most naively written build systems do.<p>Edit: zig is a beautiful exception (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;0.3.0&#x2F;release-notes.html#caching" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ziglang.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;0.3.0&#x2F;release-notes.html#cachin...</a>)')
