How fast can you build and ship? I saw startups spending a year, and they could not launch a website. \nSame thing in enterprises too. A team gets formed around a project and they start building everything including a highly sophisticated pipeline, feature toggles and multi cluster deployment; but the product is still not close yet. \nVelocity is my indicator for team success.
