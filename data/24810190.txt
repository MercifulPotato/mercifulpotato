I was totally proficient in it, and very productive, especially after c++11. Often I would reach for C++ even in favor of Python for small throw-away tools, in the knowledge that it wouldn&#x27;t bail out on a typo in the final print statement after 10 minutes of analysis.<p>I have now worked with Rust for a year, and I don&#x27;t see myself ever going back to C++. The statement in the article that &quot;only the final iteration would be unsafe if one would forget to check the length&quot; made me cringe uncomfortably. I might have written similar code as the author, but it now looks clumsy and overly complicated.')
