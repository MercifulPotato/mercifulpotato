Although do note that graph layout tends to be heavily dependent on what kind of graph you actually want to visualize; an algorithm that works well for one type of graph may look atrocious for other kinds of graphs.<p>The algorithm used by dot (Sugiyama layout) works well for trees or any other graph where the structure is well-approximated by a tree. Control-flow graphs are the prototypical example of the latter (being the use case dot was explicitly designed for), but the VCS commit graph is also going to fit in well in this model. If you have a graph which has many more cycles in it, or has a crisscrossing connectivity pattern like a hypercube, the resulting layout from dot is going to be a giant ball of twine.')
