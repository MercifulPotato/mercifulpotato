E.g.,<p>1. Use a single expression per line, and don&#x27;t combine the line starting or ending a block with the contents, and don&#x27;t use semicolons where they are unnecessary (so, semicolons are used only to separate the opening and “end” of single-line blocks.)<p>2. Use parens among function calls, except omit them in calls that are part of internal DSLs.')
