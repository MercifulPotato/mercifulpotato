There were a number of people being downvoted asking questions about how this could have happened, and now to see that someone posted the true answer and it was flagged and hidden, that I think reflects poorly on HN and warrants an explanation.<p>I&#x27;ll never forget at my first friend&#x27;s funeral when his mother said during the eulogy &quot;My son was a drug addict.&quot; It was so heartbreaking but so important to speak the truth and be open about it in order to pay respect to him and call out for action so that more mom&#x27;s don&#x27;t have to make that speech.<p>She did not bury the truth and &quot;wait out of respect&quot;, she confronted it head on. If she can do that and do it in a positive way then I think an Internet forum could do it too. The truth is it seems if it weren&#x27;t for a few of Tony&#x27;s friends sharing the whole story, the truth may have been buried and many more may have gone down that path.')
