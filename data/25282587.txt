Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606948101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282036, text='&gt; I&#x27;m definitely not defending the actions of Google here but I do understand them - it&#x27;s quite likely this HR rep couldn&#x27;t legally agree to this contract modification and it&#x27;s entirely possible that when it was forwarded to legal they didn&#x27;t have the power to approve this change without consulting up the legal ladder and possibly passing the question by upper management.<p>I&#x27;d be kinda surprised if legal couldn&#x27;t approve a change like that.  Isn&#x27;t it the bread and butter of legal departments to review all kinds of contracts (with customers, vendors, etc.)?')
