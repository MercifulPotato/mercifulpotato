At first I thought it was the same as a felt tipped pen, which is what I primarily use, but I guess we&#x27;re both in different minorities.<p>EDIT: guess I&#x27;ll add why I like felt tipped pens.  I like how the ink dries quickly, still have control over how much is being put to page, are fairly cheap, and personally I like the stratchiness&#x2F;resistance on the page, it helps my handwriting I think.')
