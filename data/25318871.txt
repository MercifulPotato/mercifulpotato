It would be preferable for everyone to have the quality of deep literacy, but it still seems like a worthwhile thing to pursue even if not everybody can get there. I can see why it would matter less, but not how that fact would negate the argument itself.<p>The Kissinger quote about 1&#x2F;3rd of the way into the article talked about how, even people responsible for making strategic decisions had (what the author of this article would call) deep literacy issues that hurt their ability to make holistic decisions. This seems like a good example of how there&#x27;s value in encouraging deep literacy, even if not everybody masters it.')
