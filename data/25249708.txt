It&#x27;s fine for you to insist on this very narrow and technical view of the situation, but that&#x27;s absolutely not how the case was presented in the media day and night for years, and I have no desire to engage you on these minute points.<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue with you about these specific facts, because the correctness of facts composing your take does not even matter for what I&#x27;m saying. You want to argue about the specific gastronomic precedents of a shit sandwich, whereas I&#x27;m telling you that the problem is that everyone was told for years that a gourmet hamburger was on its way.
