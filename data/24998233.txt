I&#x27;ve just ran Sekaiju with it and it happily played a random MIDI file I selected after changing the output port in settings to TiMidity++ (the first dropdown list in Setup-&gt;MIDI device and instrument-&gt;Midi out device). It probably also isn&#x27;t just me, the latest appdb rating of Sekaiju is platinum on wine 4.0 - for the record, I&#x27;m using 5.20 staging.')
