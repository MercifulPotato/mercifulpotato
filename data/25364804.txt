I mean, if you look at how gay people were still treated in the 90s, it was terrible. Most gay people were afraid to be publicly &quot;out&quot; and forget about any sort of trans rights, if you were trans in the 90s you just never transitioned or basically told nobody.<p>Do you think going back to a world where gay people were often attacked and beaten in public is a good idea? Where women were regularly subjected to sexual assault at work? My mum who worked as a teacher in the 80s and 90s told me she was regularly slapped on the ass by male teachers at work. Is this ok? Would you be ok with your daughters getting this treatment?')
