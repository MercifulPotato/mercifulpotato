You&#x27;re still forced to memorize syntax, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s full words instead of symbols (which becomes extra difficult for non-English speakers). This also breaks one of the best aspects of Markdown which is that it appears just as well formatted in a text editor as it does when fully rendered.<p>As far as I know, Markdown isn&#x27;t well specified so maybe that&#x27;s a place to contribute instead.<p>But if Dumbdown works for you, that&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t want to discourage you from working on it if you&#x27;re enjoying it. Just know that based on its current goals, it&#x27;s going to be quite niche.')
