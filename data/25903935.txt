Perhaps I&#x27;ll use it to maybe target ads slightly better in some cases, and put myself into every value chain you&#x27;re involved with so I can get a cut at every step.<p>Oh, and I&#x27;ll do my best to move all computing online, so that &#x27;everything you do online&#x27; equals &#x27;everything you do with a computer&#x27;.<p>In exchange you&#x27;ll get a web browser that is at times more performant than the others. Hell, I&#x27;ll even throw in a free email account (where I can gather all the best bits of info)!<p>It&#x27;s a pretty good deal, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;')
