There are even really nice &quot;standard&quot;-like libraries such as penlight. Depending on the environment you&#x27;re using, you can have a Lua distro that already contains all the most useful libraries already baked in. That stuff is out there already for those who want it.<p>In my opinion, one should assemble their own. You don&#x27;t need to develop everything yourself, but you can grab the libraries you know you&#x27;ll need&#x2F;want and craft a little baseline Lua for you. LuaRocks can do that with some clever argument passing and fiddling with the search paths. Then, you&#x27;re in control again, and your powertool is definitely yours.')
