I set it up multiple times. And it was a giant cluttered mess of a UI, things worked poorly, and as much as I want to be ok with a PHP app, I don&#x27;t trust PHP.<p>And its not because I want it to be JS web app or anything like that. Just the core HTML&#x2F;CSS is poorly implemented and just doesn&#x27;t look good.<p>The calendar and addons system just work so poorly. I just cant use it. I just use Seafile for filesharing.<p>I&#x27;ve run my own email before, also a pain in the ass for spam management. I do own my own domain and use ImprovMX.com to forward it to a free Gmail account. So if I ever need move, I can do it quickly and easily by just changing the forward.<p>I&#x27;m not privacy conscious so I don&#x27;t really care to run from Google for that reason, I just am tired of them shutting down and killing services I use often.<p>I just haven&#x27;t hit an email service that matches the spam fighting powers of Google yet. or the UI. Everything else looks so traditional. and I don&#x27;t want to pay $99 for Hey, mostly only do month to month so I can easily cancel and not waste money if I want to stop using it.<p>Anyways, I digress. I just haven&#x27;t found the right combination of tools for me, but Nextcloud was not it. I honestly think its horribly designed. We need an alternative to it, but I know its a huge undertaking to make something like this, so I am not sure it will happen any time soon.')
