(There&#x27;s a more focussed video on the Commonwealth Fusion Systems approach here [2])<p>As a physicist, turned developer, turned tech manager based in the UK I&#x27;m not quite sure what an opportunity looks like, and whether the right approach is to bash the plasma physics books, or wait for a more tech-orientated role to crop up.<p>I&#x27;m also really interested to know how these startup-esque companies are all going to handle their intellectual property now they&#x27;re private enterprises - are their individual breakthroughs all going to be kept deeply secret (and vanish if&#x2F;when most of them eventually fail) or are they all going to be frantically cross-licensing their discoveries so that in aggregate we don&#x27;t lose out of the benefits of collaboration.  According to A Piece of the Sun (by Daniel Clery) the early days of fusion research were hampered by international secrecy - things really started moving when researchers persuaded their governments to open up and let them work across borders.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L0KuAx1COEk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L0KuAx1COEk</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4</a>')
