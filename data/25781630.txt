It wasn&#x27;t intended that way but I can see how it came across. Some mediums are just poor for discussion and text is always poor for expressing context.<p>&gt; The whole vibe just felt like it was more about who did what than what any of it was supposed to mean, which isn&#x27;t really how we operate in general.<p>I got that sense from you at the time. I get that you&#x27;ve all been attacked heavily at different points. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way you couldn&#x27;t have felt that vibe. I&#x27;ve seen people call you guys out to me since on a scale that I&#x27;ve not seen elsewhere.<p>The bit I didn&#x27;t know is the how you operate in general. As an outsider that&#x27;s just not info I have.<p>I genuinely had links and samples for Appendix L&#x27;s C section - if you look at the post you&#x27;ll see the drawing screenshot and references to building blocks. Not knowing how you guys worked, I perhaps wrongly assumed that this might&#x27;ve been welcome, but wasn&#x27;t comfortable putting it in with that image there. I genuinely wasn&#x27;t trying to gotcha you.')
