This is something I have always loved in laptops and have used. Besides that card is barely even visible unlike a pen drive or a hard disk. It just stays there subtly.<p>I was also planning to have a bootable Linux on one of those, but I never got around to actually doing that. Now that my 2012 MBA&#x27;s flash storage is dead (and here in India either I can&#x27;t find replacement, or repair shops are asking for half a kidney) I will see if I can actually use a card instead.')
