So you take the statement that we can recover and shouldn&#x27;t believe in doomsday as let&#x27;s just kill each other? What are you, a Stalinist?<p>You realize the rhetoric of life being over as we know it is increasing suicide rates. People are literally killing themselves because they dont want to live in the narrative that life as we know it is down hill from here. What in the hell is wrong with you people? Yea, I dont like Trump that much either, that doesn&#x27;t mean we just burn the fucking world or imagine that it&#x27;s incapable of recovery.<p>When I say we can recover is strictly to keep your head up high and continue to do some good because it can payoff down the line. Giving up and crying about doomsday will lead to nothing but more pain and suffering. But I guess you want that since you&#x27;re a nuclear war advocate.')
