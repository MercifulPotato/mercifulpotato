(Note: PCs with 32-bit OSs often show only about 3.2 to 3.3 GiB available when 4 GiB is installed, since addressable hardware; especially onboard video controllers, may use hundreds of MB for their own support.)<p>Pentium Pro from 1995 could address up to 64 GB RAM. As could the most Intel CPUs after that release.<p>Of course you still get only 4 GB virtual address space per process in a 32-bit system. That also includes I&#x2F;O memory mapped ranges, like a graphics card aperture. Different processes can have different sets of 4 GB mapped to them.')
