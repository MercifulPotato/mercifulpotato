Decades of undermining the education system, plus many other problems such as &quot;big money lobbying&quot; is likely what led to such extremisms.<p>You know... the key metric of &quot;education&quot; used to be &quot;what percentage of your population can read and write&quot;. By that measure, the US is fairly &quot;educated&quot;. However, just like the value of each dollar goes down as the economy grows (i.e. inflation), I think it&#x27;s important to apply a similar idea to education; just as the access to information increases, the value of _only_ being able to read and write is no longer enough to be considered as &quot;educated&quot;.')
