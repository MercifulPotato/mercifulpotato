Both brands pull more than TDP when boosting at max, AMD desktop processors will pull up to 30% above the specified TDP for an indefinite period of time (they call this number the &quot;PPT&quot; instead, but they need to go higher than TDP to hit full boost, and PPT is the number that governs that).<p>Intel mobile processors actually obey TDP better than AMD processors do - Tiger Lake has a hard limit, when you configure a 15W TDP then it really is 15W steady-state once boost expires, while AMD mobile products will pull up to <i>50%</i> more than configured in steady-state operation. (the gap is larger than desktop)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16084&#x2F;Power%20-%2015W%20Comp%20Agi.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16084&#x2F;Power%20-%2015W%20Co...</a><p>&quot;the brands measure it differently&quot; is sort of theoretically true but not in the sense people think, and in practice it is not true.<p>On AMD it is literally just a number they pick that goes into the boost algorithm.  Robert Hallock did some dumb handwavy shit about how it&#x27;s measured with some delta-t above ambient with a reference cooler but the fact is that the chip itself basically determines how high it&#x27;ll boost based on the number they configure, so that is a self-fulfilling prophecy, the delta-t above ambient is dependent on the number they configure the chip to run at.<p>In practice:  what&#x27;s the difference between a 3600 and a 3600X?  One is configured with a TDP of 65W and one is configured with a TDP of 95W, the latter lets you boost higher and therefore it clocks higher.  Configure them both to a 65W PPT limit and they will boost to pretty much the same place.<p>Intel nominally states that it&#x27;s measured as a worst-case load at base clocks, something like Prime95 that absolutely nukes the processor (and even then many processors do not actually hit it).  But really it is also just a number that they pick.  The number has shifted over time, previously they used to undershoot a lot, now they tend to match the official TDP.  It&#x27;s not an actual measurement, it&#x27;s just a &quot;power category&quot; that they classify the processors as, it&#x27;s <i>informed</i> by real numbers but it&#x27;s ultimately a human decision which tier they put them in.<p>So in practice, for both brands, it is just a number they pick.  They have different theoretical methods for getting there but ultimately the marketing department looks at where the clocks would put them and pick a power number that they think represents that.  It is not, in practice, a pure measurement from either brand, it is just a &quot;category&quot; they use.<p>Real-world you will always boost above base clocks on both brands at stock TDP, at least on real-world loads.  You won&#x27;t hit full boost on either brand without exceeding TDP, the &quot;AMD measures at full boost&quot; is categorically false despite the fact that it&#x27;s commonly repeated.  AMD PPT lets them boost above the official TDP for an unlimited period of time, they cannot run full boost when limited to official TDP.')
