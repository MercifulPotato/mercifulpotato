In such a brother against brother civil war it wouldn&#x27;t have been judged shameful but with later militarism could have implied &quot;weakness&quot; against the propaganda dehumanized foreign menance. Assuring memory held to WWI and it wasn&#x27;t an independent rediscovery&#x2F;reinvention &quot;shell shock&quot; dodged the character image driven denial of having it or its existance by implying more physical damage as even valiant brave men are not immune to bullets and explosions. Men were facing charges of cowardice after fleeing vast trauma and it eased accepting &quot;the man who fled after a many months long bloody stalemate isn&#x27;t a craven but bearing invisible injuries sustained for his country so executing him would be a terrible wrong&quot;. Thus ironically shell shock could be called an ego saving euphemism itself.<p>And well authoritarians have no sense of irony - what they think is &quot;ironic&quot; is presenting their true self when it unacceptable and passing it off as a joke. Thus they destroy freedom to protect freedom the same as they destroy the village to save it.')
