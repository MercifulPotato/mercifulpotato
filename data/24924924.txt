The closed comparison is possible Qt, from a built output.<p>&gt; Some of the samples I tried on their gallery are mediocre.<p>That&#x27;s true, and I never understood why they don&#x27;t improve that, it hurts their publicity.<p>&gt; I would honestly have thought that flutter is dead in the water - every personal experience I&#x27;ve had with it has been bad, there are objective facts about it that are bad, and yet so many people love it.<p>I thought about roughly the same a year and a half ago, a coworker then did some small private stuff with it, and we talked here and then, as the base premise still sounded interesting. Comparing it now to then it just shows how much improved and gives a glimpse to what more will be possible, and I now could imagine that it will stay and even become rather useful.<p>tldr; It&#x27;s IMO far from dead in the water, but there&#x27;s also quite a bit of work to do.')
