Depending on the size of the user&#x27;s data source, they could easily use a whole CPU and a lot of memory for each request and requests can take up to 60s or maybe even multiple minutes. You need to run more than a handful of machines, so you can either overprovision or autoscale, but in either case you need some amount of reproducibility to wrangle all of those machines and you&#x27;ll probably want to plan for them to come and go because you probably don&#x27;t want to pay for a bunch of high-end machines sitting idle every night. Optimization is nontrivial so you&#x27;ll get around to it eventually and maybe even hire, but hiring your first employee is a lot harder than hiring your 101st employee, so you&#x27;re not going to do it right now but you still need a solution to your problem...')
