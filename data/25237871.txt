But this line of thinking is a bit naive unfortunately.<p>I’d say pretty much no one agrees on what “better” looks like. Better to someone often means applying a pattern that they just discovered in a blog post that week. Software design is still entirely subjective.<p>For example, “better” once meant refactoring to be more object-oriented. That’s backfired a bit recently, so now “better” might mean having a more functional design. There’s no evidence that either of these actually have any impact on the end result of quality as perceived by users.<p>Anyway, it’s good to be positive. There’s probably subconscious good that comes from that.')
