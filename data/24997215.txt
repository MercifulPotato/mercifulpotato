You can&#x27;t have both.<p>Obviously other languages do manage the balance - eg. python, rust, so it&#x27;s possible but I totally accept that given go&#x27;s minimalism and opinionated approach they might not want that. But be honest about it.<p>And good luck reverting a released kernel buried on a server :) especially once users start relying on e.g. a syscall. You might find that it&#x27;s not quite as different as you want it to be...')
