Remember early smartphones &#x2F; PDAs? They had a maximum process limit, in the low double digits! Storage that was wiped out if the battery died! Everything ran in the same address space!<p>And remember the first 5 or so major versions of Android? It wasn&#x27;t exactly a pleasant system to use.<p>But it got better.<p>The thing is, all in one custom hardware solutions will always, at first, beat out general purpose computing. But those custom hardware solutions are expensive, and <i>slow</i>, to engineer. Now if you are Apple and you can manage to find economies of scale to do everything in house, great!<p>But Amiga didn&#x27;t have that scale. They had custom in house everything, which, and they were competing against not just Microsoft, but literally every other consumer PC hardware manufacturer on the planet who were in a fight to the death to drop prices on DOS&#x2F;Windows PCs peripheral by peripheral.')
