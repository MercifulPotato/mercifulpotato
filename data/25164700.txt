I don&#x27;t want to give up control over my devices or fight an endless battle against bloatware &#x2F; spyware.<p>Some of the issues:<p>* Hibernate &#x2F; suspend does not work reliably on my Thinkpad. I gave up trying to configure it.<p>* Encrypting my drive was much more complicated to setup than on a Mac.<p>* Trackpad does not feel nearly as good as on a Macbook<p>* Palm rejection is poor<p>* My desktop gets confused about audio inputs when plugging things (e.g. mic) in and out<p>* Random UI freezes when running lots of high intensity applications, often requiring a reboot.
