Every time. And I&#x27;ll be damned if I don&#x27;t &quot;fail&quot; this CAPTCHA at least once a week, with it telling me to try again.<p>Come on, there are only so many mountains&#x2F;hills, taxis, traffic lights, bicycles, and cross-walks I can look at before I go cross-eyed.<p>They even have the nerve to suggest that I can avoid this by using the latest version of my browser (Firefox), which I already am and always do.')
