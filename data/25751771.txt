I love the simple interfaces they&#x27;ve built over some rather complicated things (concurrency, cross-compilation, networking, etc), which really do tend to just work.<p>I fear that Go will eventually turn into something where we look back and realize we&#x27;ve lost something important by gaining a lot of less importants. The impulse to <i>change things</i> is just too strong these days. C89 has done just fine unchanged for 30 years.<p>All I want is a C+=1 I can rely on for the next 30 years.')
