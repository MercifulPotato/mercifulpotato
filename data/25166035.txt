If you have private insurance, you pay for health care yourself and then get the money back from the insurer later on. So you see what is actually being charged, and it is expensive.<p>If you are on public insurance, you never even see the bills. Often the private insurance actually has to pay for the public insurance, as health care businesses would be unable to survive without the extra money from the private insurance people.<p>Maybe if you see the bills because you are privately insured, they seem expensive.
