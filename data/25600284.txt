Item(by='dwohnitmok', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609468700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599792, text='&gt; Today, when people say &quot;you can formalize all mathematics&quot; post GÃ¶del, it means you pick your area and formalize away, knowing that effectively proving consistency of your formal system (within the same system) is out of reach.<p>This isn&#x27;t what I mean when I say &quot;formalize all mathematics&quot; at least. For example the diversity among the current crop of proof assistants has nothing to do with incompleteness and everything instead to do with with proof writing ergonomics. Assuming we perfectly solved the problem of the ergonomics of writing formal proofs, ZFC would be enough to do the overwhelming majority of modern mathematics.<p>&gt; effectively proving consistency of your formal system (within the same system)<p>This isn&#x27;t the significance of the Second Incompleteness Theorem though. Since an inconsistent formal system can prove anything, why would you ever trust a proof of consistency within the same system? To avoid repetition, I&#x27;ll just link to a previous comment I made: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25118038" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25118038</a><p>&gt; many logics and sets of axioms coexist without there being any distinguished one that is better<p>(Syntactic) completeness has never really been a criteria for creating an end-all-be-all formal system in and of itself. We happily use many different mutually incompatible geometric systems (Euclidean, hyperbolic, etc.), in spite of the fact that many are complete.<p>That being said, it is true a pre-Godel desirable property of a foundational system of mathematics would be completeness, but foundations has never really been all that important for the working mathematician.')
