Unlimited storage is unsustainable.<p>I don&#x27;t like seeing things tied to advertising revenue. It&#x27;s not comfortable from a privacy perspective, and it&#x27;s certainly not competitive for other players wanting to enter the space without the dollars from Google&#x27;s huge advertising funnel&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;ecosystem.<p>You&#x27;ll notice Google also started to clamp down on Gmail trash storage space, and I&#x27;ll bet they&#x27;re going to place more limits on Drive and unused accounts.<p>I wonder if this is antitrust driven? Or are they hurting for space? We haven&#x27;t seen this crop up on Youtube, where I bet they&#x27;re really parched for disk space.<p>Will Google start deleting YouTube content that is super long tail and unviewed?')
