Based on your city, province, country of location, it could provide you step by step guide of handling next course of action. Right away, it tells user what is their crisis location address which will be required by insurance, and 911. Users can have option to start audio recording in app background to monitor themselves after crisis that they can use as proof later on. Based on crisis location, app can predict nearest locations of recommended service centres, hospital, fire, police stations and emergency contact location. For long term, it could shape up like Waze where people could report where crisis happened, which guideline they followed post crisis, rate them so other readers can read, interact etc. It would be nice if app can ask a series of questions and can dispatch info to your insurance company, CAA towing service etc. For example, all preliminary questions can be asked by app like How many passengers in car, any serious injuries, health related questions, license info etc. Once that is complete, it automatically submits this data to insurance for starting a case and dispatching tow service by recommeded parties like CAA at one touch of fingertip. This same info can be saved as PDF for distributing it to Police at scene. An app in form of educating people in a guided way can put an end to this corrupt business.')
