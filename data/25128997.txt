It was intense and powerful. I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it, before or since. There was definitely <i>something</i> there.<p>But the bond didn&#x27;t come for me until I could actually <i>interact</i> with this other human being. Offering a bottle and hearing a coo in response didn&#x27;t really do it.
