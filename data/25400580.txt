Item(by='uberman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607799927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400290, text='Larry Ellison is a big Trump&#x2F;Republican supporter, so he is politically more aligned with Texas than California.<p>He is likely also following the Elon Musk capital gains tax play book and realizes that CA is going to tax him at 13% while Texas will not tax him at all.<p>I&#x27;m guessing there will ultimately be little change for employees, as Oracle has a huge campus in Redwood City that I would be very surprised if they abandoned. Additionally, I know people at Oracle who own local business south of the city and even vineyards north of it. I can&#x27;t imagine that they would also abandon&#x2F;sell those properties. Of course, they are all wealthy enough to move to Texas, at least on paper.<p>Ultimately though I will be kind of surprised if Ellison and crew will meet a 183 day threshold to be considered a resident of Texas. After all he owns an entire Hawaiian island.')
