Sum type is basically a Union, a proper algebraic data type, and PHP doesn&#x27;t have algebraic data types (although, even before type hints it was a relatively common practice to &quot;implement&quot; them via PhpDoc... horrible, I know).<p>Enum is basically a bunch of constants, for all practical purposes. There were enums in Java for a long time, long before languages with more-or-less proper type systems became mainstream, and everybody was fine with a rigid mess of type system Java has.<p>So, to have what effectively is enum in PHP, I do just<p><pre><code>    class Status\n    {\n       const STATUS_A = &#x27;STATUS_A&#x27;;\n       const STATUS_B = &#x27;STATUS_B&#x27;;\n       &#x2F;&#x2F; and so on\n    {\n</code></pre>\nSo it looks like a new enum would be basically just a syntactic sugar for that. (And finally a way to make a type hint for $a = Status::STATUS_A.)')
