And somehow naked shorts exist, which means that it’s possible to sell stocks without first posting 100% of that stock as collateral.<p>The fact that Robinhood needs to come up with external funding to secure a customer cash stock purchase (if I’ve understood the current rules correctly) is, IMO, bizarre at best.<p>So no, I don’t think the market already works the way I proposed.')
