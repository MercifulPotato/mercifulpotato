It’s actually quite interesting that Apple does not force software updates, or perform them in a hard-to-disable-or-detect manner</i><p>This part is bogus, and Gruber knows it. The update might not be &quot;forced&quot; in its installation, but it&#x27;s forced in many other ways (Apple stops signing old versions, quickly moves on, new phones can&#x27;t install it, you can&#x27;t revert back, etc).<p>Forced updates are neither good nor bad in themselves, for me. For one, they help move the platform forward faster, bring everyone to the same page, and serve to land new features which is good (as a counter-example, remember how long Windows XP or IE6 took to die, with tons of security and compatibility issues dragging the platform behind?).<p>On the other hand, they can potentially break features someone depends on, or introduce new bugs.<p>Same at OS X. Sure, you can stay 2-3 releases behind. But often those releases are not supported on new devices, they stop getting updates fast, and new third party programs assume you have the new version and even require it. It&#x27;s not like Windows, where you can stick with a 10-15 year old version and still be fine. In MacOS after 2-3 years, you&#x27;re stretching it!<p>In any case, the forced updates are a clear tradeoff, coming from two different ideas about how an OS (move fast, be opinionated and ocassionally break things vs always-be-compatible-and-flexible).<p>Gruber to say iOS updates aren&#x27;t forced is misingenuous.')
