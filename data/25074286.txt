Nothing more. Dependency injection frameworks are DI combined with a service locator.<p>Dependency Injection Frameworks have the same issues:\n - understanding what is going on is harder than injecting objects by hand.\n - you have limited control over object lifetimes (when objects are created and disposed). Permanent, scoped and transient might be enough most of the time for a web service, but as soon as you fire off tasks that can outlive the requests or when you use it in different circumstances like UI itâ€™s getting a problem.')
