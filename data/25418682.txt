Perhaps that should be. National treasuries are linked to GDP because most taxes are either a consumption or an income tax, both of which are tied to GDP (consumption is paid by a buyer, income tax by a seller, either way, they are parts of GDP). Most arguments that try to say, GDP is unimportant or shouldn&#x27;t be important are advocating for something that would ultimately shrink GDP, and reduce government incomes. Usually  while making no case for anything other than, &quot;making due&quot; or austerity. This usually creates an unsustainable political climate leading to eventual regime change to something that will create economic growth.')
