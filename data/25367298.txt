Very few such combinations have been thoroughly studied (or sometimes not studied at all), so people rarely have any idea what effects these combinations will have long-term, or sometimes even short term.<p>Mostly, people take them based on rumors, hearsay, and anecdotes, which is kind of sad.  They&#x27;ve heard some random guy on the internet say it was a good combo, or their buddy told them it worked for them, and somehow in their mind that makes it a good idea to try it.')
