The point of a comparison is to highlight the differences and similarities. You were the one who said Rust is more similar to JS than Java, you can&#x27;t just reduce the language to &#x27;type inference and traits&#x27; - things JS doesn&#x27;t have at all and say it&#x27;s somehow similar to JS.<p>&gt; Fair enough, but most people see that very different, hence the unhappiness.<p>You have data supporting this &#x27;most people see it...&#x27; argument? Or you just made it up on the spot?<p>&gt; No no, not the error messages that the rust compiler gives you. I&#x27;m talking about error handling that the developer does.<p>Error handling in Java is very straight forward and it&#x27;s far more similar to JS than Rust is.<p>&gt; And let&#x27;s not call it imperfections. Java is _so_ far away from perfection, that just gives your post a sarcastic touch.<p>Java is a great language. It&#x27;s not overly complex, it&#x27;s fast, it has great tooling and IDE support, it has one of the largest library ecosystems. It has a huge developer community, many high profile projects, many high profile companies use it. It&#x27;s easy to find decent Java developers for your project. It has a decent type system - far better than JS or python. From a pragmatic point of view Java is one of the best languages in existence.')
