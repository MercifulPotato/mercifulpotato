Of all the things on a startup&#x27;s todo list, I can&#x27;t imagine setting up their own infrastructure is the best way to improve profits or revenue.<p>But once the constraints of a userbase are more established, it should be easier to migrate off these platforms, since their pricing is optimized for users of all business sizes and use cases, whereas your specific hardware can be optimized for your specific users.<p>My biggest question is whether cloud providers could achieve a scale where they are able to offer the most optimal infrastructure costs for specific businesses. Maybe this is the case for smaller or mid-size companies, but I&#x27;d be interested to see where the inflection point lies.')
