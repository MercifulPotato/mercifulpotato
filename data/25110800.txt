Git is a prime example, developed as a Linux program - in fact developed by Linus Torvalds specifically for the kernel - but it runs on Windows with a few quirks. LaTeX is a Linux-first project but you can also use it on Windows, etc.<p>This mostly doesn&#x27;t happen in the opposite direction because of closed, proprietary software. Could Photoshop be ported to run on Linux, and with how much effort? We do not know.')
