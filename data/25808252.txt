This, as I understand it, is because a proton beam sheds the majority of it&#x27;s energy at the very end of it&#x27;s flight, allowing internal tissues to be targeted more directly.<p>I wonder - what would it look like if you made a proton beam and pointed it to the sky? Could you create a glowing area, much like the Tic Tac, that could be used to throw off enemy radar? I am legitimately curious, as my physics background is so so at best.')
