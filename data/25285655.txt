The federal government has the unquestioned authority to set the rules for interstate and international commerce. Breaking them up is not a takeover, by definition, since the government will not end up as the owners of those businesses. It is a restructuring of the market in furtherance of our goal of a free market economy based on fair rules and equality before the law.<p>Further, pushing responsibility onto individual consumers to (somehow) shape the market &quot;with their wallet&quot; is absurd. The highest purpose of a public government is that it can serve to protect the common folk from the abuses of concentrated wealth. Asking regulators to do their job isn&#x27;t coercive, it&#x27;s corrective.')
