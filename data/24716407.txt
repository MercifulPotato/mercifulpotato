Education works!<p>Are there any scientific facts which would back this?<p>To me it feels like there have been several other causes to that which were much more relevant. Not allowing people to smoke inside, vaping and smoking getting &quot;out of fashion&quot; were much more successful.<p>It&#x27;s just not cool anymore and those who still want to smoke are being confined to disgusting places to do it. Soo...it kinda works against your argument because it was a bad example. The only thing we may take away from it would be that if we&#x27;d have made smoking tobacco illegal everywhere, it would have remained cool to do so secretly...maybe.')
