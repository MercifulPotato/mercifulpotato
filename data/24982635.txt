It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll be able to do that now.  With this said, this move by your current administration makes a lot of sense to me, there is an opportunity to grow the American middle class around knowledge work.  The United States has the best training institutions and capital structures in the world.  They have a healthy demographic profile (they are maintaining their population), there is no reason for them to spoil their own job market with injections of foreign labour.  I see no reason for them not to train and hire their own citizens.')
