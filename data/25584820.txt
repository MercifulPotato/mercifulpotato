This is verifiably false.&quot;</i> That&#x27;s a pretty big, specific claim. What is the evidence she is providing?<p>Every word in &quot;this is verifiably false&quot; links to a different article, only one of which provides even weak evidence that one might characterize as supporting the claim:<p>* Link one is to an article about San Francisco from December 10, claiming that hospitals there will run out of beds in 17 days. Florida is not mentioned (incidentally, hospital capacity in SF has increased slightly since the article was written [1]).<p>* Link two is to a an article about Miami-Dade from December 4, where they quote CEOs from two hospital chains, who say that they have enough beds to handle the current caseload, but &quot;may&quot; not have enough staff.<p>* Link three is about cases nationwide. It does not mention Florida.<p>* Link four is about a White House report from November. The article explicitly says: <i>&quot;The November 29 document showed a minimal change in total hospitalization from the week prior&quot;</i>. The &quot;evidence&quot; here is that the document <i>predicts</i> a &quot;post-Thanksgiving surge&quot;.<p>To my knowledge, no hospital system in Florida has been &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by any conventional definition of the word [2]. Florida hospitals currently appear to be well below the peak seen in July [3]. The predicted &quot;post-thanksgiving surge&quot; does not appear to have materialized [4].<p>Reasonable people can certainly disagree and debate the current level of strain on hospitals in the US, and the appropriate trade-offs in our response to these strains. However, it&#x27;s not fair or intellectually honest to attack another person for <i>weaknesses in past speculation</i> when you are yourself engaging in speculative, possibly misleading forms of arguments.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.sfgov.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;s&#x2F;Hospital-Capacity&#x2F;qtdt-yqr2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.sfgov.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;s&#x2F;Hospital-Capacity&#x2F;qtdt-yqr2...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nhsn&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;report-patient-impact.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nhsn&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;report-patient-impact.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orlandosentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;os-ne-coronavirus-hospitalizations-climb-20201229-gnoc3xo4t5bnlowjinsy5sspgy-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orlandosentinel.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;os-ne-coronaviru...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid-19.direct&#x2F;state&#x2F;FL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid-19.direct&#x2F;state&#x2F;FL</a>')
