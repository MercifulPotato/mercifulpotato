As the leader of the group you would be the visionary and have outlined your aspiration to have your team on a unified code base. I would suggest you involve the team in a brain storming session(s) to discuss the stacks and what the pros&#x2F;cons of each base are for each of them and as a collective, continue to probe each individual and then propose your opinion that &#x27;sound like we would be a lot more productive&#x2F;efficient working on a single code base&#x27; and lead that conversation into the one that majority agree on. But this may take a couple of sessions depending on how irritated some individuals get by the idea of &#x27;letting go&#x27; of their preferred base. Goodluck.')
