The choice could even change the next time you build.  I’m not sure if compilers&#x2F;linkers warn about this now but they certainly didn’t warn about it back when I first discovered this on a project.<p>And of course, the outcome ranges from nothing (if both copies happen to be identical), to slightly off (e.g. one dependency had a slightly older version of the function), to downright wrong (e.g. crash in this case).')
