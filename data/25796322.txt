Item(by='dpiers', descendants=None, kids=[25796434], score=None, time=1610744162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25795910, text='There are issues with almost every assertion and conclusion in this post, but I will limit my critique to the idea that the downward movement of BTC is capped at the % of BTC people are willing to sell. It&#x27;s simply not true. The spot price of BTC is a function of what people are currently willing to pay and what people are willing to accept. If the primary source of demand and liquidity in the BTC trading markets collapses - which this article argues is Tether - the price could rapidly collapse even on small trading volumes.<p>If you add in the fact that these exchanges allow trading on margin, you could have a situation where people are forced to liquidate their holdings regardless of the current price. It&#x27;s the perfect storm for a flash crash.')
