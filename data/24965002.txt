Every set of revisions meant typing the book over again (to get a clean manuscript). My mom helped out, spending hours and hours banging out a new manuscript. I still feel bad for her doing that boring, numbing work, but that&#x27;s how things were in those days.<p>In the 90s, my dad used a text editor to make revisions and just pushed a button to print out a clean manuscript.<p>Not only that, his computer was cheaper than his old typewriter was. Despite it being cheaper, the computer company got rich off of this. It also took my dad far, far less time to create a new book. It didn&#x27;t sell well, but the computer company hardly stole their wealth from my dad.<p>P.S. The typewriter was <i>also</i> a big productivity gain over what went before - laboriously drawing each letter by hand. Companies made a lot of money selling typewriters, and that was wealth they created.')
