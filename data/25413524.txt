Item(by='vel0city', descendants=None, kids=[25413727], score=None, time=1607919767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413271, text='True, Teslas these days come with a J1772 to Tesla AC adapter. IIRC they&#x27;re not compatible with CCS but CCS chargers are more rare than J1772 at the moment. However I often see only J1772 plugs or only Tesla plugs around me. It&#x27;s rare for places to have both options.<p>Tesla was forced to make CCS compatible versions in Germany IIRC, so they could adopt the industry standard globally but instead choose to continue pushing vendor lock-in instead of open standards.<p>Either way that doesn&#x27;t change the fact  Tesla might be the single biggest network of chargers out there, but they&#x27;re not the most common chargers out there. The majority of chargers out there will not work on a Tesla without an adapter.<p>If having the largest network of charging systems was really a long term play of theirs, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d move to actually supporting the plugs which will probably be on ultimately the majority of cars on the road and take money from everyone instead of only customers of their cars. I question the long term importance of their charging network as more and more J1772&#x2F;CCS cars get on the market and more J1772&#x2F;CCS continue coming online. Imagine of Ford and Exxon had some exclusive pump and port agreement where Exxon stations could only sell gas to Ford cars but Ford gave adapters to allow Ford owners to fill anywhere, albeit with a bit more work. Sounds pretty dumb, right?')
