It&#x27;s fragment-of-EC2 vs ovh.<p>If you need a predefined small number of VMs and no other functionality, it would be silly to go with AWS. But on the other hand, if you want a set of servers of a given class spawning on demand, with traffic coming in via load balancers, with integrated certificate and DNS management, with programmable lifecycle hooks, with integrated authn&#x2F;authz, with full audit logs and account management, with configurable private networking to other services, etc. etc. ... You&#x27;ll pay more than the price difference for someone to implement all of that from scratch.<p>Compared to this many other points sound like conspiracy theories. Meanwhile people either don&#x27;t know they can do better, or use AWS because they want more features.')
