I knew a couple of the engineers and they were nice, kind, genuine people. They knew what Onavo was doing was wrong. They also didn&#x27;t let it bother them. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it; It was just a job. I don&#x27;t think I could ever have &quot;just a job&quot;. I know someone&#x27;s got to be the repo man, and I&#x27;d hope that they act with dignity and empathy - And an appropriate level of disgust when they&#x27;re faced with people actually trying to game the system. But it&#x27;s clear that standards vary wildly, and plenty of people just don&#x27;t care.<p>I also have coworker who worked for Luminati. He&#x27;s aware of just how gray the area is, and I think he worked to make it better, but I definitely get the sense that he&#x27;s glad he&#x27;s no longer working on something so sketchy.<p>I recognize how privileged I am to never have faced the choice of &quot;Sketchy work or Starve&quot;, but I wonder what is wrong with our system that these are able to prosper as long as they are. A healthy skepticism would serve us all well. Onavo would never have gotten away with it with just a little skepticism; Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware.')
