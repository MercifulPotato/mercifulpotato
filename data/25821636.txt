The tulpa they worked to create was a &quot;demon&quot; that fucked them. The person who created this tulpa completely lost their mind and thought they were going to be the prince of hell.<p>I know, I know, annecdotal evidence and all that, but a quick trip to 4chan&#x27;s &#x2F;x&#x2F; board will uncover lots of other people who are trying to create a tulpa for sexual reasons who don&#x27;t seem particularly mentally well.<p>I think it&#x27;s irresponsible for the author to recommend this practice to people.')
