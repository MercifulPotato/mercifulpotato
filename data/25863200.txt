I think for R&amp;D, buying cheap stuff off of ebay or labx is great.<p>But if your goal is to eventually scale up and build a production lab, you will need to switch your mindset when you get some funding and buy some decent equipment. It can make a big difference from my experience. My company started out at a sub-par lab space with second hand equipment. When we moved to a very well equipped lab, we found ourselves exponentially more productive. Mainly because we no longer have to constantly second-guessing our results due to sub-optimal equipment&#x2F;reagents. Re-running experiments because of potential equipment failure adds up in terms of resources and psychological stress.')
