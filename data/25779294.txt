Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25780090], score=None, time=1610645550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778519, text='There is obviously some legitimacy to the notion the rules are applied unfairly.<p>It&#x27;s invariably about &#x27;fine lines&#x27; &#x27;gray areas&#x27; and &#x27;shifting sands of policy and situation&#x27;.<p>In that context, I don&#x27;t see Kap&#x27;s statement quite as a  call to violence, even though it may be, it&#x27;s veiled just sufficiently that I would personally give it a pass.<p>Certainly &#x27;resistance&#x27; is within bounds.<p>&#x27;Revolt&#x27; I guess would be the complicating term.<p>The real question is ... why would Jack Dorsey give a very wealthy athlete $3M? I would hope you meant to day &#x27;Colin&#x27;s <i>Foundation</i>&#x27; or something like that which is hopefully focused on legit social justice, and not, for example, perpetuating lies about elections?<p>Finally, to my point about &#x27;shifting sands&#x27; - I think the context of a President using the legitimacy of his office to make very serious false claims, which have very serious implications, and who&#x27;s further incitement at last materially contributed to an &#x27;insurrection&#x27; on Capitol Hill ... may very well have been a &#x27;new context&#x27; in which the policy might materially change. It probably the behooves Dorsey &amp; Co. to start to think about their new defacto policy in the context of other actors, so as to be fair.<p>Edit: Dorsey&#x27;s donation was indeed to a Kap led foundation, not to Kap himself, here [1]. It seems there&#x27;s legitimacy to the cause, that said, I can&#x27;t help bit grin at the large image at the bottom, with Kap&#x27;s &#x27;Che&#x27; style self-branding effort.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knowyourrightscamp.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knowyourrightscamp.com&#x2F;</a>')
