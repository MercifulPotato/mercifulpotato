One of my regrets as a late bloomer is having been ashamed to ask, then more ashamed to admit when I got out of my depth. Your friends who partake reasonably will be happy to guide you, and they’ll also be kind to set you back on your path if you stumble. If you find yourself among people who don’t match those characteristics, they’re not fun to stick around with. No matter what be kind to yourself and keep trust in the people you trust unless they show they don’t deserve it.')
