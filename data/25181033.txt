They are merged in the image only. Your default filename (like &quot;myproject.xcf&quot;) is not affected; Ctrl-S save continues to save that.<p>GIMP&#x27;s export is smart enough not to keep prompting you. You are prompted once to set the parameters, like compression and others. Then you can repeat the export operation with no prompting. You have a Ctrl-E hotkey to do that instantly, and Ctrl-S continues to save your project to the .xcf file.')
