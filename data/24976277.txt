The author writes:<p>&quot;if the election were to happen today, what is the probability of each candidate winning?&quot;<p>This is not at all what Silver&#x27;s model does. Silver writes and makes clear that there is more variance in the model a few months out than a few days out. (In other words - Biden may be 90% now but four months ago if the polls were identical he would be at less than 90% since there would be more time for voter change and real world events.)<p>I honestly don&#x27;t even get what Taleb is truly arguing here. He is using a lot of statistical arguments but ultimately Silver is making a model to predict an outcome. It is like a weather forecast.<p>I may say that four months from now the chance it rains in Los Angeles is 2%. However, the day before with more info I may be able to say it will rain 90% of the time. There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with this, even though Taleb seems to suggest this wrong (from my read)')
