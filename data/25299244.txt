The media loves the fixed supply narrative, but it&#x27;s really not important.  Other coins have permanently inflating supplies and their charts mostly match the bitcoin chart.<p>The real gift of bitcoin is that it jump-started a wave of innovation by birthing &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;.  Once people saw that money would flow into bitcoin, people started new projects to try out all the other now-obvious ideas for cryptocurrencies.  People want to build important things.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking of bitcoin in the mindset of beanie babies or building a better credit card, then you may have missed the bigger thing that&#x27;s happening.  It&#x27;s becoming obvious, to me at least, that cryptocurrency is trending in a direction where it will profoundly disrupt any industry that uses the internet, beginning with finance.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve been following this thread, and you should probably re-read all of vmception&#x27;s comments.
