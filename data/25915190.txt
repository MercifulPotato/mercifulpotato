Most open banking payment run over Faster Payments, which is owned by a company called VocaLink, which is in turn owned by (drum roll please) MasterCard.<p>If Open Banking takes off, then expect MasterCard to start increasing their Faster Payments fees (they exist, your bank just eats the cost).<p>But first you need to convince customers to give up the protections offered by Debit&#x2F;Credit cards. There’s basically 0 recourse for a consumer to get their money back if they’re scammed via Open Banking. Unlike Credit&#x2F;Debit cards where chargebacks are an option.')
