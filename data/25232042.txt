The more competition in the space, the better.<p>I hope recent software advances in ARM by Apple pushes Microsoft to focus more of their efforts in building a competent translation software layer for x86-64 apps (in contrast to their current garbage-ish emulation layer that makes their ARM devices running legacy x86-64 apps nearly unusable, in some cases) like Rosetta 2.<p>And also hoping those advances by MSFT in turn push Apple to make an even better version of Rosetta 2 (because mainstream x86-64 apps will probably be around at least for the next couple of decades, imo), leading to a &#x27;golden age&#x27; of sorts for translation&#x2F;emulation software.')
