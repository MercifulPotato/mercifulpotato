It didn&#x27;t occur to me that the pointer to a pointer aspect was the source of any of the confusion until just now. Actually, I don&#x27;t think that I consciously registered its presence when I read the code. There is only one interpretation of the code that makes any sense, and that&#x27;s at least easy for an expert to see quickly.<p>I am sure that people that think that the terser variant is overly clever don&#x27;t get it. To be fair, it&#x27;s hard to generalize from this one example. But I think that I know exactly what Torvalds intended to draw attention to.')
