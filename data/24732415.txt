Item(by='kalenx', descendants=None, kids=[24733097], score=None, time=1602265480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731644, text='&gt; I&#x27;m saying, everyone - EVERYONE - is accepting claims all day long, without any proof.<p>You included. But saying &quot;no one is checking&quot; is false. For every claim, there are people who do, actually, check. But you ask for _everyone_ to check _every claim_, which, I repeat myself, is, plainly put, impossible. So either you still do not accept that this is impossible, and going further in the discussion without this axiom is just useless, or you accept that this is impossible yet you still  hypocritically ask for it. In either case, I do not have much to add.')
