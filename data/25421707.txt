(I think, that&#x27;ll be in ~10 months, so I have some time to choose).<p>Why?  I actually like BitWarden quite a bit.  I like that it&#x27;s open source and has been audited.  I use it on Linux, my Chromebook and Android phone, and Firefox and Chrome browsers and it works very well.  My wife uses it on iOS and didn&#x27;t complain.<p>It is very nice that it has a 2-person free plan to try out.  That how I first tried it, and for me and my wife sharing it, it worked just fine.  You do have to pay to get TOTP 2 factor integration, so I got the family plan, and we also got it for work.<p>So why would I switch?<p>It&#x27;s fairly clunky.  Turns out, while my wife wasn&#x27;t complaining, she also finds it &quot;ugly&quot;.  Which isn&#x27;t the full reason to change, but...  My co-workers really struggle with it.<p>The biggest issue is that often when you are adding items, the fact that you have to add it to a collection is scrolled off the bottom of the screen, and adding it adds it to your personal collection.  Once you do that you can&#x27;t move it to the shared group, you have to start over.  Organizing passwords isn&#x27;t really obvious, we used to have a password manager with a hierarchical structure and are struggling without it.  Bitwarden has folders, but it&#x27;s unclear that they do anything.  It has collections, but likewise there&#x27;s no real visualization.  So you end up searching for everything and if you don&#x27;t know what to search for you are kind of lost.<p>In short: I like BitWarden, but there are definite UI rough edges, especially difficult with multiple using it, and since Aug 2019 there&#x27;s been no change.<p>Plusses though: Their support is super friendly.')
