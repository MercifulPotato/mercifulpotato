Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=[25304366], score=None, time=1607095741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302256, text='uMatrix is uBlock Origin (uBO) with 2 differences:<p>1) No cosmetic filtering.<p>2) A more powerful interface, as _underfl0w_ describes at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25302405" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25302405</a><p>The key thing which that comment does not mention is that the interface enables a whitelist approach — block everything (read: as much as you want) by default and selectively allow certain types of content from certain sites.<p><i>This is important because of where your effort is spent.</i><p>With uBO, sites always work by default, but it requires manual effort — albeit mostly not by regular users — to stay up to date and blocking the latest trackers and annoyances. So, the amount of effort to keep uBO functioning is proportional to the rate of change in tracking. <i>uBO is an arms race between advertisers and blocklist maintainers.</i><p>With uMatrix, all annoyances are gone by default, but often so is desired functionality. It requires manual effort to make the site work again, but once it works, it will continue to work until the site owner changes which types of resources must be loaded in order to function. So, the amount of effort required to keep uMatrix functioning is proportional to the rate of development, specifically major changes.<p>So, really, the two approaches take a different bet. uBO bets that trackers and ads will change less frequently than functionality. uMatrix bets the opposite. I know which bet <i>I</i> think is more reasonable. Advertisers have way more incentive to try and circumvent uBO than developers do to regularly break their site&#x27;s functionality.<p>This all said, it works very well to use both. Having uBO installed means that when you&#x27;re un-breaking sites in uMatrix, and you allow something that was actually advertising, uBO will usually catch it for you, so you don&#x27;t have to see ads. This means you don&#x27;t have to think quite so hard before allowing something in uMatrix, which makes the overall experience much more pleasant.')
