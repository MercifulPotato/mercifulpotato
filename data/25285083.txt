They do not—and are not meant to—prevent people from contracting and spreading the virus. They only reduce the symptoms. This does not help herd immunity (other than perhaps allowing the virus to spread faster, I guess).<p>Some other HN-er said this. If this is true, then it should be my decision. Since I have been through it without symptoms, I am supposedly immune for 6 months, but even after that, I do not really care. I care about it personally as much as I care about the flu. I have not vaccinated myself against the flu in years. Let it be my decision, please. I am not an anti-vaxxer, but when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine, I am a bit wary. I do not mind tested vaccines that have been around for decades and have been extensively researched and are pretty known to be safe.')
