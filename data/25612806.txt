You make it easier to create art by making an algorithm that takes fuzzy beginner line art that is not following proportions and has all sorts of problems and turn it into professional line art via ML. People will struggle at the far more challenging skill of choosing what to draw because it innately requires knowledge of human anatomy, perspective and many other skills beyond knowing how to use a pencil. Programming languages are equivalent to a pencil, tablet or other any input method in this analogy.')
