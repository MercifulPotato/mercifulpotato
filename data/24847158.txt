By the late dark ages, we also saw a lot of modern medical techniques coming in from the Middle East.<p>There&#x27;s this stereotype of people being filthy, ignorant, and dumb, but it&#x27;s not really true. And for many of the bad practices from then do persist in poorer parts of the world today affecting likely around a billion people (and some, like homeopathy, even in wealthy parts).<p>Note that I&#x27;m not weighing in on the overall debate about where modern medicine is relative to the dark ages. We&#x27;ve made a lot of progress. I&#x27;m just refuting the stereotype of the dark ages.')
