But the fundamentals are still there, laying the groundwork for the future.<p>Sure, ispc can win on latency. But the raw compute girth of GPU SIMD cannot be underestimated.<p>In any case, Julia has proven itself capable of compiling down to a SIMD instruction set and achieving nearly the full performance of those GPUs. Even if it&#x27;s not a computer you prefer, the programming model and technology demonstrated here is clear.')
