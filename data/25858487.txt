Item(by='AndrewSwift', descendants=None, kids=[25858872], score=None, time=1611235078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857723, text='Whether or not to obey web standards.<p>I&#x27;m building a new project that permits building web pages in SVG instead of HTML (example at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svija.love" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svija.love</a>).<p>The initial offering works well but does not obey web standards in several respects.<p>* The pages do not reflow when the browser window resizes\n* The text of the page can be out of order in the source, causing accessibility issues\n* Information about the structure of the text is missing (all text is equal — there are no ‹p› or ‹h1› tags)<p>The benefits are that you can design a web page in a few minutes in Adobe Illustrator that requires no conversion and that displays exactly the same on every platform.<p>When we have showed our project to web developers the reaction has been incredibly negative:<p>&quot;[it] is very difficult to read on a mobile device, and is completely inaccessible to assistive technologies, which interpret the page as one unlabeled image. Sites should not be built like this.&quot;<p>However, when we&#x27;ve showed the product to designers, they&#x27;ve been very enthusiastic:<p>&quot;Wow, I&#x27;m blown away by your product. It is seriously incredible, I&#x27;ve been showing all my designer friends and they can&#x27;t believe it.&quot;<p>For me, it&#x27;s a transition, like from black-and-white to color television. There are obvious shortcomings, but we&#x27;ll address them as we go forward.<p>· · ·<p>To come back to web standards: people have made a lot of noise about how they&#x27;re important (and given us a lot of grief), but the big companies just do what they want, especially Google.<p>AMP pages have turned out to be just a way to keep visitors from leaving Google properties, for example.<p>And most of the standards-related criticism we&#x27;ve receive has come down to advice that would mostly benefit Google rather than our visitors (structured text).<p>Web standards are holding back the Internet and catering to Google.<p>We&#x27;ve been given an incredible opportunity to broadcast content everywhere in the world and all that&#x27;s permitted is making glorified books?')
