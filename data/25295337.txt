Item(by='DarkWiiPlayer', descendants=None, kids=[25297545], score=None, time=1607031062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25293416, text='Yes, I agree that affirmative action has some merit on paper, although there&#x27;s also many good points for why it might not work after all.<p>I&#x27;m arguing on a matter of principle here. I think my root-level comment made it more than clear that that&#x27;s my perspective and it&#x27;s somewhat annoying that people seem to have no other answer than &quot;but it works&quot;.<p>Once again, my point is: Discrimination, regardless of the direction, is morally bad. I&#x27;m saying we shouldn&#x27;t do it even if we think it might work.<p>&gt; you&#x27;re irrationally insisting that a complex social problem can be distilled into an 11-word yes-or-no question<p>No. I&#x27;m just saying this is not the answer.<p>&gt; that frames your side of the argument favorably<p>Yes. And you know what? This wasn&#x27;t my own idea. I just grew tired of having this kind of thing thrown at me and to see it thrown at others. This is the kind of framing the left uses. So now I&#x27;m just throwing it back. You don&#x27;t agree with me? You&#x27;re a racist. And suddenly everybody is butthurt because I point out that fulfilling the dictionary-definition of racism makes you a racist. What. A. Joke.<p>So here&#x27;s an idea: Instead of complaining about my framing, how about you just explain how this could possibly not be racist? Because I haven&#x27;t seen one good explanation. Not one. And no, &quot;it&#x27;s complicated&quot; is not an answer.')
