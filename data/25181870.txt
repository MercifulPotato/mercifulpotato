Christian and I had a phone call back in 2017 about a potential internship at Audm. While it didn&#x27;t work out, we really enjoyed talking to each other over the phone and have followed each other on Twitter ever since. We&#x27;d catch up occasionally, and engage with each others tweets and have some good conversations.<p>What stood out to me was how open and kind he was. He was willing to take a call with me as a student in college and offered to help me out with my projects â€“ won&#x27;t forget that. Wild to think how fleeting life is. Rest in peace, Christian.')
