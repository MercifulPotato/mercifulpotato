It wasn&#x27;t amazing preformance, but it was in a rural area with a slow ISP anyway. IPSec performance was sufficient for the single client I ever used with it.<p>For the year prior to this one, I had FreeBSD in almost the same configuration running on a Raspberry Pi (1!!!) B.<p>Both were rock solid stable without any serious problems, but in the end, I favored the OpenBSD&#x2F;Beaglebone more. The sole reason for this is the strange behavior I encountered on FreeBSD while using vi over a serial connection - all of vi would appear in the serial console as a single line. I believe it was a known bug at the time. This made vi unusable, and I had to resort editing the firewall confgs line by line using sed and cat (FreeBSD sed doesn&#x27;t have the in-place editing that GNU sed has). Quite a PITA.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beagleboard.org&#x2F;green" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beagleboard.org&#x2F;green</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Router_on_a_stick" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Router_on_a_stick</a>')
