No other president has ever tried to overturn the results of an election like Trump. You&#x27;re attempting to make a blatantly false equivalency. That&#x27;s textbook &quot;bothsidesism&quot;. If you&#x27;re &quot;morally opposed to everything this President has done&quot;, then why do you &quot;not care if Trump wins or loses&quot;?<p>You&#x27;ve also offered absolutely no proof of your unfounded claims that &quot;it seems unquestionable that election laws were broken in a variety of significant ways that meaningfully impacted the result of the election&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s total bullshit. No it certainly isn&#x27;t &quot;unquestionable&quot;, and you have no proof of that whatsoever, and neither does Trump, which is why his absurd court cases are all being thrown out with such prejudice.<p>If you have some &quot;unquestionable&quot; convincing proof, then why doesn&#x27;t Giuliani have it too, and share it with the court? Why don&#x27;t you share it with us here and now? Because you don&#x27;t. You are simply parroting Trump&#x27;s and Giuliani&#x27;s and Putin&#x27;s propaganda and lies.<p>&gt;And I generally do my own research.<p>And yet you somehow coincidentally come up with the exact same conclusions that Trump is lying about, but neither of you has a shred of proof. There&#x27;s your problem.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_troll#Concern_troll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_troll#Concern_troll</a>')
