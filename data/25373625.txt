No other president has ever tried to overturn the results of an election like Trump. You&#x27;re attempting to make a blatantly false equivalency.<p>You&#x27;ve also offered absolutely no proof of your unfounded claims that &quot;it seems unquestionable that election laws were broken in a variety of significant ways that meaningfully impacted the result of the election&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s total bullshit. No is certainly isn&#x27;t &quot;unquestionable&quot;, and you have no proof of that whatsoever, and neither does Trump, which is why his absurd court cases are all being thrown out with such prejudice. You are simply parroting Trump propaganda and lies.<p>&gt;And I generally do my own research.<p>And yet you somehow coincidentally come up with the exact same conclusions that Trump is lying about, but neither of you has a shred of proof. There&#x27;s your problem.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_troll#Concern_troll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_troll#Concern_troll</a>')
