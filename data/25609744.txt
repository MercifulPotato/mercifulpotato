After any major organizational change, such as a merger, any promises made by the diminished chain command are not enforceable. What you won&#x27;t see is that some of those promises are encouraged by the new chain of command in order to maintain calm.<p>Eventually the one making the promises will either not be around or find that they don&#x27;t have the resources to fulfill the promise. They may quit when they figure this out, if they haven&#x27;t already been let go once they&#x27;ve established their status as scapegoat.<p>If something matters to you, make sure you get the new bosses to announce it in front of people. Be aware that you should have already thought at least briefly about the wording of your resignation letter prior to doing this.')
