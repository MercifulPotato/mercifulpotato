The odds (and risks) in the long run aren&#x27;t the same when <i>there is no long run</i>, just <i>one</i> experiment.<p>My recommendation would be to change the script so that &quot;dropping all balls&quot; stops after one run, and the button &quot;drop one ball&quot; gets highlighted after that, encouraging the user to click it.<p>Because it is <i>then</i> that you get to feel how <i>real</i> the chances of ball ending up on the right side are, even if <i>most</i> balls end up on the blue side.<p>We all only get one drop.<p>----------<p>Personal plug: my 3D-printed Galton&#x2F;Plinko board[1].<p>If anyone&#x27;s interested, I can share the STL file or OpenSCAD code.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;O4ZqOVR.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;O4ZqOVR.jpeg</a>')
