Your examples are about <i>users of devices</i>.  True, programmers use languages, but programming is far more complicated than using a music service.<p>Something like &quot;no code&quot; may make programming easier... until it doesn&#x27;t.  That is, you get to the point where either you can&#x27;t do what you need to do, or where it would be easier to do it by just writing the code.  If the &quot;no code&quot; approach lets you write significant parts of your program that way, it may still be a net win, but it&#x27;s not the way we&#x27;re going to do all of programming in the future.')
