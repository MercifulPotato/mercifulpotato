With non-private cabins (or worse, standard seats), there&#x27;s nothing as dreadful as the sound of people boarding or leaving every hour through the entire night.<p>I&#x27;ve most reliably slept on trains where the journey is usually short, say four hours, yet the night itinerary is stretched to 7 or 8 hours. That&#x27;s usually a sign the train will stop before the destination and wait until the next morning before pulling in.')
