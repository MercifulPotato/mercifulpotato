It is only crippling poverty by today&#x27;s distortion lens (also a shifting baseline).<p>We should focus on what people really need to live quality lives, which is: good health (read: access to modern healthcare, freedom from pollution, disease), good food (read: freedom first from starvation, from malnutrition, poor diet), shelter from the elements, and then the rest of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy. Cars, TV, home appliances, and the whole lot of today&#x27;s energy-hungry living isn&#x27;t sustainable, and I&#x27;d argue isn&#x27;t even the thing we should be shooting for. People of the past lived very different and satisfying lives that we simply can&#x27;t imagine because, frankly, we are spoiled. People lived in tribes and hunted with spears for 100,000 years at least. And you know what, they beat those drums, painted their faces, tracked the stars, and contrary to whatever we might believe from our high place of &quot;development&quot; they actually <i>enjoyed</i> their lives.<p>This is a totally other conversation, but let&#x27;s just say, I disagree with a lot of what you say about money and what it means to people. Money&#x27;s new. We&#x27;ve been around a lot longer.')
