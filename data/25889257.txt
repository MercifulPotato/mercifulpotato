Python 2 programs simply get ported to python 3.   And we are already ten years into python 3, so yes, python 2 is going away at least as much as say Perl 4 or MySQL 3 or Oracle 7 has gone away.  Which is pretty damn away.<p>Also they aren&#x27;t withdrawing pip from being available for python 2.  You just use the older version of pip.  Programs that need pips newer features won&#x27;t install on python 2 anyway.  Because it&#x27;s really going away very quickly now.')
