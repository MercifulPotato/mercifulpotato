As the only full-time engineer, you&#x27;re more than just an engineer, you&#x27;re basically the IT department. So when the other departments were represented at meetings and disputes were being raised, IT wasn&#x27;t represented. You failed at basic office politics. Office politics gets a bad rep because lots of people play it to further themselves, but being able to play basic politics is required to make sure other departments don&#x27;t give your department all the blame.<p>Also, because you weren&#x27;t at the meetings you weren&#x27;t able to understand what the business really needed. If you understood what the business really needed you would have been delivering that and people would have noticed. Instead, I suspect you focused on the technical tasks and created a very good technical product that fit the basic idea of what was needed but didn&#x27;t deliver what is needed. In the future I would suggest looking into something like BDD, it basically follows the premise that business people don&#x27;t even know what to ask for, so you have to work with them in meetings to discover what the true need is. And because you weren&#x27;t really delivering what was needed as far as the other teams were concerned it most likely came across as they had no idea what you were doing therefore doing nothing at all.<p>Basically, meetings, they&#x27;re important. I hate to put it this way but I feel it&#x27;s the truth, it&#x27;s the difference between a software developer and software engineer. And the difference between a senior and a lead. It seems to me you would be much better suited for a role in a team where the management track stuff was dealt with by other people. I personally dislike the management track work but I understand the importance and I avoided management track roles for years to focus on writing code and solving problems.')
