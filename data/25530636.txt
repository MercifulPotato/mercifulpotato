At the same time, if you learn them early and practice a little bit, it&#x27;s not difficult to develop healthy habits that will make <i>everything</i> you play sound more natural and beautiful.<p>It&#x27;s a bit frustrating because at least in the U.S., most people don&#x27;t do this and just learn how to depress some keys in the right order.<p>To me, hearing that result is equivalent to walking into someone&#x27;s house and seeing pictures on the wall where the paint is smeared past the border onto the wall. It&#x27;s novel the first time, but once you realize <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> walls are like that you start to feel like you&#x27;re being set up to eventually burn to death inside a wicker man.')
