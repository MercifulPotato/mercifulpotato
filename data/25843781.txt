If you want to prove your point, go ahead and prove it. But shunting the work of making your point off to me, by telling me to go read an entire book just to be convinced by you, isn&#x27;t super persuasive. I already know what I think - you want to change my mind, then change my mind. I&#x27;m listening, but I&#x27;m not credulous.<p>So far, my original interest in the book from your earlier mention has been reduced by your less-than-stellar use of statistics in making your point. If that&#x27;s all the book offers, my time is better spent elsewhere.')
