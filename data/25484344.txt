You can promise a release date or you can promise features, but not both. Rarely both for a game this ambitious. It makes more sense not to hype a game up or promise a release date, and instead maintain power over when the release date is.<p>Gamers don&#x27;t care if they get a game 18 months later, as long as it&#x27;s better. They&#x27;ll bitch and whine but they will <i>always</i> still buy the game. They&#x27;re not going anywhere. Best to release a finished RPG late than release a half-assed one on some arbitrarily agreed upon date. Hopefully CDPR will learn this lesson, as countless other game developers have.')
