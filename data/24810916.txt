Item(by='jaydcarlson', descendants=None, kids=[24820859, 24821172], score=None, time=1602950375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805172, text='Please don&#x27;t quote me out of context: &quot;these raw parts&quot; referred to the MediaTek parts specifically, not all the parts in this review.<p>The only thing that SOMs provide is a processor + DRAM + PMIC. If you practice and become proficient at designing around application processors, it should take you no longer than 3-4 hours to get this component of the system (the processor, DRAM, and PMIC) laid out when working with these entry-level parts.<p>SOMs aren&#x27;t some magical remedy to all the problems. It&#x27;s still up to you to design the actual system, which takes hundreds of hours. The difference between using a SOM or a raw-chip design is negligible at this point.<p>I have no problem prototyping on EVKs --- in fact, I link to EVKs for each platform in my review. But a lot of these evaluation boards are pretty crummy to prototype with; some don&#x27;t have all the pins of the CPU brought out, others use proprietary connectors that are a hassle to adapt to your hardware. You shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to spend an 8-hour day designing a little breakout board for a part if you&#x27;re interested in using it in a product that&#x27;s going to span 6-months&#x27; worth of development time.<p>Of course there are caveats. I&#x27;m entirely focused on entry-level parts; if you need a Cortex-A72 with a 128-bit-wide dual-rank DRAM bus, sure, go buy a SOM. Also, it should go without saying that it completely depends on you and your company&#x27;s core competencies. This article is aimed at embedded designers who are usually working on hardware and software for microcontroller-based platforms. If you work at a pure software shop with no in-house EE talent then this article is likely not relevant to you.')
