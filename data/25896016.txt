It is often used as a common common language between people who don&#x27;t speak English natively, and so idioms and nuances from their own languages seep into this common English.<p>The finer points about the semantics of a word such as &#x27;man&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;men&#x27; and when it can be taken to refer to people unambiguously vs when it may accidentally imply you are talking about adult males are likely to be lost on a non-native speaker, especially if they come from a culture&#x2F;language where this distinction and its implications are not subjects of general interest. Even if they are well-versed in the use of English in general.<p>So it&#x27;s better to follow HN guidelines and assume the best intentions where meaning is unclear, instead of calling people out on their use of English.<p>Now, if you know for a fact that the GP is a native English speaker, and especially if you know that they are American, then what I&#x27;m saying is not very relevant.')
