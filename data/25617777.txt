Item(by='undo123', descendants=None, kids=[25620115], score=None, time=1609630834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25617104, text='Not looking to start or participate in a conspiracy, but I do think it’s valid to ask for both numbers: The number of people hospitalized (or died) who have C19, and the number of people hospitalized (or died) <i>because</i> of C19. Unless the coding systems simply can’t make that distinction, it seems like a no brainer to publish both numbers. The conspiracy theorists lose traction, and we get more data.<p>Despite this, I see precious few C19 dashboards that show the ratio. We’re lucky to see one that describes precisely what is counted as a hospitalization. We’ve had plenty of time to figure out how to report this, I’m stunned that there isn’t more transparency.')
