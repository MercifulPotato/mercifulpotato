I would argue that people vastly over estimate their degree of independent mindedness because although it&#x27;s easy to be independent minded in one field, especially if it&#x27;s one you have been studying for a while, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to fall victim to common sheep-like mentalities about any other topic you&#x27;re not an expert in. Just ask non-economists what they think of the economy, all of their answers, if not outright incorrect, will be canned answers stolen directly from whatever media outlet they use.<p>This is important to note because literally everyone does it. I don&#x27;t actually know of a single person that has not done this, and I personally have done it so many times I question my degree of independence and free will all the time. So what can we say about this? Is no one independent minded then?')
