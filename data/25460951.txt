It gave us the best of both worlds; an unsupported but compatible and stable dev environment we could bring up and throw away as much as we wanted _Without_ licensing BS. And when the devs were happy with it, the move of a project to RHEL was easy and uneventful.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on the &#x27;free&#x27; dev version of RHEL. It&#x27;s a PITA to use, we&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s also why we&#x27;ve halted our RH purchasing for the moment. Sure, it&#x27;s caused our RHEL reps no end of consternation and stress but too bad. I&#x27;ve been honest with them, and told them that they are probably lying through their teeth (without knowing it) when they parrot the line that RH will have some magic answer for &quot;expanded&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;reduced cost&quot; Streams usage in &quot;1st half of 21&quot;. That trust died when RH management axed CentOS8 like they did.')
