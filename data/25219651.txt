That has simply not been true in a long time. Especially looking at the disaster that is American democracy today, it is hard to grasp how people can still cling to this idea.<p>Among all developed countries I have visited and lived in America has always felt most like a police state to me. Cops are aggressive, overzealous  and tend to show zero tolerance. In general anybody with some authority are kind of scary in the US. Just look at immigration in the US. You will be hard pressed to find immigration in other developed countries behaving in this manner.<p>What I notice most interacting with American at authorities are all the threats. Pretty much any document you sign elaborate quite a lot on the dire consequences of filling it out wrong.<p>And as one can see online and I have experience myself, the Us is a country in perpetual paranoia. Cops get called all the time for nothing. And they abide. There is not any issue small enough for them to not show up. And they are not nice. They act like police state police. You can look at videos online of police arrests and dealing with different situations. American police tend to escalate and be very brutal. Slamming people to the ground. Beating them up. Pointing guns and yelling. Handcuffing even small kids. A ridiculous practice seen from the perspective of other actually free countries.<p>No, the US is an embarrassment to liberal democracy. It makes the rest of us living in democracies look bad.')
