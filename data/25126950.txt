(Even large eDRAMs sharing a die with logic don&#x27;t currently reach to gigabytes.) How far can DRAM-on-package go? NVidia just released a GPU with 96 GB of HBM on package (80 GB enabled, 16 GB disabled for yield reasons), with 30x the bandwidth (!!!) of the M1 processor. This wouldn&#x27;t be a low power or low cost solution, but for something like a future generation Mac Pro, it gives a good intuition for how far you can go with today&#x27;s technology.')
