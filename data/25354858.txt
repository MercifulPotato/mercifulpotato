Before anyone pounces on me (I actually have strong opinions about privacy)... I have a client that has 300 employees that are enforcement officers in the field on company issued phones during their shifts. (think tow truck drivers or parking enforcement officers) and they&#x27;d like to be able to quickly dispatch the &quot;nearest&quot; officer to the scene. Is this something we could use to get real-time locations of these officers?<p>I was asked for advice on coming up with a solution and I had a tough time finding a good solution that is API-first, battery optimized, and has solid Android support, and a privacy-friendly DNA. We just need the real-time location tracking piece so we can use the information for dispatching them.')
