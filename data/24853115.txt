There was a puzzle[1] in which you had to listen to a tone, cross a room and move a slider until you heard the same tone. I knew exactly what had to be done, but I could not match the tones even after many attempts. Finally, I had to ask for my mom&#x27;s help.<p>I carried the belief that I was tone-deaf with me for a decade or more until I happened to replay the game and found that as an adult, I had no difficulty completing the puzzle whatsoever. Apparently in my case, tone-deafness was a temporary condition of childhood. I wonder how many people have a childhood memory of not being able to sing in tune or complete a musical puzzle and believe they are tone-deaf for the rest of their lives.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qP6GU710jV4?t=141" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qP6GU710jV4?t=141</a>')
