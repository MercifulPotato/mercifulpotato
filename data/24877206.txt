We are seeing the damage from this right now: the minority is having their way in Supreme Court appointments.<p>&quot;James Madison made the following comment about the Senate:<p><pre><code>    In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The Senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, the people ought to have permanency and stability.\n\n    â€” Notes of the Secret Debates of the Federal Convention of 1787&quot;</code></pre>')
