Many smaller (and more recently established ISPs) ISPs have given up on buying IPv4 addresses and are now running CG-NAT behind the handful of IPv4 addresses they still own. Even big (especially older) ISPs with large IPv4 blocks are experimenting with CG-NAT (e.g. I know one large ISP who is doing it only for wireless broadband probably because it&#x27;s a easy test market). Either they&#x27;re looking at selling part of their blocks (since they could operate out of smaller blocks with CG-NAT if they downsized) or they are genuinely predicting that they will eventually run out of space in their existing blocks--and these blocks are huge.')
