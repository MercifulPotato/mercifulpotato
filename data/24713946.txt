Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24714256, 24714423], score=None, time=1602112537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709905, text='&gt; despite having a net positive ROI on its budget<p>This is a common trope but is hugely misleading.<p>The issue is that the IRS can spend e.g. $40 on enforcement to collect $100. But what they&#x27;re really doing is auditing several totally innocent people to find someone who has significantly underpaid and covers the costs of the audits for the others. The problem with this is that it imposes expensive and extremely stressful audits on several totally innocent people, and if you count their side of the cost, the &quot;profits&quot; are totally destroyed. The taxpayer has a better expected value to eat the cost of a certain amount of tax fraud than to pay the higher cost of a certain number of fruitless audits.<p>Moreover, the purpose of the IRS is to collect money to fund government programs, not to collect money to fund IRS audits. The money spent doing audits is a dead-weight loss which can&#x27;t go to programs. Meanwhile the ordinary IRS collection efficiency is &gt;99%. Inverting that and doing audits until the efficiency fell to zero would be a tremendous increase in inefficiency and dead-weight losses, but that&#x27;s where you would be if the metric was &quot;positive ROI&quot; from the perspective of the IRS.')
