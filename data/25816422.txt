The AI behind the facebook feed or the google ad tech is a very early beta of those agents - and &quot;on our behalf&quot; may seem a stretch.  But that&#x27;s not just a cheap snide remark - I think on our behalf is a fundamental issue of how they will be built and designed and regulated.<p>Richard Thaler has promoted Paternalistic Libertarianism - which seems to me a very good default setting for digital agents working on out behalf.  It&#x27;s not however that simple.<p>I hope we shall see a Medical approach to managing data - where everything is shaped by the best interests of the data subject.  But there are three major world views - let&#x27;s call them European, US and Chinese for over simplified ease.<p>The Us view is caveat emptor - one should be rugged individualist enough to be able to calculate the best co-pay arrangement and by extension work out ones preferred facebook privacy settings.  If you get it wrong you will be prey for the payday loan industry.<p>The European view that by default it should be good for the individual (although as a Brit I should sneak in that the state gets to define good.  And I suspect the Chinese view is it should be good for the confucian society - and the state may have some say in who is in and out of that.<p>As we are entering the new era of regulation of tech, these conflicting world views are becoming entangled - and we coders will be on that front line.<p>Choose a side - and be prepared for some very weird outcomes.')
