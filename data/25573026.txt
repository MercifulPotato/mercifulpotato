And the annoying thing for me is that I spend much of my (work) life sitting in front of a full-size keyboard, yet when I want to respond to a personal email on my phone it&#x27;s actually quicker to type it on the PC keyboard, mail it to myself, and then copy-paste it into my personal email on my phone.
