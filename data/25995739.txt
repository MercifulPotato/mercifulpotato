But in practice, Google Play is the standard app store and 99% of users use it exclusively, at least in the West.

The reason why Google Play has so many shitty apps is because Google simply doesn&#x27;t care about curation in the same way Apple does. That&#x27;s true for every Google product, by the way. They strongly favor algorithmic curation, while Apple also relies heavily on human curation.<p>If Apple allowed alternative app stores, nothing would change as far as the standard iOS app store is concerned. 99,99% of users would keep using the Apple app store unless there was a very compelling reason for using an alternative.')
