I would encourage people to listen to a balanced view on doctor Vinay Prasad&#x27;s excellent podcast &quot;Plenary Session&quot;. Even mentioning the <i>possibility</i> that this might be true is enough to get shouted down and accused of supporting Trump. In fact, it is quite unclear whether widespread masking is a net positive for US populations. It hasn&#x27;t been shown to be effective, and there are still many unstudied avenues that could lead to a negative result. Just a couple examples:<p>1. Giving people a false sense of security, causing them to go out when they feel sick when they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t.<p>2. Causing more face-touching behavior while fiddling with the mask, making infection more likely.<p>We just don&#x27;t know the answer.')
