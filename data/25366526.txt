SN8 will also attempt to perform a landing flip maneuver, which would be a first for a vehicle of this size.<p>&gt; With a test such as this, success is not measured by completion of specific objectives but rather how much we can learn as a whole, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship.')
