Item(by='zepearl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610408339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738203, text='&gt; <i>the retailer must accept the equivalent appliance you are replacing and recycle.</i><p>Interesting - to be honest I&#x27;m not sure if Switzerland has the same rule or not - so far I always brought my old stuff to local retailers even if I didn&#x27;t buy anything from them - usually we just leave the stuff outside of the shop in some designated areas. It could be that the retailers then &quot;get a cut&quot; on what is sent to be recycled, I honestly don&#x27;t know, but so far nobody ever complained to me.<p>One thing that is not so great is that outside of those shops there are usually &quot;scavengers&quot; (trying to find something valuable that can be reused or sold - quite good chances for that to happen in Switzerland) that can make quite a mess (e.g. they might break a TV-panel trying to reach for whatever is behind them =&gt; glass everywhere on the floor).<p>I usually position my own stuff tactically to avoid that and leave on it a post-it stating something like &quot;panel has broken pixels&quot; or &quot;device works but battery cannot be charged&quot; or &quot;works perfectly it was just old&quot;, etc... =&gt; little effort for me, less effort for the scavengers and the shop&#x27;s recycling area doesn&#x27;t get messed up :)')
