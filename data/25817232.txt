Updates for me take less than five minutes to upload and appear within an hour or so.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have many users, or don&#x27;t use any minification, or something else?<p>I&#x27;d like to publish for Safari but it&#x27;s a much higher bar. Similar to the old Edge extensions which required Microsoft Store hoop jumping.')
