Tap for options&quot;<p>Tapping brought me to a menu that said:<p>&quot;Safety Number Changes -- The following people many have reinstalled or changed devices.  Verify your safety number with them to ensure privacy&quot;<p>At which point I was given the option to re-verify (e.g. via a provided QR code), but also the option to manually mark &quot;verified&quot;.  That is to say <i>something</i> does notify participants of changes to recipient devices.')
