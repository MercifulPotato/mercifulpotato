They are still missing some features I find critical, but they really have things figured out with integrated voice&#x2F;video communications in the app.<p>The one feature I wish they&#x27;d clone from Slack are threaded replies. I know they&#x27;re rolling out a new way to reply, but it still makes the chat flow messy. I really enjoyed the way Slack allows for breakout threads&#x2F;replies to a particular message.
