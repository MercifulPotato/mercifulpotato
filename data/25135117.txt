It&#x27;s also an incredible tool to teach both probability (given that you use two dice, and understanding the probabilities of dice events is crucial) and risk&#x2F;reward judgment calls. It teaches many of the same lessons of poker, but without the gambling aspects.<p>As for the section on that page, you could make the same arguments about monopoly, or any game that uses dice. Backgammon can be played for money like any game, but it&#x27;s not the usual way to play it, and it&#x27;s not integral to how it functions. Indeed, the conclusion of the judge in that case was that it was NOT gambling, but a game of skill.')
