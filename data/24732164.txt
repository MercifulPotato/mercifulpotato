Yes, sometimes after you&#x27;ve installed new packages, the Julia VS Code Language Server has to do some re-indexing which can take some time, but they&#x27;ve improved this and you can still program and use the integrated REPL while this is occurring.<p>&gt; Ctrl-click navigation does not work to lookup definitations in libraries<p>In VS Code, F12 (Go to Definition) does work. You can also use `@edit foo(x)` in the REPL.<p>&gt; Filters and maps are not lazy<p>Use Iterators.filter or use generator expressions.<p>&gt; Package management is done as a part of script execution<p>I&#x27;m also not sure what this refers to, but the package manager in Julia is one of the best things about Julia.<p>&gt; Editors (Juno) do not check types at runtime when the information is readily available<p>The VS Code Julia extension has a linter that is pretty helpful. It&#x27;s not perfect, but they&#x27;re actively working on developing it.<p>&gt; DataFrames.jl: Transform does nonsense (use map instead)<p>The new select and transform functions in DataFrames.jl are actually quite powerful and useful.<p>&gt; DataFrames.jl: No transpose<p>Transpose is not a generic concept for a table. Sure, it might make sense in specific cases, but in general it doesn&#x27;t make sense to transpose a table.')
