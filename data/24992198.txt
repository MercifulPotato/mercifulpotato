They are all allowed to make their own types of ballots, allow (or not allow) mail-in voting, decide how many workers to employ for the process,  etc.  The US government is, by law, not allowed to mess with any of that.  Check out how different, for example, Maine&#x27;s process was this year.  They didn&#x27;t have one winner. They split out electoral votes to two different candidates.')
