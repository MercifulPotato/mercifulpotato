You can either have the backup server ssh into your clients, or set up an account on the backup server for each client to use.  In that case, &#x27;snebu&#x27; is installed owned by the user ID snebu, and is set-uid to that ID.<p>When starting up, it checks if your UID is different than your EUID.  If so, it looks up your UID in a table to determine what you can do (listbackups, restore, newbackup&#x2F;submitfiles, expire, purge), affecting which backup sets.<p>Back on the pull backups, the backup server ssh&#x27;s to a client (optionally using a non-privliged user), then sudo&#x27;s to root (or if backing up files owned by a specific account, can sudo to that account).  And no software is required on the client in that case (except tarcrypt if doing encryption).  So it is really easy to set up backups on a fleet of servers.<p>BTW, I see in your profile that you are a C++ programmer -- feel free to drop by the github repository (github.com&#x2F;derekp7&#x2F;snebu) if you have any issues or ideas (I have Github discussions enabled also for free form chat).')
