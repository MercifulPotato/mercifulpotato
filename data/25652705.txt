Everyone would sign up for the test vaccine to get a chance at escaping quarantine without understanding the risk.  And if we offered this on a regular basis it is inevitable that a candidate drug would have adverse effects on a large group and people would be out for blood because nobody actually read the fine print.<p>Here’s a list of examples that shows why the FDA must be deliberate in their testing.  People can die or be permanently crippled when we screw it up.  Just imagine if we rushed a coronavirus vaccine with a similar safety concern and ended up hurting millions of people before we realized it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history....</a><p>The FDA already does have compassionate use exemptions for people that are on death’s door and there are no downsides to taking an experimental drug- they’re dying anyway if it doesn’t work out.  I think that’s about the right level threshold for deciding whether to give people unproven drugs and we should not have rushed the vaccines any faster- hindsight may show us that the vaccines are safe but we couldn’t have known that a few months ago.  We have to do the testing.')
