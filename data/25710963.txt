Item(by='clouddrover', descendants=None, kids=[25711140, 25712449], score=None, time=1610257713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25709875, text='YouTube rolled out AV1 support quite some time ago. Many YouTube videos are AV1 encoded. Here&#x27;s one example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k3Yk6FrjMkQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k3Yk6FrjMkQ</a><p>You can tell if it&#x27;s playing back in AV1 in your browser by right-clicking on the video and selecting &quot;Stats for Nerds&quot; to find out the video and the audio codecs. On my system in Firefox it&#x27;s AV1 for video and Opus for audio.<p>For that video the file size savings are a bit hit and miss. AV1 saves a lot versus H.264 at 1080p, saves a little bit at 720p and 480p, and saves a bit more at 360p.<p>The 1080p results for that video are:<p>- AV1 50.28MiB<p>- VP9 69.12MiB<p>- H.264 106.68MiB<p>So a clear win at 1080p for AV1 versus VP9 and H.264.<p>Sometimes YouTube&#x27;s AV1 encodes can actually end up being bigger than the H.264 versions due to the vagaries of automated transcoding.<p>When AV1 support was newly added to Firefox I used this 1080p60 video as a benchmark for my system:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fmdb-KmlzD8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Fmdb-KmlzD8</a><p>Over the course of the development of Firefox&#x27;s AV1 support and the switch to the dav1d decoder (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.videolan.org&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;dav1d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.videolan.org&#x2F;videolan&#x2F;dav1d</a>) that video has gone from being unwatchable due to too many dropped frames to now playing back smoothly.<p>My system still struggles with AV1 above 1080p in Firefox though.')
