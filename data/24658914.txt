Can we just fucking fight this virus already?</i><p>Because the numbers actually matter. We could save lives by quarantining the entire population during every flu season.  We don&#x27;t, because the social and economic costs would far outweigh the benefits. It may well be the case that COVID is so dangerous that it justifies destroying millions of jobs, disrupting children&#x27;s education, and forbidding physical proximity with friends and family. But if you&#x27;re going to argue for that you need to use numbers rather than righteous indignation.')
