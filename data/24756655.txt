Each time they do that, you have to call them or send them a form asking to opt-out again. That&#x27;s right. Once is not enough. You have to constantly opt-out each time they send you new card agreement. If I remember correctly, you have 30 days to opt-out again or you&#x27;ll be automatically part of their data &quot;sharing&quot; program.')
