It seems that they&#x27;re typing a command in Slack, and this triggers a pipeline. Which is something I&#x27;ve been wanting to introduce for our team.<p>Our UAT environment is deployed with fixed versions, and is only updated either after a sprint, or when the business wants to test new features. Generally this is done by someone from the business asking to deploy a new version, and then a developer manually triggering this process. I see no reason as to why the business wouldn&#x27;t just be able to do this through Slack, and not have developer act as a middleman.')
