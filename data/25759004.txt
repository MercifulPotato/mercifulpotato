Most calm and constructive forums and mailing lists I’ve ever seen had an unwritten rule (written actually, but who reads ‘em, right?) to ignore “hot” messages or at least the hot tone in these. It doesn’t prove that it’s the only way, but once the reply is done, every other user feels urge to add to that, because it is in a human nature that something said repeatedly or upvoted has more weight than something stated once, but it is harder if you’re first (crowd psychology). It is a culture of a public place (a thing that supports healthy cooperation) and they have to learn it, no matter how strong is their desire to respond.')
