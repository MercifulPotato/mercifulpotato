They should be allowed to grow uncontrollably to make as much money as possible but it&#x27;s actually impossible for them to know the details (moderate content in this specific iteration of the argument) of what they have grown. The point of this thread is the same argument against that very idea.<p>If the organization is so big that the CEO believes that, it shouldn&#x27;t matter.
