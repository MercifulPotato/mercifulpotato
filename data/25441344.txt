Firms and consumers don&#x27;t want to do business with companies that look like they&#x27;re triviliasing child abuse. The payment processors are not compelled by regulation here.<p>Even in a &#x27;free market&#x27; you&#x27;re not free from the consequences of your actions, and you&#x27;re not unaccountable. And furthermore, just because two actions are motivated by ethical judgements, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re equivalent. Being a homophobic cake vendor isn&#x27;t the same as trying to stop the funding of child porn.<p>The EFF article seems to suffer from the same misconception, accusing Visa and Mastercard of &#x27;censorship&#x27; and asks where they got the authority to &#x27;regulate speech&#x27;.<p>In free societies there is another freedom, namely freedom of association, which these firms exercise when they decide not to do business with Pornhub, which nobody ought to compell them to. Also as a sidenote, declaring pornsite payments freedom of speech is a strange reframing of the concept')
