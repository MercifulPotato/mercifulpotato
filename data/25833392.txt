IMO it looks to us like the only &quot;natural&quot; way for humans is a centralized system&#x2F;power structure because we simply are unable to envision a world which is not. It also would require an unrealistic &quot;deprogramming&quot; of society which makes the idea just another utopia (at least not achievable without huge sacrifice to what we hold dear today). The more likely scenario in which this is more realistic is after a total collapse of anything we associate today with society&#x2F;humans. Even after collapse we&#x27;d have probably lost everyone except the most brutal selfish individuals and therefore we&#x27;d have to again first go through similar phases of central power structure ...<p>To paraphrase Zizek&#x27;s quote on the end of capitalism: We are so far down that road, that it&#x27;s easier to imagine the end of the humanity than it is to imagine humanity living in a decentralized society.')
