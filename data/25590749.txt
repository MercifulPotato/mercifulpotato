For some it&#x27;s 1984. For me it was Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot;. It, and the questions it raised, are still with me.<p>Monsignor Quixote I can also recommend. The others I read I have forgotten, except for Brighton Rock which I didn&#x27;t like.<p>As a sibling commenter has said, if you have any form of religious background or have seen that world, his books speak with a depth I think it would be difficult to grasp without that.')
