You could add a sensor that&#x27;s just a few dollars more expensive at scale - it seems the margins are trivially there since that would easily justify a $50 markup.  I realize the optics also matter, but at this point it&#x27;s really the sensors limiting the phones, not the cheap glass.<p>In an industry where everyone is struggling for an edge, it just seems painfully obvious to do this to me.  I look forward to someone more knowledgeable telling me why all my assumptions are wrong though (I mean that literally, no snark intended!).')
