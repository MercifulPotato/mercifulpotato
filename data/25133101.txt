You&#x27;re starting with some of the most intelligent, diligent, bright-eyed young people on the planet and letting them work independently in a field that they presumably have a deep passion for.<p>All we ask them to do is write 100 pages or so on a topic of their choosing. They&#x27;re given four or five years, which comes out to less than a page a week. Yet more than half will fail to complete the task due to attrition. (Yeah, I know this is over-simplified...)<p>And I think the obvious answer is that humans, in general, are horrendous at being self-directed on long-running, large-scale, multi-step tasks.<p>Almost anybody who consistently produces anything of real value works on a team, where at least there&#x27;s some semblance of regular accountability to other humans. The rare example of truly productive people who can work in isolation are almost all (rightly so) lauded as atypical geniuses.')
