You can even play it on a  whiteboard. The rulebook gives various stats for your assets (ships, planes, missiles and weapon systems), and you roll dice for things like sensor detection (radar, sonar, etc), scoring hits and damage to the target. There might be modifiers to various dice roles for weather, countermeasures, equipment and troop quality, etc.<p>I played an early version a few times in the 80s, and read The Hunt for Red October the year it came out. Funnily enough I watched the movie last week, it really holds up.')
