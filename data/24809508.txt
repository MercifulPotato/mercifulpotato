Not only do you get fully working code (which could easily save you 100+ hours of dev time) but you also get direct access to the author to ask questions. At least that&#x27;s what I do in my own courses (I offer (24&#x2F;7 - sleeping hours) support).<p>Sure the fully working code that gets continuous updates is nice on its own but think how expensive it would be if you wanted to hire someone to do 1 on 1 help with you as you learn something new from various blog posts and scattered Youtube videos. You could easily spend $100-200 an hour for that and it would be less effective because the person you&#x27;re paying likely didn&#x27;t write the material you&#x27;re learning from.<p>For a lot of folks $100 is well worth saving an endless amount of nights of furiously Googling around on how to troubleshoot things. Especially if they have a family or are trying to ship whatever they want to build as soon as possible.<p>With enough persistence you might be able to battle through that on your own, especially if it&#x27;s a well explored technology that&#x27;s been around for a long time but we all have limited time. If you value spending 50 hours of your own time instead of spending $100 then you&#x27;re right, you&#x27;re probably not the target audience for buying courses.')
