Less capable people can document what someone more skilled solved if they&#x27;re not great communicators (I knew several people exactly like this). Having all documenters doesn&#x27;t necessarily allow tackling hard problems but could risk reducing the bar to who can communicate in-lieu of doing hard things. There is a finite supply of hard problem solvers and even fewer far who can communicate well. It may or may not be cheaper to hire one who can&#x27;t communicate and a technical writer or junior staffer rather than an all-in-one unicorn who can do everything.')
