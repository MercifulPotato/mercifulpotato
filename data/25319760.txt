I run (a little), but have never enjoyed it. I&#x27;ve never once experienced a &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot;--even when I ran 5-6x per week for years. I still do it a couple times a week because it&#x27;s a quick way to get my heart beating, and I do feel better afterwards.<p>I think that &quot;feeling better afterwards&quot; _is_ runner&#x27;s high.')
