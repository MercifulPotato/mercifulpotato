I don&#x27;t want it to be justification for further authoritarianism.<p>It already happened, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be punished if its done or incited with State approval (Trump&#x27;s inflammatory rhetoric and constant lies about a stolen election).<p>What you&#x27;re describing already happened, long ago actually; its the selective application of this authoritarianism that you should be worried about now. Don&#x27;t be surprised to see more heavy handedness like we saw last year when any form of dissent takes place in DC now with this as a justification, the thought of &#x27;free speech zones&#x27; once seemed like conspiratorial hyperbole, but after this I&#x27;m not sure its not a given under the premise of curtailing &#x27;domestic terrorism.&#x27;<p>Take the case of this 28 year old disgruntled &#x27;black panther sympathizer&#x27; Colorado citizen who colluded with what was later revealed to be an undercover police to shoot the Attorney General [0]. They&#x27;re making it seem like its this massive success and they foiled an assassination and made him forfeit his firearms to the State for merely stating what he would do if he had the chance, by contrast you had those &#x27;protestors&#x27; armed with actual firearms and IEDs show up to one of the most surveiled places on Earth, and with the help of LEO to enter to overthrow Biden&#x27;s confirmation and in the case of the Q-anon ex Navy vet&#x2F;woman who was shot by secret service trying to enter the building letting &#x27;liberty ring and bring light to darkness.&#x27;<p>That is the most blatant conspiracy to increase the budget and incentives for the Police State since 9&#x2F;11 in my view, and it was all recorded and they were simply let off with no repercussions thus far and you have this feeling if impending doom for something that already happened?<p>I really hate dwelling on race based things and white privilege as its over used in most respects, but it is without a doubt apparent for all to see that non-whites are on the lowest of the 3&#x2F;4 tiers of the US legal system that systematically seeks to put them in the for profit prison system. Especially when in comes to question the crimes and wrongful deaths of the Police State.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coloradosun.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;05&#x2F;denver-police-guns-weiser-red-flag&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coloradosun.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;05&#x2F;denver-police-guns-weiser...</a><p>EDIT: 15 have were arrested &#x27;so far&#x27; and are awaiting sentencing for the event that happened this week.')
