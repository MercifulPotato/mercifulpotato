I thought it would take off since you could get them in an AT form factor system<p>At that time period it failed because the design wasn&#x27;t sufficiently open to allow manufacturing of motherboards by ten different Taiwanese motherboard makers. The whole x86 AT form factor PC component ecosystem was there to support it, except for the motherboards, which were treated as a proprietary secret sauce.<p>It was totally cost prohibitive to attract a large base of independent software developers. At the time the first Alphas came out, you could buy or build a pretty nice Pentium based desktop for around $2000 to $2500, when the alpha desktops cost $4000+. And this was in 1994-1996 pre-inflation US dollars. Ultimately it had the same problem as the NeXT workstation and cube, that very few ordinary people could actually afford to buy one.')
