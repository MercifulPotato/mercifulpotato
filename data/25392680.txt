Generally a buffer on a relevant Org file is never <i>not</i> visible to me, so I don&#x27;t really need org-capture and went with a keymap based on the direct-to-template invocation described in the linked documentation.<p>I also use a Mac for work, but tend to forget about all the complex gymkhana I go through with keyboard prefs and Karabiner-Elements to get its keyboard to behave like those of the Linux and Windows machines I use. Since that includes remapping Caps to Command outside Emacs, and Command to Control inside it, that all probably makes my keybinding advice a little useless, or at least worth more consideration of how things would be in a closer-to-stock configuration.')
