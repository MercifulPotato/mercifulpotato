I don&#x27;t really feel like I get that in CA. It&#x27;s like an extremely inefficient engine.<p>Ironically there is one way in which the tax benefits are ABSURDLY generous - unemployment. When I saw how much that returned I was staggered. Perhaps I&#x27;m in an income sweet spot, but when I calculated it, it was far more assistance than I would have expected from a non-French government.<p>I&#x27;m aware of course that state tax sits on top of Federal tax, but when you factor into the equation what responsibilities are Federal and not state, it looks astonishingly poorly distributed.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure how the high cost of living is anything other than a milestone around the area&#x27;s neck. I&#x27;ve lived in v-high COL areas, but that has always gone hand in hand with extreme density, which could easily be viewed at as a simple tax for the provision of world-class services. Somehow I&#x27;m out here in suburbia paying Megacity rates.')
