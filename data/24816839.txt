Sometimes I have to reply to those company and especially in a Mail client setup it becomes difficult to reply from &lt;company-name&gt;@mydomain.tld and I often end up replying from &lt;my-first-name&gt;@mydomain.tld and they have my main email as well. Unless of course I setup a &quot;reply-from&quot; for each of these &lt;company-name&gt; emails I used.')
