We have layers and layers of magic that make us _very_ good at that.<p>For cases where you have lots of devices throwing small chunks at high frequency and you have to respond (in this one, do a small computation, and out that one...) we&#x27;ve sucked bad.<p>That&#x27;s why bare metal RTOS&#x27;s still exist.<p>The io_uring &#x2F; eBPF combo looks _very_ promising for opening up that domain in a tidy fashion.<p>I also hope there will be no reason to throw away &quot;heaps and mounds of existing and perfectly working code and solutions&quot;.<p>I hope to replace my finely tuned epoll &#x2F; read&#x2F;write reactor pattern inner loop with io_uring &#x2F; eBPF and leave 99% of the code untouched... just better throughput &#x2F; lower latencies.')
