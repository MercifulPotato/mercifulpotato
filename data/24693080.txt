We&#x27;re human and can&#x27;t say for certain that falling asleep is impossible (or some other medical event won&#x27;t happen).<p>We live with that risk, and some others have to live with more risk because of their circumstances.  I&#x27;m more reacting to all the posts that no one should ever drive at all with even the slightest risk that they&#x27;ll fall asleep, which is just an unrealistic ideal for most of us.<p>You know they let some people drive who have extremely bad eyesight--bad enough that that they can&#x27;t read road signs?  Yet they are allowed to drive, because not driving makes participation in our economy next to impossible.')
