I want to work with knowledgeable people so that we can work together efficiently and teach each other stuff. If the person above me doesnt know the answer to simple things, then I might question the strength of the team. The interviewee typically doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, but they are evaluating you too.</i><p>Yes, and I&#x27;m interested to see that evaluation and how they act on it. The whole thing is what you do with vulnerability: does the person correct me and consider it a problem to fix? How does the person do it? Does the person rejoyce that I got something wrong&#x2F;don&#x27;t know something? (which is the case of people who don&#x27;t know much who do not believe when they &quot;get to correct someone&quot; and make it a big deal). Will the person let it slide and be secretly disappointed and talk about it (which is characteristic of bad, toxic, organizations)?<p>Delivery is key. This reveals a lot by incurring a small &quot;reputation&quot;&#x2F;&quot;perception&quot; debt repaid quickly afterwards.<p>That and you other points are all valid concerns.')
