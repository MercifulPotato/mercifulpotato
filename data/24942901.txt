But many other binaries appear to have roughly aligned axes of rotation, which is what astrophysicists expect when the two black holes began their lives as a binary star system.<p>This is mindboggling -- you can tell two black holes from thousand of light years away had misaligned axes of rotation by measuring the effect they have on lasers bouncing some mirrors.')
