Item(by='ryan_j_naughton', descendants=None, kids=[25987194, 25987315], score=None, time=1612171689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986840, text='Totally valid point but I&#x27;m also conflicted here.<p>I live in Washington DC where crime definitely happens (there was a double shooting 150 feet from my house 3 weeks ago).<p>I have cameras installed so I can monitor my house along with an alarm system.<p>My cameras are angled so as to preserve my privacy (e.g. no cameras inside the house) although they do capture anytime someone enters or leaves my house.<p>My backyard camera captures several other people&#x27;s front porches and I&#x27;ve thought about that as I have no interest in capturing their front porch and monitoring them. I have drawn my polygons for the event captures to only trigger if some one enters my yard.<p>That being said, the city of DC has a program where if you register your camera with them so they know where they are and you have 2 days of 24&#x2F;7 recording history, then they will reimburse cameras up to $500 total. [1]<p>I just signed up for that rebate program as $500 is $500. Free money.<p>And honestly if my camera would have been setup and registered with them prior that that shooting earlier this month, I would have happily given them that footage to aid their investigation.<p>But again, I have no interest in spying on my neighbors.<p>So how could this be resolved so this data doesn&#x27;t proliferate in usage by the police for minor crimes but is still available for serious crimes. If someone breaks into my house, I definitely want their face to be on camera.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ovsjg.dc.gov&#x2F;page&#x2F;private-security-camera-rebate-program" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ovsjg.dc.gov&#x2F;page&#x2F;private-security-camera-rebate-pro...</a>')
