For example, in the US, ballpark 1% of cars are electric. Meanwhile, the flat federal fuel tax is not indexed to inflation &amp; hasn&#x27;t been increased in almost thirty years. Yet everyone is in this panic about how EVs are going to cause a huge revenue shortfall!? I&#x27;m not opposed to EVs paying their share, but something is rotten in Denmark.<p>Anyway, shifting fuel taxes onto tires might make sense. All cars use tires, no matter the fuel, it requires no odometer reading, and a tire has a designed application &amp; load range which ought to translate reasonably well to anticipated road wear.')
