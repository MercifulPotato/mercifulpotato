Try using lua without support frameworks. Modding ns2 is a nightmare with zero docs and trying to reverse engineer in a terrible debug environment. Lua just doesn&#x27;t stand up by itself.<p>You are only discussing the successes. Even built for purpose, game building applications like Core fail miserably to make development easy enough off the back of lua. Far cry 1 had lua scripts that went nowhere.<p>What love2d games?? The tech demos and hobby projects listed on the website??<p>For the three or four big successes there are a lot of obscure failures.<p>The big successes of creative modding projects came out of Half Life, Half Life 2 and Warcraft 3 which spawned Dota,  team fortress, counter-strike, left for dead, garry&#x27;s mod and many other successes.<p>War3&#x27;s editor and XNA are the best modding environment&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen for individual acheivement.<p>Kids dont know better, they just put up with the jank and learn from their friends.')
