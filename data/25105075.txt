Don&#x27;t fill the issue with any more comments as it&#x27;s likely to be locked and not really achieve anything more than that (specifically looking at you &quot; dsignr&quot;)<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fair. If you didn&#x27;t want to stoke internet drama, the thing to do would have been not to submit it to HN in the first place. Having submitted it, it&#x27;s unsporting to put the onus on others to de-escalate, and singling out a particular user feels particularly distasteful.<p>Edit: also, comments like these stoke further escalation:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25103613" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25103613</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25103873" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25103873</a><p>Please don&#x27;t use HN for this, and please don&#x27;t target people personally.
