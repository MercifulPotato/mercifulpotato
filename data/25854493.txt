I thought about implementing something like that for Pd, but in reverse. Programs there tend to look like write-only spaghetti, so it would be helpful to have something like a &quot;spotlight&quot; feature that temporarily removes (or blurs, etc.) the spaghetti that isn&#x27;t part of a currently selected chain of objects. That would make spaghetti at least navigable with a mouse and some time.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;ve never found a dataflow or visual programming that really deals with the ergonomics of writing the code. At some point I just want to do a little math, or a quick conditional, or some such conceptually simple business for which the graph just gets in the way. At that point it&#x27;s easiest to drop down to some kind of text-based DSL <i>inside</i> a single box and be done with it.')
