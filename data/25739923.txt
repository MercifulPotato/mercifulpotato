Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=[25740076], score=None, time=1610408800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739002, text='I look at this--with the caveat of casually accepting the frame of &quot;censor&quot; to include &quot;stuff done by private companies&quot; (which isn&#x27;t, of course, how it is technically defined)--as &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to censor people... but, since Facebook&#x2F;Twitter think that&#x27;s somehow OK, we are going to make an exception to our rule about this and censor <i>them</i> to show them how it feels (though of course, if you would prefer to not take part in this, contact us and we will happily turn this off for you, as we&#x27;re only willing to take this demonstration so far)&quot;. FWIW, I consider this frame to be not only consistent but even acceptable, and it is similar to essentially all attempts to ensure freedom: &quot;we believe in the freedom of all people... and so if you attempt to harm someone else&#x27;s freedom we punish you (and only you) by taking away <i>your</i> freedom&quot;.')
