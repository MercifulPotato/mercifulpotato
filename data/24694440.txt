My legs can only take this for about half an hour before I start feeling the lack of blood flow, so Iâ€™m forced to change positions, stand up and rest for a little, or move to a desk or to the sofa. Even in the sofa I work sitting with my legs crossed up in the sofa for the same reason. I find this forces me to change my position quite frequently and never work for too long at a time without moving at least a little.')
