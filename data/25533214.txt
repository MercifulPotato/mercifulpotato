But for clarification:<p>Not trust, just statistics.  Great Britain has ~half the fire related deaths per million people vs the US.  Various differences make comparing countries difficult, but their doing reasonably well vs the US.<p>Anyway, I donâ€™t think the current system is optimal. However, fixing the stairwell issue <i>before</i> telling people to evacuate <i>might</i> be better than telling people to evacuate tomorrow.  Eventually, evacuation is likely the better option and should therefore be the long term goal.<p>And so it goes across a million possibilities which is guaranteed to be suboptimal and interact with each other.')
