Item(by='Arathorn', descendants=None, kids=[25030070], score=None, time=1604875469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029649, text='Yes, we think it will help meaningfully help detect and reduce abuse - mainly because it&#x27;s shamelessly mimicking the way society works in real life.  Many (most?) abusive communities are at least adjacent if not overlapping with publicly visible communities.  Simply put, they need a way to advertise and recruit.<p>So, just as in person you might stay away from a given political party &#x2F; religious institute &#x2F; youth club because your social graph has warned you that it might actually be a front for whatever obnoxiousness, the same approach can work online (or, conversely, could also be used to help hunt down abuse in the first place).  It&#x27;s then up to the authorities to investigate what&#x27;s going on - which is quite possible through infiltration etc without having to go and blanket break encryption for the whole of society.<p>To be clear: this is still largely sci-fi, and we don&#x27;t think this is a perfect solution, especially given this is a fundamental problem of the human species which nobody has yet solved.  Our proposal doesn&#x27;t solve lone wolf situations, for instance.  So perhaps for that you need the ability to gather evidence from endpoints post hoc.<p>Unrelated: one particularly dark dystopian outcome we&#x27;ve been wargaming is: what if someone (not us!) used decentralised rep to seed a GPT-3 style bot to locate abusive communities, and then automated the process of infiltrating &amp; investigating them... only to then end up ascending the ranks while preserving its cover and accidentally triggered some atrocity.  So, um, let&#x27;s not do that.)')
