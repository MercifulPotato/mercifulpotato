I wonder how important is static register allocation by the compiler in that scenario. In theory, even if the compiler uses the same register over and over in sequential instructions, the renamer should be smart enough to detect the false data dependencies and allocate registers from individual instructions to different locations in the register file.<p>Are there any x86 profiling tools which give any metrics about the real utilisation of the register file?')
