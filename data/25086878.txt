One is using a battery on a laptop and the other is plugged in to a power source with dedicated cooling.<p>Yes, Apple is claiming this is a better solution but that&#x27;s mostly for laptops. While they did release a Mac mini, they still haven&#x27;t released an Apple SoC Mac Pro or iMac. Those would be fair game for such comparison.')
