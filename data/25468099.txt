I attended a public&#x2F;state university for 5 semesters studying computer science, and dropped out due to personal matters (while also getting paid employment during the internet boom in a relatively rural part of the United States.) My first paid job didn&#x27;t pan out, but then I got my first salaried position as a web developer, and I&#x27;ve been employed ever since (though I&#x27;m currently furloughed but mostly satisfied to be so because - I can handle it financially, and I have lots of work and projects around the house to keep me busy.)<p>I&#x27;ve often thought about getting a degree, mostly for some additional pointers on low-level, algorithmic engineering, and for exploring more interesting computer science subjects in greater depth. However, I don&#x27;t plan on doing full-time development work for a significant period of time going forward, so the investment of money and time at a traditional four-year university doesn&#x27;t seem worth it to me.<p>This alternative may or may not pay for itself in compensation, but that isn&#x27;t why I would pursue it. I&#x27;m just interested in the education!')
