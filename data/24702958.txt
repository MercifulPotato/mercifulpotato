I certainly wouldn&#x27;t if I were in charge of hiring.<p><i>You</i> might not be, but there are certainly companies where H-1Bs are their bread and butter[1]. Taking Cognizant as an example:<p>* their wikipedia page says &quot;The company has 281,200[2] employees globally, of which over 150,000 are in India&quot;, which means there are at most 131,200 US employees<p>* in the year 2017 they brought in 28,908 H-1B workers. This works out to 22% of the US workforce. If we include 2016 as well that works out to 38% of the US workforce.<p>* the figures above are conservative estimates. We probably overestimated their US workforce and underestimated their H-1B population (we&#x27;ve only looked at 2 years of visas, but H1-B visas are good for up to 6 years).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H-1B_visa#Top_H-1B_employers_by_visas_approved" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H-1B_visa#Top_H-1B_employers_b...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cognizant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cognizant</a>')
