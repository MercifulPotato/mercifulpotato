As someone who regularly produces YouTube and Reddit content as well as content for my own site (which I often share here), it seemed like it might be worthwhile. So I&#x27;ve signed up. Obviously nothing yet, but I was interested in hearing from other publishers&#x2F;creators&#x2F;whatever who&#x27;ve signed up:<p>* Who is your audience?<p>* Do you receive any BAT?<p>* How much of your audience appears to be using Brave and are contributing BAT?<p>I&#x27;m going to use Brave for non-work things for the next week or two and buy about $15 worth of BAT so I can help contribute to this little experimental attention economy.<p>Thanks for reading&#x2F;answering.')
