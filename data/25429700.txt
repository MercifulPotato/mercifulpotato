I&#x27;d really like to be able to use tools like find, grep and friends to interact with those files.<p>With painfully slow access to Windows mounted drives this makes using those tools not possible in practice. No one wants to wait 15 seconds to grep through a directory where the same operation finishes in 1 second in native Linux.<p>This becomes a real nuisance with my backup script that rsyncs things from WSL 2&#x27;s file system + Windows mounted drive onto an external drive. It takes rsync over 5 minutes (!) just to figure out what it needs to send over the wire because statting hundreds of thousands of files on a Windows mounted drive is ridiculously slow. With WSL 1 it used to take about 5 seconds to run rsync with that backup script to transfer a very small diff of files. I&#x27;m not exaggerating here either. It&#x27;s literally 5 minutes vs 5 seconds and I&#x27;m sure native Linux would probably be 2-3 seconds.')
