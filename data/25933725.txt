So in order to get your report off the printer, you&#x27;d have to form feed a couple of times so you could tear off the report.  This left you with reports &amp; printouts that started with 1-2 blank pages, so it was common to remove those and put them in the pile of &quot;scrap paper&quot; (which was what my Dad used to bring home for us kids!).')
