Item(by='CarelessExpert', descendants=None, kids=[24921561], score=None, time=1603905006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921229, text='&gt; My opinion - today - is that X doesn&#x27;t work on laptops where the user expects to use a touchpad. Nor does it work on a laptop with a resolution that requires scaling (at least not the second you plug in another display).<p>None of those issues actually make X unusable.  And I say that while writing this on an X1 Carbon running Debian testing using X in a multi-monitor setup (and yes, this is a totally plug-and-play setup with zero monkeying around in config files... a fact that, frankly, amazes me, having grown up hacking X modelines).<p>Wayland, by contrast, is <i>literally</i> unusable (as in, it lacks fundamental features that make it something people can&#x27;t use) in many circumstances due to either compositor bugs, features that don&#x27;t work by design, or features that don&#x27;t work due to a lack of solutions or a lack of adoption of those solutions.<p>And I know this because I&#x27;ve <i>tried</i> to use it.  I really <i>like</i> the possibilities it opens up.<p>But it&#x27;s so far from mature, at this point, that it simply cannot act as an X replacement for most people.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m a little shocked distros are making Wayland their default display server ecosystem, as it&#x27;s an objective step backward for desktop Linux and I expect will scare a lot of neophytes away who wonder why the hell basic features like screensharing still don&#x27;t yet work in their favourite application.')
