Most languages use more sounds than 26 letters can capture. I don&#x27;t know about Turkish or Romanian so can&#x27;t say. As an example my mother tongue Hindi and Sanskrit maps the most of utterances of hard, soft, and nasal varieties originating from throat, palate, cerebral, dental, and lips into specific symbols. This reduces the friction between writing and speaking.<p>One can still speak wrong if they learn to speak the letters wrong but chances are reduced. Are Romanian and Turkish similar?')
