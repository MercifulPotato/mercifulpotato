An animal would be intentionally infected with the disease and a random mutation would allow the virus to jump to a separate cage to infect an animal there.<p>Pretty horrible and dangerous, imo. Research on this was banned in the US for a few years, see also [0].<p><i>Edit:</i> a small bonus comment I just thought about: here is a time lapse of development of resistance to antibiotics on a large petri dish [1]. Observe how they used increasing concentrations of antibiotics to allow stepwise improvement of resistance instead of confronting the bacterium with an unsurmountable effect all at once.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mutation#By_effect_on_function" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mutation#By_effect_on_function</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yybsSqcB7mE</a>')
