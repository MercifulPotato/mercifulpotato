Not everyone fits into one of the 16 types perfectly and not every test reliably figures out which of the 16 types you are, not to mention that dividing the entire human population into 16 types is an overly simplistic way of categorizing personalities.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean MBTI is useless.  You can take a test and hope that it reasonably finds what type you are or you can simply read the archtypes for all 16 types and figure out which type you are closest to.<p>I think the community element is the most underrated aspect of MBTI, esp if you&#x27;re a rare type that&#x27;s been misunderstood most of your life.  I can certainly related as an INTP and have struggled most of my life when taking the advice of my parents, teachers, professors, mentors, even self-help gurus only to get limited results despite following their advice almost exactly.  When I learned that I was an INTP and followed the advice from other INTPs, I finally felt understood and was able to follow a different set of advice that got me much further in life than following the conventional advice from the former parties.<p>Is it scientific? It&#x27;s debatable.  Is it useful?  It depends but personally, it has been tremendously helpful.')
