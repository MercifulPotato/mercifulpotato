When I go to someone else&#x27;s apartment now, usually it takes me a couple of seconds to realize why in the bathroom and it&#x27;s dark. Haha\nI don&#x27;t know how people live without this. It&#x27;s so convenient - you don&#x27;t have to worry about turning on the light when you enter, turning it off when you leave. You&#x27;re just in - out. At the same time, it saves money, because it&#x27;s on only while you&#x27;re in there.')
