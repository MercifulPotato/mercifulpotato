Annie Hidalgo won re-election and has pretty decent popularity ratings.  Maybe they&#x27;re hated out in the countryside or whatever, but the actual citizens of the cities run by these &quot;ecologist&quot; mayors do seem to be generally happy with them.<p>I really wish we had one here in NYC.  Only 22% of households in Manhattan where I live even own cars, yet an ungodly amount of the total public space is given over to cars, including two whole lanes of free parking on most blocks.  Meanwhile the sidewalks are narrow and often full of trash bags because we can&#x27;t even put in dumpsters lest some sacred parking spots be removed, and delivery vehicles are constantly double-parked or blocking bike lanes since there&#x27;s no delivery-only spots.<p>I think the majority of people here would be in favor of a mayor that de-emphasized cars and got a lot of this traffic off our streets, thus making it more pleasant for people on foot.')
