People should be moving fast so they don&#x27;t end up in endless discussions regarding or spend too much time on creating a foundation for a solution that doesn&#x27;t work, and to inhibit perfectionism. People should also be transitioning from &quot;make it work&quot; to &quot;make it good&quot; once it works, prior to delivering or finalizing it.<p>This is largely a problem with people unable to shift practice according to the context, lazy developers and managers thinking &quot;it works&quot; means &quot;ship it and never look back&quot;. Unfortunately, there is no cure perfect cure for lack of foresight and willingness to listen to the guy saying PoC code will cause problems at some point down the line.')
