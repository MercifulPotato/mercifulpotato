If we do treat them as mental illness and approach these people with kindness and compassion, is there a threshold of sheer numbers and self-destructive potential beyond which kindness and compassion fail to be effective tools to bring people back to reality? If so, what do we do then?<p>Obviously there are weaknesses in the human brain and in our educational systems, and these weaknesses are being actively exploited by people bent on chaos, power, money, or whatever. So how to we find and punish the culprits and dissuade them from doing this kind of brain-hacking in the future? How do we establish global-level policies to make average citizens less vulnerable to it?<p>Stuff I spend a lot of time thinking about lately.')
