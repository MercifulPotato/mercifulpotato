We could maybe add WoW to that list due to the die hard players still paying a subscription (if that&#x27;s still a thing?) but Warcraft, Diablo and Starcraft and basically hibernating IPs at this point. None of those hibernating IPs have seen any major movement or releases in _many_ years. Starcraft is still viable as it&#x27;s considered to be a mainstay of completive RTS (and therefore great for branding of Blizzard in general) but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s earning them buckets of money.<p>So we&#x27;re down to 2 properties making the majority of earnings, both on Free to Play but not Pay to Win models. That model has a very distinct shelf life of, I&#x27;d say, 5 years before you need to either release a sequel or change it up with a new IP.')
