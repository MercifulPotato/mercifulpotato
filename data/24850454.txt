The reason is, google doesn&#x27;t have a vested interest in notifications being great. Facebook didn&#x27;t either when they had their platform, so it was full of spam and ended up being useless. I think the same is happening with browser notifications. Mobile notifications seem to be going on the same path of saturating.<p>What i find more useful is to have the notifications in-page.
