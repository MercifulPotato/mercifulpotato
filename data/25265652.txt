The term that is being described here is kind of like a meme-phrase&#x2F;word. Like in the article said, it was likely invented years ago, probably in the Chinese version of twitter&#x2F;social media&#x2F;etc.<p>The revenge and retaliatory terms are more subversive than negative.<p>The retaliation is against losing control of your own time. The revenge is against your corporate-master, your boss, the pointy-haired boss, the Communist political officer, &quot;the Man&quot;, late stage capitalism - whatever you want to call it I don&#x27;t think the sentiment is limited to China and communism, etc. and that&#x27;s why this article struck a chord enough for it to get onto hnews.<p>That said, the subversive nature of the wording is very very Chinese. Not just Communist Chinese, but this type of subversive back-talk has been alive for many many generations since the imperial days, where you had to talk in circles in order to not be executed.')
