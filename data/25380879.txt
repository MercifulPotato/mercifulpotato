They need servers everywhere to ensure low latency.  I don&#x27;t see how they could work around it if half of their business model is made illegal by Western governments.  They&#x27;d have to return to doing tracking by ip and cookies (and maybe localstorage, whatever the law exempts) only.  I don&#x27;t see why that shouldn&#x27;t be enough.<p>I agree in principle that fixing the browsers to remove fingerprinting vectors is the correct approach, and making tracking illegal is not.  I just think making it illegal would work, at least mostly, because companies that are good at tracking would have to comply.')
