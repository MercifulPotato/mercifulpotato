All of Javascript is on a JIT - and thats the dominant UI for now! For servers generally you find that users are all calling the same function so it&#x27;s very rare that you hit a blip - much more commonly users get performance problems from something else in the stack like the network or the client, and while Javascript is the dominant front end the dominant back end for servers is Java and that&#x27;s got a JIT as well.')
