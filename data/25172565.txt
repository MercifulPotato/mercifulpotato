Every time I make a change in the database I make the change in the repository. It doesn&#x27;t automate anything, it doesn&#x27;t save me time in the process of modifying the database, it&#x27;s actually a lot of extra work, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. If I want to know when, who, why and how a table has been modified over the last 2 years, I just check the logs, commits dates, authors and messages, and display the diffs If I want to see exactly what changed.')
