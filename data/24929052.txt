Of course the thing will be extremely limited in what you can do with it, subject to Terms&amp;Conditions, but why would you want to do anything non-standard with stuff? There&#x27;s always another service you can throw money at to solve the same problem.<p>What&#x27;s the end-game here? That we specialize into sub-species of humans, forever stuck in one role, with zero autonomy? No longer building wealth, we&#x27;ll only be allocating the flow of money - from what Society gives us in reward for our work, straight to Services of said Society? Will we become specialized cells of the meta-multicellular organism Society becomes?<p>I can see how we&#x27;re on the path towards that reality, and I absolutely hate it.&quot;<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24787804" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24787804</a>')
