Item(by='klyrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606520944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25233199, text='&gt; Keep in mind that simply complaining about something to a coworker isn&#x27;t the same thing as &quot;filing&quot; a complaint.<p>It <i>really</i> depends on the HR department, too.  In most, reporting something as seemingly straightforward as an overt sexual assault will raise the question &quot;how do you want to proceed.&quot;  But they might not lay out what your actual options are -- or worse, they might just offer an ear and won&#x27;t offer to act unless you demand it.  Sometimes, they&#x27;ll make it quite clear that a complaint will be a huge pain in the ass for everybody involved, especially the person reporting.  HR should understand that there can be direct and indirect blow-back; that reporting misbehavior (especially of management, or worse, HR) can have both real and perceived consequences for the person reporting.  HR departments cannot, generally, be trusted to police themselves if you can&#x27;t go to them or above them, the only other option is the labor relations board.  So much of the time, marginalized employees will either suck it up and endure the abuse, or quietly leave to keep their reputation intact.<p>So if anything, I see the discrepancy of 3 official reports and 11 complaints as a weak signal about how seriously HR takes complaints about racism at the company.')
