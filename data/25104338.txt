So it is possible for individuals to be Bulgarian citizens, but not of Bulgarian ethnicity. Or vice versa. Someone of Bulgarian descent born in USA won&#x27;t be necessarily Bulgarian-in-the-citizenship sense.<p>So in the grandparent case, he obviously meant &quot;non-Roma&quot;, without regards to citizenship.')
