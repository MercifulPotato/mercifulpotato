Dude starts building some software to make it more convenient for close-knit communities of people to share goods and services with each other. In other words-- a good faith effort from a dev to add some digital convenience to happy little sharing economies.<p>2. Some people riding the blockchain bullshit train see value in the name &quot;Ripple&quot; and image associated with that name<p>3. Said people buy that name from Ryan<p>4. Original spirit of Ripple is lost to history, and a long, boring drama over preseeded coins, what &quot;decentralization&quot; actually means, whether it really applies to XRP, positioning as <i>the</i> international payment system against every other blockchain idiot trying to do the same, etc.<p>In other words-- we go from this:<p>&quot;Hm, I wonder if graph theory can be used to reinforce local economies&quot;<p>To this:<p>&quot;There&#x27;s gold in them there transnational borders, boys! Yeeeha!&quot;')
