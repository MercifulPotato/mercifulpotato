It&#x27;s been awkward watching them blindly copy &quot;popular&quot; features from other messaging platforms. The reason I like and use Signal is precisely because of the minimal feature set - all I want to do is text people directly or in group chat. Some emoji and gif support is nice and that&#x27;s about it.<p>I hope Signal stays true to its roots and doesn&#x27;t give in to more bloated crap like the other messaging platforms but unfortunately I&#x27;m not optimistic in that front...')
