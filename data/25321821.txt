Item(by='mleonhard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607239618, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316328, text='I walked 3 miles a day, about 1,000 miles a year, before the pandemic.  For me, two things are important for walking:<p>1. Environment - I need a quiet &amp; safe path.  You can find this in most cities with enough trial &amp; error.  Try different streets at different times.  You will eventually find a way to walk wherever you want, whenever you want, without much traffic noise or street-crossing risk.<p>2. Equipment - Great shoes, better socks, water, and protection from wind, sun, cold, and rain.  Here&#x27;s what works for me:<p>- Darn Tough Hiker Boot Sock Full Cushion, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darntough.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;mens-hike-trek&#x2F;products&#x2F;boot-sock-full-cushion-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darntough.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;mens-hike-trek&#x2F;products&#x2F;bo...</a> .  You can get 6-packs on Amazon for $20&#x2F;pair.  My pairs last me about 750 miles, far longer than all the other socks I&#x27;ve tried.<p>- Columbia Menâ€™s Newton Ridge Plus II Waterproof Hiking Boot - Wide, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;mens-newton-ridge-wide-1594732.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;mens-newton-ridge-wide-1594732.ht...</a> .  This is a waterproof sneaker with ankle protection and grippy tread.  The shoes are flat on the inside, great for walking not running.  I&#x27;ve gone through six pairs.  They last me about 750 miles each.  I went most of my life wearing shoes that were too narrow.  Walking suddenly became comfortable when I got wide enough shoes.<p>- Thermos Intak 24 bottle, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B002VJX4C4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B002VJX4C4</a> .  I own 8 of these, grab a clean one each day, and wash them in the dishwasher.  You can remove the ring seal with a fork.  You can order replacement parts from Thermos customer service.<p>- Tortuga Outbreaker Daypack, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tortugabackpacks.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;outbreaker-travel-daypack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tortugabackpacks.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;outbreaker-travel-...</a> .  The side mesh pockets are perfect.<p>- Tilley LTM6 Airflow hat, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tilley.com&#x2F;us_en&#x2F;ltm6-airflo-hat.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tilley.com&#x2F;us_en&#x2F;ltm6-airflo-hat.html</a> .  Super durable, floats, non-adsorbent, ventilated, lightweight.  I&#x27;ve crammed this in my backpack nearly every day for 3 years and it still looks nice.  Walking takes time, so you will get more UV exposure.  Protect your skin to avoid looking old.<p>- Patagonia Torrentshell rain jacket.  It&#x27;s light weight.  It blocks the wind and rain.  It rolls up to a small package.  Mine is wearing out after 3 years.  It fits well in an Eagle Creek Pack-It Spectre &quot;Sac&quot; medium.  Get a bright color to reduce evening street-crossing risk.<p>- Uniqlo merino sweaters.  Soft, warm, light weight, don&#x27;t pill, and last forever.  I wash mine in a front-loading washer, on the delicate warm cycle, with standard detergent, and hang them up to dry.  I own 4.  The oldest has been worn about 100 times, washed about 10 times, and still looks great.<p>- Cheap synthetic beanie hat.  This can warm you as much as a sweater.  Buy a bunch so you always have a clean one, and have extras for friends.<p>Happy walking! :)')
