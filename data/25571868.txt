But this could be easily automated with a script (since you can tangle without opening emacs directly, or within the org file itself!) to tangle after any update, or even to pull in changes if you make them to the file directly. For example, you could have a hook so that on saving the org file it tangles to update any files, or on opening pull in changes you made directly in the result file (e.g. not in the org file directly). I saw some links on this but unfortunately don&#x27;t have them handy. I&#x27;m sure they will come up with some searching, but let me know if you can&#x27;t find anything.')
