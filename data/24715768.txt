That said, the overall distribution of possibilities skews on the &quot;lesser effect&quot; side, so if you had to guess which way the estimate would move with another trial, you&#x27;re more likely to get a smaller effect than a larger one.... 6x is still the most likely single value.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s extremely rare for a treatment in medicine to have a 6x benefit.<p>All kinds of drugs and treatments for acute disease have a &gt; 6x benefit.  We have plenty of conditions that have a horrible prognosis untreated and great outcomes treated.<p>Have a bad bacterial infection?  Odds are abx will clear that right up and you&#x27;d die otherwise.  Active TB has a ~60% death rate within 5 years untreated, while with normal treatment regimens only has a relapse (not death) rate of a few percent in that 5 year period.  Most vaccines have high efficacies.  Standard treatments can prevent the vast majority of malaria deaths.')
