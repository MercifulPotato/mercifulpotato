The relative lack of motion blur despite the low frame rate gives it a jerky appearance similar to sped up or timelapse video, or animation. Combined with the slightly odd motion of the robots, it has an uncanny look.<p>It&#x27;s kinda funny because most robot demo videos <i>are</i> sped up and&#x2F;or CGI, but this one isn&#x27;t.')
