Great if that&#x27;s not the case.<p>I agree that the backend team should test their own stuff. End to end testing is a poor substitute for that. There may be value, though, in having some (light?) validation of a dependency, ie. the frontend team validating that the backend is still there. I heard the latest SpringOneTour talk refer to this as &quot;enemy testing&quot;. Maybe really bad for internal teams, but I can sympathize when the dependency is external and you don&#x27;t know when to expect changes.')
