They stopped him. So they knew very well about his intentions. Then a nearby state Slovakia told the Austrian authorities that this person was there and bout ammunition. The Austrian authorities did not further investigate and at the end he went to the center of Vienna and started shooting at people. The thing is, he also showed pictures on instragram or facebook with him holding guns.<p>Now the EU representatives demand more censorship and want to end End-To-End encryption for the state by implementing a general key so that they can see any kind of encrypted messages. The proposed law also demands from platforms to implement a sort of filter to remove any kind of uploads that might be IP or maybe even offensive.<p>I actually really like the ideology behind the EU. I think growing together and bringing the states together to strengthen the EU is great. But what is happening right now is pure authoritarian act that will hit anyone for the failure of authorities that would have had enough information and power from the beginning.')
