Our largest and most targeted cities (e.g. NYC, DC) absolutely should have dedicated heavy weapons troops on call to respond in real time to a terrorist attack.  Their equipment and training should be <i>separate</i> from workaday policing.<p>Then most of the rest of the country just needs normal policing, because realistically, they&#x27;re so unlikely to be a target.  Look at all the big terrorist attacks that have happened in the past several decades.  They&#x27;ve targeted huge international cities: DC, NYC, London, Paris, Mumbai.  These are the kinds of targets (and the only kinds of targets) that plausibly need military-level policing on stand-by 24&#x2F;7.')
