In the case of a password manager, the manager itself is the one that needs to be compromised, and you have more reason to trust them to avoid being compromised than some other random site. Some random sketchy website being hacked doesn&#x27;t need to effect the rest of your network of logins if you use a manager.<p>Most password managers (such as 1password) won&#x27;t let anyone from any machine access your stored passwords over the web by just supplying your single password. They require multiple extra steps that are quite limiting, so for the most part they first need access to a computer that you&#x27;ve already installed your password manager on.<p>Furthermore, if your password manager is compromised, you have a very clear path to your password on that manager, and then a list of all the websites, usernames and passwords that you need to change in order to regain secruity. By contrast, I&#x27;m still rediscovering old websites I used 10 years ago that used my old omni-password which was compromised.')
