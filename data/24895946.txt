Something I&#x27;m interested in, but unsure how to make it work.<p>There are intentional communities that support themselves with their own, often agriculture based, products sold on the open market. Plus the usual homesteading.<p>The skills needed for this kind of work are not highly specialized and in general not well paid, therefore levelling the playing field for everyone in the group.<p>I think the opportunity cost for IT professionals building a SaaS to support the community is a lot higher, and while I would love to see that work, the chances of key community members dropping out to make more money for themselves is fairly high. I&#x27;m not sure if a simple time based system for everyone involved is fair, given the high upfront investment to get the skills needed for IT work.')
