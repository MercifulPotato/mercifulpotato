Item(by='lukestevens', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609901145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25647164, text='I&#x27;ve been looking closely at WordPress &amp; alternatives for a new biz site, and it&#x27;s in a weird place at the moment.<p>- Gutenberg and block editing are clearly the future, and ad hoc blocks are a great abstraction. However...<p>- Gutenberg as a place to write is miles behind e.g. Notion in terms of UX.<p>- Gutenberg as a page builder has a long way to go to catch up to the page builders.<p>- Full site editing in Gutenberg is coming, and early demos are out, but who knows how that will shake out.<p>- The WP ecosystem&#x27;s culture is still race-to-the-bottom dreck. Interesting contrast with Webflow there.<p>- Therefore Gutenberg is in a weird transitional state where <i>right now</i> it&#x27;s overloaded for writing, underpowered for building, and in transition. I&#x27;m keen to see what it&#x27;s like in 2023, but it&#x27;s hard to go all in on it now.<p>- The WP as a &quot;forever&quot; project seems to create weird incentives -- the lack of commercial pressure (until site builder SaaSs caught on) seems to have let it drift and drift. It&#x27;s an interesting case study in open source effectively winning in terms of the network effects of free, and then suffocating and stagnating due to those same network effects. I know they&#x27;re trying to self-disrupt with Gutenberg [0], but whether they can execute <i>and</i> overcome the UX trap they&#x27;ve identified remains to be seen. Modern SaaS UX (Webflow, Squarespace, Notion et al) just seems beyond their reach.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markuraine.com&#x2F;disrupting-wordpress&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markuraine.com&#x2F;disrupting-wordpress&#x2F;</a>')
