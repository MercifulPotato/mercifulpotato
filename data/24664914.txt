For any sufficiently large company, especially one where the CEO profits privately directly from the company profiting publicly, a portion of that money should be tied to the company directly in terms of liability. You shouldnâ€™t have to prove the CEO was directly involved. At the level they are, the very nature of their position should have some sort of liability in regards to the actions taken by that company under their watch. It should be built into the very regulations and laws.  This would hold CEOs accountable for inaction, apathy, or ignorance leading to law breaking within their company, and it would only apply to compensation for managing said company.')
