Instead, the two apply to almost disjunct subsets of people. Therefore it is more accurate to say that the &quot;closing both&quot; restriction is a *0.66 reduction of the reproduction number, while &quot;closing schools&quot; and &quot;closing offices&quot; only apply that 0.66 factor to a subset of the population. What is really additive is the amount of people affected by the restriction.')
