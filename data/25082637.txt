As recently as a few month ago I wanted to spend 1-3 thousand dollars pr year on a SaaS product. The problem internally was never exactly how many thousands I was spending, but what the payment process looked like. And the sole reason I didn&#x27;t give that money to the SaaS company was because they couldn&#x27;t work with our procurement process. We&#x27;re now investigating a much more expensive solution from a much bigger company.<p>I&#x27;m sure the SaaS company turning down our money was being rational and figure the cost of taking our money was higher than the profit they&#x27;d make from us, but there still seems to be money left on the table for someone to scoop up.')
