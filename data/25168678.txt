What does my location have to do with anything, and who&#x27;s anonymous? Your unhealthy behavior and disregard for safe public health practices is much more dangerous to yourself and other people than me simply asking you not to do it is to you. You&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s bragging about putting other people&#x27;s lives in danger, and who needs to get some help to not harm other people. So stop endangering other people&#x27;s health, and complaining when people ask you to stop. Thanks!')
