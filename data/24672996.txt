That is because we have to fight every utopian totalitarian grift that comes along.</i><p>I definitely end up this way talking to friends. My politics are always othered for not parroting their party line, generally whatever nascent groupthink is setting the stage for some future corporate-totalitarian push.<p>But you&#x27;ve seriously got to apply this insight to your own lead off assertion:<p>&gt; <i>It was clear to me that he [Assange] was a supporter of the fascist movement that swept across the tech and hacker culture in the early to mid teens, and that he biased his leaks accordingly</i><p>Your claim that the right-totalitarian side was ascendant in the &quot;early to mid teens&quot; has more to do with your own perspective, seemingly ignoring the overarching societal tone of left authoritarianism (led by the White House). IMO the rise in red flavored thinking was driven by dissent, and I say this as someone with generally blue biases.')
