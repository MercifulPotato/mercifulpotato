See google spanner for instance.<p>Updating the clock one second means taking a whole cluster offline untill you are sure the clocks are synchronized exactly before bringing them online again. It brings an outage and potential of headaches.<p>If the clocks are not synchronized you break the consensus, might cause transactions to commit partially or cause inconsistent reads and writes.')
