I do have it on my iPad (tablet) to read when I forgot my kindle. It hasn&#x27;t happen in 3+ years. However, I forgotten my iPad a lot of times and not my Kindle. :-)<p>My phone (iPhone 11 Pro that will likely last for 2+ more years) is just a really good camera, that has some phone function with the usual calendar, maps, etc. I avoid phone calls as much as I can.')
