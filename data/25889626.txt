Item(by='Retric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611466865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25887793, text='&gt; Nearly no aircraft have a 50 year lifespan.<p>Individual fighters don’t, but widely adopted designs from the 70’s and after stuck around. The F-16 family is currently expected to be in service for 75 years though it’s only reached 42 years at this point.  F-15’s have done 45 years at this point and “We intend to maintain the F-15C fleet through the 2020s.” Suggesting 55+ with a fair amount of uncertainty.   F-14 was introduced in 1974 and ironically enough is still in use by Iran.  Hell the F-4 entered service in 1961, and is still used by Japan.<p>As to what you said, <i>nearly certainly killed or captured</i> isn’t <i>it’s better than even chance</i>.  You can quibble about meaningless numbers chosen to convey meaning not specifics, but as your making a different statement clearly you agree a small percentage <i>of total elections</i> are expected to result in capture.  Death and serious injury is a much greater risk, but again overall risks for the lifespan of the design is what’s important, the US military will sacrifice far more lives than the a most few hundred F-35 pilots we are talking about.  As demonstrated by the decision to double down on manned aircraft in the first place rather than try and make a air to air combat capable drone.')
