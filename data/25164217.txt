Item(by='bitminer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605902042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25161738, text='&gt;Is there a field of study&#x2F;practice that deals with such changes to large scale system? It does sound like a very useful thing to systematically study, if possible.<p>&quot;Analysis points to ways engineering strategies could be reimagined to minimize delays and other unanticipated expenses.&quot;<p>(from comments below).<p>The two quoted authors in the press release are a prof in energy studies and a nuclear engineer.<p>What I notice is that MIT does not have a Systems Engineering undergraduate department, but numerous specialties.<p>In a large design&#x2F;build project such as a nuclear power plant, the systems engineering group (there must be exactly one) keeps track of the performance and function of each of the subsystems (civil works like containment, basements, buildings; electrical; controls; HVAC; the nuclear bits; and so on).   In addition, it is the system engineering group that responds (or directs responses) to a change order request, and the overall impact on expense, on functionality&#x2F;reliability&#x2F;safety, and schedule.<p>It seems these are responsibilities that are not identified here with a known role; instead the authors reinvent system engineering for themselves.<p>There is a lot of SE work done in numerous industries (Elon Musk is what I would call a systems engineer, based on how he identifies things to do and how he gets them done.  His degree is not in SE though).<p>A short list of US universities offer SE or related disciplines; in California&#x2F;New York&#x2F;Illinois.  MIT is not one: it has a research group not a degree-granting program.<p>References:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incose.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incose.org&#x2F;</a> The International Council of System Engineering.
