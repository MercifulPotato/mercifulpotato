Just look at the crappy Netflix 4k, which is less bandwith than a 1080p Bluray (like 30% less iirc). Now, obviously, it&#x27;s a better codec, but h265&#x2F;VP-9 (or whatever they use) won&#x27;t give you a &gt; 400% increased efficiency over h264. So, people are buying new Fire-TVs&#x2F;TVs&#x2F;GPUs all so that they can enjoy a 4k artifact show.<p>Meanwhile I&#x27;ve fallen under the hedonic treadmill and bought a TV. Sitting 3m from this 49inch screen, I play Netflix in 540p (on Linux) â€“ and it totally looks fine. Well...<p>But, truth be told: I&#x27;m typing this on a 32inch 4K monitor. For work it&#x27;s gorgeous (yet some people still buy FHD...).')
