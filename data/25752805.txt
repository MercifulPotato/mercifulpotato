Item(by='SZJX', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610482369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732676, text='Simply sad to see such a garbage-quality piece of fear-mongering &quot;journalism&quot; (published more than 2 weeks ago, no less), with only wild anti-CCP speculations from a single random commentator for Radio Free Asia (spoiler: not exactly known for their neutrality), and practically non-existent factual information, getting so many upvotes here. If one applies the least bit of logic, one could immediately grasp the absurdity of such a &quot;proposal&quot;, which would only do every party involved immense harm.<p>Then again, maybe this is no longer anything surprising at all, given the multiple recent precedents, including e.g. the ridiculous &quot;chromeisbad.com&quot; post.')
