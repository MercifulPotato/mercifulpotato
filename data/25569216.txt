If I need it repaired, I&#x27;ll pay the vendor to do it. If I need it extended, I&#x27;ll pay them to do it - or buy something new. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s modular. I only care about openness insofar as I can tell what it&#x27;s doing. The rest is a waste of my time.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m not the only one who feels this way, given the way this thread has gone.')
