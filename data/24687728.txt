The big companies make the machines and sell them.  Big companies make the software.  What is left is the physical efforts of finding a location, putting the machine in place, and then tending it regularly. There isn&#x27;t much to be gained by adding a layer of management over the top of that, so big players can&#x27;t really skim off the top by good management making things better.<p>Also big companies have too much to lose to fraud. The route operators are alone with big piles of cash. It is very easy for someone who knows what they are doing to &quot;discover&quot; a broken  a  machine (read they break it) and it was dispensing the J row without payment, then take the extra cash.<p>All in all it is best to leave route operations to little players.')
