I&#x27;m not raising this as a defense of his making that pardon, but rather, to point out that a President selling pardons <i>is</i> and <i>has long been</i> considered a serious crime. The Clinton precedent is a clear illustration. Saying &quot;hey, some book alleges Clinton got paid for a pardon, therefore it&#x27;s common practice&quot; sounds nice, but ignores the fact that suspicion around Clinton&#x27;s Marc Rich pardon triggered an extensive criminal investigation that concluded he did not, in fact, get paid for it.')
