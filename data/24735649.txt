It is postulated that there is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to an endogenous antigen expressed after exposure to sunlight or artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.&quot;<p>Hypersensitivity means allergic reaction. UV radiation is murking your exposed skin cells because it causes such severe DNA damage that the cells commit suicide in a process called &#x27;apoptosis.&#x27; The body&#x27;s immune system is freaking out because it&#x27;s seeing a bunch of stuff all of a sudden, that has floated out of your dead skin cells, that it isn&#x27;t supposed to see. It releases a ton of chemicals that make you feel nauseous, crappy, and sore, and which normally are key parts of fighting infection as part of the inflammation reaction.<p><i>Oakley AM, Ramsey ML.

Sunburn. [Updated 2020 Aug 15]. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2020 Jan-.

This is scary because if the cells are dead, ok you get a sunburn, but that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re dead. If the DNA is damaged and the cells don&#x27;t die, you can lose genes like cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors and tumor suppressors. And <i>BAM</i>, melanoma which winds up killing somewhere in the ballpark of 9,000 people in the U.S. each year, as well as squamous cell carcinoma which kills like another 15,000.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;cancer&#x2F;uscs&#x2F;about&#x2F;data-briefs&#x2F;no9-melanoma-incidence-mortality-UnitedStates-2012-2016.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;cancer&#x2F;uscs&#x2F;about&#x2F;data-briefs&#x2F;no9-melano...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skincancer.org&#x2F;skin-cancer-information&#x2F;skin-cancer-facts&#x2F;#:~:text=The%20latest%20figures%20suggest%20that,nonmelanoma%20skin%20cancer%20every%20month" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skincancer.org&#x2F;skin-cancer-information&#x2F;skin-canc...</a>.')
