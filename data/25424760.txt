Most black Americans have ancestors who (slavery) worked a lot of unpaid hours.  Having clear metrics on how many slaves there were is a step towards having a well founded number for what the cost of reparations should be.<p>There are some places in the US which have started, but they&#x27;re just kind of pulling numbers out of a hat and I don&#x27;t see that being scalable.  But reparations should be paid, if for nothing else, at least for the unpaid hours.<p>Next we need to figure out who profited the most from slaves and where that money is today.')
