It’s a fundamental feature of Cocoa, open which all native apps are built, so every app gets the correct behaviour for free. Dragging and dropping is super powered on Apple platforms.<p>This isn&#x27;t true. It is true that it&#x27;s built into the development tools and toolkits that Apple provide and expect you to use when writing software for their platform.<p>But it&#x27;s not particularly hard to avoid. Google &quot;nibless development mac&quot; and you&#x27;ll find some links that reveal how to develop full GUI apps on macOS that do not rely on this infrastructure. Regardless of whether or not you think this is a good idea, please rest assured that an application developed in this way does <i>not</i> share the &quot;OS-level&quot; drag behavior that you describe above. For it to behave in this way requires explicit code to handle notifications delivered by the OS.<p>Why does this matter? Because those Apple SDKs that make all this happen &quot;seamlessly&quot; are hard to use if you want to do cross-platform development. Qt (and GTK) work at trying to take care of this for you, but its not 100%, precisely because (as you note) this concept doesn&#x27;t exist on other platforms.<p>So yes, from a user perspective this is a &quot;universal&quot; feature of apps on macOS. But it does not come with the OS - it comes from only developing apps using Apple SDKs and tools, which makes it harder for people doing cross-platform development to correctly play the game in the expected way.')
