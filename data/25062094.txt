My main machines are wired internally with gigabit, and my wifi supports 1.3Gbps across the backhaul.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve ever maxed it out is with five torrents running at once, and that only lasts a second or two, because then they&#x27;re done.  And we&#x27;re not a light usage household.  It&#x27;s pretty common for us to have three or four streams all running at 1080 at the same time, plus other big downloads and videoconferencing.  One main limiting factor is that I&#x27;ve never seen  single service provider get close to gigabit speed (like updates from Apple or Sony for example).  It has to be a swarm to get even close.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d do with 2Gbps.  The rest of the internet just isn&#x27;t there to support fully utilizing that connection.')
