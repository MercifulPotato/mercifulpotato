After all, cookies are just an HTTP header sent from server and it&#x27;s up to the user-agent to handle it.<p>There could be a standard header such as cookie-privacy-policy which would point to url containing the policy in standadrd format (html?) and the browser could show it in standard way (by user&#x27;s settings). Personally I would be happy with just a little &quot;privacy policy&quot; icon in url bar, similar to https lock icon and reader view icon (in Safari).')
