Who is your product currently suited to, who would you like to get, and what do you need to get them, how do you speak to them, etc. etc.<p>It also fits well with the Crossing the Chasm model where you can look at each customer segment and measure adoption.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think throwing away the &quot;Product Market Fit&quot; term is necessary, as it is still an apt description, but just don&#x27;t get stuck thinking that Product Market Fit happens only once for a company, it happens for each market you target.')
