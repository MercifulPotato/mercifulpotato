It sure seems to me that you could have a relational database without SQL. Something non-text could be nice. It might be a binary data format or compiled code.<p>One might even convert SQL to binary query data at build time, with a code generator. It could work like PIDL, the code generator Samba uses to convert DCE&#x2F;RPC IDL files to C source with binary data. Binary data goes over the wire. Another way is that both client code and server code could be generated, with the server code getting linked into the database server.')
