Now I strain my IDE-s autocomplete with 1000s of classes, will need a css minifier&#x2F;bundler (that will at least make my build slower).\nI&#x27;m not a frontend dev, but I do dabble in writing the occasional website, and other than bootstrap (which contains complete styles for stuff like buttons), I never felt the need to use a CSS framework. I get it that in pre-grid days, it was a minor feat of wizardry to implement complex layouts, but nowadays, frameworks seem largely unnecessary to me. Another added benefit of using pure CSS, is you just have to learn it once (with tons of great resources), while with these CSS frameworks, I&#x27;ll need to learn what everything&#x27;s called for every framework.<p>Not sold.')
