I think it&#x27;d be quite difficult to do this for the case of an email or URL, but for cases like &quot;length values must be non-negative,&quot; a parser&#x2F;validator with a type like<p><pre><code>    parseLength :: JSON -&gt; Either Error (Sigma (l : Length). lengthToDouble l &gt;= 0.0)\n</code></pre>\nis reasonable, and I&#x27;m sure somewhere in the literature there&#x27;s an indexed monad or something for building parsers&#x2F;validators out of these, that keeps track of the properties while combining parsers like these.')
