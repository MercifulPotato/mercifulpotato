Soon I&#x27;ll be able to delete it entirely, and hopefully decentralized social networks will indeed become popular.<p>Now if only we had some sort of open website aggregator on top of which people could build search engines. Sort of like an analogous for what OpenStreetMap is for geographic data. Maybe it already exists—I&#x27;m a bit ashamed to say that I haven&#x27;t actively looked for it nor have I heard of such a thing—but whether it does or not, it&#x27;d be a huge step in the right direction. I think that any progress toward a decentralized web is a bit weakened if search results continue to be provided at the whim of only a few actors. But I&#x27;m digressing at this point.')
