And I don&#x27;t mean the mosque shooting. That was illegal. I mean part of having a free society means you have put up with people saying crazy nonsensical bullshit that any reasonable person would laugh at and then click on a new video. And you&#x27;re going to have some group of people who are just dumb, or are easily impressionable, or are easily persuaded, or are whatever.<p>Maybe the sickness isn&#x27;t in the platform, either... maybe the sickness is somewhere else... and nobody wants to bother with it because its actually hard, and will actually cost money to deal with it.<p>And to that, I also say, &quot;Too goddamn bad.&quot; Its not a buffet and you don&#x27;t get to choose, you have to accept the whole dinner, the h√°karl along with the strawberry cheesecake.')
