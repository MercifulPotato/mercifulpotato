You really need to be dealing with high force systems to justify the cost and added complexity of using servos. I&#x27;ve built a mill from scratch that can handle decent sized steel milling using NEMA23 sized steppers and some decent 10:1 gear reducers and a nice spindle. IMO a better spindle and structure is where you should be spending your money, and if you really are afraid of losing steps, you should use encoders that are DECOUPLED from the motors, not integrated into them...<p>Servos are great if you&#x27;re working with huge forces, need a lot of speed, need ridiculously high accuracy, and have a team of engineers to actually build and tune the thing. Ridiculously expensive and complex unless you&#x27;re looking to go into busines manufacturing CNC systems.')
