I love that I can write one set of code that covers most of what I need for Android, iOS and web. I just think the way you define component (I&#x27;m sorry, widget) layout is ugly. They even have setState like React. I&#x27;m hoping when I get further into it that I&#x27;ll find Flutter Hooks to be a nice addition.')
