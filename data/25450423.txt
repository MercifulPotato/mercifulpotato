Like salt. Or water.<p>Uh, lol, no. 100x and 1000x multiples are standard EPA testing procedure, so you&#x27;re not disagreeing with me, you&#x27;re disagreeing with the EPA, and I&#x27;m gonna stick with the EPA on this one. [1]<p>&gt; This is a far more nuanced problem that &quot;let&#x27;s just shoot up some monkeys with a gallon of the stuff and see if their nuts shrivel up&quot;. In fact, that sort of reductionist approach is why we have this problem.<p>That&#x27;s a disingenuous reading. A 1000x dose of these chemicals would be less than a miligram, which is plenty to do harm. Even lead can do brain damage at the ppm level (some chemicals are even ppb). Don&#x27;t be too embarrassed by your comment though, we all start somewhere.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reference_dose" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reference_dose</a>')
