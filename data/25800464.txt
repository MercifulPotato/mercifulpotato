Some very good people designed it, but it&#x27;s from the era when computers came with one CPU and GPUs didn&#x27;t do much.<p>C++ programs tend to be heavily inheritance oriented, with huge lists of includes and inheritance. Decoupling things to parallelize them is very difficult in that environment. Rust is mostly a single assignment language with move semantics, which encourages creating objects (yeah, the Rust crowd calls them structs) and passing them off to something else in a somewhat functional style. So you get programs that are less tightly coupled. That&#x27;s useful if you find you want to pass an object to another thread, put it on a queue, etc. for performance reasons.<p>Any dangling pointers or cross-thread references will be caught at compile time. That alone makes development far easier.')
