Common Lisp OTOH is a language standard with widely different implementations. Just like Scheme has very different implementations - in sizes of small, medium and large.<p>Common Lisp with more extensive C extension support are CLISP (written in C, not that well supported nowadays), ECL (&#x27;embeddable Common Lisp&#x27;, compiling to C), CLASP (integration with C++ via LLVM), mocl (commercial whole program compiler to C) and a bunch of others.<p>Thus the support of and integration into is different in Common Lisp implementations, just like it is different in Scheme implementations. GUILE was designed for C embedding, just like some Common Lisp implementations were designed for that task. Guile was also designated as a language of choice for the GNU project, which adds quite a bit community support - while Common Lisp (or one of its implementation) was not:<p>&#x27;Guile is the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions, and the official extension language of the GNU project.&#x27;')
