Bitcoin is the easiest example but it works to varying extents the same way with any supply and demand product (like currencies as well): if someone discovers an issue with bitcoin, nobody wants to own it anymore. The first person to sell is probably happy, but as soon as buyers catch on, the value has disappeared without anyone receiving another penny. If a publicly traded company is suddenly not expected to make more money, its shares become worthless. Nobody received money proportional to the value loss.<p>I think you&#x27;re mostly right in this case since we&#x27;ll need solutions and we&#x27;ll pay dearly, but value&#x2F;wealth&#x2F;money being lost isn&#x27;t necessarily coupled to someone else getting rich. If people suddenly can&#x27;t inhabit certain plots of land anymore, they&#x27;re not selling it at previous market rates anymore; their value is just lost.')
