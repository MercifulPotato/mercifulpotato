There are a wealth of plugins that attempt more or less successfully to bring IDE-like features to VIM, but I&#x27;m not sure I see the point personally, it&#x27;ll never be as seamless as an IDE built and maintained from the ground up to do these things. I hear that many IDEs have semi-competent Vim-style editing support, so maybe that would be more to your taste.<p>If you want to try the Vim experience I suggest doing it the Vim way, use a minimal config when starting, only add plugins after careful consideration, prefer simple generic tools like grep&#x2F;rg, FZF, dumb completion and ctags over complicated tight integration with language servers and debuggers.<p>But maybe you prefer more integrated environments and that&#x27;s perfectly fine, but in this case I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a switch to Vim unless you have a very good reason to want it.')
