Item(by='dnautics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607707110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379388, text='&gt; Water should be free upto basic living necessities.<p>If you mean to an end user, that&#x27;s your opinion.  I think we should aspire to that, but water is most definitely not &quot;free&quot; in general, and treating it as such is very dangerous.  Even if government is responsible for providing water to the people, there is a cost (to the government for obtaining that water), and that cost needs to be accounted for somewhere.<p>Perhaps you can provide a better price discovery mechanism that efficiently matches the price to its cost, that is robust to environmental swings and minimizes waste.
