The hardwrae has to run code, I get that, but VLIW didn&#x27;t work. Risc did. The x86 decompiles its opcodes into micro-ops which are load&#x2F;store risc-y simple things.  Simplicity was always the way to go.<p>I do take your point about VLIW, but I&#x27;m kind of assuming that the CPU has to, you know, actually run real workloads.  So move the complexity out of the languages. Or strongly, statically type them. Or just don&#x27;t use JS for server-side work. Don&#x27;t make the hardware guys pick up after bad software.')
