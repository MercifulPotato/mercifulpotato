The type of barcode we used, and I forget the type, was actually a little to large for the labels we wanted to use, and the labels where very skinny. Trying to maximize the size of the barcode, so our cheap scanner would read the, meant pushing the barcode almost to the edge of the label. That involved fiddling with the size and margins on the Zebra printers, and if you don&#x27;t get it right the scanner would either fail to read the barcode because the margin was to small (at least our cheap scanners require a margin of some minimal size to identify where the bars start) or the lines where to short and scanners can&#x27;t read the bars if they&#x27;re to short.')
