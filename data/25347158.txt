Graig didn&#x27;t play that, so in my mind it makes it a bad Bond movie.<p>It may still be a great movie. The Bourne triology works great as a movie but it wouldn&#x27;t, and isn&#x27;t a James Bond movie.<p>I just wish the movie producers would create new franchises rather than reboot the others.')
