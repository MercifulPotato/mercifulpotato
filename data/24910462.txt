The stored charge and its electric field are isomorphic, i.e. have the same functional properties. So the difference is meaningless. But the question of what  constitutes consciousness isn&#x27;t merely about functional equivalence. If we took away the brain but left the dynamics of the electromagnetic field in tact, would there still be consciousness? Or vice-versa? The distinction I point out points to different answers to this question. This is a relevant philosophical difference, although no practical difference.')
