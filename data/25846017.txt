This isn&#x27;t <i>totally</i> seamless, as although parameters are retained, any state held within the DSP code (say delay lines) will be reset to initial conditions, but it&#x27;s pretty good.<p>So then, update your faust code, re-run faust2soul and the soul command will see the updated patch and recompile.')
