I had 125mbps Comcast for years and the upload speed was around 30mbps.<p>In every market I have live in, the US broadband market generally has 2 providers.  One offers a cheap bottom tier and then higher tier ridiculous plans no one would buy.  The other provider is the opposite, offering a comparably worse low tier plan but better higher tier.<p>There&#x27;s no competition, rather a gentleman&#x27;s agreement that one provider would own the low tier and another the high to give the impression that there isn&#x27;t a monopoly.<p>Who is the high or low tier provider varies by market but there&#x27;s never any real competition.')
