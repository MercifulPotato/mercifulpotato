I thought Kirby&#x27;s dreamland did as well. There were a number of games that had save files although of course many did not include the needed hardware on their carts.<p>FWIW, the SNES also had no storage, and saves were in the carts. Not until the N64 did Nintendo ship a device with fungible, non-cart storage.')
