With gigabit internet service, getting 90% is easy wired, getting 30% wireless is lucky.  In a &lt;1000 sq ft apartment my wireless performance depends on the room. Basically on the physical layer wireless is very busy with collisions and retransmitting.  Better performance can come with some tuning, but ultimately it is quite limited.<p>I plug in all the devices I can conveniently.')
