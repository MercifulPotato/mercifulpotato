Item(by='totony', descendants=None, kids=[24993792], score=None, time=1604529043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993501, text='&gt;Getting a &quot;receipt&quot; is also problematic: You should never be able to prove you voted A over B or vice versa since that opens up ways to intimidate people to vote one way and coerce them to prove it.<p>Your receipt does not have to mention who you voted for in a way that&#x27;s verifiable by a third party. But this problem is also a problem for mail-in ballots.<p>&gt;using somewhat public things like SSN, &quot;numbers in your street address&quot; and a credit card number is a terrible idea.<p>Agreed, this does not mean that it is not feasible. You could use some zero-knowledge based proof that ensure that the person is allowed to vote and has voted only once without knowing his identity. Mail-in ballots are also problematic in that regard.<p>I dislike that people say evoting is a bad idea when we already have things like mail in ballots which are analogous to a poor e voting system.<p>&gt;Also requiring a credit card or home to vote would almost certainly be unconstitutional.<p>But don&#x27;t you need a registered address to vote?')
