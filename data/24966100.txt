Maybe google bans people who use ad-blockers, maybe they didn&#x27;t explicitly set that way but some of their algorithms must have figured out these users should go. I know, it is extremely unlikely but we&#x27;re free to come up with reasons if google doesn&#x27;t give one. Don&#x27;t sit there thinking it won&#x27;t happen to you(I was like that up until recently), get a domain name and transfer all important accounts to it. And do a Google takeout.')
