Unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t had much love for a long time, especially as it&#x27;s quite a task to seriously change it and we&#x27;re both under-resourced and Python-oriented. We&#x27;ve been talking about various options for a long time. It&#x27;s possible we might make some moves now as Kivy 2.0 was just recently released, which was a major update taking up a lot of focus.')
