But if I have a function foo() that takes another function bar(), and I don&#x27;t know what either one does, then I have to look at <i>both</i> foo() and bar() to understand what is going on.  I have to look at two places, not just one.<p>But this is not unique to FP.  If I&#x27;m using OOP, I can do the same thing with virtual functions.  In UI frameworks I can do the same thing with callbacks.<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t like it, whether it&#x27;s FP or not.')
