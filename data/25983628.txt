You don&#x27;t spend money on ads saying &quot;we no longer have a financial stake in this stock&quot; unless you, you know, have a financial stake in this stock.<p>Considering this is a hedge fund, I just assume they&#x27;re lying because, you know, it&#x27;s a fucking hedge fund.<p>EDIT: People are claiming CNBC bought ads, not Melvin Capital.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;8vxraurkcce61.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;8vxraurkcce61.png</a>')
