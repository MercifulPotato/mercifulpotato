How long ago was that? Is it 10 years already? Granted, it was total, not per slot. Wasn&#x27;t officially supported, but it worked. Tried personally, memtest passed, all good. IIRC W520 even took 32GB(4x8GB). Ten years of progress and ... still no progress. Who even buys this crap?<p>&gt;If you&#x27;re talking repairability, than I just haven&#x27;t had to replace my RAM sticks due to wear.<p>Somewhat agree with you on this point. Safe to say that if RAM works now, it will keep working. Test it after buying and you should be good. You can&#x27;t scavenge soldered RAM when the device fails though.')
