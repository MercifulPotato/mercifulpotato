SpaceX is getting heavily criticized for littering the skies with tens or hundreds of thousands of satellites, just so people can have internet. I mean it&#x27;s a laudable goal (probably), but beyond the enormous expenditure in terms of materials, as you write (even keeping in mind that in the rocket business SpaceX is Nr1 when it comes to re-using rockets), there&#x27;s still the additional material they send into the orbit, material that sooner or later will have to be replaced, material that is not unlikely to cause problems at some point (like a possible Kessler event which could shut down space exporation altogether, not to mention the light pollution they cause).')
