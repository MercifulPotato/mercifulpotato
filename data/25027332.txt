The linked page is about a bug when you use .nomedia which is kind of interesting in it&#x27;s own right. However most replies here seem to be on the broader topic of whether an OS should be able to block screenshots - this is another interesting topic but one that&#x27;s only vaguely related to the linked page.<p>I&#x27;m curious if the &#x2F;u&#x2F;distalx posted this because they were interested in a discussion about the former or the latter.<p>If the former then it has largely strayed off topic. If the former then there might be a better page to link to that is more clearly about that specific &quot;feature&quot;.')
