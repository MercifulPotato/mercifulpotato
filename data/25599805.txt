For example, I wrote a proof of concept Rabin-Karp hashing approximate string matching algorithm to perform plagiarism analysis while I was working at Udacity in around 2017. The system never went into production, but pypy was super helpful in crunching all historical user submissions for analysis.<p>I’ve also had great success using pypy to accelerate preprocessing steps (when they don’t rely on incompatible c libraries) for machine learning pipelines. It’s the most painless performance enhancement trick in my toolbox before I reach for concurrency (in which case I reach for joblib or Dask).<p>The one oddity I’ve noticed is that using tuples (including things like named tuples) often speeds up CPython by a lot, but even plain tuples can slow down pypy on the same code—in some cases pypy winds up slower than CPython.<p>In any case, I’m low key in love with pypy, even though I can’t use it for _everything_.')
