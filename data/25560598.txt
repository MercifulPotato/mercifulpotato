(low wage, s*ity bosses, shady working conditions)<p>It made me who I am today, and I&#x27;m very thankful; but I still have friends in Croatia and I understand the plight well, such that I do want to move back to Dalamatia but only on the basis that I have secured remote work as I refuse to ever work locally again. Croatia is lovely place to live provided you don&#x27;t have to work there, or at least depend on it as you major source of income, that&#x27;s for sure.<p>&gt; Considering the region we are talking about, the thing that pops in my mind and falls in the super-high return category is the truffle. (and they are trying!)<p>It&#x27;s funny, I ran a kitchen in Lovran overlooking the Adriatic before I worked in those farms&#x2F;agrotourisms and used to buy black truffles at a discount since there were so many and most restaurants in the area were closed for the season by November especially if I didn&#x27;t need them to be fresh to garnish&#x2F;finish a dish: and were used soups, stocks, bases etc...<p>The thing about truffles is that it really depends on how well you can make them travel to get into the hands of chefs in as short of time as possible, but again after COVID the culinary Industry may never be the same. And I don&#x27;t care who you are and what kitchen you came from but I can&#x27;t think of a single professional chef&#x2F;cook who would buy black truffles, let alone white, on a weekly&#x2F;monthly basis for cooking at home so the lack of demand would vastly reduce the price even if it could be actively cultivated instead of foraged in the Forest as it is now.<p>Personally speaking, I&#x27;m not that big of a fan as the black ones always tasted like very good garlic to me, I never got to use white truffles as I missed the season and only made rissoto from the rice they use to carry them in which was good but not worth the price, in my opinion.<p>And truffle oil is an abomination.')
