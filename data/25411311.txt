Some things I am excited about for the future:<p>- Continued progress on the new &quot;stage2&quot; compiler, which is written in Zig itself (long promised, work started in earnest I think about six months ago). There will be an optional non-LLVM backend this time, which is good news for build times. Even in debug mode, most of build time currently is spent waiting for LLVM.<p>- Incremental compilation with live reloading (in-place binary patching). The stage2 compiler is being written with this feature from the start.<p>- I can&#x27;t find the link, but I believe the plan for stage1 (the current compiler written in C++, with all its warts) is to simply delete it. Since the new compiler will also support compiling to C, the devs will simply have stage2 compile its own source into C at some point, and that will be the stage1 from that point forward.')
