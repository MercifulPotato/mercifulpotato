The SCP protocol is like the <i>only</i> tool that allows that (ignoring being able to use a contrived combination of ssh and tar).<p>For example, very often I use this to pull the latest file I produced in a server that has zsh set as the shell:<p><pre><code>  scp -T trustedserver:&#x27;*(oc[1])&#x27; .\n</code></pre>\nI just pull that command from my history. For the other trusted servers that don&#x27;t have zsh, I do the following (while being completely sure that the filenames I&#x27;m working with aren&#x27;t directories, don&#x27;t have newlines, spaces or other shenanigans):<p><pre><code>  scp -T trustedserver:&#x27;$(ls -t * | head -1)&#x27; .\n</code></pre>\nIf SCP protocol support is completely dropped, the only alternative I know of would be something like this:<p><pre><code>  ssh trustedserver &#x27;tar c *(oc[1])&#x27; | tar x\n  ssh trustedserver &#x27;tar c $(ls -t * | head -1)&#x27; | tar x\n</code></pre>\nThat wouldn&#x27;t show per-file download progress bars, but oh well...')
