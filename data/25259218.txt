But the consequences of doing nothing are reasonably well known. We know the death rate by age well enough, we can suspect that there are significant long-term effects in survivors even if we don&#x27;t know the full extent.<p>We also know that reducing contacts reduces the transmission of diseases like COVID-19. We might have no hard data on how well each measure works, but we know that reducing contacts does work in general.<p>The part I find problematic are the very generic &quot;just protect the vulnerable populations&quot; calls. I mean that would be a great solution for a virus with this kind of strong age dependency in lethality. But I still have no idea at all how we are supposed to protect the vulnerable populations while the virus is spreading among everyone else. For me this is just a slogan, not a real solution. I don&#x27;t see how it could be possible to let the virus surge in a large part of the population while still reliably isolating everyone above 60 or so. I honestly don&#x27;t see any way this can work at all, so I&#x27;m entirely baffled by this line of argument.')
