Instead of filing bug reports, or writing code, or advocating for <i>the thing that he wants</i>? Or at least engaging in the bare minimum effort to assign blame correctly.<p>- The fact that GNOME Software says things are &quot;Sandboxed&quot; without further information is (<i>gasp</i>) a GNOME Software issue. And I don&#x27;t think anyone is all that happy about it. In fact, there&#x27;s a redesign pending, but resources are limited. GNOME Software is a rickety old beast and needs love, but it would be nice if people weren&#x27;t trying to tear down surrounding projects as a result?<p>- Good job finding a security vulnerability. Please report an issue with the gitg Flathub repo[2], and with freedesktop-sdk[3], respectively. Congratulations on your amazing contribution! Have a free t-shirt before they run out [4].<p>- Speaking of Flathub, there is a discussion to be had about Flathub&#x27;s lackadaisical approach around submitting stuff (and updating it). Maybe write about that? Or, better yet, don&#x27;t write about how it&#x27;s terrible and kills babies: write about how we can solve this stuff. For example, we could add some better backend tooling for Flathub that checks for unpatched libraries. Flatpak makes this sort of thing pretty doable. The Flatkill guy seems to have some experience with that, so, maybe that can be his next contribution (after he reports those two issues in their respective bug trackers). Heck, &quot;Flatkill&quot; is an okay name for a vulnerability scanner, so we&#x27;re halfway there.<p>- To clarify, it&#x27;s okay giving these things shit in your spare time, but once you&#x27;re running a domain and spreading fear and uncertainty for dubious reasons (when being constructive is actually less effort), you&#x27;re just being an asshole.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24658052" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24658052</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flathub&#x2F;org.gnome.gitg&#x2F;issues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flathub&#x2F;org.gnome.gitg&#x2F;issues</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;freedesktop-sdk&#x2F;freedesktop-sdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;freedesktop-sdk&#x2F;freedesktop-sdk</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com&#x2F;</a>')
