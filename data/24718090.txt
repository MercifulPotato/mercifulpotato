I share your concern of something going wrong and being stuck with a huge bill. Someone pointed out that 1TB of outgoing traffic from Amazon EC2 would cost $90. I&#x27;m fortunate enough that that won&#x27;t obliterate me, but I won&#x27;t be happy if that happens. I&#x27;d rather my blog get hugged to death. Going viral isn&#x27;t worth $90 to me.<p>But I don&#x27;t think DO really solves this problem either. They say they have spending caps in some of their marketing materials, but the finer print says that overage billing is $0.01&#x2F;GB. Now that&#x27;s a whole lot better than Amazon&#x27;s $0.09&#x2F;GB, but it&#x27;s not a cap.<p>DO can say they have &quot;predictable pricing&quot; because in the vast majority of the cases the &quot;free allotment&quot; that comes with your droplet is enough, so you never see a bandwidth charge, you pay the cost of your droplet and you&#x27;re done. So yes, it&#x27;s more predictable because Amazon would charge you $5.23 one month, $4.87 another month, and DO charges you $5 every month.<p>But I&#x27;m not worried about the 99% case, I&#x27;m worried about the extreme scenario where I somehow go viral or get DOSed. And both options leave me exposed.<p>That&#x27;s not to say DO isn&#x27;t a better deal for the hobbyist than AWS. The equivalent of DO&#x27;s $5 droplet will run you much more on AWS, especially if you actually use the bandwidth they&#x27;re allotting you. And the big 3 do a lot of nickel-and-diming, which is a nuisance compared to the simpler pricing model of the smaller providers.')
