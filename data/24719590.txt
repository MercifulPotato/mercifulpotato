That doesn&#x27;t necessarily make &quot;Trump stories&quot; <i>in general</i> on-topic.<p>Stories about &quot;the effect that social media as a whole has had on the American political landscape&quot; could be on-topic. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily make US politics <i>in general</i> on-topic.<p>Stories about &quot;the influence of social media platforms and their ability to manipulate public perception&quot; could be on-topic. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily make stories about &quot;fake news&quot; <i>in general</i> on-topic.<p>Stories about the Wikileaks organisation could be on-topic.

That doesn&#x27;t necessarily make stories derived from the contents of the DNC data leak on-topic.<p>Stories about gender and racial disparity in tech and programming could be on-topic. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily make stories about gender and racial disparity <i>in general</i> on-topic.<p>Stories about an Antifa or BLM hacking group could be on-topic. That doesn&#x27;t neccessarily make stories about Antifa or BLM <i>in general</i> on-topic.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t find this distinction particularly hard. As for &quot;bias&quot;, I&#x27;ve seen sentiments on this site that could broadly be categorised as Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green, etc. Of course, there <i>is</i> a heavy political bias, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s generally just &quot;US-centric&quot; (which is to be expected, as this is a US site); e.g. as a UK citizen I find some of the comments very bizarre (usually anything involving guns, healthcare, abortion, etc.). It can still be interesting, and if not I can just collapse the thread or close the page.')
