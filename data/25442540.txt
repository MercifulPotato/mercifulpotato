It is a &quot;gotcha&quot; business model that is rightly reviled; the victims don&#x27;t &quot;choose&quot; to use a patent, but rather the assertion of use is used as leverage by Myrvohld&#x27;s company, and is expensive to defend regardless of merit. Therefore it is in their interest to assert every patent against every entity with any assets to take.<p>It <i>is</i> very unfortunate that the justice system is so broken as to make this a viable business model. There are cases of stealing, but there are far more cases of businesses doing normal things and receiving claims out-of-the-blue that they have to spend tens of thousands of dollars to defend.')
