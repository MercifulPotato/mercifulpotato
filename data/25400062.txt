Item(by='psyc', descendants=None, kids=[25400125], score=None, time=1607795541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399641, text='Facebook and Twitter are not communities in any meaningful sense, because they are global, and generally speaking meant for &quot;anybody&quot; to talk about &quot;anything&quot; (of course the limits of this generality are exactly what&#x27;s under discussion). More like a telephone.<p>The proper analogy to HN&#x27;s moderation would be the owner of a FB Group kicking someone, which I believe is fine and good. What Facebook and Twitter are doing, and especially as they move beyond the less-controversial &quot;hate speech&quot; to the more controversial &quot;disinformation&quot;, is the whole global platform moderating everything, and is veering dangerously close to being... I&#x27;m struggling with the word, but something like partisan but less one-dimensional. It&#x27;s not hard to see this path leading to these global platforms simply causing the speech that occurs on them to match the politics of the people in charge at Facebook and Twitter. And nobody needs to hear for the billionth time about the rights of private companies and the law - we know, so save your keystrokes, please.')
