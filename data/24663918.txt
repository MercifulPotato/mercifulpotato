In previous iterations (late 1700s, 1800s and the first few decades of the 1900s) labor and money moved at basically the same speed: as an investor, your capital (gold&#x2F;silver, then whatever money instrument replaced it) took the same boat&#x2F;train&#x2F;carriage as labor.  This had a moderating effect, and the system was able to almost always equalize itself in terms of trade and investments flows.')
