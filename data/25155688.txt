(Have you seen stare-sponsored Keno games like &quot;California Hot Spot&quot;, with draws every 4 minutes, offered in only the very finest neighborhoods&#x27; liquor stores to extremely wise gamblers?)<p>Mortgages were pushed to sketchy credit risks for years, wiping out the the poor&#x27;s earnings &amp; equity with unsustainable housing costs in (temporarily) pubic-policy-inflated home values - and even now, there&#x27;s minimal protection against over-concentrating in unwise housing markets.<p>Plenty of public securities go to zero, often in fraud. But with easy-to-get investing leverage, any amount of initial capital can go to zero with only small moves in public prices. You can lose any amount of money after a small move of AAPL <i>up</i> - if you purchase enough (or leveraged) securities which bet on it going down, which are available to anyone without an accredited-investor-like wealth test.<p>(Have you seen the promotions, and easy on-ramps, for daytrading &amp; foreign-exchange trading &amp; Robinhood? Or how easy it is to channel any amount of money into crypto trading?)')
