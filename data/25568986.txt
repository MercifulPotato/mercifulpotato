Here&#x27;s how you can verify wallet ownership in about 10 minutes:<p>- The one who like you to verify the ownership generates a signature file from whatever they want<p>- Ask the owner of the wallet to add the hash of that file to OP_RETURN in a transaction from their wallet<p>- Wait for the transaction to be validated (longest step)<p>- The one who wants to verify the ownership can now compare the latest transaction from the wallet to the hash of their signature file<p>Same process applies for proving ownership of bank accounts, although if done in the weekend&#x2F;evening, verifying the bank account will take longer time and you need to have a receiving bank account to read the signature hash, otherwise the process is mostly identical.<p>The rest of your comment is based on that you can&#x27;t prove you own any bitcoins, hence worthless as you can prove you own bitcoins, it&#x27;s trivial really. A quick search before thinking out loud would have shown you the answer.')
