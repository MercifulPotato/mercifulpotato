The nostalgia value of owning 1 share of GameStop is pretty important considering the joy that going to that store brought to me as a child. I can totally understand if 20 million people also want in, especially given the idea that we&#x27;re fighting against a short position to cause a squeeze. It&#x27;s like a dumb feel-good movie where we had a bake-sale and everyone buys a cookie for an unreasonable price to help our favorite local grocery store avoid bankruptcy by the evil liquidators who want to turn it into a Walmart.')
