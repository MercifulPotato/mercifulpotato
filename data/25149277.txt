I&#x27;m reasonably tech savvy, but still it was becoming painful to manage all sorts of app permissions on Android. Not to talk about all kinds of tracking that Google does by default some of which may even be impossible to turn off.<p>Between me and Apple I&#x27;m reasonably clear about the business transaction.

In turn Apple assures me that they have a vested interest to do what&#x27;s best for me (i.e., my privacy, no trackers allowed etc.,).<p>With Android we have bewildering choice of hardware&#x2F;forked-Android and what not which come with pre-burned apps and app stores that one can&#x27;t get rid of.<p>Google Pixel comes closest to iPhone but at that price point I might as well buy iPhone as Apple has better track record of respecting user&#x27;s privacy.')
