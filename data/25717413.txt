It will only benefit the language to have more than one quality implementation.  C++ has benefited hugely by the competition between g++ and clang; both compilers have gotten much, much better.  To be fair, it will take a while before the GCC Rust front end is competitive, but for some purposes it doesn&#x27;t have to be, like bootstrapping.<p>If &quot;progress&quot; means &quot;rapidly add more and more new features in each release&quot;, multiple implementations will slow things down.  But that problem can be addressed with editions: at some point, if the project is a success, the gcc front end will be a feature-complete version of some Rust edition, plus enough extra features to build an older version of the Rust compiler.  At that point, you have a better solution to the bootstrapping problem (how to get a Rust compiler when you only have a C compiler and you want to build everything from source and not trust some binary you download from somewhere).')
