Item(by='koeng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602871636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799772, text='^ Listed the 2 that I think really need help above<p>Biology isn&#x27;t nearly as organized as software, so the bio communities are a bit disparate. It also doesn&#x27;t help that biology has such a large scope. From my experience, conferences and academic labs seem to be the only real places were bio folks congregate. To get a sense of needs, conferences are definitely the way to go. iGEM comes to mind as probably the best one to attend.<p>The culture is a little bit different, too, which might impact that. The idea of someone coming and saying &quot;hey I have some &lt;engineering&gt; skill, how can I help?&quot; is pretty foreign. Contributions are almost always from people within a lab, so there aren&#x27;t any mechanisms in place to get interested outsiders involved.<p>I think that&#x27;ll change with the increased networking in biology, but right now, people just aren&#x27;t helping each other very much :(')
