Existing programs like a browser, taskbar or window manager will still work for a while, until they need I&#x2F;O too, eventually everything will be progressively dead.<p>It should be a persistent problem that shows up immediately after you&#x27;ve just installed an incompatible SSD, and it should only affect those who installed Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver. So, if it only appears after a system upgrade, it should not be the problem here. But apparently it&#x27;s still a possible cause.<p>So, just in case, the solution follows:<p>First, try disabling HIPM and DIPM in Windows &quot;Power Options&quot;, you can use this tutorial: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sevenforums.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;177819-ahci-link-power-management-enable-hipm-dipm.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sevenforums.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;177819-ahci-link-power...</a><p>Also, if you are using the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver, LPM and DIPM can be disabled by making the following registry changes. After making the changes, reboot the system and test.<p><pre><code>    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\iaStor\\Parameters\\Port0]\n    &quot;LPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;LPMDSTATE&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;DIPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n\n    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\iaStor\\Parameters\\Port1]\n    &quot;LPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;LPMDSTATE&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;DIPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n\n    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\iaStor\\Parameters\\Port2]\n    &quot;LPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;LPMDSTATE&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;DIPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n\n    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\iaStor\\Parameters\\Port3]\n    &quot;LPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;LPMDSTATE&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;DIPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n\n    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\iaStor\\Parameters\\Port4]\n    &quot;LPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;LPMDSTATE&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;DIPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n\n    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\iaStor\\Parameters\\Port5]\n    &quot;LPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;LPMDSTATE&quot;=dword:00000000\n    &quot;DIPM&quot;=dword:00000000\n</code></pre>\nNote:<p>1. It disables LPM and DIPM blindly for Port0, Port1, Port2, Port3, Port4, and Port5. It may miss your SSD if you have more ports (unlikely), and if you know the location of your SSD, one entry is enough.<p>2. I only tested it many years ago on an old version of iaStor, perhaps a new upgrade has made these register keys ineffective. Who knows.<p>3. Previously, uninstalling iaStor and using the built-in AHCI driver in Windows could be a workaround. But I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s still a solution.')
