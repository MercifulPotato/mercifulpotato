The appeal for me is that I know RHEL really well because of work, so for personal use CentOS is awesome (I can use all my expertise).<p>I have a few personal prod machines (my home router, a few personal website servers) that I need to run and I don&#x27;t need support for them, and I can&#x27;t afford a couple grand a year to pay for them nor would I.  I&#x27;d just use something else.<p>That said CentOS Stream will likely be fine for me.  I think RH bungled the news badly, but overall Cent is still pretty much fine.  It&#x27;s going to be way, way more stable than Fedora, and even Fedora wouldn&#x27;t be all that bad in prod (I know because like a crazy man, I run Fedora in prod sometimes when I need fresh packages).  Personally, I&#x27;m mostly upset about how this went down, not so much the outcome.')
