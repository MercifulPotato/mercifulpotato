I think the problem is the lies, not the ideas. If an idea, like that the Earth is flat, can only find support in lies, the idea will go away if people aren&#x27;t free to lie.<p>To be clear, a lie is a proposition insincerely asserted with the intention of causing others to sincerely believe it.')
