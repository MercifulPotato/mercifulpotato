Not sure what these studies are that say motorists and cyclists are blind to them, by that logic why have any signage on the roads at all? I absolutely notice them as both a motorist and cyclist, and I’m sure many others do too. They work. Of course they don’t work as well as dedicated bike lanes, but to shit on something that is at least a step forward just because it didn’t take us all the way to the ideal solution is a great way to ensure progress is never made.<p>Edit: I suppose it’s also worth pointing out most of my bicycling experience comes out of San Francisco. A lot of the bicycle infrastructure here is newer than you would think, it was a noticeably more hostile place to be a cyclist 10 years ago when I moved here, but same could be said of any US city I assume haha<p>Edit: guess the downvote button means “I don’t agree with you” on hacker news now :&#x2F;')
