The AppleTV itself wirelessly, the TV power on&#x2F;off and source via HDMI-CEC, and finally the external amplifier volume via IR, which powers on&#x2F;off itself when sound is received or idle.<p>The TV automatically switches source to the game console when it&#x27;s turned on and vice versa.<p>Couldn&#x27;t be easier.<p>I haven&#x27;t done any fancy hacking or special hw to get this working, just basic Samsung, Apple, a decent amp and a few minutes adjusting the settings of each.')
