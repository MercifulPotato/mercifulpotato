What is considered the leading edge of the field of in AI ethics research? Had she accomplished something of great distinction in this field prior to google? Was her google street view result related to ethics? I would assume that ethics research would involve how an AI can learn to act ethically. Perhaps something about how an AI treats a sentient versus non-sentient impediment, like how it would decide whether to stop for ducklings or just run them over, whether it has the ability to learn a function for long-term social implications of its actions, specifically longer than the training stimulus, which is the remarkable function of the human prefrontal lobe, or only considers short-term task reward.')
