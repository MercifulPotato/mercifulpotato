It is for people to ensure maximum benevolence with their work for everyone and take the highest moral position. I believe what needs market penetration is this ideal, rather than the GPL itself. GPL is for people who already hold this kind of ideal. They are looking for exactly this.<p>I don&#x27;t say you shouldn&#x27;t ever make money from your work or never use any copyright&#x2F;MIT&#x2F;BSD licenses. Most people are not filthy rich and need the money. What I am saying is GPL is not for this, and does not have the requirement to be convenient or framed in a different way than the heroic selfless endeavor it is, in any sense.')
