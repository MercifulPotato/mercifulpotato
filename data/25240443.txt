It&#x27;s tragic to hear of Tony&#x27;s death, and it&#x27;s even more disquieting to speculate about the causes. Arson&#x2F;murder paints the event in a very different light from a mechanical malfunction or, god forbid, suicide. And, as you mentioned, fire deaths are exceedingly rare, so the whole matter is cloaked in mystery.<p>I&#x27;m pretty shocked to hear of Tony&#x27;s passing, as I was also very moved by his ethos and writings. That he died in a fire is all the more shocking — a death from cancer or something similar would be easier to accept. Perhaps this is because cancer and serious illness feels almost inevitable, and this doesn&#x27;t.')
