Currently even for models still in sale it is usually impossible to get parts. You can go to an IKEA store &#x27;used&#x27; section, if they happen to have this model returned by some customer, they will sell you parts, but most likely you will return empty-handed.<p>Recycling large furniture, such as sofas, just because they have one tiny part responsible for folding broken, is not really an eco friendly way to go.')
