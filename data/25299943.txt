Item(by='hmexx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607067349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25299910, text='49Wh is very small battery for a laptop, even a light one, which this one isn&#x27;t particularly. So spec-wise not impressive. Not surprising as it&#x27;s competing with some pretty big players with a lot of hardware expertise.<p>For reference the LG Gram 15 has a 72Whr battery at 1.1kg. The current champ in &#x27;battery size to weight ratio&#x27;. Most ultraportables have a 50-60Whr battery at around 1.3kg.')
