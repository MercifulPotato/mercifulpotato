But what I want in that is probably a much bigger ask: I want the partial hydration to be performed automatically with static analysis. Something like Svelte (real DOM codegen, no need to ship a library to the browser) would be especially nice, but I don’t want to give up JSX. In the end, this is probably well outside the scope of a framework coupled directly with React, and I suspect that if I want it badly enough it’s something I’ll need to build myself.')
