Let me know if I&#x27;m mistaken.<p>Your question is difficult to answer, but I ask in return: Is a general propensity to engage in an act sufficient to excuse it?<p>I will concede that &quot;every person has their price&quot;. At some point we cross the line from &quot;asking for a bribe&quot; to &quot;engaging in extortion&quot; to &quot;direct threats of violence&quot;.<p>Moyer ran the ethics and business conduct programs. Is there an expectation that someone in that position <i>does</i> have a durable set of principles, and a price higher than a CCW permit?<p>The appropriate consequences for the involved parties are, of course, along completely different ethical lines.')
