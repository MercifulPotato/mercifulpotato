Item(by='doctor_eval', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609659474, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618679, text='&gt; This looks more like T1 support made a call that T2 reversed.<p>Given the fact that Apple had themselves featured the app, ISTM that T1 didn’t even do the most basic diligence before making this call.<p>I’d say that’s the problem more than anything. It seems like Apple takes a completely stateless approach to things.<p>It’s as if they have periodic scrubs of the app list based on some middle-manager defined predicate (in this case, “does app name potentially breach ToS?”) and then they do a mail merge of the results, without even looking at any other metric at all.<p>IMO that’s not remotely good enough.<p>It would cost Apple almost nothing to add some other predicates like “has app been around for &gt;12 months? Has app previously been featured  by Apple? Does app have more than 100K downloads?”.<p>If any of these are true, app should go to T2 or even T3 before any contact is made with the developer whatsoever.<p>I mean this is customer support 101. The stress this must have caused the Amphetamine team must have been huge. And for what? A bad user experience and yet another hit to the reputation of the App Store.')
