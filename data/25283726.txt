I&#x27;d posit that the opposite is also true where a space with more formality can also be helpful. Each sort of space has its strengths, and it helps to participate in a variety in order to be well-rounded.<p>One thing I like about Hacker News is that since humour isn&#x27;t centred as much, crass ideas can&#x27;t be cloaked in a joke and get a pass. I&#x27;ll go into some Discord channel and see borderline-insensitive memes be normalized as they&#x27;re &quot;just joking&quot; or &quot;didn&#x27;t mean any harm&quot;. That thing doesn&#x27;t happen as much here as those memes would fall flat when presented plainly.')
