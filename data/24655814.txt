Hacktoberfest has never generated anything of value for open source.<p>This statement by the author is not true. I lead Home Assistant[1], last year the 10th most active project on GitHub[2]. We love Hacktoberfest at Home Assistant and gladly participate. We have gotten a lot of high quality contributions and some of these contributors also stayed and joined our core team.<p>We&#x27;ve been many years in the top contributed projects during Hacktoberfest. In earlier years spam was higher but now it&#x27;s not too bad. The biggest thing that they did to reduce the spam to us was making sure our repository didn&#x27;t get linked on their website.<p>I see a bunch of calls of people are trying to stop Hacktoberfest because it attracts people to open source and we&#x27;re all so busy. But… if we get more people and we get them along as a maintainer, the long term work load can be reduced because more people are working on open source.<p>So instead of calls for trying to stop Hacktoberfest, let&#x27;s ask for a better way to control spam. I think that the announced guide by DO to tell people to open a PR on their own repo is a good start.<p>And if anyone reading this is interested in participating in Hacktoberfest by improving their smart home, check out the Home Assistant Hacktoberfest blogpost[3]!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;octoverse.github.com&#x2F;#top-and-trending-projects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;octoverse.github.com&#x2F;#top-and-trending-projects</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;hacktoberfest-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;hacktoberfest-...</a>')
