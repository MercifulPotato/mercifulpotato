As entrepreneurs who exited our startups last year, we wanted to give back to the communities that fostered us. So we set up this foundation to invest back in SF and NY with bi-annual grants.<p>For our first grant, we focused on small business development, specifically restaurant closures. We mined public data, talked to affected restaurants, as well as academics and politicians.<p>We found some expected causes (falling sales) as well as unexpected (labor flight).<p>Would be happy to answer questions about our methodology or findings!')
