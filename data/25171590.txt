All people should be able to strictly tell apart games and reality, and then violence in games can actually be helpful to relieve the inherent need for violence in humans without hurting anyone.<p>I used robots just to bring attention to pacifism and because I found it a nice replacement for demons, plus it also has that small extra advantage of being friendlier towards e.g. people who dislike blood or whatever.<p>&gt; politics<p>My views have become a centerpoint of my life and everything I do, but I don&#x27;t mind if anyone forks this and takes all politics out. Or even put your own politics in. It&#x27;s all fine, that&#x27;s why I released it into public domain!')
