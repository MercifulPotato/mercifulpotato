If I don&#x27;t then I code&#x2F;debug in my head (this is not a joke, I do that and I like to code) and usually sleep within minutes.<p>Then comes 2 am and I often wake up. If there is no stress then I fall asleep and it&#x27;s fine. If there is stress then I digest it and cannot fall asleep.<p>To that I found a solution that sometimes work: I have a pen and paper next to the bed and I write inthe night that thing I am thinking about to not forget it in the morning. My brain acknowledges and I can fall asleep.')
