Sales orgs (quite a large part of Microsoft) must still work from the office (with exceptions) and cannot relocate as they need to meet customers - including the technical sales. Even though they&#x27;ve worked fine from home and were in fact MORE productive. So a lot of nuance is missed, and the application of this isn&#x27;t as broad as it is suggested.')
