If you bought a book from me but are unsatisfied, I&#x27;m happy to refund you. If you found my stuff unhelpful, let me know what&#x27;s missing and I can try to include a discussion of that in the next edition. Just write me offline. Or write to the group, or visit us (or me) in the Racket Slack.<p>I wrote my stuff to help people get into web development with Racket. I love web devel, and Racket, too. You and I have a lot in common: I found the official docs puzzling, so I worked out my own approach to them and made _Server: Racket_. It should go without saying that that&#x27;s the origin story of just about every paid book out there on applications of programming language X to domain Y. That&#x27;s not even a criticism of the Racket docs. Plenty of tools&#x2F;languages also have good docs, and there are lots of books, too. How many Django books (or even courses) are out there?<p>There are also some great web programming tutorials out there for Racket, too. I recommend this one, by Racket star Jens Axel SÃ¸gaard: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;soegaard&#x2F;web-tutorial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;soegaard&#x2F;web-tutorial</a> .<p>I hope you&#x27;d give Racket a chance. Since you&#x27;re talking about it, it sounds like you&#x27;re dipping your toes in the waters. I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll find them quite welcoming. That said, all this negativity is pretty off-putting.')
