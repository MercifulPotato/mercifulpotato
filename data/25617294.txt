The similar appearances of the B-1 and Tu-160 suggest that when two planes are designed using similar technology with similar mission requirements, they tend to have a lot of similarities.  (In the years since they were initially designed, the way these aircraft are used has changed.  But they were initially designed to meet similar requirements.)')
