Ideally the interviewer should be looking for how you approach the problem and what you do to obtain an answer (whether they do or not is a separate topic)<p>Granted, the 747 question also technically does have a concrete solution I guess, but I would end up asking things like what&#x27;s the volume of a 747 and the dimensions of a ping pong ball and then point out there will be gaps as we fill the 747 with balls so it&#x27;s not simply dividing the volumes, write a program based on these observations, give a disclaimer that it will most likely be inaccurate, and hope that is good enough to pass.<p>But that blender question... uh yeah... I&#x27;d probably spend too much time asking clarifying questions to actually come up with something plausible.')
