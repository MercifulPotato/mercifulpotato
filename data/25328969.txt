The school district I grew up in spent about $13K per pupil in the school year following my graduation (easiest year to find quick and dirty data for), and still had all of the problems I outlined. I assure you, it wasn&#x27;t going to high teacher salaries when I was in school.<p>So how about we do trim off some of that fat, give the teachers a raise, and then evaluate whether we need the additional spend?')
