I&#x27;ve been browsing news sites with &quot;links&quot; a lot more lately as it usually just gets me the content I want and it does so very fast. No ads, no popups, no JS - just the content. I could achieve the same thing with noscript and a few other extensions but those generally still aren&#x27;t as fast and simple as links.')
