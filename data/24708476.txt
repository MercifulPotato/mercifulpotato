It could easily be manipulated by companies paying reviewers for biased reviews. Same as sponsored YouTube reviewers.<p>It doesn&#x27;t of course, but (going back to the RT comparison) it would be a major scandal if it were ever discovered that a well-known professional movie critic were being paid off by a studio for biased reviews. A website that focused on this could keep track of and remove the special status of reviewers caught doing that. Given that obtaining the &quot;professional reviewer&quot; status is quite expensive (relative to making an RT account) and such people have much more to lose than a random user, I tend to trust the RT critic score much more than the user score.<p>If it&#x27;s possible to establish a similarly robust reputation system for user reviews with no external source of validation (e.g. a newspaper&#x2F;journal hiring someone as a reviewer) I&#x27;m definitely all for that! That seems much more difficult to me though. But maybe if it continues as a niche community as you say, it could work. I hope it does.')
