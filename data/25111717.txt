It does spread quickly, but not that quickly.  The most well known exponential growth model of SARS-CoV2 infections is the Imperial College model which has proven to be at least one order of magnitude off in its predictions.  The most accurate model of SARS-CoV2 spread currently available is that published by Michael Levitt which predicts SARS-CoV2 comes well short of exponential spread even in worst case scenarios.  The only reason we thought there was exponential growth is because the beginning of the epidemic was so poorly understood.')
