It does exist, but Apple&#x27;s just not going to help you with that.<p>Also, to unlock your Mac:\n1. `csrutil disable` to disable SIP\n2. `sudo spctl --master-disable` to disable Gatekeeper and allow apps from anywhere<p>And finally, the whole thing about MacOS Spying on every app you opened and bypassing VPNs - turns out, both stories had some fake news to them. It was actually the developer certificate (not the actual app), and Apple has announced they are building a new protocol with more failsafes to prevent a repeat of the previous incidents. As for the &quot;bypassing VPNs,&quot; that&#x27;s actually not true at all. System-wide VPNs still do work in Big Sur, it&#x27;s just that the API that Little Snitch used for app-specific traffic redirects doesn&#x27;t work on system apps (although system apps still respect system-wide VPN settings).')
