I actually don&#x27;t really like rules all that much. And there are shitty laws. GDPR and speed limits aren&#x27;t in my opinion though. I find them sensible. If you think they are not, I got you covered with my civic disobedience parenthesis.<p>That said, breaking the law has risks, you cannot lightly advise people breaking it as they feel like it.<p>Where did you read that I want cookie banners? They ask me whether I want to be tracked. They are nonsense, often bad UX, and often riddled with dark patterns. The GDPR never forced anyone to implement them. It requires explicit consent for tracking in essence, which cookie banners often do a very bad job of.<p>If you think that as a visitor I am not going to opt in, don&#x27;t ask me, and definitely don&#x27;t force me into it with dark patterns. If you think your cookie banner is going to annoy me, well don&#x27;t design your website this way, or you are not being coherent. Or, more accurately, you are solving a problem that is yours, not mine, and yet putting the burden on me.')
