One of the questions they asked me to solve was the &quot;n - 1 numbers in a list&quot; question the article talks about - I promptly came up with the XOR solution because I have more background in low-level work than the high-level finance role I was interviewing for. Turns out, they had never seen it before, didn&#x27;t really understand how&#x2F;why it worked, and they took a lot of convincing to accept it as correct.<p>I think I only still got the job was by then proceeding to also solve the problem the &quot;normal&quot; way.')
