We are looking to grow our mobile engineering team with a senior iOS engineer to help expand and improve our mobile product offering. Rest assured, this role is not &quot;building an iOS app&quot; - you will be diving deep into the depths of iOS to create a plugin used across hundreds of apps running across millions of users.<p>If tracing through detailed system logs and occassionally firing up a dissassembler with high calibre ex-google and mozilla engineers sounds like a &quot;jolly ol&#x27; fun Tuesday&quot;, this is the role for you. If you tinker with open source for giggles and routinely make jokes about the number &quot;42&quot;, this is the role for you. If you want to work with a group of highly skilled, yet &quot;just good people&quot;, engineers...and quickly grow to a leadership role, this is the role for you.<p>Come join us! The team is primarily remote, so...yes, very remote friendly.
