Is this considered &quot;aggressive behavior&quot;? This is one example of a type of behavior that I&#x27;d consider to be aggressive and likely not fitting the definition of the study. There are many others out there. And I&#x27;m betting some of them are impacted by the games.<p>Why? Because I&#x27;m recovering from gaming&#x2F;media addiction and I would adopt behaviors and lines from things I played&#x2F;watched to use in real life.<p>I&#x27;m waiting for the study that actually detects me and people like me. I suspect it&#x27;ll take about as long as the tobacco industry took to conduct and release studies showing tobacco can cause cancer.')
