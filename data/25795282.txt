The single largest reason I can think of that Lua is known is because World of Warcraft used it as the UI language, and therefore a critical mass of people had to learn it to do a popular thing. Kinda like how it&#x27;s irrelevant how good or bad JavaScript is if it&#x27;s the only way to get dynamic behavior in a web browser.<p>... and in terms of <i>why</i> Blizzard used it in WoW... One of the strengths of Lua is it&#x27;s so small that its interpreter is extremely easy to understand and debug, while still having just enough power to make most things one wants to do not super irritating. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the technical-space aspect that boosted its social-space aspect... It&#x27;s not so bad to use that nobody wants to touch it, but it&#x27;s so simple to integrate into an existing complicated system that developers aren&#x27;t pulling their hair out building the integration layer to whatever they&#x27;re <i>really</i> writing the system in.')
