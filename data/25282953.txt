We use &quot;Computer&quot; which is one of the wake words offered by Amazon because we don&#x27;t want our kids to get used to the idea of bossing around a person.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve mapped all of the functions we use to &quot;recipes&quot; that include the word &quot;please&quot; so that they don&#x27;t work unless you use the word &quot;please.&quot; i.e. the upstairs lights are named as for example &quot;the Chicago lights&quot; and there is a recipe that says &quot;turn on the Chicago lights&quot; when someone utters &quot;Computer, please turn on the upstairs lights.&quot; So if you say &quot;Computer, turn on the upstairs lights&quot; it says &quot;I don&#x27;t know what upstairs lights are.&quot;<p>The disadvantage of this approach is that you need to get the string exactly as stored.')
