Water, mud, dropping it, things falling on it, and so on. A weapon cast and milled from steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber impregnated polymer, with tight tolerances, is going to be more durable to that kind of thing vs. a firearm having structural parts made with FDM printing like the subject of the article.<p>I agree that barrels are available in the US but that isn&#x27;t generally true worldwide. I admit that I don&#x27;t know much about homemade barrels but my understanding is that for a long rifle barrel (needed for &gt;200 yard shooting) is going to require some pretty specialized and expensive equipment, and I would be very surprised if they could approach the accuracy of even a cheap, non-accurized factory chamber&#x2F;barrel, but I&#x27;ll look into it more to satisfy my curiosity.')
