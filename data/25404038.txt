These huge companies that can afford lots of money intentionally get the FDA to set a high bar with lots of expensive testing in the regulations. This creates a HUGE barrier to entry. Right now I&#x27;m working with a pathology lab who are buying a pathology slide scanner. This is basically a slide handling robot with a high end camera hooked to a PC with an image viewer. The combined system costs over $300,000 from companies like Leica and Philips. The software is incredibly basic, it&#x27;s basically Thumbs Plus with Irfanview and that&#x27;s $100,000 alone, aside from the scanner. But they charge that because it&#x27;s incredibly expensive for a startup to come in and challenge their pricing.')
