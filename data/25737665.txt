Meanwhile, a historical event took place in the United Sates this past week. &quot;Big Tech&quot; has reacted to that event. That reaction is being discussed. Seems like an appropriate topic for HN to discuss. If you don&#x27;t want to discuss that issue there are still posts such as how the new MacBook Air is the best computer I&#x27;ve ever used.
