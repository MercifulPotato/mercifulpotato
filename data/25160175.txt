Your comment is uninformed in that you did not read my comment with comprehension and that you don&#x27;t understand what stupid stuff anti-vaxxers are serving.<p>My kids are all vaccinated and so am I and I don&#x27;t suggest to people to not vaccinate.<p>I am just trying to cool down the too happy thinking that the vaccine is some magical tool that automatically causes problems to go away with no risk.<p>In particular, we don&#x27;t yet know how long the effects of vaccine will persist, we don&#x27;t know of long term side effects (and even very small amount of side effects multiplied by 7B people is a problem) and we don&#x27;t know <i>WHEN</i> it is going to be feasible to vaccinate everybody.  Remember, it is going to be pricey and many people will choose not to vaccinate for financial or other reasons.')
