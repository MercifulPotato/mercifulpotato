Also the 9 was an abnormally high year (I think the highest ever in the UK?). This year is down 40%, which is the worst since the 1980s [0].<p>&gt;Are we measuring different stuff?<p>Apparently.<p>Also, why use UK numbers to compare to a story on US agriculture, especially without mentioning you switched countries? Can I cite numbers from Congo without noting it?<p>&gt;Surely yield in Uk can&#x27;t be 3 times higher.<p>Sure it can - variation in wheat production has well over a 50x variation among countries. Not every country has the UK climate, or even the uniformity that the UK has. The climate and rainfall in the UK are very well suited to wheat production.<p>Also, I just posted the values. And here&#x27;s [1] another place you can look. From this place you can select countries to compare them. The US is ~1&#x2F;3 the output. The UK has exceptionally high numbers, nearly the highest in the world.<p>Pretty much every source I find is similar.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allaboutfeed.net&#x2F;Raw-Materials&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;UK-suffers-worst-wheat-crop-in-40-years-632827E&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allaboutfeed.net&#x2F;Raw-Materials&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;U...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;crop-yields" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;crop-yields</a>')
