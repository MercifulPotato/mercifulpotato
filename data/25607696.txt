I imagine the MS cards is more of a &quot;central account&quot; that is accessed when you swipe.<p>I guess each &quot;Eagle Cash&quot; terminal has a certificate, and whenever you credit&#x2F;debit the card, the terminal adds&#x2F;subtracts the amount on the card, signs the new balance with the certificate, and then this can be verified at any other terminal.<p>In other words, you can&#x27;t modify the balance on the card unless you have the secret certificate, which is only present on the authorized terminals. If you try to modify it yourself, you can&#x27;t do it, because no other terminal would accept the card unless the balance was cryptographically signed with the cert.<p>That&#x27;s my guess for how this works, at least.  I wonder if each terminal has a unique cert that can be revoked if it is compromised.')
