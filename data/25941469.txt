Don’t  use a generalist attorney because they won’t be familiar with the nuances of employment contracts or the specifics to your jurisdiction. $700&#x2F;hour may sting momentarily, but it’s peanuts in the long run. They also may be able to help you negotiate better salary, equity, terms, etc. A good one will be able to give you a sense of how they can help you  and the general cost before you engage. Don’t just sign the updated contract (especially if you just relocated from California to a new state).')
