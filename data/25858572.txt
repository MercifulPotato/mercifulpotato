Those who can take care of the money (as opposed to giving it to scammers) can also figure out how to get more and just need the government out of the way.  (this is the conservative lower taxes point).  What is left is a lot of people with mental issues who can never take care of themselves and wouldn&#x27;t use the money to do it.
