Item(by='CarelessExpert', descendants=None, kids=[25012172], score=None, time=1604694413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009646, text='&gt; I stopped reading as soon as the article said anger is an unhealthy emotion.<p>Anger <i>not turned to constructive action</i> is an unhealthy emotion.  Unfortunately, that kind of nuance isn&#x27;t gonna get captured in an intro to Stoicism blog post.<p>Stoicism teaches that, in those moments where you feel that flash of anger, pause and ask yourself: what in this situation can I do that&#x27;s in my control that can lead to a constructive outcome?<p>If the answer is absolutely nothing, then the goal is to recognize that and let that anger subside because it&#x27;s fruitless and harmful.  This is the essence of the dichotomy of control: if you can&#x27;t control something, then getting worked up about it only harms yourself.<p>But it&#x27;s <i>very</i> rare that we have absolutely no control in a situation, and in those cases where we have some measure of control, Stoicism as a philosophy challenges us to find the constructive action that lets us turn that challenge into an opportunity while allowing us to replace that anger with a sense of constructive purpose.<p>And in fact choosing acceptance <i>is</i> an action itself, and therefore such situations become opportunities for personal growth that hopefully leads us to becoming a more kind, patient, humane individual.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s not to say that Stoicism is a cure-all or that it&#x27;s good for everyone.  Maybe for you it&#x27;s the wrong choice!<p>But your comment is a <i>perfect</i> example of how people continuously misunderstand Stoic thought and then disregard it out of hand, which is precisely what this article is all about.')
