Each type of coffee (Robusta has 2x that of Arabica coffee) and each type of tea has its own amount. You can&#x27;t even say that black or green tea has more. There are such and such.<p>2. understand the effect of caffeine: caffeine does not make you awake, but caffeine prevents you from getting tired.  (to a certain extent). so you have to take it at the right times.<p>3. understand what you actually need: you don&#x27;t always need the caffeine effect. you also have to distinguish between being awake and being able to concentrate. sometimes you just want to concentrate, then maybe b12 or sugar will do.<p>A word about sugar: sugar is dangerous. by the way, problems with energy during the day come almost more often from sugar, not only from caffeine. \n(when i have to drive a car for a long time at night, i need sugar rather than caffeine. caffeine only gives me a headache. but a pack of wine gums gives me energy.<p>If you want to level your caffeine, you first have to give up sugar completely for 1-2 weeks.It&#x27;s mentally hard, but most of the energy waste actually comes from it.<p>so, and how am i doing today? \nlately i had it well leveled. You can escape the above-mentioned spiral of increasing consumption and withdrawal if you always drink the same amount of coffee (and ideally the same brand) at the same time. \n- i had e.g. 2 x double espresso in the morning, 1 x double espresso at noon. \n- I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with my sleep-through behavior for 2-3 months, and then just slowly dosed down to \n- 1x double espresso in the morning, 1 espresso in the afternoon. in each case before the creative sessions.<p>dosing down works well during the vacations, for example, when you don&#x27;t have the same daily routine, expecting the same creative burst.\nand remember that sleep always takes a few weeks to settle down.')
