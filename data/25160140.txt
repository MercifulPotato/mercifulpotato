Item(by='usrusr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605878186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159946, text='&gt; I have been around people risking their lives in B.A.S.E jumps, scuba diving or aircraft acrobatics.<p>Those are more risks of a quick end doing something you love, which is much more attractive than a risk of ruining a long life ever after, which being on the wrong end of a failed medical experiment very much is. If we somehow had cultural conventions and processes about controlled opt-out from life then this might be different, but we don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know how those cultural mechanisms would look and I don&#x27;t know if they would even be possible without doing more harm than good, but I do know that we clearly don&#x27;t have them.<p>But the real issue with challenge trials is that they just don&#x27;t tell you that much as the trial group would undoubtedly be extremely biased. Basic validation can be done in a dish, in programmerese that&#x27;s the suite of unit tests, and it can be done well enough to skip from safety tests (that don&#x27;t involve the virus) right to observed staged deployment. The main thing challenge tests would add is that they would be a big lure for reckless people who try to be faster by skimping on the initial dish tests that are the majority of development (the equivalent of skipping unit tests).')
