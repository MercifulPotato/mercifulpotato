When looking for a Go or Python alternative, Zig doesn&#x27;t immediately come to mind TBH.<p>Also: Go (or python) has no UI system or 3D API wrapper in the standard library, but those are (probably) useful for at least as many people as a HTTP server. Does that mean that Go should get UI and 3D-rendering support in the standard library?')
