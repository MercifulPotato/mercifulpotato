It&#x27;s hard to give a price. Our pod and rail would have been $300k +- 50k new. A top end in that range could be up around $750k. The low end maybe $150k.<p>The type I work with are for wood working. Manufacturing cabinets and furniture. So very big (6m long work surface) but not capable of metal work. But there is a huge range out there.')
