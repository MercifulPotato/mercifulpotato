Item(by='derekp7', descendants=None, kids=[25783955], score=None, time=1610663385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='I have an open source snapshot backup system (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snebu.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snebu.com</a>) that I&#x27;ve been improving over the years, and after adding public key encryption support I posted to HN and I actually made the front page for once (this was on a Sunday afternoon however).<p>Got some feedback, a couple more contributors sent in pull requests, and based on other feedback I decided to submit a package to Fedora (currently working through their review process).  Will try for Debian next.<p>What I&#x27;d like to do after getting more traction is put together a cloud based service for either sending backups directly or replicating a local repository to the cloud.  I think the best way to go here is to partner with an existing provider instead of starting from scratch.<p>One thing I need to do is work on my elevator pitch, as Snebu often gets compared to smaller single-host backup tools such as rsync-snapshot based ones, or Borg or Restic.  Whereas it is more comparable to tools that are intended to back up multiple hosts (Amanda, Bacula), with granular access controls, per-host encryption keys (optional) with site-wide skeleton keys (again optional), and a robust data catalog.')
