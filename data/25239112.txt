It doesn&#x27;t make a distinction useful for guiding behavior. If we use a stricter definition of &quot;rewrite&quot; to mean changing the <i>logic</i> as well as its expression in code then that is much more useful and precludes refactors. Also, anyone who can&#x27;t see the difference between basic logic and its expression in a particular notation (code) probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing either except under strict supervision of a real software engineer.')
