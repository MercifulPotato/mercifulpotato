The learning resources for ruby felt old and stale. Meanwhile javascript&#x2F;typescript, c#, Python, go etc resources just feel fresher. Unsurprising as to why these are the recommended languages for beginners to learn. Currently working a .NET gig right now and I had to learn C#. The process was much more enjoyable than learning Ruby, the resources are plentiful, and the community is very strong and itâ€™s backed by Microsoft. Not to mention .NET has a stronghold here in the Midwest.')
