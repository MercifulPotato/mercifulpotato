Also, Pfizer is an American company.</i><p>But also a multinational, manufacturing their vaccine in the US and Belgium.  Initially without any help from Operation Warp Speed, which appears to be a mistake if their December claims about supply chain problems was true, along with eventually signing up to the program and moving up their promise for our second 100 million doses from the 3rd to 2nd quarter.<p>But that Belgium plant?  Something is so wrong with it they&#x27;re shutting it down for a while to improve capacity ir so they claim.  My only good guess is that they have a sterility problem and are finding they have to dump way too many lots they produce after testing for that.')
