When someone tells you, “There’s free beer at Oktoberfest,” is your first thought that the beer has no monetary cost, or that the beer is unencumbered by particular legal restrictions?<p>Now someone tells you, “There’s free speech at Oktoberfest.” Is your first thought that there’s no monetary cost to expression, or that the expression is unencumbered by particular legal restrictions?<p>(Happily, Oktoberfest has both.)<p>&gt;I&#x27;m just wondering in what context or culture beer is considered free (gratis).<p><i>When</i> beer is described as “free,” it’s understood to be gratis. <i>When</i> speech is described as free, it’s understood to be libre. These are used as examples for more ambiguous situations, since software can be one, the other, both, or neither.<p>&gt;Why not say &quot;free as in beer, not free as in lunch&quot;?<p>For three reasons:<p>1. “Free for lunch” is a way more common phrase, and it already means “unencumbered by schedule or previous commitments.”\n2. “Free lunch” is already part of a more common phrase which states that a free lunch cannot exist, ruining the effectiveness.\n3. Beer and lunch are both expected to be gratis, not libre. Exceptions (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;freebeer.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;freebeer.org&#x2F;</a>) have to explain themselves over that hill.')
