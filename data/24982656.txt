Cars are a great example: Safety features may add around $2k annually [0], though they&#x27;ve helped prevent a few hundred thousand deaths since 1980   roughly cutting in half the per-capita automobile fatalities. As it is, they cost about $44 billion annually [2] which means in addition to lives saved, the reduction in deaths save us up to $44 billion&#x2F;year. (probably not all attributed to safety features given the reduction in drunk driving.)<p>Considering the $2k cost and roughly 5 million cars sold each year, the safety measures cost $10 billion, for an ROI of up to $30 billion&#x2F;year.<p>There was an unfortunate uptick as smart phones gained popularity, though it seems like public awareness campaigns and distracted driving laws may have helped that.<p>Car safety is a pretty good example of how both government regulation and the free market can work together to achieve positive results. (marketing based on safety features allowed companies to compete on something other than price).<p>That&#x27;s not an endorsement to embrace all government regulation, just an example of how it isn&#x27;t all meaningless bureaucracy.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Api&#x2F;Public&#x2F;ViewPublication&#x2F;812354" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Api&#x2F;Public&#x2F;ViewPublication&#x2F;...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;winnablebattles&#x2F;report&#x2F;motor.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;winnablebattles&#x2F;report&#x2F;motor.html</a>')
