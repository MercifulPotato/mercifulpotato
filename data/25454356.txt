I understand that the creator deserves fair compensation, but why would relatives or companies who bought the copyright make a living from some dead person&#x27;s work? To me it makes no sense, people should be paid for their own work based on their own merits.<p>But even during lifetime 20 or 30 years would be more reasonable. As much as I sympathize with people who make substantial money off a Christmas song they wrote 40 years ago, the idea of lifelong support already seems a bit exaggerated.')
