It is the social systems and contracts we live in&#x2F;with.<p>I can be secure in the knowledge that I can not be laid off if I am doing good work, unless my employer can truly justify it (the myth of employers not being able to lay of employees is just that. There has to be a justifiable reason though).\nI know my healthcare is taken care of by the state, I get financial support if I want to start a family, get paid leave to be with my new born child, get most of my education for free, have high trust in the capabilities and fairness of the justice system and on and on.<p>All of this creates a relaxed environment where most of the base needs in Maslow&#x27;s pyramid are taken care of, and I don&#x27;t need to worry about them. \nSimilar to the Harvard study that showed that there was a sweet spot for the ratio of performance to salary increase, having these social norms &amp; contracts in place leaves most of us free to get on with the work with a focus of doing the best we can each time without financial&#x2F;health&#x2F;education worries.<p>And, ofcourse there are plenty of problems in the nordics! Let no one ever sell you a utopian fairytale telling you otherwise.')
