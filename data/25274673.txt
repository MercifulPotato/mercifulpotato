But taxi companies have a far, far higher bar in the eyes of the law. In most countries you can&#x27;t just decide to climb in your private car and provide commercial transportation service. You have to spend <i>a lot</i> of time and money to get there, authorizations, commercial insurance, driver certifications, etc. Uber bypassed it by saying &quot;we&#x27;re a tech company&quot; and left it to the drivers, making the enforcement of the law a lot harder.<p>Hotels also have higher requirements than an AirBnB host but the company says &quot;we&#x27;re just the tech platform&quot;. Just look at conflict resolution and what kind of leverage and protections a client has when dealing with a hotel vs. dealing with a private renter to see the massive gap that comes attached to that &quot;disruption&quot;.<p>Because that&#x27;s the thing, you could have short-term renting in the past but that wasn&#x27;t an alternative to hotels. AirBnB made it a hotel alternative so that&#x27;s the benchmark. Same with Uber, you could (legally) hitchhike in the past but Uber made the service a taxi alternative.<p>Imagine Google &quot;disrupting&quot; the state&#x2F;national&#x2F;federal identity registry, as in become the equivalent of the passport or identity card issuer while offering Google-style support and SLAs. Some services are important enough to be regulated, this is what today&#x27;s disruptors are bypassing.<p>The solution to an industry being crap isn&#x27;t to allow someone to bypass existing regulation, it&#x27;s to create a set of effective regulations that can be applied equally to everyone.')
