M1 unifies its high‑bandwidth, low‑latency memory into a single pool within a custom package. As a result, all of the technologies in the SoC can access the same data without copying it between multiple pools of memory. This dramatically improves performance and power efficiency.&quot; [0]<p>[0]\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;mac&#x2F;m1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;mac&#x2F;m1&#x2F;</a>')
