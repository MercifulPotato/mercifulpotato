Allegations which were never substantiated, probably because it never actually happened.<p>And when the Reagan administration learned that Iraq was targetting their own Kurdish population with chemical weapons, they still didn&#x27;t give a shit.  But two decades later, when Bush the Younger decided to emulate his father, the American government invoked those gas attacks against civilians as a justification to dismantle Iraq.  Two decades late for the Kurds that got gassed by Iraq while the American government pretended not to notice.  American foreign policy is depraved.')
