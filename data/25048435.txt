My own experience on HN has been that folks may be more cynical than average, and sometimes lacking empathy, but I&#x27;ve found most arguments are at least made based on reality, facts and good faith. Those that aren&#x27;t usually get downvoted and&#x2F;or flagged pretty quickly. Meanwhile twitter threads are frequently full of trolling, memes and reaction gifs. Where does this &quot;HN is toxic&quot; mindset come from?')
