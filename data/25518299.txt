And it doesn&#x27;t have to be a choice between one or the other, a perfectly workable best of both worlds path exists, in Germany even:<p>There&#x27;s a concept called &quot;church tax&quot; that is handled, for those who are members in one of the &quot;qualified&quot; confessional church orgs (in this car, &quot;qualification&quot; basically boils down to Napoleonic age precedent but this is orthogonal to the topic at hand) by the tax collection authorities in a proxy role for the church orgs, but which is very clearly outside of government budget scope. Exactly the same setup could be used to collect income-based broadcast contributions without subjecting broadcasters to budgetary government influence.')
