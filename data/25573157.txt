Trying to do so is like trying to compare salaries across countries without taking into account exchange rates.<p>With the single federal rate you can do some rough comparisons.  For example we can compare Ohio, a fairly blue collar, not totally rural but also not urban dominated state, with Massachusetts, a state that has all its stats dominated by the Boston area in order to tease out the difference between what it&#x27;s like living in middle America.  But even than it&#x27;s kind of limiting because the next obvious question is what are the county poverty rates and that gets real messy and inaccurate real fast.<p>Think of the federal poverty rate like U3 unemployment, better than nothing but not good for much if you really want to understand what&#x27;s going on')
