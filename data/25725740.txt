Trading partners won&#x27;t accept tariffs without reciprocating. The US might be big enough now to get away with this to some degree, but that won&#x27;t last forever, and tariffs would probably accelerate that reduction in influence.<p>I&#x27;m all for tariffs when there is some other goal that makes sense (for example I think tariffs should bake in the cost of environmental or other regulatory compliance we have that the foreign trading partner does not).')
