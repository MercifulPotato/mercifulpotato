None of them are open source and they tend to have better code than stuff I work for clients. Which usually means I borrow my code from my pet projects a lot when solving client&#x27;s problems.<p>That also leads to a nice side effect that over years I have a huge collection of personal code that I just copy&#x2F;paste and I know it works. When I do a live session of creating a PoC the client even if himself is a developer gets lost in my fast switching of pages, copy&#x2F;paste, my fast way of talking and throwing overwhelming information at him that in the end they just get lost. And one hour later a final &quot;it&#x27;s done, here take it&quot; usually gets a &quot;holly shit, that&#x27;s awesome&quot;. When I hear that I know the client is mine.')
