Usage is already a form of consent. The discrepancy is between the user and the company in <i>what</i> is consented. Forcing the company to provide service to the user even if the user disagrees with an upfront description of what the company requires to provide that service is a completely valid objection.<p>Also GDPR applies to any organization providing to citizens of the EU, not companies operating there, but that&#x27;s yet another example of poor design which results in GDPR having little enforcement.')
