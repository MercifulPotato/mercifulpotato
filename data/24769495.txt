It&#x27;s been experimentally proven many times that at the moment you look at your marble, the other marble&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 probability of being red and blue shifts substantially to, for example 75&#x2F;25. And that&#x27;s without it having any way of knowing that you&#x27;ve seen your marble. So there are hidden variables that we don&#x27;t understand, but they&#x27;re not local. They somehow affect both marbles.<p>The rest of your explanation was super easy to grok (thank you!) but this part I can&#x27;t wrap my head around. If the balls can be red or blue, and it&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 before, how would the probability go to 75&#x2F;25? I would expect it to either stay at 50&#x2F;50 (no change) or to 100% (because the other ball is known).<p>Can you elaborate on this part? This is really fascinating.')
