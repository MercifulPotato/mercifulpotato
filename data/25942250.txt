For example, I have a server that continuously runs Litestream on a database that&#x27;s constantly producing load. Every time I make a change in how Litestream works, I create and push up a new build to that server and run it for at least 24 hours. After that, I review metrics about performance and throughput and go through the logs to check for any abnormalities. Finally, I have a separate runbook that I go through for manual testing every CLI command and their various options. It&#x27;s a slow process but it helps catch weird bugs that aren&#x27;t apparent from automated testing.<p>As for the license, yes, the PR author agrees with the license but it makes it harder in the future to change the license and then I need to maintain a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) which is more work. I don&#x27;t have any plans to change the license but I also don&#x27;t know if that will change in the future.')
