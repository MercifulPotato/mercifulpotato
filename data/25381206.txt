Then the choice becomes do without or use another app store to get what you need. I don&#x27;t want to have to shop for iOS apps at the Amazon, Google, and Microsoft stores, each with their own app policies, billing systems, etc... not to mention some other AppStores from some vendors I&#x27;ve never heard of.<p>For as much as Facebook gets beat up the reality is, it is still popular with people like my parents and other family members. Right now Facebook is not happy about the coming tracking restrictions that Apple wants to apply. Do we not think that Facebook would be the first app to jump ship to a place where Apple rules won&#x27;t apply to them and drag a lot of people with them into these new AppStores? For some people saying you can&#x27;t use the Facebook or some other social media app is not an answer.<p>I am not torn on this at all and that&#x27;s coming from someone who makes the majority of their income from selling iOS apps. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;m happy to only have to pay 15% now rather than 30% but for me, that is still worth the cost for what I get from the overall experience of making and selling apps for iOS and knowing that someone is looking out for my interests as an iOS user.<p>edit: typos')
