I wrote it in 3 different languages for Amazon when I worked there, and went through all sorts of discussions to have them release it, and they refused for no meaningful reason that I could see.<p>The only reason I was ever given was &quot;we use it and think it is great therefore we won&#x27;t release it.&quot; The implication was &quot;If what you wrote was junk we&#x27;d let you release it.&quot;<p>Needless to say I never tried to get Amazon to release any of my software during my time there after that, because the response was so poor.<p>Edit: If Amazon releases my code, I&#x27;ll be happy to add a tiny credit to Amazon in Notices.Txt and in no other way be thankful to Amazon.')
