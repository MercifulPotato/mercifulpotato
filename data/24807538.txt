I like the idea of complete transparency, but even without being able to capture dramatic photos of courtroom battles the US already has trial by media in some cases.  I feel like adding photos and videos to that would throw gasoline onto that fire and turn our judicial system into a reality show.  I almost prefer the system in some European countries where they are not even allowed to release the names involved in criminal cases unless they have been found guilty.')
