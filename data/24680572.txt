It started as a side project but soon I realized it got traction and hundreds of user used it on a daily basis. I added a subscription model to the existing community&#x2F;free service and I got a good bunch of customers. \nLast year I had a dilemma: keep on working at Microsoft or leave and dedicate full time to Apility.io. But then Auth0 came up and offered me an acquhire. So now Iâ€™m full time (among other things) dedicated to Apility.io inside Auth0. Happy ending.')
