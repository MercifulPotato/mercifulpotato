The middle ages were far more democratic than our modern enlightened times. Canadian historian Francis Dupuis-Déri writing in the book &quot;Démocratie: Histoire politique d’un mot aux États-Unis et en France&quot;:<p><i>&quot;During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, thousands of villages had an organized assembly where communal decisions were made. The &#x27;community of inhabitants&#x27;, which even had legal status, functioned for centuries by a process of self-management. Kings and nobles were content to manage affairs related to wars or their own private property, to administer justice, and to now and then mobilize their subjects for common chores. The hierarchical or aristocratic authorities did not interfere in the affairs of the community, which met to deliberate on political communal, financial, judicial and parochial issues. They discussed the sharing of the harvest and sale of the surplus, the cutting of wood on communal land, the repair of bridges, wells and mills, and the hiring of instructors, shepherds, watchmakers, forest guards, sometimes even parish priests, and guards when brigands, wolves or epidemics were rampant. They designated those who would serve in the militia, debated the obligation of lodging the royal court should it visit, or the utility of sending a notable to submit to the court of grievances in the nature of community.&quot;</i>')
