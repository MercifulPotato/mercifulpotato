Mind you, the unuoptimized version is already (apparently) 35MB (uncompressed) JS. Should see if I can improve that.<p>edit: built version is ~600KB, of which ~70KB is actual application code. Seems like I&#x27;m using a &#x27;big&#x27; version of lodash somewhere.<p>Edit 2: Fixed, shaved off down to ~730KB. Biggest factors now are React itself, react-bootstrap, i18next, yup and lodash-es.')
