So if anyone says the squeeze hasn&#x27;t happened yet, it just their opinion.<p>For all we know the hedgefunds got out of their short positions and retail is pumping the stock higher. Or conversely hedgefunds are still short and waiting for the rally to fizzle until it collapses and then they reap huge gains.<p>Or it could explode higher like this week(the big squeeze), the point is nobody knows with any certainty what will happen. I never thought tesla in a million years would be a $800B company but I and many like me have been proven wrong. its whats great about investing, there are always surprises all the time.')
