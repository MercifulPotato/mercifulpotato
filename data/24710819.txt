Akin to racists taking immigrants and minorities having 3 or 4 kids on average instead of 2 as &quot;planning long term white  genocide&quot;.<p>Whether something preserves a given group&#x27;s wealth is utterly independent of it being good or bad for everybody else. Rule of law and not having bandits choking trade also help to preserve their wealth. So would a hypothetical vaccine for all diseases. The definition of oligarch is also very non-standard as it would not only mean college educated technically qualify as they use their disproportionate earning to earn more to build and preserve their own wealth but so would teotoller factory workers over their peers as they would spend less wealth by not drinking and with compound interest&#x2F;average stock marker growth and time could become a shocking fund.<p>To be frank in absense of other details in the summary the &quot;framework&quot; is so vaucous that he can conclude anything he wants including &quot;the agricultural and food producers have ultimate control of the army, navy, and airforce&quot; or &quot;that dentists are the gatekeepers to being upper class&quot;.')
