Item(by='kwaugh', descendants=None, kids=[25233354, 25233053], score=None, time=1606512663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230198, text='&gt; A double chainring setup likely offers smaller gaps between gears but likely a comparable overall range from lowest to highest.<p>This isn&#x27;t true. This bike is using a 40 gear crank in the front with an 11-40 cassette in the back. That puts the gear ratio at 1.0 on the low end and 3.64 on the high end. The corresponding Shimano GRX setup with a double chainring would be a 46-30 in the front and a 11-34 in the back. This gives a 0.88 ratio on the low end and 4.18 on the high end, which is actually quite a big difference. One could argue that the difference in gear ratio on the low end isn&#x27;t a big deal because this bike has pedal assist, but the difference on the high end is quite noticeable.')
