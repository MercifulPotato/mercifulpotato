In the present, use of old ammunition (a few decades or more) is discouraged because the old formulations of primer compound produce corrosive hygroscopic metal salts that will rust your gun badly if you&#x27;re not dilligent with cleaning.  Very cheap old surplus ammunition from overseas is something to be wary of, but that&#x27;s mostly because of bad QC that made that ammunition unreliable or dangerous from the day it was made.<p>As for atal or sling, unless you&#x27;ve been practicing with these since you were a child, I think you&#x27;ll sooner starve to death than score yourself a single meal.  The cultures which used those tools had people practicing with them for years before they were useful with them.  A sling is easy to make, I encourage you to try it out.  I used a pair of shoelaces I bought at the grocery store for $2.  It is <i>not</i> easy to even get the projectile flying in the general direction you intended, so if you try this make sure you&#x27;re far from any buildings or bystanders...<p>(But really, I recommend buying some canned food.  It is unlikely any infrastructure collapse would last more than a few weeks.  Any scenario where you have to hunt for food at all, let alone for years, seems exceedingly unlikely.)')
