In effect, therefore, anybody in England may register and consult with a GP without charge.<p>8.4.7 It is important to note that there is no set length of time that a patient must reside in the country in order to become eligible to receive NHS primary medical care services.<p>8.4.8 Therefore, all asylum seekers and refugees, students, people on work visas and those who are homeless, overseas visitors, whether lawfully in the UK or not, are eligible to register with a GP practice even if those visitors are not eligible for secondary care (hospital care) services.')
