Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608231214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25458201, text='&gt; and the employer replying &quot;sorry to hear that buh bye.&quot;<p>... and then other employees raising a stink, perhaps in the hope, misguided or not, that the company will reverse its decision or change its behaviour to help its PR. The employer can use whatever power they think they have, but so can the employees. It&#x27;s one thing to say that what the employees did wasn&#x27;t a wise way to achieve their goal, but it&#x27;s a whole other thing to say that what they did is wrong.')
