It&#x27;s a cesspool.<p>Brother is one of the few left standing that hasn&#x27;t taken that road and I think they should be rewarded for it.<p>FWIW they also sell color laser printers and I&#x27;m using one right now. It connects over the network, supports AirPrint, and just sits there quietly doing a good job. It doesn&#x27;t get gummed up if it sits idle for weeks or months. The model I have even does duplex printing (printing on both sides of the page) which is quite handy. It was less than $500 when I purchased it. The official toner isn&#x27;t terribly expensive and you can use cheap refills if you want to save money.')
