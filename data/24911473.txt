There are countless excuses for why it&#x27;s a net neutral or even a positive for us to waste our most finite resource (time). But chances are, you&#x27;re not going to be glad you played that one extra game, or watched more TV shows, when you&#x27;re on your deathbed.<p>I don&#x27;t accept that life is about happiness. Happiness is too vague of a term, used to describe multiple different things. Does it mean a measure of how much pleasure one is feeling in a given moment? Satisfaction with one&#x27;s own life? How much entertainment someone manages to have?<p>We could reduce the argument that life is about simple pleasure to its logical conclusion, and ask why it wouldn&#x27;t be optimal to use drugs and&#x2F;or a neural device to induce a semiconscious, lasting state of maximal pleasure. I don&#x27;t accept that most people would choose this life. And to anticipate that objection that it&#x27;s because you have to look at a ultiliarian view of <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> happiness, I don&#x27;t think most people would choose to have everyone collectively in that state, either.<p>I assert that life is about meaning. That&#x27;s why the above doesn&#x27;t sound appealing (probably). What do you do that is truly meaningful, to yourself? That is what makes a life well lived and gives you satisfaction, and it&#x27;s separate from how happy you feel.<p>And it could be chess games. It&#x27;s up to us to look inside and figure it out for ourselves. I&#x27;m just tired of people expressing existential angst and it being met with &quot;it makes you feel good so it&#x27;s good&quot;.')
