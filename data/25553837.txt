Realistically speaking - what kind of other random aircraft are going to be up to 120m&#x2F;400ft or around trees&#x2F;obstacles when flying a racing drone? I bet it is zero. I am not disputing the fact that there are situations when all the precaution is needed but the fact that you are breaking the law when you are flying your FPV racing drone alone between&#x2F;above trees alone in a private forest is a bit unsettling (at least based on the latest unified EU drone regulation).')
