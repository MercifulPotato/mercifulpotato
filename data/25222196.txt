Fuel consumption is perhaps 10% or less of my cost per km. If that fuel consumption goes up or down 10% that means my driving cost goes up or down 1%. My 60L tank takes me 1100km. I don’t care if more streamlining or lower height would take it 1200km. 1100km is at least two toilet breaks anyway. So I’ll pick the practical car I want&#x2F;need and don’t care too much about consumption so long as it’s reasonable. I wanted a bit higher clearance and 4WD (and I use it too - but rarely). Last time around it was a jacked up wagon and I don’t think I’ll buy an SUV because the 4WD wagon is so much better at everything plus it’s cheaper.<p>With an EV, this equation of cost and range goes out the window. The difference between 300km and 400km range is huge.')
