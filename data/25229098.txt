These things generally aren&#x27;t rationally founded anyway. If you ask about some political issue, you&#x27;re going to get regurgitated talking points and tribalism, not a thesis. I think it&#x27;s quite rare to meet someone willing to suspend belief for a bit and engage in unbiased debate, or at least I haven&#x27;t met too many. This line of thinking can be helpful in a technical context though.')
