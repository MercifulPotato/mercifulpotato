A good type system is worth its weight plus some.&quot; really depends.<p>If you are trying to make a mobile app, I agree. If you are trying to make a deep learning framework for researchers, I think the evidence is pretty clear at this point that type systems have more cost than benefit. Pytorch, Tensorflow, Jax, Keras, etc. are all far more popular than their strongly typed alternatives and I would be willing to bet this remains the case for many many years.')
