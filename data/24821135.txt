I think the problem is entirely systemic. I don&#x27;t think Graham is corrupt, any more than any other Congressman. This is the same problem that the Trump tax returns illustrated. It&#x27;s all perfectly legal. If you could find a way to pay less tax, you would too. Similarly, if you can get someone to give you campaign dollars for voting a certain way, why _wouldn&#x27;t_ you sell that vote?<p>I believe we should fund national-level campaigns with Federal money, depending on the &quot;level&quot; of the race. (And state elections with State money.) Everyone gets the same amount, and all of this nonsense goes away. Will it prevent graft? Of course not, but it would kill the legal-and-public kind.')
