Calls for violence and death threats galore. If Parler called for an insurrection then you must also hold Twitter accountable for the violence it propagated.<p>Matrix is probably not coming back for exactly the reason Parler was nuked, because it provides a free speech platform to &quot;undesirables&quot;.<p>I hope they double down on PWAs after this incident.<p>Edit: Please have a conversation instead of drive by downvoting.')
