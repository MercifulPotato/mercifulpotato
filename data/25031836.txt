Item(by='CyberShadow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604901499, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030758, text='&gt; as error-nodes (&#x2F;open (No such file or directory))?<p>No... This particular one most likely indicates that the path on btdu&#x27;s command line is not to the root subvolume. The attached explanation mentions this when the node is opened. If it&#x27;s not this, then it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m aware of - what paths are under the node?<p>&gt; Also: Is there a way to stop sampling after some time or amount of samples?<p>Once you&#x27;re satisfied with the precision, you can press p to stop sampling. Does that do it or were you looking for a configurable limit?<p>Thanks for the feedback!')
