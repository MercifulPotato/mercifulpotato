(Didn&#x27;t happen, but really, think about the logistics). That&#x27;s a lot of land to cover.<p>I think the long-range logistics of supporting an army thousands of miles away from your civilization centers was just too much to handle for Iron Age &#x2F; Dark age civilizations.<p>Even if one leader (Genghis Khan) could successfully lead such an expedition, it was clear that his successors were unable to.<p>As such, once Genghis Khan died, the Mongol Empire could only sustain itself for a short time before collapsing. First into the four Khanites, then total collapse a few decades later. That&#x27;s just too large a land-area, without any decent form of large-scale transportation (ie: boats) that could assist travel.<p>----------<p>The Roman Empire&#x27;s expansion was primarily driven by the Mediterranean Sea. Going over the land-route through the Silk Road between Europe and Asia is... hard. Very hard.<p>Another part of the Roman Empire was that they were a bureaucracy: they spread their ways and very carefully organized their empire as it expanded. You didn&#x27;t need once-in-a-thousand year leaders like Genghis Khan to do things, your standard Roman Magistrates were effectively trained to do the task. Even when Rome itself collapsed, the Byzantine empire (Eastern-half) continued to run itself for nearly a thousand years later, under largely Roman-inspired principles.')
