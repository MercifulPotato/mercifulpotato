You are a liar.<p>This is false. You need to also look up the definition of &quot;liar&quot; - it exclusively refers to <i>intentional deception</i>. I did not intentionally deceive you - I just thought that they were hidden when they were not.<p>You&#x27;re zero for two while acting in the most malicious way possible. Perhaps try taking a step back and not only looking up words before you use them, but stop assuming the worst about people who disagree with you.')
