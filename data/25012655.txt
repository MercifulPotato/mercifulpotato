It may be somewhat less common for people writing code to be proficient in some aspects of data refactoring, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it can be done.<p>That refactoring can be done incrementally — that it is possible to pay down tech debt — doesn&#x27;t, in any case, prevent it from being significant.')
