Item(by='heimatau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611879884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951219, text='&gt; Have you proved the point that I need to &quot;assume malice&quot;?<p>Catch up to the conversation. I moved on from my characterization to repeat my question without the malice. You said &#x27;i can answer your question&#x27;, yet your entire comment is devoid of such answer.<p>You&#x27;re Sybil&#x27;ing this issue. Only obstructing the real issue at hand.<p>The real issue is whether the laws (via court cases ensure interpretation is correct) says it&#x27;s allowed or banned. The good faith in the government or bad faith in the government is moot. The intention&#x2F;malice distracts from the actual point. Which is why I moved on from it because I&#x27;m trying to engage you in the actual issue.<p>Nothing explicitly protects citizens right to encryption. No law. No court case. And until that&#x27;s plainly laid out, we shouldn&#x27;t be offering our trust to any ruler over us. Whether their intent is positive or negative, it&#x27;s entirely moot.<p>Whether citizens have a human right. That&#x27;s the issue and you&#x27;ve spoken to distract from the issue. I encourage you, prove your case that EU provides this human right.')
