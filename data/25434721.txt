I deliberately didn’t claim certainty on whether these legally compelled requests counted as warrants because I didn’t know for sure.<p>&gt; It doesn&#x27;t matter whether they run geolocation on the IP logs; logging the IPs is collecting a tracklog regardless of whether they store it <i>as such</i> or not.<p>The weasel words here are ‘as such’.<p>If they substitute the IP address with an anonymous identifier after ingestion, without having first performed geolocation then they <i>have not recorded</i> the location data, and <i>they do not have</i> a record of the location data.<p>I realize you don’t want to be critiqued, but it’s clear that you don’t have any evidence that Apple is actually storing location data on people.<p>You only have an explanation as to how they <i>could potentially</i> be storing it.<p>On almost every post regarding Apple, you insert alarming sounding statements like “Apple is recording your travel history”.<p>You must know that you don’t actually know this for sure, and yet you persist in inserting this falsehood over and over again.<p>It’s true that I’ve challenged you on this a couple of times.  It’s simply not true that I have replied to every one of your comments on this topic.<p>As I pointed out earlier, elsewhere on this thread you pointed out that IP addresses can leak coarse location data.  I didn’t respond to that.<p>As for ‘cross-examining’ you, I agree that is against the site guidelines, however I don’t see myself as doing that to you in general.  The site needs to have some way of distinguishing between cross-examination and challenging outright lies.<p>It would seem weird to tolerate polemics which veer into misinformation as comments, and yet not allow this to be challenged.<p>I’m curious why it’s so important to insert this particular idea about Apple into the conversation?<p>It seems especially weird when we’re taking about cellphones, whose location is of course logged by cell companies and is definitely accessible to both law enforcement and other government agencies.')
