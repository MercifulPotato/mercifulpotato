CPU&#x27;s are not that problematic with the huge number of cores in AMD Epyc, but RAM is a serious limitation, in my world I need between 15% and 60% RAM to database size ration, depending if it is transactional, reporting or somewhere in between. Taking a 50 TB database as an example, it is too much for a 4TB RAM 2 socket Epyc system.')
