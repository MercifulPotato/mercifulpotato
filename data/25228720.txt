(This would be the Applicative instance for collectors.) Combining  functions [a] -&gt; b and  [a] -&gt; c doesn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;stream&quot;.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t use GADTs, only GADT &quot;syntax&quot; in which data constructors are provided as functions with signatures (MakeCollector :: ...)<p>Personally, I find this syntax much clearer for existential types. It amounts to having a type variable in a parameter which doesn&#x27;t appear in the return type of the constructor.')
