Rust has much larger compilation unit and knows more about what can read&#x2F;write a particular piece of memory. This allows some occasions for optimization where C compiler must be conservative.<p>An example of simpler version of this is Fortran that can be faster for numerical loads due to the fact that Fortran disallows aliasing of function arguments. C on the other hand, must pay the price of having to be conservative with how it treats arguments just in case they overlap.')
