The size of the economy doesn&#x27;t really matter. We don&#x27;t say Norway isn&#x27;t viable because its size is only a fifth of that of the UK. There is no point in doubling the size of the population to make the economy twice as big when each person is no better off. Especially when we are increasingly bumping up against ecological limits.')
