In some very large companies I worked in (or with), techies focus on work while less competent people become managers; techies regard managers initially as admins that do work techies don&#x27;t want to, but then the managers take over the organization and make it rot. This is initially far from senior leadership&#x27;s sight, when it becomes visible it means most of the organization is already affected and it is too late. In most cases HR is helping with this because HR is completely disconnected and not understanding techies and the power dynamics (&quot;those geeks nobody understands&quot;) and side with the bureaucrats because HR is also a form of bureaucracy (you don&#x27;t get in HR is you are a brilliant STEM graduate).')
