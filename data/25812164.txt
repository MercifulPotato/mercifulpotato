It probably should have occurred to me before, but a lot of the Wacom and Huion drawing tablets with screens use HDMI for display and some kind of USB for input. Obviously that would be better if they were upgraded to thunderbolt models that could do both, but that would of course require another $1000+ upgrade for those users on top of the laptop.<p>Of course the real question is how much more quickly does thunderbolt get adopted when nobody&#x27;s Macbooks have HDMI, which is probably one that Apple is asking themselves. They&#x27;ve never shied away from pushing industries forward to accommodate them.')
