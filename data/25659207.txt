Clever has many different axes.<p>Compare debugging something like git or hg (clever, simple data structure) to cvs or svn (non-clever, standard data structure).<p>Systems like git and hg don&#x27;t just do more; they&#x27;re also far more debuggable thanks to clever. That&#x27;s not an IOCCC type of cleverness, but a deep, deep clever.<p>Likewise, consider general-purpose data stores (such as a KVS or an RDBMS) compared to a one-off data structures mapping directly to your data. The design of the original RDBMS was hyper-clever.<p>A wise man knows when to be clever and when not to be clever. I don&#x27;t know of any programming language designer who can make that determination for me; it&#x27;s too domain-specific. If you can rely on programmers to not be clever for inane reasons, you can allow them to be clever for architecturally-critical reasons.')
