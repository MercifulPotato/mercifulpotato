That is a pretty massive space. I don&#x27;t know how many active secrets are out there, but I think someone would need to get very lucky to collide before the attack was noticed and stopped.<p>Other partner&#x27;s secrets may be more susceptible.<p>Edit: I did not consider the paired access key which is another 70 or so bits.
