Norton AV 2007 was their first version that used Sciter (named HTMLayout then).

User may not trust AV app that looks outdated - that rises suspicion that it is not adequate to recent threats - so it <i>must</i> look modern. Therefore ability to modernize UI by CSS without touching anything else (happens at least once per year) is the key requirement. UI systems&#x2F;frameworks that use designs nailed down to pixel grids are too expensive on the long run in such circumstances.')
