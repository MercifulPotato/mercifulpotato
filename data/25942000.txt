And more to the point: they also wouldn&#x27;t have materialised without the workers who get paid less in 30 years than the CEO makes in a day. Why aren&#x27;t they fairly compensated? And even more extensively: they wouldn&#x27;t have materialised without <i>the broader society</i>, a simple word to hide &quot;everyone that is alive or has lived before you&quot;. Amazon makes that money because it has roads to drive its deliveries on, a police to prevent theft, courts to settle disputes, and of course the power of the state is what lets them keep their private property, ultimately society provides them with relatively safe and well-fed people with money in their pockets to spend on their stuff. Without that they would have nothing.<p>In other words, no person is &quot;self-made&quot;, and <i>everyone who has achieved financial success owes a debt to society</i>. This is not even getting into Georgist ideas that people also owe a debt to society for using &quot;commons&quot; such as land or natural resources or polluting.')
