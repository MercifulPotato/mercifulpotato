HDMI&#x2F;DP link that M1 produces is some otherworldly HDMI&#x2F;DP not available to anyone else?<p>I have an example right here, in front of me. I have a Dell monitor. My Macbook Pro is connected to it via Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB-C-&gt;HDMI. My Windows box is connected to it via DP.<p>So, I&#x27;m on my Windows box, playing a game. I turn on my Macbook Pro, and it shows me a proper resolution on the laptop screen. The laptop sees that the display is on, and I see that many windows are missing because they are on the other screen. So, I switch my display from DP (coming from Windows) to HDMI (coming from my Macbook Pro).<p><i>The only thing that changes is the source input to the display.</i><p>And yet. Macbook takes up to 10 seconds to renegotiate the resoltion again. First it slowly disconnects from the display, screws up the resolution, brings all the windows to the laptop screen. Then it reconnects to the display, renegotiates the resolution and restores the windows as they are supposed to be.<p>Why? And what is so magical about the M1 CPU that it seemingly can do this in an instant? There&#x27;s nothing magical: whoever implements all this crap simply doesn&#x27;t care. And in a couple of years M1 (or M1 X Pro whatever) will forget how to to that just as MacOS forgot how it could instantly wake up from sleep 12 years ago.')
