When I asked them about it, I was told that every since they were shifted to WFH, they&#x27;ve been expected to work for a lot more hours, but for no increased pay. They feel frustrated because their work-life balance has been thrown out of the window.<p>I asked around in a few groups that I am part of, and this seems to not be an uncommon occurance, and is happening to people from all fields, not just tech.<p>Have you experienced this? Do you have any solutions in mind?')
