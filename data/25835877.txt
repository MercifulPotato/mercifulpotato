My wife loves WFH. I hate it. I wound up quitting my job at the start of November and taking a couple months off before starting the new gig. I think that time off helped. I&#x27;m still eager to get back into the office.<p>As others have mentioned, having a dedicated office space really does help. A plant on the desk is nice. There&#x27;s soem light at the end of the tunnel, thankfully.. I think I can whiteknuckle my way through the end.')
