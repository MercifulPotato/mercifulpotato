Hope I don&#x27;t get one of those!<p>&gt; Most of the time you cannot even return these items!<p>That&#x27;s just rubbish though, Amazon returns are so easy, if the price is only marginally lower elsewhere I&#x27;ll order from Amazon just because - if necessary - returning is easy, third party or not.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I get the point of it, if I can&#x27;t tell if the product&#x27;s a &#x27;fake&#x27;, aren&#x27;t I happy? If I can (and I&#x27;m not happy with it anyway) I&#x27;ll just send it back?')
