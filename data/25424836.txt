The &quot;decision makers&quot; most of all know the true nature of the party.<p>Its naive to assume that none of them consider the true nature of the party to be what constitutes &quot;virtuous.&quot;<p>&gt; I think the word you&#x27;re really looking for is just &quot;signalling&quot; or at least a different kind of signaling than &quot;virtue signalling.&quot; You&#x27;re really torturing that term into meaninglessness here.<p>Sure.<p>&gt; &quot;Virtue signalling&quot; really only applies to situations where at least some people genuinely think they&#x27;re signalling virtue or that others would actually perceive it that way. One end or the other can be cynical, but not both.<p>Value signaling is perhaps a more value-neutral way of expressing the same sentiment.')
