Cross-platform software is much more ubiquitous than 5-10 years ago.  For linux I always used another box or just run a VM. Nowadays my laptop can ssh or Remote Desktop into a more powerful machine. I have a custom built widows box, a custom built NAS running FreeNas (FreeBSD), 2 RPi&#x27;s running Raspbian, and a not always linux box based on old hardware. There is a machine big or small to do things or play with. My VPN allows me to connect from anywhere.<p>What are you guys doing that you have to install linux instead of running a VM or remotely connecting to a linux box? If it&#x27;s just for the sake of knowledge I can understand it.<p>Apple&#x27;s touch pad experience in MacOS is the best in the market and it is always very different in Windows and Linux. The XPS, Lenovo and smaller vendors really make killer Linux&#x2F;Windows laptops that have much more options than Macs.')
