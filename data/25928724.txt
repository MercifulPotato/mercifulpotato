The only evidence that&#x27;s presented that the govermnent is practicing &quot;socialism for the rich&quot; is the statement of an investment banker, of all people. He also says that government intervention &quot;stimulates the stock market&quot; rather than the &quot;real economy&quot;, and the &quot;best evidence&quot; is that the stock market is rising during the pandemic and startups have been dying.<p>Meanwhile, in the real world, government money during the pandemic is going to individuals who need it and to small businesses. Which is exactly as it should be as we deal with a bad situation. It&#x27;s a <i>good</i> thing that the stock market remains high, as the economy hasn&#x27;t taken the big tumble in the US that it has in many other countries.')
