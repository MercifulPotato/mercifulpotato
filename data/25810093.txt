The first one went kaput about a month after I started using the magnetic adapter and I chocked it up to bad luck. The replacement fried about a week later and I put 2+2 to together and removed the adapter and haven&#x27;t had any trouble over the last ~1 year.<p>All I can say is that I am glad it was the dock that fried not any of the laptops that use it...<p>That all said, it was pretty glorious when it worked -- a single magnetic cable that did dual 4k monitors, charging, videoconf setup, network, license dongles, etc')
