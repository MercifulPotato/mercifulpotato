We will cause destruction no matter where we go, no matter the planet or galaxy, we will destroy it and move on. Even with all our technological advances, we are causing more destruction than ever.<p>Humans unsettle the balance of nature, we are the problem.<p>&quot;I&#x27;d like to share a revelation that I&#x27;ve had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you&#x27;re not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.&quot;')
