A future which is ultimately no different from college-bound people that coasted and chilled through high school, and a professional future that isn&#x27;t much different from everyone there.<p>The actual college course is 3-4 months and may just have only a midterm that you need to show up for, or less.<p>The AP exam and equivalents you can actually self-study for, so the overachievers congratulating themselves for 10 months straight would probably be equipped to use their time more wisely if they already have the discipline and support system.')
