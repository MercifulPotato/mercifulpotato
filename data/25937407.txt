However, more permissively licensed software does seem to reach widespread adoption more easily. Elastic&#x27;s download rates seem to have approached hockey stick growth trend around the time of AWS adoption, and Elastic&#x27;s revenue significantly increased afterwards as well. It might have been on track for that anyway, but 5 years of linear growth did turn sharply upwards around AWS.<p>It seems like Elastic as a company has a decent probability of faster growth and more revenue due to market penetration and name recognition assisted by AWS usage.<p>Had Elastic been restrictive.from the start, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the industry would have focussed on and driven improvements in something like solr instead. As you said, elastic solved problems people had, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to think they would have solved them some other way without elastic.')
