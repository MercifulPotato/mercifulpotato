It cannot possibly be this one:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;I can&#x27;t remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you&#x27;re saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it&#x27;s not literally illegal to express.&quot;</i><p>This is saying &quot;that your idea cannot be censored is not good enough in order to convince people that it&#x27;s good&quot;. This cannot be used to censor anything -- in fact, it claims the position is legal -- neither by the CCP or anyone else. It&#x27;s a judgment on the <i>quality</i> of the idea.<p>It seems to me you&#x27;re trying to invoke the CCP boogeyman regardless of whether it actually fits this argument.')
