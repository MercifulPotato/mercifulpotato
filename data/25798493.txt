We are unable to tell when something is universal experience just by hearing more anecdotes.<p>And even if we somehow got to negative universal experiences, those very well could be:<p>1. Part of a conscious tradeoff (e.g. firms being less profitable due to higher labor costs).  A lot of anti-union rhetoric seems to amount to complaining about not being able to have one&#x27;s cake and eat it too.<p>2. Artifacts of law (either direct or indirect) that could solved through legal reform.  My understanding is that at least some of the &quot;adversarialness&quot; of US unions derives from the requirements of US law, and German unions (for instance) operate very differently (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Codetermination_in_Germany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Codetermination_in_Germany</a>).')
