To be specific, instead of providing a unique address per deposit, Coinbase instead provides one address, and identifies individual deposits to that address using a Stellar &quot;memo.&quot; The same issue is present with Ripple.<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem with Stellar itself, but more how Coinbase decides to approach the issue.
