If you just want a zfs storage pool and aren&#x27;t too picky about anything else, it works, but if your list of expectations goes beyond a place to dump data, you&#x27;re setting yourself up to be frustrated later.<p>My home net has several pi3 and pi4 systems that boot off a small SD card and then mounts working storage via iSCSI, which works great for how I use them.  There&#x27;s no reason I couldn&#x27;t serve that off a pi, but their limited IO and memory makes them a poor choice.')
