This model was accepted without reservation by governments around the world as the basis for their pandemic response.<p>Avoiding these types of errors might be difficult but how much effort are we really putting in trying? For one of my EE courses at university, I designed the power distribution system for a residential subdivision, aiming to keep all the voltage and amperage without acceptable tolerance while minimizing the cost of materials.
