I wish vendors would respect the HTML standard and stop thinking they can machine learn the website to guess what the user wants.<p>Case in point: CRM system with address fields for records. Chrome, I don&#x27;t want to put <i>my freaking address</i> when I&#x27;m updating a customer address, nor do I want to save every customer address I add to my browser&#x27;s address book.')
