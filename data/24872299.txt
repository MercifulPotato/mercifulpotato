However demoting bookmarks to such an inconventient level boggles my mind. Instead we have &quot;collections&quot; which are basically... bookmark folders? Except they don&#x27;t sync to desktop like bookmarks. Just let me load up my bookmarks list on the start page like before and I have very few issues with the new Android FF.<p>The limited selection of addons is also frustrating.')
