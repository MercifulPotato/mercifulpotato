But if you&#x27;re implicitly arguing that more of the GP would be just fine for HN, then I do have to disagree.<p>Moderation comments are an unfortunate evil. To some extent they do the very things we&#x27;re scolding others for. I don&#x27;t feel very good about that and I&#x27;d love to find a better wayâ€”especially because they&#x27;re even more tedious to write than they are to read. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=tedious%20write%20read%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=tedious%20write%20read%20by:da...</a> Unfortunately, the system doesn&#x27;t regulate itself with community and software mechanisms alone. There needs to be a moderation mechanism as well, i.e. humans who are giving the system their primary attention and giving feedback to it. I&#x27;d never claim that the way we do it is the only way or the best way, just that it&#x27;s better than nothing.<p>While I have you: could you please stop creating accounts for every few comments you post? We ban accounts that do that. This is in the site guidelines: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>.<p>You needn&#x27;t use your real name, of course, but for HN to be a community, users need some identity for other users to relate to. Otherwise we may as well have no usernames and no community, and that would be a different kind of forum. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=community%20identity%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=community%20identity%20by:dang...</a>')
