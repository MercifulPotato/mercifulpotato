I keep my account and treat it like what it is, utter garbage. Though, it keeps my contacts in cases where it&#x27;s convenient to connect. If not FB, it would be something else.<p>The problem is those people who derive their world-view from social media platforms and buy in to all the lies and manipulation from bullies. There&#x27;s pressure for accountability, and that should be a good thing, although we need to keep watch. If they oust the bullies and fake lies, good riddance. I don&#x27;t need someone telling me their &quot;Final Solution&quot;, especially without anything backing their words.')
