So we get the worst of both worlds where we force students to do both while taking out massive debt, resulting in a workforce that still has to be trained when they graduate, but much of the liberal education being ignored or useless because there is an argument over whether or not you should be preparing for a job by going to college or whether it is to make you a more holistic individual.<p>For the record I would subscribe to the liberal education viewpoint of college but question why that can&#x27;t be had for free with the resources of the internet at this point.<p>Note: By liberal education I do not mean politically liberal but rather a term encompassing a full rounded individual akin to a renaissance man, that is familiar with and can discuss language and mathematics just as well as art history or philosophy.')
