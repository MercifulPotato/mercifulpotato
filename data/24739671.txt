The maturity level is a signal by CNCF as to what sorts of enterprises should be adopting different projects.</i><p>&gt; <i>Are there any foundations that don&#x27;t operate like this?</i><p>Presumably.  My main experiences are with the Apache Software Foundation, though, which in terms of &quot;incubation&quot; operates similarly to CNCF.<p>&gt; <i>Are foundations good at all for anything?</i><p>The answer is foundation-specific.  But in general, foundations allow for pooling of resources and wisdom such as legal services, and allow for consumers to know a lot about a project&#x27;s governance and status at a glance in a way which is difficult to ascertain for a standalone project on the web or Github or wherever.')
