The per-year-worked fatal injury rate for truck drivers(1) is 0.024%. Meanwhile, a COVID-19 infection for the 20-49 age group has just a 0.02% fatality rate. Logging is even worse, at 0.14%&#x2F;year-worked.<p>More than just risk adverse, I think a lot of people don&#x27;t understand how risky life in general is.<p>edit: ...and I&#x27;ll point out, those truck drivers may still have been brave! If you mistakenly think the risk is higher than it actually is, you&#x27;re still brave for taking it on.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trucks.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;trucking-deadliest-jobs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trucks.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;trucking-deadliest-jobs&#x2F;</a>')
