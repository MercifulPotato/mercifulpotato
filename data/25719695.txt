You seem to think I wouldn&#x27;t support criminal charges for the rioters over the summer. I do. I think they should all be prosecuted for any crimes committed.<p>But there are lines to be drawn, and It&#x27;s certainly not an arbitrary line when it&#x27;s drawn between the severity of crimes &amp; their impact on society &amp; the foundation of our government.<p>Are you telling me you don&#x27;t see a difference between rioters that disrupt the peaceful transfer of power between Presidents?  Between the a rioters that burned down a Wendy&#x27;s compared to rioters that planned to assassinate the Vice President?<p>Sure, prosecute everyone who breaks the law, destroys property, etc. But I have no idea how you can say there is not a significant difference, a clear line to be drawn, between the impact of the Capitol rioters and those over the Summer.<p>It&#x27;s the equivalent of you saying that a thief breaking into the house next door is no different than a thief breaking into the second most important building in the country. The later has a much larger implication for society, undermines society at a deeper level.')
