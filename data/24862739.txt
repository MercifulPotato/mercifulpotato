The difference is that the plumber&#x27;s wrench (never heard that name, the Swedish name translates directly as &quot;pipe wrench&quot;) is that you can &quot;help&quot; it bite initially and that means it doesn&#x27;t have to have as sharp teeth. The &quot;american&quot; pipe wrenches always seem to severely mar what they are used on.')
