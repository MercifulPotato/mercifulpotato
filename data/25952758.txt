I think i used Vundle once upon a time, but honestly don&#x27;t recall.<p>My biggest pet peeve with vim and emacs is that (a) discovery sucks as with most all text mode tools, and (b) emacs in particular is slow and difficult to configure to get some mainstream languages working. Doom was the closest I ever got to being happy with my setup, but the tooltips and autocomplete were still objectively inferior even to vscode (for typescript and react, at least).<p>Lisps are a different story, but not by much. I&#x27;m actually fairly happy with using vscode to write common lisp, though I don&#x27;t do much of it these days.')
