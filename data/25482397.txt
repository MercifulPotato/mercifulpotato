The performance is fine, but I&#x27;m on a RTX 3080 so that&#x27;s to be expected.<p>What gets me is how utterly boring games have become.  There&#x27;s not really much of a game to even be played here.  There&#x27;s lots of talking, lots of sections where the characters are doing things and you end up pressing F to engage some action that continues the, erm, &quot;action&quot; to the next section.  There are parts where you press W to get out of a pile of rubble (which engages the prescripted animation of your character getting out of the rubble) or &quot;W or S to crawl&quot;, where S doesn&#x27;t do anything and W makes your character continue his prescripted crawling animation.  Press F to take your pills and watch your character perform his prescripted pill-taking action, etc etc etc.<p>The actual <i>gameplay</i> is very nearly nonexistent in the first 7 hours.  It&#x27;s just about 98% thinly-veiled cutscenes, where the only say you have in the &quot;action&quot; is pressing a button to make the characters continue to do the thing they&#x27;re already going to do.  Or picking dialog and listening to dialog.  With maybe 5 minutes of really mediocre gunplay mixed in.<p>I don&#x27;t really see how people have the patience for this.  None of this is fun, none of this is engaging.  None of this is high-quality enough storytelling to be as good as even the worst B-movie dialog and exposition.  If I want to watch scenes where characters act out dialog and action happens, literally any movie would be better than this.  I play games because <i>I</i> want to take part in what&#x27;s going on. I don&#x27;t want to watch someone else do it.<p>But, I recognize that I&#x27;m in the minority here, and most people would rank this game 10&#x2F;10 if they had the right frame rate and didn&#x27;t have any bugs.  Because I guess people like this sort of thing now.  Meanwhile I think modern gaming has just about lost me for good.<p>(Until I remember that Doom Eternal came out this year and that it&#x27;s hands down one of the best games I&#x27;ve ever played, and I remember there&#x27;s still hope for gaming.)')
