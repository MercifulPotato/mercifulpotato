Item(by='hhjinks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606237307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197937, text='FNB is about &quot;bompenger&quot;, basically a fee paid when crossing certain spots with your motor vehicle, often used to pay for road maintenance etc. Usually you have to cross one or more of these spots before getting into any major city. Since it&#x27;s a flat fee, it disproportionally affects less affluent families, who often need their car more than the average family. These fees are often quite expensive. You might have to pay €5-10 to deliver the kids to kindergarten, and then get to work, if you live outside the city. That can be as much as €400 a month, just passive, unavoidable expanses for a lot of families. The reason FNB was founded is because these fees have increased substantially in recent years. The camel&#x27;s back finally broke, and FNB became an actual political block in like a year.<p>I would argue FNB is a prime example of democracy working for the people. The two established ruling parties kept wringing money from people using bompenger until they had enough and took a lot of power for themselves.')
