Assuming you only expose an API gateway to the outside world, have the gateway handle authentication, then each service can handle any feature-level authorization with that user info.<p>Bonus: When using a mesh service like this, you can also ban&#x2F;rate-limit&#x2F;load-balance&#x2F;canary calls between any two microservices if necessary.')
