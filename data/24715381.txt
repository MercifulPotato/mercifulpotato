You don&#x27;t have to worry about the inks or &quot;substandard&quot; or whatever&quot;. And then the pizza boxes aren&#x27;t re-recycled because of grease.<p>You suggest we stick to trees instead of recycle, &quot;for paper&quot;. But the whole point of recycling is to turn paper into pizza boxes (and presumably also our Amazon shipping boxes, etc.).<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re trying to argue against recycling paper... when the reality is it&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> success, when you realize paper is recycled into cardboard.')
