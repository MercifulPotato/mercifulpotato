There is no serious historian of Chinese history would actually claim a number like that either. Direct responsibility is probably in the thousands range, he was fighting for decades after all, indirectly through 1 degree of separation probably hundreds of thousands, through 2 degrees of separation probably in the low millions if you include the cultural revolution and the very late stages of the famine when he became fully aware of the devastation. 3+ degrees? Perhaps in the 8 digit range, though at that point attributing malice or intent becomes absurd for anyone who understands how Beijing power politics works.')
