Item(by='carapace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611954831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961083, text='&gt; &gt; The primary result is that we should all work to make a humane\ntyranny (if such a thing is even possible; it sure sounds like an\noxymoron, doesn&#x27;t it?)<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not possible, governments need checks and balances, things get bad\nreally fast when they have absolute power.<p>If it&#x27;s not possible then I think we&#x27;re destined for a very nasty future.<p>I don&#x27;t think a technologically sophisticated government can afford to be non-totalitarian (in the narrow sense I&#x27;m\nusing here: making &quot;total&quot; use of available information technology.  Cf.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Total_Information_Awareness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Total_Information_Awareness</a> ).  I think if\nit tried it would be undermined by other governments.<p>In re: this point, I find it discouraging that the Communists won in\ntheir <i>imperialistic</i> effort to subdue the people of HK.  I was hoping that\ntechnology would give the masses the edge over the central government but\nit doesn&#x27;t seem to have played out that way.<p>&gt; &gt; Yes, your privacy is a social fiction, but in return, we can stop almost all crime.<p>&gt; No we can&#x27;t,<p>What would prevent it?<p>&gt; and (longer conversation) it wouldn&#x27;t be desirable to in\nany case. There is a strong school of thought that we don&#x27;t want perfect\nenforcement of all laws, at least not ones based around nonviolent\ncrimes.<p>I don&#x27;t agree.  I feel strongly that laws should be legitimate or\nrepealed.  We can&#x27;t have <i>perfect</i> enforcement, but technological advancement is exponentially reducing the cost of enforcement, eh?<p>Is the answer <i>selective</i> enforcement?  That doesn&#x27;t sound right does it?\nIf there are laws that we believe should be <i>imperfectly</i> enforced then\n<i>that</i> should be written into the law.<p>For example, if you smoke pot, is it better for that to be legal, or\nillegal but most of the time cops won&#x27;t bust you for smoking a joint?<p>&gt; To me, it is hypothetical, because we still had a Capital riot even\nwith increased surveillance. After the riot, it didn&#x27;t take ubiquitous\nsurveillance to catch those people, they bragged about it in livestreams\non social media. We can do better with the capabilities we have.<p>Well, I&#x27;ll say this: the Capital riot is unprecedented in USA history and\nI think it will be a while before we can draw reliable conclusions from\nit.  It does seem to me that the problems with the response to it that\nday did not stem from insufficient information.<p>&gt; It seems intuitively correct to say that the NSA surveillance is\nimproving security, but (surprisingly) I don&#x27;t see strong evidence that\nthe programs are actually helping to catch terrorists. We&#x27;re giving\nadditional capabilities to people who aren&#x27;t leveraging or making good\nuse of the capabilities that they already have.<p>That&#x27;s kind of my point: rather than trying to sequester the technology\n(which I believe is impossible) we have to use it well, or we&#x27;ll fall\ninto some sort of dystopian system.<p>&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not a particularly good person (I do my best) and I like my privacy, but I think I would have to take that bargain.<p>&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t. To me, it sounds like a nonsensical comparison, it&#x27;s like\nasking whether or not I&#x27;d switch to eating only bugs to stop a\nkidnapping. I don&#x27;t believe that it would help, I don&#x27;t believe the\nbargain you&#x27;re proposing makes sense on an individual level. And as a\nwidescale solution to crime on the macro level, the consequences of\nconstant surveillance for everyone are worse than a kidnapping. It&#x27;s not\na good trade.<p>I wasn&#x27;t clear.  It&#x27;s not a trade.  You&#x27;re going to be livestreaming\nanyway, whether you like it or not, so do we <i>also</i> stop the kidnapping?\nThat&#x27;s the question.<p>I can&#x27;t find the news article now, but I was reading a few months ago\nabout this exact scenario:  A young child in China was kidnapped and the\nauthorities used the system there to locate and rescue the kid within a\nfew hours.<p>We in the West <i>could</i> do that too but if we don&#x27;t because we value\nour personal privacy over the occasional kidnapped kid, well, I&#x27;m no fan\nof the CCP but that doesn&#x27;t seem like a defensible moral position to me.<p>&gt; I do agree with you in one way, which is that regulation of this tech\nis not a perfect long-term solution. We need to figure out how to enforce\nregulations, and outside of the regulatory world we need adversarial\nresearch into the technology itself as well. Banning facial recognition\nwill not be enough, on its own, to solve the problem -- solving the\nproblem will require a combination of multiple solutions. But it is a\nproblem we should try to solve. Whether that&#x27;s by normalizing mask\nwearing, researching how to combat systems like gait detection, making it\neasier to detect cameras -- we should be thinking about how to give\npeople tools to hide from omnipresent facial recognition.<p>To me that just sounds like closing the barn door after the horse already\nbolted.  The technology is already deployed and more and more gets\ndeployed every day.  We should be talking about a universal\nhighest-common-denominator of laws for the planet so that the decreasing\ncost of asymptotically-prefect enforcement becomes a solution rather than\na problem!<p>That makes more sense to me than fighting it because the laws are crap\nand unevenly enforced.')
