They voted for him because he&#x27;s not Donald Trump.<p>Yeah, same here, but that&#x27;s because we live in progressive bubbles.  Dem voters chose Biden over many other candidates that progressives preferred.<p>&gt; We need better candidates who generate real support and appeal other than just not being their opponent. Not sure how to get there.<p>You cannot imagine someone actually liking Biden without being soft in the head.  And other people cannot imagine someone liking Trump without being racist.  But these assumptions prove nothing except lack of imagination.<p>People need to understand how heterogenous the US is...in every way.  We have to regain the ability to see the world from other people&#x27;s perspectives and extract the grain of truth from those perspectives.')
