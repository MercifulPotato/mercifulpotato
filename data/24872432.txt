I was not hired as remote employee. Was hired in CA. So lets say that I got 10,000 stock options (strike @ $1.00) that vests over 4 years. 3 of those years I have been in CA and 1 year in Texas.<p>Let&#x27;s assume my company goes IPO in 2024 (it&#x27;s a lottery, I understand), and assume each share is worth $10.00. Which means my 10,000 shares will be worth $100,000.<p>So I will owe tax on 7500 of those shares to CA? Because I&#x27;ve been there 3 out of those 4 years? That is ($10.00 - $1.00) * 7500 = $67500 of my income will be taxed by CA? And remaining amount will be taxed by Texas?<p>Even if I move to Puerto Rico, where there are no capital gains, I still owe CA taxes?')
