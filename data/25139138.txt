And the process and write ups are entertaining, but I understand some of the negativity. He comes off as peak tech bro, instead of talking about how he&#x27;s making the projects for fun or for learning everything is about monetizing or getting views on (admittedly!) poor quality hackathon projects. Dialing down some of the tech bro and the focus on making &quot;products&quot; and I believe the negativity would go away. It doesn&#x27;t help that his idea process seems to be &quot;what can I make that is like something else, but significantly worse&quot; :). I think it&#x27;s a great achievement in rapid development, however')
