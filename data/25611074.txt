Waking up, doing the same thing as the previous day, surviving, going to sleep, repeat... is uninspiring, and can feel soul crushing.<p>I even bought a shirt about it to have a memory of this time, a Nine Inch Nails shirt that just repeats the lyric “every day is exactly the same” over and over.<p>Anyway, what you’re feeling is normal.
