What about the thousands of sworn affidavits? Surely, ALL of them can&#x27;t be lying.<p>Proper investigations <i>were</i> conducted, and no serious issues found.  The lawsuits were laughed out of court, even by Republican judges.<p>Its surely possible that all those &quot;sworn affidavits&quot; can be wrong in some way: AFAIK, they were either bogus, irrelevant, or from people who didn&#x27;t understand what they were seeing because they hadn&#x27;t bothered to familiarize themselves with the vote counting process before they became election observers.<p>The more pertinent question is: how could anyone still believe those lawsuits could have merit at this point?  The sad answer is: <i>disinformation works</i>.')
