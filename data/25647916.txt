When you hit this is it:<p>a) moving to Preview (you can see the changes you made, but in preview mode not page view mode (the page tree won&#x27;t be visible)<p>b) browser returns to the &#x27;view page&#x27; (page tree visible), but your changes are not published (you may see a tag at the top &quot;UNPUBLISHED CHANGES&quot;)<p>c) something else (please describe)<p>Second question: what does the browser&#x27;s forward&#x2F;back buttons display after the &#x27;ctrl+S&#x27; result?')
