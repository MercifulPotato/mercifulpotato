It&#x27;s hard to imagine a court throwing out email evidence because it lacked a DKIM signature.<p>They&#x27;re more likely to ask their expert witness to testify about the evidence, and the deniability of the DKIM signature could be brought up by the expert witness as a reason to distrust the evidence.
