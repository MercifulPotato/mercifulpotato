That&#x27;s it. So now I&#x27;m writing in my own editor, in windows with nothing but the text - not even a menu or title bar - and literally not a single one of the features you list.<p>Some of it because I don&#x27;t want to focus on it while writing and&#x2F;or because it&#x27;s something my editor or proofreader handles (grammar and style correction, typography, selection by font, search &amp; replace of formatting, ebook export). Some of it because I&#x27;d rather pick and choose separate tools (name generators, backups, data integrity). Some because I&#x27;ve never had a use for it (pinboards, character databases beyond a folder of plain text files by name, snip management).<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not at all disputing that these features can be useful or essential for you. I just find it fascinating how different our expectations are.<p>There&#x27;s room for a lot of <i>very</i> different editors for the writers market, as people have very strong and contradictory ideas about what you need... The UI for Papyrus Autor looks like something I might have nightmares about, for example...')
