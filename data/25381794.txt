M1 offloads oodles of compute to hardware accelerators. No idea how their code interfaces with it, but I know lots of the demos involve easy-to-accellerate tasks like codecs and neural networks<p>that wouldn&#x27;t help in benchmarks, would it? Only in the most dishonest benchmarks would they compare x264 to a hardware h.264 encoder, for instance.')
