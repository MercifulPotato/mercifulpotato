There’s dozens of us! Dozens! My first job was at Wendy’s earning minimum wage, and during my tech career I’ve helped take 3 tech companies through IPO, with all 3 tickers still ticking away on the NYSE.<p>I like Kelsey’s spirit of “hustle” and pursuing what he’s passionate about. Totally agree. Find what connects with <i>you</i>; don’t simply try to fill other people’s shoes! I now work outside of tech entirely, because life is is full of endlessly fascinating things to pursue, and unfortunately life is far too short to try them all.')
