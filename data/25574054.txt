Several reasons:<p>- You weren&#x27;t using the actual FSD software, but the live production autopilot, so it&#x27;s Apples to Oranges.<p>- It&#x27;s not clear that the transition from low quality to high quality full self driving will be linear. Most claims around anecdotes come with an unspoken assumption we ought to see steady improvement over time vs a step-function like behavior. The latter seems somewhat possible given the nature of how improvements in AI systems seem to happen.<p>- Beyond all this, without understanding the underlying cause of the behavior you mention, it&#x27;s hard to say from a risk perspective if the car made the right choice. Unless you have a clear understanding of the data and mechanisms that led to the speed reduction, it&#x27;s hard to be sure it&#x27;s a bug beyond not doing such transitions in a way that are comfortable for passengers. (My understanding is adding smoothing to the control algorithm is somewhat separate from overall decisionmaking, and hence poor control algorithms may mislead you into thinking it&#x27;s more dangerous.)')
