If we don&#x27;t modify the constitution legally, how do you propose we do it? I am aware that the constitution doesn&#x27;t mean much of anything in the courts these days. But how is this different from the law of the west? The powerful make the rules with no accountability.<p>Historically, people have burned the government to the ground and started with a brand new document. I suppose that&#x27;s what most people are advocating when they wish to change the constitution in a way which it does not allow.<p>If not by law, how is it decided? Can I decide? I suppose I can if I become a supreme court justice or someone like Bill Gates.<p>The founding fathers certainly knew that the constitution would be hard to change - that&#x27;s the whole point. They saw what happened to past governments with wimpy foundations. I really can&#x27;t see the point of keeping the constitution at all if we are going to violate it due to &quot;current sentiments&quot; - it&#x27;s all a sham.<p>Perhaps they would have voted for becoming a state even without their 2 senators, but that seems far from certain to me. Like the American Revolution itself, I just can&#x27;t see Wyoming people sitting down and taking what&#x27;s given to them.<p>Of course, my predictions about the future of America are different from most. I think we&#x27;ve only just begun to hear the rumblings of a deep conflict. This election was not the climax, but the prologue.')
