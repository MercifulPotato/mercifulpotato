Well, should have been. I don&#x27;t know if they <i>actually</i> learned any lessons. ;)<p>In theory, they expected merging SD into the GCP UI to be straightforward, because they&#x27;re both Angular. In practice... Angular is a framework for inter-component communciation, not an SDK. And it&#x27;s not a profoundly opinionated framework---the way the two codebases use Angular is so wildly disjoint that a merging was basically impossible without a rewrite. They don&#x27;t even use the same date-time libraries.<p>One does wonder why they don&#x27;t give up on the unification model.')
