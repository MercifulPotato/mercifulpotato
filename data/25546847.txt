Here in the wet part of Oregon we go through about 50 pounds of bird food every 2 weeks. We have a feeder outside every window and they frequently have 5-10 birds each.<p>It&#x27;s great to be sitting at the desk coding and being able to look out and see a handful of birds attacking the feeder.<p>- 2-3 Flickers (I&#x27;ve seen at least a male and a female)<p>- 3-4 Acorn Woodpeckers often we get 2 per feeder and the other birds keep their distance.<p>- About 20 Stellar Jays. They stick around most of the year.<p>- Dozens of Junkos, House Finches, Chickadees, Silkens, Starlings, and Red-Winged Blackbirds.<p>It&#x27;s pretty crazy watching these little tiny birds get all belligerent at the feeder.')
