We follow Scrumban - something between Scrum and Kanban.\nWe have sprints, tickets, story points, daily standups, but it is humane.<p>Before sprint starts, tickets are estimated and assigned to developers. Each developer gets more-less the same amount of story points. Since the codebase is very big, if possible, a developer would get tickets related to his past tickets. A developer would own a certain feature of the system. We can trade tickets with each other. Usually, tickets are overestimated a little, but we are encouraged to adjust the story points of our tickets to match reality. In case of an urgent issue, anyone can add tickets to the ongoing sprint, but it is done sparingly. It&#x27;s okay if it takes two times longer to finish a ticket sometimes. It is also okay to say on standup that you didn&#x27;t make any progress on your tickets assuming you&#x27;ve been busy doing something else related to the project. If the ticket is big and the end of the sprint is close, the pull request would be merged at the beginning of the next sprint. Finally, the release can be delayed for a couple of days if necessary. Every third sprint is a tech sprint. The goal is to improve the system. Anyone can write a ticket and work on what he wants pretty much.<p>In conclusion, it&#x27;s about trust and being professional. The methodology is just a baseline that sets the tone. It should be followed for as long as it makes sense. There should be a clear goal. In our case, it is to have a stable system and a healthy workplace.')
