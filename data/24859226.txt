The increasing popularity of SUVs is one of the main reasons behind the rise in pedestrian deaths in the past decade. Given their bulk, they also cause slower traffic in general. Their popularity is a lose-lose for drivers (and everyone else trying to get around) at the end of the day.<p>I have mixed feelings about this car: on the one hand, it does give me hope that mainstream consumers who are attracted to trucks and SUVs will start to accept EVs as the standard, and the brand cache will accelerate EV adoption overall. It&#x27;s also a pretty darn cool car; they did a great job with their initial marketing. On the other hand, it&#x27;s going to suck to drive (or cycle, or walk) alongside people driving these vehicles. We&#x27;re going to be complaining about selfish Hummer drivers when we see these on the roads again based purely on their behavior as drivers, EV or not.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m hoping we start to see a more diverse mix of electric vehicles on the market, including new kinds of micromobility. The Biro (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biro.nl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biro.nl</a>) is apparently a very cool car to own among wealthier Europeans. I&#x27;ve heard of a couple electric motorcycle brands that are trying to copy Tesla&#x27;s playbook as a high end, prestige brand. More efficient delivery vehicles are desperately needed, too. But unfortunately, when other people drive SUVs, it makes it harder for you to drive these other vehicles safely and incentivizes you to drive an SUV, too.')
