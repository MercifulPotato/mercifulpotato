We still don&#x27;t know the exact mechanism of action of many commonly prescribed psychoactive medications. We know they work because, unlike in the past, we conduct rigorous studies, but we can only theorise as to why the work and why they don&#x27;t have the same effect in all patients. This has real implications for how medicine is practiced, which will undoubtedly make our methods look quite primitive to future generations. For instance, physiatrists are still forced into a &#x27;trial and error&#x27; approach when finding the correct antidepressant and dosage for each patient.')
