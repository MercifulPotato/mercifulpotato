After that change, it made it a lot more difficult to find the oldest commit in a large repo - frustrating.<p>That said, I think the percent of average ability internet users (ie. people visiting an ecommerce shop) will virtually never attempt to navigate by changing values in a query string param. High scores on a gaming forum, maybe more likely. Either way, if users need the ability to jump through pages, I would hope that would be exposed in a UI rather than expecting people to edit the URL directly.')
