Considering just one application, or one link, puts one at risk of arriving at a model that breaks these connections to other parts of mathematics. It seems unfair to expect to understand the why without considering the connections to Lie Groups, their associated geometries, differential forms, etc.<p>That said, I have some unpublished examples displaying and processing bvh (mocap) files that I&#x27;ll try to cleanup and put online.<p>&gt; Also is it possible to collapse a series of such transforms in a single versor like you can do with matrices without going into dual quaternion stuff? In generic game developemnt, translation, rotation, and non-uniform scaling are all extremely basic things that cannot be handwaved away or &quot;too big&quot;.<p>Versors combine just like matrices (using just the ordinary product). (doing this for translations&#x2F;rotations _are_ the dual quaternions, but you don&#x27;t have to (and imho shouldn&#x27;t) call them that.). Non-uniform scaling along your scenegraph (as opposed to in the beginning (object space) or at the end (view space)) is usually frowned upon in professional game development. (it makes it impossible to correct matrices using Gramm-Shmidt, and adds a lot of complexity to things like tracing hit rays etc).<p>&gt; Also, why the need o a dual(e12, e02, e01) to represent a point when in vector it&#x27;s just a (e0, e1, e2). This is just counterinuitive. This is what I mean by &quot;quickly gets complicated&quot; and it feels nearly as opaque as cross product in vector math.<p>This is because geometry and group theory are intricately connected. When you use matrices, you represent elements with vectors and transformations with matrices - they&#x27;re separate things. In Geometric Algebra, every element also _is_ a transformation. (a plane represents a reflection in that plane, a line represents a 180 degree rotation around that line, a point represents a point reflection in that point). So now there is a strong link. Whatever you use to represent reflections should also represent planes, same for rotations&#x2F;translations and lines, or point reflections and points.<p>It is in fact very intuitive and simple, its just different from what you&#x27;re used to. For example, in 2D, given a point at euclidean position (3,4), here are the two mindsets:<p>* classic : it is a sum of three times the &#x27;x&#x27; vector and 4 times the &#x27;y&#x27; vector. (and actually than add in &#x27;1&#x27; homogeneous vector). &#x27;3<i>x + 4</i>y + w&#x27; (in memory : 3,4,1 )<p>* GA : (3,4) is a system of equations. Namely &#x27;x=3&#x27; and &#x27;y=4&#x27;, or homogeneously : &#x27;x-3=0&#x27; and &#x27;y-4=0&#x27;. Such homogeneous linear equations are lines (in 2D), and represented by vectors : &#x27;e1-3<i>e0&#x27; and &#x27;e2-4</i>e0&#x27;, solving such a system of equations is just the outer product: &#x27;(e1-3<i>e0) ^ (e2 - 4</i>e0) = 3<i>e20 + 4</i>e01 + e12&#x27;. (in memory : 3,4,1)<p>so because it is on the bivector basis, this element (3<i>e20 + 4</i>e01 + e12) now represents both the point at (3,4) as well as a rotation of 180 degrees around that point. Just like the line (e1-3*e0) represents both the line `x=3` as well as a reflection w.r.t. that line. For the same reason the product of two lines will give you the rotation or translation between them and the product of two points will always give you the translation.<p>So I&#x27;d argue its a lot more intuitive, don&#x27;t factor out the time it took you to find the linear algebra approach intuitive.')
