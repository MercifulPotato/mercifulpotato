Item(by='zaroth', descendants=None, kids=[24773453], score=None, time=1602651290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770424, text='I don’t understand how engineers can read the actual text of the Question and think this is a good idea...<p>&gt; <i>shall be required to equip such vehicles with an inter-operable, standardized and open access platform across all of the manufacturer’s makes and models.</i><p>What is a “platform” in this context? The vehicle is supposed to be equipped with one, so presumably not a cloud server then?<p>Inter-operable with what? Other manufacturers? Standardized how and by whom? What does “open access” mean in this context?<p>Does this run on the car? In the cloud? How do you connect to it? Remember this is a legal requirement, not a spec that can just be revised.<p>&gt; <i>Such platform shall be capable of securely communicating all mechanical data emanating directly from the motor vehicle via direct data connection to the platform.</i><p>So I think this is saying that all mechanical data which is emanating from the vehicle must <i>also</i> be made available by connecting directly to “the platform” but you could read it two or three other ways.<p>&gt; <i>Such platform shall be directly accessible by the owner of the vehicle through a mobile-based application and, upon the authorization of the vehicle owner, all mechanical data shall be directly accessible by an independent repair facility</i><p>As supposed to the ODBII port which is the current standard, now we have a “mobile-based application” which the “owner” of the vehicle uses to <i>directly</i> access the “platform”.<p>I don’t know how the car is supposed to know who the owner is, let alone the original manufacturer of the car.<p>But then after somehow authenticating the owner on this mobile based application there’s also going to be a way to authorize your repair shop to do the same?<p>So perhaps repair shops are registered with this platform and I can select them from a list, or maybe after I’m magically authenticated I send them an email and they open that on their phone and click a link which send a message to an app which... wait what?<p>&gt; <i>limited to the time to complete the repair or for a period of time agreed to by the vehicle owner for the purposes of maintaining, diagnosing and repairing the motor vehicle.</i><p>Oh yeah and these access tokens are also time limited and revocable.<p>&gt; <i>Access shall include the ability to send commands to in-vehicle components if needed for purposes of maintenance, diagnostics and repair.</i><p>So I’m just not following at all the level of complexity here and the huge number of red flags on legislation which is trying to spell out a technical solution instead of just spelling out the <i>effect</i>.<p>We don’t need an open access inter-operable standardized data platform providing direct and delegatable remote control via mobile application to mechanical control systems. We really don’t.<p>I would be a lot happier if it simply said that manufacturers must provide documented vendor extensions to the ODBII port to cover any new data streams.')
