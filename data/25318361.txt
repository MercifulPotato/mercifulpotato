I&#x27;m quite sure there aren&#x27;t mental _illnesses_ which last 1-2 days like Stockholm syndrome does.<p>&gt;Suggesting everyone using C++ isn&#x27;t capable of properly evaluating it (which the comment author can clearly tell from the outside, for every use case) is &quot;not derogatory&quot;?<p>I see it more as &quot;I wonder if they have given other languages a chance?&quot;. There&#x27;s definitely a lot of C++ devs who aren&#x27;t giving for example Rust a try, and don&#x27;t see the negatives of C++ because they haven&#x27;t experienced anything else lately.<p>If anything, it was derogatory towards C++, not the devs.')
