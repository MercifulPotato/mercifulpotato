One of the two is an engineer, the other is a mathematician.<p>The researchers set up an experiment by putting a sink, an empty bucket and a waste paper bin in a small room. Then they set the bin on fire, and call the engineer in to see how he approaches the problem.<p>The engineer takes a quick look around, assesses the situation, and then takes the bucket, fills it with water at the sink, and pours it on the fire.<p>The experiment is then set up again and repeated, this time with the mathematician. Like the engineer, he quickly fills the bucket and puts out the fire.<p>Next, a slight variation is made to the experiment: it&#x27;s the same as before, <i>except</i> that the bucket is filled with water in advance.<p>As before, the engineer goes first. Upon seeing the fire, and the bucket full of water, he pours the water on the fire without hesitation, and all is well. The team nod to each other and mumble approvingly, writing the results on their clipboards.<p>Now it&#x27;s the mathematician&#x27;s turn again. The team resets the experiment and calls in the mathematician. He looks around at the situation, and sees the bucket of water, the sink and the burning bin. He then calmly picks up the bucket, pours the water down the sink, puts the bucket back down, and stands back. &quot;There you go&quot;, he says, &quot;done!&quot;.<p>The researchers look at him, and at each other in total bewilderment. &quot;What do you mean, &#x27;done&#x27;&quot; they ask, &quot;the bin is still on fire!&quot;.<p>&quot;Yes&quot;, says the mathematician, &quot;but I&#x27;ve reduced it to a previously solved problem.')
