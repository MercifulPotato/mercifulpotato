It&#x27;s like the way we started out with a million sea otters, killed all but five of them to make fancy hats, and then when a shark eats one of the last remaining females we say oh well what can we do about nature? Luckily in that particular case the species recovered somewhat, but there are lots of examples of animals that we&#x27;ve reduced to a handful of individuals that now face extinction due to &quot;natural cycles&quot;.')
