Chrome solved this problem with a change to the spec (which they called &quot;User activation v2&quot; [1]). It&#x27;s basically two flags and a short timeout, and it covers basically all cases. Safari&#x27;s approach means you have very specific codepaths, and if you do something async outside of that, tough luck, you can&#x27;t use the feature and will have to nag the user to touch the screen again. This already affects APIs like clipboard (want to copy something that takes async work to generate? tough luck), limits APIs like OffscreenCanvas (want to move your game engine to a worker? tough luck, you lose access to all user gestures), and this too. Hopefully Apple can consider aligning with Chrome on this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromestatus.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;5722065667620864" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromestatus.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;5722065667620864</a>')
