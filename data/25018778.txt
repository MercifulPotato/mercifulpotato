It&#x27;s a massive improvement even over the two-pole world, as a quick glance at the battle deaths over time graph [1] shows.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;6&#x2F;23&#x2F;8832311&#x2F;war-casualties-600-years" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;6&#x2F;23&#x2F;8832311&#x2F;war-casualties-600-yea...</a>')
