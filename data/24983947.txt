I do often encounter people with inflated opinions of modern medical understanding that does not match reality, so I am suspicious that your claims are not necessarily grounded in reality.  I&#x27;m also not interested enough in the topic to look into it in any detail.  I do agree that it isn&#x27;t necessarily impossible for a vaccine to cause lasting resistance even if direct exposure does not.')
