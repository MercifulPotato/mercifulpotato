But as far as I can tell, they only really got better when Aldi and Lidl seriously started taking market share.<p>Aldi and Lidl have a very German no-nonsense approach to advertising.  There&#x27;s a single simple price that you pay.<p>Similarly in the UK, the regulator always told off the retail banks for their bad behaviour, but they never really changed their tune much.  I am hoping that challengers like Monzo are changing that.  (I left the UK nearly three years ago, so I don&#x27;t know how retail banking has come along in the meantime.)<p>UK retail banks usually advertise that their accounts are &#x27;free&#x27;, but then have lots of hidden fees.  Monzo doesn&#x27;t have those hidden fees.  (Eg when you try to make a transfer when you are out of money, Monzo just fails your transfer.  My previous British retail banks charged you for that.  And they typically gave you an &#x27;unarranged overdraft&#x27; that you couldn&#x27;t decline.)<p>Keep in mind that these are two examples of the top of my head.  You can probably find more with a more scientific inquiry.<p>&gt; It seems to me that it mostly leads to a race to the bottom that just optimizes for hiding your dishonesty better.<p>Do you have any examples of that?<p>Competition usually leads to customers getting more of what they are willing to pay for.  Of course, that&#x27;s not always what customers say they want, if you ask them outright.<p>(Eg Starbucks sells well.  But what they are selling is not what people say they value in coffee.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call that dishonesty on Starbucks site.  People pay for having a spot with free wifi to idle or work while sipping some acceptable beverages.  People who go to Starbucks are not there to satisfy a distinguished taste in coffee.  But Starbucks advertisement compliments on their good taste, anyway.)')
