It depends entirely on what music services you use.<p>It’s quite possible to use Sonos speakers without an internet connection if you use something like AirPlay, a local NAS, or an audio in (e.g. TV or Record Player).<p>If you wanna use a streaming music service like Spotify, then obviously they need an internet connection. Unless of course you stream via your phone using AirPlay, but your phone will probably still need an internet connection.')
