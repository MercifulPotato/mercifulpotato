It&#x27;s just that violin really is a pretty difficult instrument. When people say it&#x27;s difficult, it doesn&#x27;t mean impossible. It means that goals are attainable through slow, steady, practice, investment (both time and money), and ultimately, drive, passion, and not expecting too much of yourself.<p>Being easy on myself is how I was able to get through 7 years of sounding bad. I had to sound unbearably bad in order to get here. and I am planning to sound bad for the foreseeable future until I get to my goals.<p>That&#x27;s the way of fret-less stringed instruments, and probably a lot of other things in life as well.')
