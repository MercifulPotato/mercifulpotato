It’s almost as if the client is executing the query locally on the client device.”<p>Of course, there are plenty of attacks on SGX (I’m not enough of a cryptographer to know how practical they are to apply to Signal’s methods or not); but at some level you are going to have to trust servers you don’t control, whether your system is federated or centralized. I’m mostly willing to give Moxie the benefit of the doubt here.')
