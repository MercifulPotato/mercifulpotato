IIRC it&#x27;s part of the Intel Graphics (built into the CPU) so maybe it&#x27;s not exactly fair to call QuickSync part of the CPU but it&#x27;s included in the physical CPU chip and I have no discrete graphics card in my server right now. I know I can get a GPU to offload decoding&#x2F;encoding to but QuickSync is pretty awesome for my use-case and buying a graphics card has it&#x27;s own issues (space in case, cost of card, getting it play nice with Plex in docker, etc).')
