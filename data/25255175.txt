They&#x27;re trying to apply methods to in-person learning to distance learning.

A big part of the grade was memorizing and performing these dialogs.  If you didn&#x27;t remember the dialog word for word, you&#x27;d get points off.

I took a trip to Japan a couple of years go, and did some brushing up for a couple of months before I left.  I learned more in those two months than I did in my entire time at school.')
