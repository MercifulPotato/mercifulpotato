Even if you return the favor, asking for ride to airport is reserved for very strong relationships!<p>I&#x27;m an American who never seems to be able to understand cultural norms. Is this a thing? Is driving people to the airport that big a deal? If I need a ride to the airport, I always just ask around. I am always ready to drive people to the airport (or anywhere) as I went without a car for  a few years and greatly appreciated every ride I got.')
