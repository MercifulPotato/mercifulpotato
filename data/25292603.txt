According to their website (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demonware.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demonware.net&#x2F;</a>)<p><i>We have a commitment to open source. Our core technologies are Python, Erlang, C++, and MySQL.</i><p>Epic Games has Epic Games services, which is a set of backend services that includes matchmaking, achievements, peer to peer networking, lobbies, etc.  Apparently Fortnite runs on Epic Games services.  Consoles and Steam have similar backends.<p>All of these backend services use variations on standard web stacks that, from what I can tell, don&#x27;t look radically different than the variance you&#x27;d see among startups or big tech.  Here is a postmortem of a Fortnite outage that talks about some of their tech stack, for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epicgames.com&#x2F;fortnite&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;news&#x2F;postmortem-of-service-outage-at-3-4m-ccu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epicgames.com&#x2F;fortnite&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;news&#x2F;postmortem-of-...</a>.  They use MongoDB, Java, JAXRS, Redis, AWS, etc.  All tech familiar to &quot;mainstream&quot; (web) software engineers.<p>One thing that is different is game clients (which are obviously real-time 3D engines), and specifically game servers, which are either peers or headless server versions of the game.  These run game sessions once matchmaking is resolved and connect to a fixed (usually 4-128) number of players in that given session.  Sometimes the backend and game server code is more tightly intertwined, for example in an MMORPG or a Destiny style &quot;shared world&quot; game where matchmaking happens on the fly based on the player&#x27;s location in the world.  There are a variety of services that will help manage hosting game servers (Multiplay, Playfab, etc.) but most of them end up running on &quot;standard&quot; Cloud compute providers (Azure, AWS, GCP).  Ultimately the only non &quot;mainstream&quot; thing about running large multiplayer games is the game engine piece.')
