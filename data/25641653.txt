I don&#x27;t live on the coasts, so prospects are already a bit more limited. I&#x27;ve spent the past decade more or less on a team of ~5 engineers as part of a ~10 person company.<p>I did interview at a different startup a couple years ago, which was I think around 100 employees at that point. They claimed to be very lean and quick on their feet, but I got the feeling that we were talking about different levels of volatility.<p>I suppose the thing that actually keeps me where I am is I have both a very long leash and a high degree of influence. Hard to level-set that against other positions I see listed.')
