Among a history of ToS violations, we finally had ones that weren&#x27;t muddy &amp; deniable, but represented a  bright line crossing in support of illegal action.<p>An argument could be made (especially &quot;securities fraud&quot;) that these platforms have their own legal liability in supporting these illegal actions because they allowed them <i>despite</i> violating their own ToS.<p>I&#x27;m sure there was some belief along the line of &quot;it&#x27;s the right thing to do&quot; as well. There was also probably some consideration that with Democrats having both Congress &amp; the White House their actions, among those in power, were less likely to be interpreted as too heavy handed. Ultimately though I think legal liability may have been the largest factor.')
