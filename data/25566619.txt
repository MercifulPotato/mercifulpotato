It baffled me, since I expected some of the early digital synths used in the original sessions should habe been rock solid 440 tuning.<p>And that’s how I learned about “tape stretch” where analog audio tape stretches just enough to make the pitch of everything a few cents lower over long period of time.<p>p.s. I ended up applying digital pitch correction, so I could “jam along” with my own synths :-)')
