As long as the US is the only source of key technologies, countries will continue to maintain a stockpile of USD so they can buy&#x2F;pay license fees. If another country develops an alternate ecosystem that&#x27;s equal in capability (looking at China) then you&#x27;ll see the collapse of the USD&#x27;s global value, especially if both sides start a price war.')
