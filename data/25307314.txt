Single thread ordering is not enough.  We need specific exclusive scheduling of critical sections and I don&#x27;t see how this system can understand that without just as much or more work as async&#x2F;await styles.<p>Perhaps we will get some new way to render UI out of this.  I&#x27;m excited to see what the UI team comes up with once it all works.  However, my pessimistic assumption is that we will simply stick with native non-premptive threading.')
