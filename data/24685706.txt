It would be fine if there was a recourse when getting kicked out of the platform.<p>This is similar to mail data on gmail, people are aware of the limitations, but are still pissed off when Google shuts down their account without any explanation.<p>Your point about DRM-free is another form of having a way out of the platform in case of dispute, but there could be other solutions as well I guess.')
