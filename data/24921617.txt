Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[24921822], score=None, time=1603906171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920098, text='what if you allocate on the stack?<p><pre><code>    {\n      something a_thing {};\n      ...;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIs a perfectly reasonable way to allocate something on the stack and have it unwound at the end of the block.  No pointers needed.  Perhaps I&#x27;m misunderstanding your argument.<p>`new`, much less `malloc` hardly ever need appear.  I&#x27;m working in a reasonably large code base that has four uses of new: three hidden in in internal graph node construction and one in a high-performance deserializer (actually that last is in the process of being replaced by code that simply requests pages from the OS).  There are very few cases where user code might allocate memory with `new` these days.<p>pooya13&#x27;s argument stands as well.')
