Learning is a gradual processâ€“I&#x27;m almost never embarrassed by the code I wrote in the past, but that&#x27;s not because that code is perfect; it&#x27;s just that I made the best choices I could at the time, and made sure to know enough to identify what I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> know back then. Embarrassment stems out of not knowing what you don&#x27;t know and acting on that.')
