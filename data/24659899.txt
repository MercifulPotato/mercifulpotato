China still has cases. So do ~all of the southeast Asian nations, Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The virus is endemic, and while these countries may have <i>controlled</i> it temporarily, they have not <i>eliminated</i> it. Save for perhaps Korea (and maybe China, but it&#x27;s not clear), most of these countries aren&#x27;t testing at high rates, so they don&#x27;t really know <i>what</i> is happening.<p>Unless you believe the virus is hiding out in cats, the only other logical conclusion is that it&#x27;s spreading asymptomatically, and they&#x27;re simply not detecting it until it pops up in a symptomatic way.')
