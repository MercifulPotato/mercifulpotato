It&#x27;s &quot;reasoned&quot;, and it&#x27;s easy to think that reason is everything worth thinking about. That is, after all, reasonable.<p>But a huge swath of human activity isn&#x27;t reasoned. A lot of human activity is spent just sitting around wondering what it all means, trying to live a &quot;good&quot; life, and wondering for that matter what &quot;good&quot; even means. Those are unscientific questions (or at least, we lack anything close to a science for discussing them), but it doesn&#x27;t make them unimportant.<p>Those are the questions the &quot;continentals&quot; are usually working on. In my opinion, they&#x27;re at their worst when they&#x27;re trying to sound analytical about it. The more rigorous they get, the more they make it clear that they&#x27;re actually pretty bad at rigor. Derrida is the most obvious example, and honestly I have only the word of his defenders that he&#x27;s somehow trying to undercut rationality rather than simply being a charlatan.<p>In the end I treat the continentals the way I treat fans of soccer: I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re having a good time and finding meaning in what you&#x27;re doing. That&#x27;s worth it. But I&#x27;m gonna get irritated if you insist that I must find meaning in it as well. Maybe I will, maybe I won&#x27;t, but the harder you insist the less interested I get.')
