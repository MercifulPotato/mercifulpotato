Some of those folks like to say it is anti-user or anti-customer.<p>I respectfully disagree. As an iOS user who interacts with android devices daily (and used to be primarily an android user, Moto 360 watch and all), I really like that it’s locked down.<p>Yes, there are things I can’t do, like run v8, or have a built-in IR blaster, or sell my attention.<p>What’s more important to me is what hostile actors (Google, AT&amp;T, Verizon) can’t do. My phone doesn’t get malware, it doesn’t show me notifications that can’t be dismissed (I don’t know how android users tolerate this), it doesn’t prevent me from removing apps like Facebook (also something android phones like to do), and it generally doesn’t let app developers get away with nonsense.<p>If anything, my biggest concern with the state of iOS is that it isn’t strict enough with the larger players. From the the business side of things there are some self-owns on Apple’s part that I won’t go into.<p>Tl;dr please stay the f<i></i>* away from my iPhone, I chose it for all the reasons you hate it.')
