The game has literally caused Sony to review their policies.<p>- CDProjekt worked on this game for 8 years, with employees crunching for several months in exchange for a share of the company&#x27;s yearly profits. It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the latter happened during a global pandemic.<p>- The game&#x27;s release was delayed several times, leading to more crunch.<p>- The game infamously failed to add seizure warnings at launch.<p>Other huge failures I can think of are Brink back in 2011 and No Man&#x27;s Sky more recently, but this is orders of magnitude worse.')
