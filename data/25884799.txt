It is indeed a compliment of untold proportions.<p>&gt;Then, anatomically modern humans did not start expanding millions of years ago. And most species do not have an innate fear of humans.<p>No other species has been called &quot;invasive&quot; after millions of years have passed. Look it up. Most apex predators do have an innate fear of humans:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;190717084243.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;190717084243.h...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;humans-predators-mountain-lions-landscape-of-fear&#x2F;594187&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;humans-p...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;animals.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;mammals&#x2F;fear-human-superpredator-carnivore-ecosystem.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;animals.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;mammals&#x2F;fear-human-superpr...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildlife.org&#x2F;human-presence-creates-fear-response-in-predators&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildlife.org&#x2F;human-presence-creates-fear-response-in...</a><p>The animals that don&#x27;t fear humans are located here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Island_tameness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Island_tameness</a><p>&gt;Preserving the environment is not a political agenda, it is an extension of our survival instinct. Just like food security is not treated as a politically charged topic because everyone can agree that they need food.<p>But talking about things that are clearly not true to serve your agenda is wrong. Humans are not invasive. We are destroying the environment through technological development not by being invasive.<p>&gt;Pretty much everything you said is a bunch of nonsense. I regret having read that. Clearly the educational system failed you. I do not have an agenda.<p>I&#x27;m a environmental biologist by trade, aka scientist. All I did was point out your mistaken attribution to humans being &quot;invasive.&quot;')
