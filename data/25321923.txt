In an alternate universe, he is working at Bing, producing code of identical quality. The economic outcome of this identical unit of labor output is dramatically different.<p>That difference is attributed to the company, not the laborer. Now whether that is because of “monopolistic forces” or because the company is truly “better managed” is up for debate.<p>So just because your labor is worth $X to your employer doesn’t mean all of it can be attributed to you. It would be inaccurate to believe that they owe you exactly $X, and anything less would be exploitation.')
