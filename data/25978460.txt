You write way less code, you have fewer things to keep track of, you need fewer abstractions, you can write everything in the most straightforward way possible and then extend only when necessary because refactoring is super safe.&quot;<p>What I _actually_ said was: &quot;F# is an extremely rigid language. It will not let junior developers take shortcuts, because you must write your code properly or it won&#x27;t compile. Your classes and functions must be written in the correct hierarchical order, you must cover every corner case. I know it&#x27;s going to be stressful or boring to be forced to do things right every time and never be able to just push some sloppy cowboy fix, but it&#x27;s a sacrifice we&#x27;re willing to make :)&quot;')
