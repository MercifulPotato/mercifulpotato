If media publications credulously publish explosive accusations in the month before an election then you have a very easy way for foreign entities to influence elections.<p>Even if you buy Bobulinski as a credible witness it&#x27;s difficult to discount the fact that his allegations have been deliberately timed to be as politically damaging for the election as possible, whilst giving the smallest amount of time to fact check his story. Specifically since the allegations could&#x27;ve been brought to light years ago. We don&#x27;t have to be credulous - we all know that the unsubstantiated accusations can be damaging even if they turn out to be utterly baseless (which is what seems to be the case given the lack of coroborating evidence).<p>To put this in context - the 2016 relevation of Hilary Clinton&#x27;s emails in the last weeks before the election coincided with a shift in the polls that pushed that election into a tossup, and when actually investigated, were found to be duplicates of emails that she had already been investigated for.<p>It seems natural given that we know about this dynamic, the reasonable thing is to raise your threshold for publishing accusations in the last weeks before an election.<p>If it is true that these accusations really are as damning as Bobulinski claims then they&#x27;ll be coroborated and investigations will start, and frankly we&#x27;ve got 3 months before Biden even takes office. But those should be real criminal investigations, not baseless accusations made in the 2 weeks before the election - or more reasonably, made at the time that Bobulinski claims these conversations took place over a year ago.')
