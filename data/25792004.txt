You could tell if the speaker is placed in a drastically bad place, ie it sounds bad everywhere, but you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell if the speaker sounds good where the listener is.  For that you need to put a microphone (which itself would need to be of relatively good quality) where the listeners ears are.<p>Even with measurements like that, it&#x27;s pretty nontrivial to compensate for it.  It&#x27;s technically a proven problem[1] (solvable for some convex shapes) but its a little more complex than just adjusting the volume or phase of a given frequency.  A room -and by extension all the little nooks and crannies of a room- acts as a resonator, and will gather and sustain notes.  You need to counter that sustain ahead of time.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hearing_the_shape_of_a_drum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hearing_the_shape_of_a_drum</a>')
