But &quot;higher salaries, better work conditions, more benefits, and similar things&quot; are usually part of left-wing political ideology too. \nSo for me there is no surprises and nothing new in unions sharing&#x2F;pushing &quot;sociopolitical ideas currently in vogue in left-wing political circles&quot;.<p>If i understand correctly your point (and to paraphrase), unions are not setting the correct priorities between work condition and more general sociopolitical ideas.\nFor me this is a good new : It mean works conditions are not that bad and that union want not just to take care of personal interest but of company interests as well. But this is a ideological stand point :)<p>And some may argue that&#x27;s not the role of unions. But the role of union is to carry the worker voices. If this is the subjects workers want to talk about, i don&#x27;t see any issue. If it&#x27;s not, the union will just not meet enough workers to join them.')
