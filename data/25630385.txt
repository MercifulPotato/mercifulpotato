I work for a large company and am a member of the union. While they&#x27;re not perfect they&#x27;re very constructive and provide a lot of benefits to all employees, and also to the company itself.<p>Compensation has become very complex over the years. While most people understand their pay the rest is usually where employers cheap out, things like insurance, sick pay, long-term provider care, pension contribution, tend to be worse for my friends who also work in IT but in non-unionized workforce.<p>I understand that in the US unions are often seen as a burden, rather than a constructive partner, so I hope this one will help to improve the image of all unions as well as improve live of Googlers.')
