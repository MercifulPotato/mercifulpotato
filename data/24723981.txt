Climbing is incredibly slow, swimming is slow and perilous, in some places such as the dark forest you can only enter&#x2F;exit in one place, not randomly, you can travel faster on roads.<p>I guess later in the game one doesn&#x27;t mind randomly walking right by the castle just because it is the shortest path, just going to eat some time dealing with each guardian of course.<p>Same for swimming across a the river twice around a bend rather than just following the coastline.<p>Also there are 226 waypoints, the linked map is missing a lot...<p>I am not sure what it is trying to show.  Was this the waypoints you had not done at the end of the game?')
