Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611321187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863668, text='&gt;Most people do - but don&#x27;t hesitate to put more value in your labour and look for other career opportunities. The world is pretty unjust at a basic level and if you&#x27;re waiting for someone to acknowledge your excellence and land a big payday in your lap you&#x27;ll be waiting for a long time.<p>It is also economically inefficient. If you are worth $100k&#x2F;y and you sell yourself for $50k&#x2F;y then you are basically doing charity for your company. If you really cared about charity you would ask for the higher salary and then donate the money yourself. What really happens is that you are keeping an economically inefficient company alive. That&#x27;s not just bad for you but also for the economy as a whole because your &quot;talents&quot; are being wasted.<p>&gt;Oh and we&#x27;re all super lucky to be in tech because in a lot of other fields there is just no way to advance yourself.<p>It&#x27;s the opposite. Low skill jobs are drying up. Most of them are going overseas. Getting a high skilled job is not luck, developed countries are restructuring their economies to specialize in high skilled jobs.')
