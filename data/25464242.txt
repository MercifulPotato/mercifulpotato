Lower the cost of labor and you lower the cost of the good that is provided.  Why not lower those costs to the minimum? &#x2F;s<p>Also, a wage laborer who opts out of the wage labor system will likely end up just as dead as a slave who tries to opt out of the slave system.  The &quot;voluntariness&quot; of wage labor isn&#x27;t quite the panacea is seems to be, when you realize many people are given the choice between one or more shitty jobs or no job at all.')
