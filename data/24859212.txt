How the hell did we ruin the web experience this much?<p>Looking back in the 90s, the web wasn&#x27;t the most pretty thing but how simple it was. You went to a news website and that was it. Click, read, the end.<p>These days however:<p>- Go to a news&#x2F;content website<p>- wait for the 40MB of useless CSS and JS &quot;minified&quot; crap \nto download.<p>- Agree with 2 or 3 huge popups to allow collect your data<p>- Get a new popup to make you disable your ad-blocker plugin. And if you disable it, you need to refresh the page all over again.<p>- Get a &quot;subscribe to our newsletter&quot; popup<p>- Get tracked by amazons, facebooks, etc...<p>- And once you finally click on an article.... get another popup to subscribe to their premium paid content...<p>Seriously, we broke the web, and now we are trying to fix it with putting more plugins and tools on top of this problem.
