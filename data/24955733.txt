The EU companies will have an easier time buying that tech than building their own.<p>This is analogous to banning airplanes until they can be proven safe to fly in. The countries that don’t ban them will lose more lives early on, but they’ll have a technological advantage. The place where this analogy breaks down is that hundreds of people are killed by human driven cars every day. Every year cars kill 120,000 people in the US &amp; Europe. If we can develop and deploy this technology a year sooner, we can save tens of thousands of lives.')
