Item(by='awinder', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1605549354, title='Tell HN: Dead and Hidden Posts Should Lock the Thread', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I (very, very stupidly) commented in a thread this morning that quickly got deaded and hidden. And yet as a connoisseur of oddball hackernews behaviors, I’ve checked back in to the thread and it looks like despite all of that, there’s a ton of active &amp; ongoing conversation going on in the subthreads of this supposedly dead comment.<p>It would appear that a dead and hidden post, one flagged by the community as not being up to snuff, can somehow become a honeypot for that very behavior. I’ve been here 7 years and this seems to be an emergent behavior, so I’m just here to tell HN it’s going on, I don’t think it’s good for the community, and maybe there’s something that could stop it.')
