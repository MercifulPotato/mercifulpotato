Working in Bevy is the first time I&#x27;ve made actual progress on my projects.<p>There&#x27;s something about the way the ECS framework is designed that just <i>works</i>. In particular the way the &quot;systems&quot; part of the ECS is automagically generated from regular old rust functions is just brilliant to me.<p>Aside from the ECS stuff, the WASM support is something else I&#x27;m pretty happy with. I can compile my game for native when I&#x27;m working on it locally, then when I want to show it off I can just `aws s3 cp` it up to a bucket and have people try it out in their browsers. The performance is still great there.')
