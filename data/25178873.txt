They believed that the USA was the frontrunner in technology but the Sputnik demonstrated that this may not be the case.<p>So from my understanding, the technology become a populist agenda as a result of that.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to watch old American movies like Rocky or Top Gun where the Soviets are portrayed as the more technologically advanced nation but Americans prevail thanks to their spirit and courage.<p>Maybe after the collapse of the Soviet Union, science and technology  got a pushback in popular culture? \nWhen you come to the end of the 90&#x27;s and the beginning of the 2000&#x27;s you have movies like Fight Club and Matrix denounce technology as the destroyer of the society or humanity.  You even have Lord of the Rings trilogy that tells an epic story about an industrialist who dares to start a mass production and tech research, meritocracy instead of race but &quot;the good guys&quot; are those who are deeply involved keeping the world as-is for thousands of years and value separation between races, masters and servants.<p>And what we have now? Red pills, blue pills, black pills from the Matrix, quest to restore the manliness from Fight Club, race separation, leader worship and and looking down to technology and multiculturalism from Lord of the Rings. Half Joke, half serious of course :)')
