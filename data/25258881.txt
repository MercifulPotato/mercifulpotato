I&#x27;m very, very impressed by these results, but that still doesn&#x27;t mean that we just solved biology. If this works that well on folding, this could mean that a lot of other stuff that simply didn&#x27;t work well in silico might come into reach.<p>I&#x27;m maybe overcompensating for the tech-centric population here, with some comments speculating for very near and drastic impacts from discoveries like this. Biology and life sciences are much slower, and there&#x27;s always more complexity below every breakthrough. That does tend to push me towards commenting with the more skeptical and sober view here.')
