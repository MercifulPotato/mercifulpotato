You can look at analytics and comments to see which of your posts are popular, but nobody ever says, &quot;Oh, this post would have worked better had your sentence structure been less repetitive.&quot;<p>I solved this problem by hiring a freelance editor from Upwork.[0] It was a few hundred dollars to have her read a few of my articles. The high-level feedback was extremely helpful and had a huge impact on my readership almost instantly.<p>Obviously, it&#x27;s not a magic bullet. I still had to do the work of integrating her feedback and continuing to find ways to improve my writing.
