The political spectrum is a circle. The far left and right are flavors of the same thing, loud and utterly intolerant of anyone not like themselves.<p>The far right will tell you about their intolerance to your face, the individualistic version of intolerance. Like an asshole neighbor. The far left will make endless laws and rules, using the power of group norms to attack you. Like a shitty HOA.<p>Both I find insufferable. I wish US politics would turn back towards the center. I blame social media AI bubbles for segregating everyone into their own world where there&#x27;s nobody with an opposite opinion to temper absolutism')
