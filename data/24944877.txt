It may be my &quot;reach&quot; as others have stated. I like pushing out the small tutorials that I write, but I just can&#x27;t justify 3 hours (ish) of work for &lt; $1.50&#x2F;mo<p>I also don&#x27;t want to have to buy a domain and have a hosting service to push my own site having to load it up with ads or other nonsense just to make a side hustle possible. So I stick with Medium.')
