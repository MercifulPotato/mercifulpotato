Item(by='stale2002', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603833731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905101, text='&gt; &quot;Few economists doubt that Marx flunked economics&quot;<p>So you do not refute this statement?<p>I using this source to reference the opinions of economists.<p>This is what economists believe.<p>The rest of the blog post makes no other references to what economists actually believe.<p>I am merely using the source to explain to you, what the general opinion of economists is.  (even though the author disagrees with the opinion of economists)<p>The person in the blog post (Samuel Bowles) is literally a Marxian.  So yes, I do know that a Marxian believes in Marxian economics.<p>But I am using this source, because <i>even</i> a Marxian is willing to admit that basically all economists think that Marx was bunk.<p>Even a supporter of Marxian economics is aware that his opinions are fringe, and that the rest of academia disagrees with him.<p>Which is why I am using him as a source.  Because even though he gives arguments in favor of Marx being relevant, he is willing to admit that all of his fellows in academia, disagree with him.<p>&gt; it looks like the best source you can muster for your claims is making substantively exactly the same argument I&#x27;m making<p>The source that I am showing, is by a Marxian economist who admits that he is in the extreme minority position, and that everyone disagrees with him.<p>This absolutely supports my point.  Even a strong supporters of Marxian economics is saying that everyone disagrees with him, and that he is fringe.')
