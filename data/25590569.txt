I stumble a lot over complaints like these in the enterprise company I am working for and truth to be told, I voiced many of these before myself.<p>Problems I see:<p>- What is the business problem the author is trying to solve? How does a tool - Python - can help do specifically do what better?<p>- There are no specific measurements mentioned. How big is the data the author mentioned, how long does an analysis cycle take, how large are the teams, the affected people? What about maintaining the software stack? How many requests are there per year?<p>-What about cost savings? How could they help us compete with other companies?\nLead cycles of even weeks may bother a developer but not the business.<p>It is not that I don&#x27;t believe his suggestions. It is just that I don&#x27;t get to the point other than &quot;my favorite tool could do it, too.&quot; We could easily substitute Python with R, for example.<p>&quot;The spreadsheet took 30+ seconds to open&quot; I know this is an annoyance, but how often do you open it? One time a day? 20 times an hour?<p>&quot;The new model logic is testable and can be upgraded independently&quot; this is one of the most valuable points here, as long as you work in a larger environment. So context is needed here as well.<p>I know a colleague of mine who is extremely well versed in Excel who has put a decent amount of magic into her sheets. However, even losing her and starting all over again is from a business perspective way cheaper than trying to put her solution behind a cloud service.<p>It would be fun, to have a conversation with the author.')
