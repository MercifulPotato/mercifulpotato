With regular line and shape tools I end up obsessing over geometric precision and symmetry, with excalidraw it’s impossible to create “perfect” drawings, so I don’t worry about it (within reason). I wonder if this phenomenon has been named or observed in UX&#x2F;game design because it’s so darn effective at making me productive when drawing.')
