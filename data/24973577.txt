I had used (and abandoned) a free zoho account like almost 10 year ago...but then read the following post, which re-interested me in zoho (though now via a paid account): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevq.uk&#x2F;reasons-why-zoho-mail-is-better-than-gmail&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevq.uk&#x2F;reasons-why-zoho-mail-is-better-than-gmail&#x2F;</a><p>So far, a few months into my experiment, zoho is really working great!  For a single-person approach, zoho&#x27;s cost is really difficult to compete with; you&#x27;re looking at $1&#x2F;month, plus the annual cost of a domain name...which of course is not free, and to your point could add up if need more accounts (for family members, etc.)...But considering other options, it could be something worth considering.')
