If it turns out there are no stores ok with it, whose problem is that? Should store owners be prohibited from refusing service to anyone, no matter what their behaviour?<p>You can start your own store, so long as you can pay rent, have suppliers that will sell you goods, etc - but again, no one is obligated to do any of that.<p>(I get there&#x27;s protected classes that prevent discrimination based on things like age, gender, ethnicity, etc, but that&#x27;s a separate issue, and tangential to their behaviour which is what we&#x27;re discussing here.)')
