It reminds me of a similar approach I did when I still commuted to work: putting the sticky notes directly on the laptop.<p>At the end of the day, I’d put the laptop in my backpack, and the sticky notes would get crumpled, so I would have to write new ones for the following day. It didn’t work as well, though, because I’d occasionally lose sticky notes, and forget what I did yesterday.')
