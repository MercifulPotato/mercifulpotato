In recent years, people have broadened the definition to include ideas not present in the original formulation, including lack of skill, expedient hacking, and obliviousness to software architecture. By lumping these together, itâ€™s harder to choose the right repair. This article proposes that we use the term ur-technical debt to refer to the original idea, which was: When I build systems iteratively, my understanding of the problem and solution grow gradually, and inevitably my current thoughts do not match code I wrote earlier, so I must expend effort to fix that code, much like paying interest on a debt.\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;9121630" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;9121630</a>.
