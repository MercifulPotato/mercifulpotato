Item(by='cafxx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610423444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733060, text='&gt; Few people care to repair Android phones because you can&#x27;t upgrade the OS after 2 years regardless.<p>I sincerely hope the EU will actually do something about that as well. As you point out, it makes no sense to allow to repair something that receives no support for its software components.<p>What I hope they will do is actually mandating that, if an item is sold as having networking capabilities, the manufacturer is required to maintain (as in, provide security updates for) the software required for the item to continue working as sold, at least for the intended lifetime of the item (that should be explicitly stated by the manufacturer). Maybe exceptions could be granted - after a minimum period of mandatory first-party support - if all code required to build the firmware was open sourced.')
