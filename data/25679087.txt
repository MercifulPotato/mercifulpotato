As far as I can tell, mbsync doesn&#x27;t do this.<p>I haven&#x27;t found a single other program that does this well; there are tools to sync entire directory trees that can idle, but they don&#x27;t seem to support &quot;download everything and delete it&quot; the way fetchmail does.<p>Many e-mail services throttle new connections, so it&#x27;s not the difference between getting your mail now and 1 minute from now, it&#x27;s the difference between getting your mail now and 5-10 minutes from now.<p>[edit]<p>Another thing keeping me on fetchmail; I have all my filters setup with maildrop.  Most other programs want to deliver to a local folder directly.  Maybe there&#x27;s a way around this?')
