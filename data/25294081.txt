I always thought it&#x27;s legal, but not a hundred percent legal. I mean, you can&#x27;t walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffing away. You&#x27;re only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.<p>I was under the impression: it&#x27;s legal to buy it, it&#x27;s legal to own it, and if you&#x27;re the proprietor of a hash bar, it&#x27;s legal to sell it. It&#x27;s legal to carry it, but if you get stopped by the cops in Amsterdam, it&#x27;s illegal for them to search you.<p>Am I just misled for the last 25 years?')
