Wolves don&#x27;t just attack once and leave. They come back.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s not livestock. Many have horses or donkeys, or goats and sheep that they don&#x27;t turn into meat.<p>Also it&#x27;s about the rights of your own land. If wolves kill the lives you take care of, they cannot be allowed to continue. The fact they are killing your animals means they&#x27;re not finding other prey and are overpopulated at that location.')
