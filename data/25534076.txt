I really <i>liked</i> that Evernote could be a shoebox where I put all my random PDFs, receipts, user manuals, etc, alongside a smaller number of evergreen notes.<p>I haven&#x27;t found that same shoebox aspect to Notion, which I think is by design, because people believe it to be an antipattern. But every time I want to save something, it needs to be need in some kind of database or as a subdocument to another document, and that&#x27;s just not how I think of those things.')
