These diseases are <i>extremely</i> contagious and <i>extremely</i> persistent in the environment.  And no mask (not even N95) will help for these.<p>Covid19 basically requires virus in water droplets to transmit.  Consequently, it requires close contact and time to transmit.  So, yes, it transmits through the air but isn&#x27;t an &quot;airborne&quot; disease as the water droplets seem to be a required vector.<p>This is why even simple masks are quite effective against Covid19, because it requires water droplets to spread.<p>Thus we have anecdata like this:<p>&quot;Starbucks outbreak infects 27 customers but spares mask-wearing employees&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19data.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;starbucks-outbreak-infects-27-customers-but-spares-mask-wearing-employees&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19data.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;starbucks-outbreak-infect...</a>')
