Note, this meant as a honest question.<p>I think it&#x27;s just simple to enforce and has very limited downside. We want people wearing them in public closed spaces because that&#x27;s were they help the most and we don&#x27;t necessarily care if they were them outside but the inconvenience of doing so is fairly minor. So the simplest way to enforce this is if everyone has to wear them to go outside of their home.<p>&gt; Some research on current evidence was published in Science last month[1]. With the exception of some specific &quot;job related&quot; events (like meat packing plants) or public gatherings, most of the transmission is in fact in the household.<p>Thanks for the article.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve seen this a few times, but as far as I can see the current data are absolutely inconsistent. And the largest contact tracing study from India (recently published) was done with closed schools, so no information from there either.<p>I intentionally phrased as being an assumption as I don&#x27;t have the hard data to back it up yet. It&#x27;s based on the spike of cases observed here in Europe after the return to schools, in Belgium (for example) the french-speaking side went to school one week before the dutch-speaking side of the country.The dutch-speaking side is lagging in cases for roughly that amount.')
