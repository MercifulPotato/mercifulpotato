Former means there&#x27;s not much of a second-hand market, the latter means that even giving away for free is too much work compared to just dumping it.<p>I&#x27;m very much surprised about the amount of comments here on HN (today and in many previous discussions) that claim to reuse IKEA furniture; it&#x27;s completely contrary to my experience. My opinion of IKEA furniture is that it&#x27;s single-assembly - trying to break it apart irreparably destroys it.<p>I conclude there must be either high variance in IKEA&#x27;s production quality, or we&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges. Maybe some IKEA products have more reassembly potential than others. Someone mentioned an office chair elsewhere in the thread - yeah, that obviously can last years and be moved, because it&#x27;s made of metal and hard plastics. But most IKEA furniture I experienced is made of dried toilet paper glued with formaldehyde^W^W^W^W^W^Wmedium-density fibreboard and assembles destructively.')
