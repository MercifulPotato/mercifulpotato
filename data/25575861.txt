Item(by='Twisol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609281101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575800, text='&gt; as a result, seeing how eliminating state is far from the only way to tame it.<p>I agree! Elimination is but an extreme form of control :)<p>I have strong hopes that logic programming will provide the next generation of formal tools for controlling (rather than eliminating) state. My ideal paradigm would be &quot;logical shell, functional core&quot; (swapping out &quot;imperative shell&quot;). But logical methods are (a) unknown, (b) niche, and (c) overshadowed by the barest treatment students receive of Prolog, so there&#x27;s still a long way to go here.<p>(FWIW, I think of things like LVars, CRDTs, and distributed protocols more broadly as having a fundamentally logical flavor. See the recent CALM Theorem for more on that.)<p>(EDIT: Here&#x27;s a very recent comment I made where I dig a bit more into those logical items. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25567740" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25567740</a>)')
