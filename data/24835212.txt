Much to say there are no riots on the streets and society has not even come close to collapse. (Everyone from the president to schoolkids makes fun of the utility on Twitter) People just make fun of the fact that they have to BBQ more often than not and change diets slightly to account for the lack of constant refrigeration. More people have invested in solar solutions for creature comforts like lights and such.<p>Moral of the story is, people have just become a wee bit less reliant on the energy grid. Renewable sector is booming too.<p>So I&#x27;ll just stop right here. Because some humans have clearly forgotten the human race has existed for millenia without electricity.')
