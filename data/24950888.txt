And sure, maybe it&#x27;s more comfortable to go into denial about what really has been happening over the past two decades, but why settle for comfortable denial when you can embrace the whole truth and feel happy? Feel happy that you&#x27;re where you are, and they&#x27;re where they are. We&#x27;re so lucky to have been randomly born in such good circumstances. Think about it. We might have been randomly born in Yemen, and in that case we would have been thoroughly fucked. Do you feel happy? There are a lot of people suffering right now for our benefit. It would be wasteful to feel anything but joy.')
