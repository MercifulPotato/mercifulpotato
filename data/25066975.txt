Google music worked, YouTube music is horrible. I&#x27;m back to using an mp3 player of sorts. I bought a JellyPro, disabled all apps apart from a music player and added some automation via magisk to turn on airplane mode when it&#x27;s not plugged in, and turn the device of after an hour &quot;idle&quot; (not playing music, not plugged in). Best damn mp3 player ever. I get wifi sync, album art download, tag editor, last.fm scrobbling (caches tracks while airplane mode is on) and with the modifications I made, crazy battery life (especially considering how poor the jelly Pro battery is)<p>These days a 200gb sdcard is dirt cheap, so I can fit my entire collection on it.')
