It&#x27;s a corporation you can walk away from it.<p>The risk narrative is the current preferred reason to justify gross inequality caused by power imbalances.<p>It ignores that every participant is taking a risk. It&#x27;s just some manufactured narrative designed so that we&#x27;d think &quot;well alright&quot; and not question the unjustifiable disproportionate gross inequity of all the reward going to those with the smallest risk because of how structural power works.<p>The lowest wage worker living paycheck to paycheck has wayyyy more risk exposure than someone like me who has skated by trivially without a paycheck for over a year. The idea that my investment portfolio entitles me to the profits because of some immense risk I&#x27;m taking is clearly totally manufactured  bullshit that&#x27;s used to shape public opinion.<p>I could lose every penny without affecting my quality of life at all. Literally zero effect. The risk is purely abstract. It&#x27;s not material in the slightest')
