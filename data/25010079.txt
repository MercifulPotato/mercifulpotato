In the first few months, it was perfect because I could reach around her and still type on the keyboard.  It also makes traveling with the baby a lot easier because you have your hands free for luggage and whatnot.<p>It was also great exercise to wear the baby while doing physical activity.  I once carried her through the streets and museums of Paris for an entire day, and was barely sore.<p>If you&#x27;re a mom or dad I highly encourage it.  In fact, it&#x27;s a great way for dad to help out while mom&#x27;s body recovers from birth.')
