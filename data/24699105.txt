Our tech sector has been strong and growing for several decades - locally we have Epic Systems, Exact Sciences, Promega Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific, several large insurance companies like American Family Insurance, Sentry Insurance.  It might be easy to miss the agglomeration of these companies in one area because some of them are technically in different municipalities than the City of Madison.  But it&#x27;s a great area, and most of the big players here have been spared or even strengthened by the unique circumstances of the pandemic.')
