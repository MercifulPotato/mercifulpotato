Especially given the major shortcomings in UI? The architecture transition will destroy Microsoft&#x27;s compatibility advantage.<p>Why not hedge with a really well supported Linux Desktop alternative they personally&#x2F;collectively fund and push... personally I think that&#x27;s corporate malfeasance given the scale of revenue to not pursue. Or a BeOS.<p>The architecture switch will probably limit the hardware that needs support. A linux-based or at least OSS_based x86 emulation somewhat on par with Rosetta will be a critical component as well.')
