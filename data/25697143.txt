Also a true statement, but ridiculous.<p>The BLM riots resulted in 19 dead, and thousands of properties damaged. It&#x27;s equivalently true to say &quot;Trump protests&#x2F;rallies are mostly non-violent&quot;, since the majority of them (probably rivalling the 96% in the article you mention) have had few issues with violence until the recent insurrection. But that would just be a vacuous talking point.')
