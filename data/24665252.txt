In most investment classes, being top quartile across funds is basically uncorrelated. So good VCs tend to be reliably good and not good just because of pure chance.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.morganstanley.com&#x2F;im&#x2F;publication&#x2F;insights&#x2F;articles&#x2F;articles_publictoprivateequityintheusalongtermlook_us.pdf?1596549853128" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.morganstanley.com&#x2F;im&#x2F;publication&#x2F;insights&#x2F;articl...</a> (p 51)<p>&gt; The fundamental randomness is so high here that any ranking a VC made would likely be garbage<p>A ranking doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, just better than random. E.g. let&#x27;s say you give me a bunch of companies and ask me to rank them, and I put 60% of the actual top 1% and 40% of the next 1% into my top 1%. I&#x27;m making mistakes, but that&#x27;s still pretty good. As long as I&#x27;m directionally right on average, I should do well on the investing side.')
