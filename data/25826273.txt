Of course you may end up wasting your time with a new report – unless you include closed issues in your search.<p>For example, a closed-resolved issue could mean there’s a known workaround, which the user needs to apply.\nIn that case, you have to look at that workaround to solve the issue for you personally. If you miss that closed issue and report it again, you’re going to waste your time, no matter the semantics of “closed.”')
