I&#x27;m not sure about how it works on PS4 but on Switch games just use NVDEC like a PC with Nvidia hardware would and the functionality is exposed in the SDK. You can use h.264, h.265, VP8, and VP9 (the hardware supports more but it&#x27;s not exposed).<p>When Bink was released and the PS2 and Gamecube were on the horizon this kind of thinking was needed. When you get to PS4&#x2F;Switch you&#x27;re just running consumer PCs. The exact same Nvidia SoC used in the Switch is actually used by Nvidia for their Shield Android TV boxes whose literal purpose is to play audio&#x2F;video streams - it&#x27;s quite capable of doing so.')
