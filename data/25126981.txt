The actors are either irrelevant or continuous and unambiguously implied.<p>In the example we&#x27;d have to keep referring to &#x27;Hemingway&#x27; or &#x27;the application&#x27; in order to maintain active voice, which adds no value.  E.g. &#x27;Hemingway marks phrases green to show passive voice&#x27;<p>Passive voice allows us to switch focus to the object that is being acted upon, which is much more relevant.')
