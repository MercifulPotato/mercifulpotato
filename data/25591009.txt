The whole app is pretty slow on lower end hardware, they even recommend having an SSD which my travel laptop which I tested it on doesn&#x27;t have.<p>That&#x27;s when I thought I should look for a web based solution because that would also solve acessing and managing the lib from multiple devices, and now there&#x27;s this post here. I guess before making another switch I should check out other solutions too and compare their feature matrix and how well those work. With digikam I noticed that it seems to overfit once you tagged a couple hundred faces of the same person, for example, and is less likely to identify that person in new photos.')
