In several flu seasons, hospitals have been overwhelmed, tent beds set up, etc, and most people don&#x27;t care because the flu is &#x27;normal&#x27;. COVID is becoming &#x27;normal&#x27;, which is good, because it&#x27;s not going away, so we all need to learn to deal with it.<p>This is like accusing those in the 50s for being apathetic about polio, because they didn&#x27;t upend their entire life to protect their children from this incredibly deadly and disfiguring disease. When humans are confronted with a problem they simply cannot meaningfully prevent, they tend to ignore it and get on with their lives.')
