Buying a $1M condo for $2M costs you a 50% of your ill gotten gains, and there is still risk of seizure.<p>At those costs there are far cheaper routes for laundering your money.<p>So what’s occasionally  happening is that Chinese trying to escape the control of the PRC dictatorship send money to a trusted expatriate, sometimes a student, and tell them to pay up to $X for a property at market prices. Naturally this can lead to paying slightly over market because the proxy isn’t motivated to negotiate, or often equipped to.<p>If I price my home at $1M when it’s worth $950k, they’ll pay the $1M. But they aren’t offering me $1.4M. And it’s questionable what the specific market price really is at any moment.<p>My friend recently bought a home for $605k that was listed at $599k. He got an early preview the day before it’s initial open house. That night He made a full cash offer at $6k over ask that expired the moment the open house started. The buyer accepted 15 minutes before expiration.<p>Did he overpay? The buyers received over a half dozen backup offers during the open house, some as high as $30k over ask.')
