Item(by='vmarsy', descendants=None, kids=[25388877, 25389860], score=None, time=1607710344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388334, text='&gt; Ugly - Alot of owners now are pulling a perfectly legal scam of listing a place at a certain price point and then charging an extremely high cleaning fee. When booking it, you are then shocked by the extreme fees, one place (5 days stay) was charging $400 for their cleaning fee.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow here, the cleaning fee is announced <i>before</i> you confirm the booking isn&#x27;t it?\nIn a way it&#x27;s similar to airlines having cheap tickets to then adding seat-choosing fee, bagage fee, etc. The initial low price is slightly deceptive to appear cheaper on aggregators, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Here the &quot;scam&quot; is they use same deceptive practice to appear cheaper on the Airbnb map?<p>For any serious booking, people explore their options and open a few tabs of different listings to pick, since they have to check other things (smoker&#x2F;non-smoker, pets&#x2F;no pets, etc). The cleaning fee for the trip is listed there.<p>Some owners  prefer long term stays, so putting a flat higher cleaning fee is a good mechanism to incentivise longer stays imo, as yes, cleaning is time consuming.<p>Maybe the Map itself could improve to show the total price for the trip instead of base-rate-per-night.')
