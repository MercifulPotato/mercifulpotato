To me this seems like a well-intended idea from the UK but it&#x27;s not how reality works. I would even go so far and argue that people develop and engage in extremist views only once they have actually broken ties to any &#x27;normal&#x27; people. That said, all documentaries I remember watching about the topic, e.g. the people who did the 9&#x2F;11 attacks, they were basically living solitude lives, and extremists were welcoming them with open arms.')
