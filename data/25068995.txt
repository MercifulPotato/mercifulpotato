You&#x27;d then &quot;rediscover&quot; and reclaim it a year later when the game needs to ship but no longer can fit in a memory.<p>That is, any sort of astonishing improvements is often a sign of the original version being crappy, so it&#x27;s also a red flag even if it&#x27;s ultimately the good news.')
