I&#x27;ve seen that argument before and it requires basically brainwashing that a particular government (the US, if we&#x27;re being honest) is offering <i>sooo</i> much infrastructure that was <i>required</i> to make a profit. &quot;Roads, schools, and such an <i>amaaaazing</i> court system&quot;. And that&#x27;s just not true to domestic and heavily international business, and even if it was there would be a diminishing return that this argument doesn&#x27;t even begin to account for.')
