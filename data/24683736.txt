That says more about the codebase than it does of the dev reading it.<p><pre><code>  &gt; especially given what&#x27;s happened to the &quot;average \n  &gt; programmer&quot; over time\n</code></pre>\nAnd what, indeed, has happened to the &quot;average programmer&quot; over time? From my view, more people today are making computers do new things than ever before; from &quot;secretaries&quot; (oof, that term) maintaining excel spreadsheets that run entire small businesses, to bootcamp graduates who can (with a little guidance) ship fully functional MVPs to prove a line of business.<p>If something&#x27;s beyond the skillset of a newer developer that&#x27;s reasonable, but the goal should be to continually make that <i>not the case.</i>')
