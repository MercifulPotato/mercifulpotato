Forms.io gives you the form schema in such a scenario as JSON out of the box. That gets matched with answers as JSON.<p>Saving this to MongoDB directly, rather than SQL seems to simplify things.<p>With anything else, at the end of the day, you are enforcing FK constraints anyway, so might as well use SQL.<p>I never had issues with MongoDB performance.<p>One caveat to this is that I am yet to see a project that needs database sharding in real life, and I have worked on projects with millions of entries in a table and hundreds of writes a minute.')
