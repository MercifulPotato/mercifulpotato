(It’s the reason I’m on HN rather than working right now.)<p>- I get up at 5am to do some early work.<p>- Work laptop (Win10) is still connected to the VPN from yesterday. Cool.<p>- Try to connect to drive. No dice. Try same drive in SharePoint. Failed auth. Reconnect VPN. Same. Oh well, guess I’ll reboot.<p>- Reboot. Go to make coffee.<p>- Come back to black screen. Ah yes, that’s right. If I reboot and McAfee drive encryption has kicked in, <i>and</i> I’m plugged in to my USB-C monitor, all screens are just black. The solution is to...<p>- ...pull the monitor cable, power down the laptop, power it back up, authenticate with McAfee, plug the monitor in, let Windows start, check HN, reply to this post.<p>I know this latter half isn’t Windows’ fault, strictly speaking. But it’s the Wintel laptop’s fault and that’s all the same to me. I <i>hate</i> using Windows. It’s easily the thing I dislike most about my job.<p>Let’s just try my Mac over here, hang on.
