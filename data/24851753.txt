They&#x27;re either &quot;the only&quot; (no &quot;one of&quot;) venomous mammal because there are no others, or there are others in which case they&#x27;re &quot;one of the few&quot; or &quot;one of the many&quot; depending how many others there are.<p>At any rate, there are a bunch of search results for &quot;one of the only&quot; saying it&#x27;s a neologism with the same meaning as &quot;one of the few&quot;. So we&#x27;re probably stuck with it now, just like we&#x27;re stuck with &quot;begs the question&quot; used to mean &quot;raise the question&quot; and &quot;two times longer&quot; used to mean &quot;two times as long&quot;.')
