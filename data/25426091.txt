All of these skills are useful in &quot;real life&quot; programming.<p>However, since the code you write will be thrown away post-competition, your focus is on churning out solutions that &quot;just work&quot; — proper engineering practices and maintainability isn&#x27;t relevant. All your code needs to do is to generate the correct outputs.<p>Does competing turn you into a strong coder? Absolutely. Does this equate to being a strong engineer? Nope. Software engineering isn&#x27;t just about coding fast.<p>This is anecdotal, but from what I&#x27;ve seen (as a trainer and friend of several IOI medalists): some of them appreciate that coding != engineering and proceed to develop their engineering skills. Others don&#x27;t and remain stuck at the &quot;I&#x27;ll come up with a fast solution&quot; mindset.<p>Whether one or the other happens very much depends on the person, plus, I believe, whom they end up working with. After all, we&#x27;ve all heard about the &quot;10x&quot; programmer – and when your colleague or subordinate appears to code at 10x speed, you just might think twice about whether you&#x27;re qualified to advise or guide them. That results in their keeping any bad habits they might have.')
