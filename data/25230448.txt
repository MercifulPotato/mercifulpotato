That&#x27;s why PaulDavisThe1st&#x27;s suggestion was IMO completely reasonable. Mixing is a skillset that not only takes time to master, but also requires that you keep your ears healthy - which is something that many musicians don&#x27;t always do (myself included). Not only that, a professional mixer understands that you can only mix for so long in a single session before your ears become fatigued and you can no longer trust them (until you give them rest).<p>I would argue that if someone cares primarily about the end result of the music then it should be easy to put aside their pride and allow the experts to do their job and help them sound better.')
