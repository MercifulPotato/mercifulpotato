Then, even if redditor HODLers hold 99% of actual shares, and won&#x27;t sell them, it&#x27;s enough if there is 1% free float, and the 141% remaining longs (who have lent out their shares to the shorts) are happy to sell at the current inflated price. The shorts can then close out their position with 140 of those 141  longs, and then you&#x27;re left with 99% shares held by redditors, and 1% held by someone else who might want to sell at this point.<p>To squeeze the shorts, you need to control 100% or more of the long interest. I doubt that&#x27;s the case here.')
