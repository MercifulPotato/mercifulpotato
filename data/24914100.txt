I think we eat more calories than we consume when those calories aren&#x27;t delivering the nutrients we require.<p>Just refusing to eat more than X amount of calories is an approach that fails for a lot of people. Relying on so-called will power fails for a lot of people.<p>I think this is a useful distinction to make and doesn&#x27;t actually contradict the idea that &quot;You get fat from eating too many calories, more than you are burning.&quot; Instead it helps answer the question for some people concerning &quot;Yes, but why do you keep stuffing your face when you are so unhappy with the results?&quot;')
