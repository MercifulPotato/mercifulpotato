FB is really good at targeted advertising, which is what you need when you&#x27;re a tiny business. It puts you in front of the most likely customers, instead of spending more to spray your advertising in front of a wider audience to reach people.<p>I&#x27;ve got no tears to shed for FB losing one of their tools in invading privacy. But people on HN often talk about advertising as if it were in itself an unmitigated evil, but it really is an important way for businesses to find customers. Social media should be good for that, since people really are voluntarily telling about themselves, which makes it easier to connect them to businesses that might matter to them.<p>So good on Apple for forcing FB to play by some kind of rules, when they&#x27;ve been invasive in ways far beyond what people realize they&#x27;re letting themselves in for. Small businesses will have to learn to cope. But finding the &quot;elsewhere&quot; for their marketing budget isn&#x27;t as easy as you&#x27;d hope.')
