So this leads to needing JITs to improve performance which then give a slow start up time and increased complexity. Even with JIT, Python is just not fast thanks to the above issues and it&#x27;s overall dynamism.<p>It can be optimised and for sure there&#x27;s some impressive attempts at doing so. However I don&#x27;t think pure Python will ever be considered &quot;fast&quot; as these things necessarily get in the way.<p>I highly recommend the two videos posted here that go into more detail as to why there are limits to how far optimisation can go: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qCGofLIzX6g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qCGofLIzX6g</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IeSu_odkI5I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IeSu_odkI5I</a>')
