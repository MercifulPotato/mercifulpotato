It is slow and doesn&#x27;t need to interrupt.  mailing lists feed into this.<p>- wikis are great for information that is designed.  But it takes a lot of energy, and really requires dedicated maintenance.  I&#x27;ve never worked anywhere where internal wikis were better than mediocre.<p>- bug systems have an off-label use - they are great for finding out about problems in company specific software&#x2F;systems<p>- ticket systems are great for resolving small problems.  But they seem to be closed systems that aren&#x27;t searchable.<p>- slack.  Now slack is good, not evil.  I think where slack shines is up-to-the-minute communication where several people help work through a problem.  but in moderation!  Be polite, do not nag.<p>It is also exceptional at &quot;trivial&quot; knowledge that nonetheless holds back bright minds from progress - and is searchable.<p>What goes into slack is the less-formal-than-email stuff, the less-organized-than-wiki stuff, and less-critical-than-bug-report stuff.')
