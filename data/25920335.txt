I just started getting into using Parsec (which is apparently what Plex it partnering with for this).  I was able to get it set up streaming from my gaming PC to a raspberry pi 2b (note, the only _officially_ supported rpi is the 3.0 or 3b, but the 2b actually works with it, while 4.0 support is in development), and  was a little underwhelmed.  Had to lock the fps to 30 or my rpi couldn&#x27;t keep up, and had to run wired or the wireless network couldn&#x27;t keep up.  at 30 fps lock, the fps was _very_ noticeable, unfortunately.<p>I tried using a Windows 10 laptop (Ryzen 5 2500u) to see if it was any fault of the raspberry pi, and noticed the decoding time for the video went from 1.8ms on my rpi to like 14ms on my laptop, which was using the Vega gpu to perform the decoding.  No bueno.  Was able to turn the fps up to 60, and things seemed okay, but when I got into a good action game (Warhammer Vermintide 2), it was not a good experience.  The latency on decoding was just causing too much of a dissonance between my input and the video output for it to be playable.<p>I will note that the video decoding was lightning fast on the raspberry pi, though.  Makes me wonder if maybe the rpi 3.0&#x2F;3b might perform better.  I don&#x27;t really want to buy one to find out (would rather wait and get a 4.0 once they release support for it).<p>In the end, I really couldn&#x27;t get anything running to my liking.  I&#x27;m sure it is fantastic for game streaming for some people, though.')
