Complexity is just the limitation of our brain to handle multiple different things (with interactions) at the same time. Laws&#x2F;rules come out of our brains ability (and habit) to extract generalisations from the observations.<p>IMO there is no way you can understand the &quot;absolute fundamental nature of reality&quot; as whatever laws you try to extract out of reality will always be our own interpretation of the observations.<p>The expectation that nature should follow simple rules is due to our brains limitation to handle complexity and hence the desire of simple laws&#x2F;rules as that gives us the pleasant feeling of &quot;beauty in simplicity&quot;.')
