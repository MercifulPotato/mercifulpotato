Is that your criterion? I&#x27;m excited because I feel they are going in the right direction. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m using their services. I use Brave, but don&#x27;t have the time to dive into things they are doing well or doing wrong. That&#x27;s what we have investigative journalism for. I&#x27;m very happy to pay for that. By the way, I also use Signal. I also have a Fairphone. etc etc.<p>The next step after excitement is of course to convert excitement into action, and to actually support these organisations, through buying their stuff or making donations. Not because they are doing everything well, but because I personally believe they are helping to improve society.')
