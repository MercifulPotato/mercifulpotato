Often they are awesome lists or too far into a specific niche. So wanted make a more general one thats quick and easy.<p>The reason it is halfbaked is because I need to spend a lot more time on writing more questions AND refining&#x2F;streamlining ones I have written already. My feedback I&#x27;ve receives so far has been that more focus should go into ensuring the questions are well written.<p>Happy to hear feedback and hope you like my little piece.')
