Elastane lets you get away with a fit that&#x27;s really too tight.<p>But none those are even close to being as comfortable as pajama pants or sweatpants. When I&#x27;m lounging at home, I want nothing to bind or sit tightly, comfort is king.<p>Wearing a belt while sitting down puts a lot of pressure on your midsection, but even wearing suspenders (which I highly recommend), you still feel the waistband. Of course you get used to it, but why not just go straight for comfort?')
