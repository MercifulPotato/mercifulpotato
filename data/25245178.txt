Multiple groups can develop their &quot;right way&quot; and you can pick and choose which way you prefer.<p>In theory. In reality you just end up having to deal with all of them simultaneously to get your workflow going because you&#x27;re using tools from different authors who all have their opinion of what &quot;the right way&quot; is.<p>&gt; As for being &quot;one update away from breaking&quot; this is an issue on any OS, at least with Linux you have the choice not to update or even roll back.<p>Again, in theory but not in practice. Because of the repo&#x2F;pacakge manager model that Linux systems insist on using, and because there&#x27;s no such thing as a separation between &#x27;system&#x27; and &#x27;application&#x27;, failure to update often means you are unable to use up-to-date software entirely. Well, unless you want to set up a build environment and compile your own version of that software, which is utterly ridiculous.')
