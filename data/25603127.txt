It is written for people who already use spaced repetition, and aims to help them improve one aspect: writing prompts. It is not intended as an elementary introduction to spaced repetition, and so it doesn&#x27;t bother to explain basic concepts.<p>Your objection is a little like complaining that a computer science textbook aimed at post-grads doesn&#x27;t bother to explain what a variable is. Some background knowledge is assumed.')
