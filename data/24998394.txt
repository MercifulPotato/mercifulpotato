In very cold conditions, they may not be more efficient than resistive electric heating, but they will never be worse.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;places up north where you do spend quite a bit on heating cannot really take advantage of heat pumps due to winters being too cold.&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;re talking about air-source heat pumps here. In colder regions, it&#x27;s better to use ground source&#x2F;geothermal heat pumps. Ground temperature is consistent year-round even in very cold climates.')
