In essence, what happened at the end was GPT-3 was asked to write an OOM-killer-inspired story. I think this should be a cautionary tale against trying to use GPT-3 to provide commentary beyond a high-level summary.<p>This isn&#x27;t a slight against the short-summary technique, which seems very cool.<p>Details: oom_adj isn&#x27;t a flag, it&#x27;s an int which can disable OOM on a per-process-leader basis but can also but can also be used to reduce the &quot;badness&quot; of a process when considering what to kill. Oom_adj is also deprecated and has been replaced by oom_score_adj. The OOM algorithm isn&#x27;t called RSS. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have been explicitly named, but the function which performs the key calculation is named oom_badness. This function assigns an integer &quot;badness&quot; to each process. A process&#x27; resident set size <i>is</i> an important part of calculating badness, but it&#x27;s affected by several other factors (what they are depends on kernel version but they include the adjustment parameter). RSS is not (part of) the OOM calculation &quot;by default&quot; -- it&#x27;s always included unless OOM is disabled entirely. RSS isn&#x27;t a comparison of reserved physical memory against current virtual size, it&#x27;s just the amount of RAM currently occupied by a process (i.e. not in swap or on disk). The OOM killer doesn&#x27;t compare RSS against virtual size. RSS doesn&#x27;t trigger the OOM killer. RSS isn&#x27;t an algorithm.<p>Another interesting aspect of this, of course, is that GPT-3 likely wasn&#x27;t trained on any specific kernel version, but on a large number of versions depending on which part of the Internet it happened to be reading. This means that it probably can&#x27;t give a good account of any single version of fast-changing parts of the kernel like the OOM killer.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;mm&#x2F;oom_kill.c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;mm&#x2F;oom_kill.c</a>')
