You get up to and including 7 days and you shouldn&#x27;t have to give a note. From gov.uk[0]:<p>&gt;If employees are off work for 7 days or less, they do not need to give their employer a fit note or other proof of sickness from a medical professional.<p>&gt;When they return to work, their employer can ask them to confirm they’ve been off sick. This is called ‘self-certification’. The employer and employee will agree on how the employee should do this. They might need to fill in a form or send details of their sick leave by email.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;taking-sick-leave" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;taking-sick-leave</a>')
