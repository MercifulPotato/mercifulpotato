It was always about programming with pure and total functions in their mathematical version.<p>Other people have correctly pointed out that this is an extremely ambitious idea, since, as they have noted, you can&#x27;t build a turing-complete language with pure and total functions.<p>This very high bar explains why there has been so many different design decisions in languages, and why most fp languages make tradeoffs in order to reach a compromise between what they believe is important in that concept, and what they can pull in terms of usable software.<p>As I noted as a response to that thread, we have seen in the recent years languages that achieve pure&#x2F;total functions, but this was only possible because so many forebearers had tried different designs, and comprmised to produce usable software they could iterate from.')
