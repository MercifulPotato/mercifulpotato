You should always make those, like don&#x27;t write shitty variable names.<p>But there are a lot code quality decisions where increasing quality costs more time. (at least in the short run)<p>Code consistency - When you write one module one way and a another dev writes it another.  Do you rewrite one of the modules for consistency?<p>Doing the &quot;Right&quot; thing - When there is a better solution and a faster solution that is maybe less maintainable.   Which solution do you pick?<p>Corrections - You wrote some code while learning a new library&#x2F;technology&#x2F;api and find that you used it poorly.  Do you go back and clean this up?<p>Code Reviews - How nit picky are you?  How good is good enough?  If a dev writes out a large feature and you don&#x27;t like the way he did it do you ask him to fix it?<p>Database Mistakes - as you learn about and build out your app you realize you made the wrong choice with some database modeling, do you fix it or write unnecessarily complex SQL to fix paper over it?<p>Analyze or fix CSS - A button looks weird, you&#x27;re not sure why the css is causing it to render funny. Do you do a deep dive finding the root cause or do you just jam some inline css in there?')
