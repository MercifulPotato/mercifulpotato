If 90% of the American search market were split between 5 companies of roughly equal popularity, the ROI of gaming ranking to trick any one of those implementations would be much lower. There would be fewer people who could make a living by faking relevance&#x2F;quality signals for junk.<p>Right now the best paying job many people with unspecialized skills can get is &quot;tricking people into clicking things they shouldn&#x27;t.&quot; Google is sorely taxed trying to keep up with the antics of a million people whose career is trying to game Google. Early Google was better because the people really desperate for money couldn&#x27;t even afford to get online. That was a glaring inequity that doubled as a crude spam filter [1]. I think about this every time a real live person telephones me on behalf of &quot;Windows Support.&quot;<p>[1] This is a large part of what I miss when I&#x27;m pining for the early Web. Practically everyone publishing online then had to be either more affluent than average or cleverer than average to get into Club Web. People contributing on the early Web were almost all financially situated <i>independent of</i> what they were contributing, so Web participation was almost all done out of passion rather than financial desperation. Authors didn&#x27;t worry about how to get paid for what they wrote online and readers didn&#x27;t worry about how to support their favorite sites either. People in the club were understood to have other means of sustenance. If you didn&#x27;t, you wouldn&#x27;t be in the club in the first place!')
