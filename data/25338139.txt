Since this is a self-funded side project, I can&#x27;t run at a loss, and I don&#x27;t think you can reasonably charge more for the kind of service ListenLater.fm provides, but I&#x27;m really excited about the prices coming down in this area.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, Google, Amazon, and basically everywhere else I&#x27;ve looked have the $4&#x2F;million or $16&#x2F;million for the higher quality voices.<p>I&#x27;m currently just using Joanna since I can get some cost savings by not having to run Text to Speech on the same article multiple times, so long as everyone gets the same voice.  But I&#x27;m considering offering a limited selection of voices for non-american listeners soon.')
