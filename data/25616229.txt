I could point out where the contradiction lies, but I think doing that may not be the best way, because it would be too superficial: You would just resolve the contradiction one way or the other and be on your way. I think if you looked for it yourself it would be a better exercise and may cause to wonder how and why it arose and expose underlying biases in your thought process. But if you are really stuck I will point it out. Or if you know what I&#x27;m thinking of, and think it&#x27;s not a contradiction feel free say so then I guess.')
