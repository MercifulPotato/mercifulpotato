MS-DOS fits that range without 64-bits, a separately correct design decision would have been to use 64-bits of time from the start. Poor software casts&#x2F;stores time_t in int because that was good enough for decades - if it didn&#x27;t fit an int from the start, they wouldn&#x27;t be doing that (or if an int were enough by having different semantics, it would also be OK for them to keep doing that).')
