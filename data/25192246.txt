If I was going to distribute something shifted from nix, I&#x27;d essentially need to move every single dependency (which needs to be compiled&#x2F;configured right). It&#x27;s not a huge problem for a cli tool in golang, but something that requires qt, GL, input method support, etc.? I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a flatpak base for those that not only &quot;just works&quot;, and it&#x27;s going to be maintained&#x2F;distributed even of the app isn&#x27;t.')
