For me I want friends and companionship. My experience is that&#x27;s not what nomads get. Friends requires you to be near by and spend time when them else they drift way. Sure you can keep in touch online but you won&#x27;t really be a part of their life nor them a part of yours if you&#x27;re not there to share your life with them. The same goes for a long term companion unless by some luck of the draw you manage to find someone that can join your open ride lifestyle. Some people don&#x27;t need that. I do which I learned the hard way.')
