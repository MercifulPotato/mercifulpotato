A cynic might think that Trump is really bothered by section 230.  (I don&#x27;t for a minute buy the explanation that it helps enemies&#x27; intelligence efforts.)<p>And a curious person might wonder why that is.

Given that the big media companies are made up of humans, who have all the faults that us other humans do, they can be wrong about which viewpoints are wrong.  If they have the freedom to shut down &quot;wrong&quot; viewpoints, that can in some instances be a bad thing.<p>Interesting times.  Pity that the military budget is the victim of all this.')
