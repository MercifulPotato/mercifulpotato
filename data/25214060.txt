Arranged marriages are forced in some sense, but people do come around to care. Put a man and woman together in captivity and they start caring for each other. That&#x27;s how human nature is.<p>And regarding the gunpoint thing, there&#x27;s something called Bride kidnapping in central asia. Ofcourse those brides cry for first few days or so, but eventually settle in, with equal or probably more happiness than the women of the so called free world.')
