(assuming 100% financed, decrement both amounts as you see fit)<p>That&#x27;s only a 14% increase in monthly payment over 2000, while general inflation has increased by 56% over that same time (all using your figures above, with the exception of researched mortgage interest rates for 30-year fixed mortgages). I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not hard now, but it wasn&#x27;t easy then either. Life has pretty much always been a struggle for most people.')
