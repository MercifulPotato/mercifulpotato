It was much faster than iterating on the QT C++ application that the Lua was embedded in. It would, eventually, even allow us to do custom targeted push updates to our software (in 2009).<p>So I love Lua. I appreciate its speed and its flexibility. I think of it as Javascript&#x27;s easy to use cousin. Straightforward to write and debug - you control the entire environment.<p>I also think this idea is deeply silly:<p>&gt;People who want batteries want a ready-made powertool full of opinions. They are not looking towards Lua in the context that Lua wants to exist.<p>I would have loved ready-made powertools! I wouldn&#x27;t include all the tools in <i>my</i> toolkit (and we already added some by building our own Lua with a few patches), but it sure would have saved me time writing them (and writing them badly as I was just out of school). I don&#x27;t think a complicated, robust library would hurt Lua&#x27;s mission and I&#x27;m sad to see this attitude in the community. I understand that Lua may be too small to support a &quot;big&quot; set of official libraries, but I think the idea that offering fewer options is better than more options is wrong.')
