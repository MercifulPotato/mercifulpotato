This means that if jurisdictions decide to move from one timezone to another, they each get their new timezones.<p>Take Indiana. Indiana is in the US Eastern time zone, except for some places near the Illinois border, which are US Central. But Indiana also didn&#x27;t observe DST until 2006 (although some counties <i>did</i> observe DST). Consequently, what could generally be described as three timezones (as in the MS timezone selector) is actually described as 11 timezones: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time_in_Indiana#tz_database" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time_in_Indiana#tz_database</a><p>From what I understand, locals in Indiana actually refer to time simply as Eastern or Central (with non-observance of DST meaning you shift from Eastern in winter to Central in summer).')
