I&#x27;ve seen several David Lynch movies, never enjoyed a single one of them. There&#x27;s something about his film aesthetic but also about his view of what the world really is that just doesn&#x27;t sit right with me. When I do see them it&#x27;s because one or more film nerds I respect has raved about it, and I think I should give it a chance. But ... nope, same film aesthetic, same worldview that I just can&#x27;t enjoy.')
