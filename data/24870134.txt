Crystal structures (Especially with ligands) were really useful to determine structure and function, but you sometimes get artifacts and it is hard to see exactly how things transition (Assuming you even get it to crystallized in the first place).<p>Techniques like cryo-EM and smFRET are definitely helping bridge this toolset gap to do better functional analysis of proteins and complexes.  Definitely worth the Nobel Prize it won a few years back.')
