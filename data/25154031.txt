I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily a &quot;morally defensible position&quot; to have a third kid when you&#x27;re struggling to take care of the previous two just because you belong to a religion that thinks prophylactics are immoral, and I would never, for example, judge a potential parent who decided to terminate a pregnancy because they were told it is unlikely their child will be born alive, and even if it is, would be unlikely to live for long.')
