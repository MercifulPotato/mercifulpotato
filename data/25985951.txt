The problem is that it is better &quot;on average&quot; to invest it all at once (and doesn&#x27;t even talk about variance).  But an individual is not an average.  They will lie somewhere on that spectrum.  I&#x27;d rather take a small hit to the expected value of my returns in order to reduce risk of being on the wrong side of that average.')
