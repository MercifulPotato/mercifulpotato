I was tired of living in an apartment, and my mortgage is less than what rent on a comparable house would be.<p>A lot times I see people mention that you are better off putting the money into an S&amp;P 500 fund. However what they don&#x27;t account for, is that you have to live somewhere. So you either pay rent or pay a mortgage.<p>Also you don&#x27;t have to put down 20%. With an FHA loan you can do as little as 3%. You will have to pay PMI, but if you in a market with decent appreciation you can get rid of that in a few years.<p>I agree that buying a home is not for everyone. If you like to move around or don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be saying in an area for 5 to 10 years, you are better off renting. Also if your financial position is not where you can afford to deal with unexpected repairs, you are probably better off renting. I also don&#x27;t think you should buy a house as an investment. That just leads to over extending yourself. Instead you should buy a house because you want to live there.')
