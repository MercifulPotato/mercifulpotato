But early on he designed a study with unethical participant recruitment, juked and terrible stats, to push a bad pre-print for a contrarian number on the death rate that has proven to be very very very wrong. And he went out into media and pushed his bad study, at a crucial time. That the Mercury News is publishing his words is a huge black eye both for Stanford and for the Mercury News. It&#x27;s clear that his COVID work is not driven by science, but rather strange political beliefs that can not be justified by data. Shameful.')
