Consider two VPNs, one of which promises never to misuse client-side IP data, while the other refuses to store that data in the first place.<p>Why do you trust either company?  Can you verify the claim that no data is logged intentionally or potentially even accidentally? Even companies that have been taken to court and shown an inability to produce logs in the past could have made recent changes behind the scenes that change this.  There is a huge degree of information asymmetry when it comes to VPN providers and as a result you shouldn&#x27;t completely trust them if logging is a make or break issue for you.')
