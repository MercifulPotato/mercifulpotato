Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604355576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24973383, text='&gt; The failure case when the conspiracy is &quot;George W Bush did 9&#x2F;11&quot; is going to involve a whole lot fewer death threats to random private people.<p>This is a rather interesting detour.  How about when the conspiracy is &quot;Iraq has weapons of mass destruction&quot;?  Did that result in any deaths?  Like, oh I don&#x27;t know, <i>many many hundreds of thousands</i>?  Was that &quot;failure case&quot; devastating, or is there some sort of a conversion factor between brown skinned Middle Easterners and Righteous Pale Westerners that I should be aware of?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s when people with significant power like Jones take to telling stories about random parents of murdered children that they do serious damage.<p>In the range of multiple hundreds of thousands of innocent dead people?<p>I would enjoy reading any serious reasoning for why Alex Jones&#x27; Sandy Hook rantings are <i>more serious than the innocent civilians killed in Iraq</i>.  Is that not what multiple people here are asserting?  If you have no regret (as a taxpayer who funds the war machine) about the situation, I wonder if any of you people have any sympathy?<p>My son was learning in school last year about the Holocaust, and part of the curriculum was how it was possible that the German public could go along with something that was so obviously wrong.  I am going to show him this thread when he gets home from school today, so he can get a real world, firsthand, modern day impression of how human psychology can so easily find a way to justify war crimes.')
