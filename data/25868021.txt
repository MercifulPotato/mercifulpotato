Twitter does use AWS for some things, but the actual service is not hosted on AWS.<p>And that&#x27;s pretty much the end of it. As the judge rightly points out in today&#x27;s filing, all of Parler&#x27;s talk about Twitter is just a bunch of hot air.<p>That could change if this lawsuit proceeds, and discovery reveals evidence of conspiracy. But that is all <i>highly</i> speculative at this point, and I would not be surprised if a company as lawyered up as Amazon has taken steps to make it all but impossible for such a thing to occur.')
