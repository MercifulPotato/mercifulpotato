Item(by='exikyut', descendants=None, kids=[25775454], score=None, time=1610625345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25774931, text='Aw, input is broken on mobile (Android + of course Chrome).<p>I&#x27;m getting a keyboard popup, and I appear to be typing somewhere offscreen (I can see a typing suggestion containing exactly what I&#x27;ve typed, which wouldn&#x27;t happen if input wasn&#x27;t going anywhere), but the text isn&#x27;t appearing onscreen, then when I press Enter, I get an &quot;OK&quot; as though I&#x27;d hit Enter on a blank line... and the input I&#x27;d typed isn&#x27;t cleared. So, &quot;words &lt;Enter&gt; words &lt;Enter&gt;&quot; shows &quot;wordswords&quot; in my keyboard&#x27;s suggestion, and &quot;OK\\nOK\\n&quot; on the display.<p>Looks really cool though :D')
