Item(by='avmich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601912790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24687857, text='&gt; I would design it as a Web of Apps rather than the Web of Docs.<p>These are two significantly different use cases. Maybe there are more? Like, apps can be split further into classes?<p>&gt; Lots of current issues are because it started as a Web of Docs, yet what people wanted was the Web of Apps.<p>Disagree, lots of people today point out that the grass was greener when we had the Web of Docs, and want that state back.<p>&gt; It would also be based on UDP rather than TCP.<p>TCP is just a rather common case - lots of cases want to have guarantees with data. We probably want to be able to use UDP as well, don&#x27;t we go towards that with WebRTC?<p>&gt; There will be no cookies, Local Storage covers it.<p>So it wouldn&#x27;t work outside of the session? We&#x27;ll need to keep entering passwords?..<p>I think some Internet things could be improved as well, not only Web.')
