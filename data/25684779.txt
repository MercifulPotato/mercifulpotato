Most small things we can get there.<p>Lowe’s is about 15 minutes away, and is the only place to get serious wood. For small things we’ll walk there and back. For medium things we’ll walk there and UberXL back ($15), for large things we’ll zipcar or rent a UHaul ($25).<p>We don’t have private outdoor space, but we live in a very quiet neighborhood. For woodworking we get very far with a dremel and a jigsaw. :)')
