If there&#x27;s also e.g. an Apple-proprietary GPU or any other components with no specifications or driver source available, there&#x27;s going to be endless catchup to play for open source support. And if those components are Apple-only, there&#x27;s almost certainly going to be no incentive for Apple to release any information to outside developers.<p>Getting code to run on, or even optimized for, an M1 CPU is probably the smallest of the obstacles.')
