Item(by='angry_octet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604428938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976369, text='This is actually a fantastic experiment to evaluate whether people are employed on H1-Bs because of a shortage which can&#x27;t be met locally, or because indentured workers are cheaper. Ideally there would be another cohort, allocated randomly, where the employee is not tied to any one employer, like a temporary green card.<p>It is fallacious to say that with decreased supply, demand will dictate wages will go up. It is quite possible that demand is elastic at a particular price point, but at higher prices demand falls to zero (aka set up an office in Canada). There is no reason to assume linearity in any of this.<p>What&#x27;s missing is that, even with the potential for high wages after graduation, it is still a big risk for an individual to borrow for a college education. These employers should be taxed, perhaps 10% of their H1-B expenditure, with that tax subsidising education in that field.')
