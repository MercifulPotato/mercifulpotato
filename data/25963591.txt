This all happened before these trade restrictions.<p>At the scale we&#x27;re talking about here, it gets to a point very quickly where nothing can save them except government intervention. Robinhood may not be at that point yet (and I very much doubt the government would step in to help them), but its also the case that their eligibility for huge loans like they need is hurt because the measures they need to take to remain solvent (locking down trades) is also hurting their future revenue (users are concerned and may pull out). That&#x27;s why liquidity events are so scary; everything just stops, and when you stop a market it sometimes can&#x27;t ever get going again.')
