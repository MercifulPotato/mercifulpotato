Some of my IRC groups have migrated to Discord or Slack, but IRC is still on in the background.<p>You&#x27;ve touched on a fundamental point that G+ was trying to get across with &quot;circles.&quot; I&#x27;m a member of probably 20 different groups across various messaging platforms. These are tight little communities with a lot of trust. It isn&#x27;t that we all agree politically or anything, but we trust each other to be kind, consistent, and not too spammy. Anyway, I think small groups in WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, IRC, etc.. are the present and future of good social interactions.')
