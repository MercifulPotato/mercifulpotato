Honestly you need both structured learning and lived experience in both, and probably in most skills in life. If you don&#x27;t have the structure you will meander aimlessly solving &quot;problems&quot; and &quot;getting better&quot; (at code or art) but never actually getting anywhere with it. If you only have the structure you will never be able to actually make anything truly new because you can&#x27;t solve the novel problems in the trenches.<p>Start something new with structure but <i>rapidly</i> push yourself to start using that regimented curriculum to make new stuff. And then when you enter a new problem domain (you learned Python and want to start doing networking or you know how to draw but want to paint) you switch back to a regimented curriculum to start till you get that 20% baseline knowledge to build off of again.')
