An iOS app uploads photos to my NAS, where I run a media server that lets us browse photos from other devices. I periodically sync the photos directory on my server to AWS Deep Glacier for redundancy.<p>Paying for iCloud or Google Photos probably makes more sense in terms of time invested: I&#x27;ll probably end up investing a lot of it migrating from old drives or cloud providers to new ones. However, given the importance I attach to generation-spanning data like baby pictures, I&#x27;d rather have a digital solution that&#x27;s as close as possible to a physical albumâ€”something that&#x27;s always with me in the house.')
