As far as we know, they did move forward in 250 or so and did not proceeed with the others (presumably because of resource constraints) - but still all those 18000 networks were infiltrated by the malware, and if I was one of these 18000 companies then I would not just assume that we got skipped - so at the very least that should result in 18000 careful audits to verify if the potential intrusion happened.')
