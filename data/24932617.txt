The universe is essentially limitless from a human point of view, so to be perpetually stuck on Earth seems like a failure of perspective.<p>- Oppressive government controlling you or your land? Move elsewhere in the solar system.<p>- Resource extraction destroying natural environments on Earth? Asteroids and other planets have far more natural resources and long term, it is inevitable that mining will be off-planet.<p>- Overpopulation? On a universal scale, there is no such thing.<p>Obviously most of these won&#x27;t be solvable in 20, or 50, or even 100 years. But, they seem conceivably doable in 200, or even 150. In the greater scheme of things, this is a very small amount of time.')
