I don&#x27;t know for the life of me what to do with them. I was thinking maybe as a temperature&#x2F;humidity monitor thing, but it would have to be mains powered because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to make a device like this diy&#x27;able (with arduino and dht22 level components) and make it run off a battery for more than a few months. So any suggestions are good.')
