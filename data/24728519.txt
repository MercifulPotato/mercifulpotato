They ARE your online identity in a way that pinterest&#x2F;snap&#x2F;twitter are not. Wechat is comparable (probably even more than FB) but only in China.<p>What FB has been able to do is smooth out those up and down waves by acquiring challengers (Insta&#x2F;Whatsapp). They tried to buy snap too but when that didn&#x27;t work they just copied features and now also copying TikTok.<p>So I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re subject to those equalising forces as has been the case previously (and which do still affect everyone else - RIP Vine).')
