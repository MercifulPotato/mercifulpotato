So it doesn&#x27;t prove that a high value target like a presidential candidate has actually typed and pressed send on that email, it just proves that the first SMTP server that routed the email has sent it.<p>Even google didn&#x27;t bother to rotate their DKIM keys as recommended by the standard, so one wonders if the google keys are stored in a cage guarded by lasers and dogs or if there are copies on someones laptop somewhere and any sysadmin with a gambling problem or a secret affair could have leaked them to an unscrupulous journalist or a spy.')
