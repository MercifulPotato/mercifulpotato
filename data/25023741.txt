As a back-of-the-envelope estimate, using budget as a proxy for &quot;regulation and resource distribution&quot;, ~70% of government spending went to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Defense. You&#x27;ve called out national defense as something that should remain at the Federal level. Social Security spending consists literally of distributing money to individuals. Medicare and Medicaid in a roundabout way are essentially the same, and America&#x27;s poor and elderly are certainly not uniformly distributed among the states. This leaves only a maximum of 30% of resource allocation that could even potentially be pushed back to the states.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_federal_budget#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:2019_Federal_Budget_Infographic.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_federal_budget#&#x2F;...</a>')
