I think it&#x27;s more expressive to have a single commit like &quot;wip: some simple description goes here&quot; and then to `git commit --amend` this until we are happy with its contents.<p>As well as being more descriptive if you come back after a long weekend, this also means that you can swap branches without worrying that your stash relates to a particular branch but doesn&#x27;t explicitly belong to this.')
