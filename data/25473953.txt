He concluded that the anecdotal evidence was correct: there was no necessary correlation between the seriousness of any wound and men’s expressions of suffering. In fact, three-quarters of wounded soldiers claimed that they weren’t experiencing significant pain and didn’t ask for pain relief, even when offered it.<p>[…]<p>In contrast, suffering a similar kind of injury in civilian contexts (a car crash, for example) was excruciatingly painful because it heralded “the beginning of disaster”. Beecher confirmed anecdotal evidence that being wounded was viewed as good luck: wounds enabled men to escape “this hell with nothing more perhaps than the loss of half a foot”, as one World War I soldier put it. Emotions and expectations affected physiological sensations.“</i><p>Also, I think we should educate people that, if an expert says “we can’t find anything physical, so I think it’s in your head” doesn’t mean you put it there, or that you should be able to take it out without any help and, hence you’re to be blamed for it.<p>(I also think we should educate doctors to tell patients that  “we can’t find” doesn’t mean “there isn’t”)')
