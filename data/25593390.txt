You &#x27;re the one that told me I had control of the client network as per MITM; don&#x27;t move the goalposts.<p>2. You&#x27;re overthinking this. I&#x27;m not talking about hijacking established sessions. I&#x27;m talking about never letting the authentic session start in the first place.<p>As soon as the attacker controls the DNS resolver it doesn&#x27;t matter what security you have in place. The bank and the LE servers and all that can be perfectly secure. But if the client is going to the wrong IPs they never will interact with them. They&#x27;ll only interact with the perfectly valid HTTPS hosts the attacker sets up.')
