So far I like it, its simplicity really kind of opened my brain to using it, if that makes sense. I&#x27;ve been finding it really nice to be limited to just &quot;content in, content out&quot;.<p>A couple notes: \nI find the title length a little limiting. I want to be able to see my tasks at a glance.<p>The cards are at full size no matter the description length. I often don&#x27;t have a description and it&#x27;s just empty space. I&#x27;d find it more useful if the cards adapted better to the content the user chooses to put in them.<p>Thanks for the tool! Goodluck in the future!')
