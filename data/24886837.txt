I&#x27;m sipping coffee and much to my shame i thought this was going to be some meta joke about screwing with some sort of master list of DMCA&#x27;d repos on Github or something. Sipping coffee, reading comments, chillin.. then read yours, and almost spit it out at how much funnier this is than i thought it was.<p>I re-opened the link and actually used my eyeballs, and yup.. it&#x27;s the damn Youtube-dl library on the &#x2F;dmca repo, bahaha. I almost whooshed the joke entirely, so thanks :)')
