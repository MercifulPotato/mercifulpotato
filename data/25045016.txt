I imagine that if at any time there are a million video streams happening, and zoom wanted to sneak into 1% of them, it would pretty much need 10000 vCPUs of compute to do that? The current tech scales affordably because only the encoded packets get transmitted between callers (via &quot;selective forwarding units&quot;) without needing server-side re-encoding?<p>edit: That was for video streams. For audio streams, certainly the cpus cost is lower - about 10%.')
