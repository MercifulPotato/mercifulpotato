Most places I&#x27;ve worked don&#x27;t define their bounded contexts based on separation of concerns, but rather on separation of reporting.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong. I mean, one of the goals of microservices is to peel off responsibilities to a service that can be owned and managed by a small team.<p>However, what I&#x27;ve been seeing in these anti-microservices rant is developers struggling to acknowledge the need to reason with loosely coupled interfaces, reason about partial system failure modes that were always there in monoliths but we&#x27;re either ignored or turned into critical system failures, and the microservices tax.')
