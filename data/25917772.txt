IMO the problem we have now is that the digital real estate is artificially restricted, by hosting companies, platforms, etc. that it&#x27;s almost impossible to have sovereignty over your digital existence. If you make the wrong person&#x2F;group&#x2F;ideology mad, they will usurp any sovereignty you thought you had. Whereas in the real world, sovereignty is generally limited by land.')
