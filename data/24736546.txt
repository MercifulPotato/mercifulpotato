If you have any other sing up option in your app you have to have Sing in With Apple as well. I don&#x27;t mind that.<p>If you want to be a payment gateway, compete with other payment gateways. If the app has any other payment method integration, there should be IAP as well.<p>But the problem is: if IAP is available, at least I am never going to opt for custom payment methods ever unless there&#x27;s a clear cost benefit. Just like the OP I&#x27;ve had nightmares dealing with cancellation and automatic reactivations (of course that means automatic billing as well).<p>But the question is will Apple allow apps to show, or does it even make sense to do this:<p>Pay With Apple: $13<p>Pay with CC: $10.03<p>Pay with X: $11<p>This doesn&#x27;t look like a solution at all now.')
