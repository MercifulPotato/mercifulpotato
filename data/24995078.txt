People who have been on ventilators, or hospitalized for extended periods due to <i>severe</i> illness are a different story, as ventilators themselves often cause lung damage. The scariest anecdotes that have been widely circulated online have come from ventilated or hospitalized patients with severe illness.<p>Beyond these anecdotes, stories of &quot;long covid&quot; thus far are predominantly based on anecdote and self-reporting of symptoms, and the symptom profiles that you hear are frequently vague and&#x2F;or unverifiable (&quot;brain fog&quot;) and in most cases, not significantly different than you might see with any respiratory virus.<p>For example, here is a report from the CDC that was widely reported as evidence that &quot;35% of covid cases had long-term illness&quot;. However, &quot;long-term&quot; here, is defined as &quot;three weeks&quot;, and &quot;illness&quot; was defined as a spectrum of mild symptoms that resemble <i>any</i> flu-like illness, such as fatigue, cough and congestion:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6930e1.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6930e1.htm</a><p>Even more specific studies have had serious problems. There have been a few reports of cardiac inflammation and other specific clinical signs in otherwise healthy people. To date, most of these have been debunked for statistical problems. For example, it was widely reported that Division I athletes were found to have heart inflammation after mild Covid-19 infections, which led the Big10 to start screening athletes with MRI before play. Subsequently, so few abnormalities have been found that doctors are now calling for the rule to be rescinded:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.si.com&#x2F;college&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;big-ten-covid-protocol-21-days-heart-screening" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.si.com&#x2F;college&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;big-ten-covid-protocol...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.saymedia-content.com&#x2F;.image&#x2F;cs_srgb&#x2F;MTc2NDI1MTI4ODc0MjIyNzY1&#x2F;hsc200003_annotatedproof.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.saymedia-content.com&#x2F;.image&#x2F;cs_srgb&#x2F;MTc2NDI1M...</a><p>In short, the science of &quot;long-term covid&quot; <i>exceptionally poor</i>, and I caution you that most of what you&#x27;re reading online is rumor and speculation.')
