People who have been on ventilators, or hospitalized for extended periods due to <i>severe</i> illness, are a different story. Ventilators themselves cause lung damage, and the scariest anecdotes that have been widely circulated online have come from ventilated or hospitalized patients.<p>Thus far, stories of &quot;long covid&quot;, in general, are based on anecdote and self-reporting of symptoms, and he symptom profiles that you hear are often vague and&#x2F;or unverifiable, and not significantly different than you might see with any respiratory virus.<p>For example, here is a report from the CDC that was widely reported as evidence that &quot;35% of covid cases had long-term illness&quot;. However, &quot;long-term&quot; here, is defined as &quot;three weeks&quot;, and &quot;illness&quot; was defined as a spectrum of mild symptoms that resemble <i>any</i> flu-like illness, such as fatigue, cough and congestion:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6930e1.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6930e1.htm</a><p>There have been a few reports of cardiac inflammation and other specific clinical signs in otherwise healthy people. To date, most of these have been debunked. The science here is <i>exceptionally poor</i>, and I caution you that most of what you&#x27;re reading online is rumor and speculation.')
