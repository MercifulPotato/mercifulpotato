[1] First, they start building some kind of &quot;media brand&quot;. Here, the OP started blogging on Medium &amp; guest blogged for a ROR startup blog. He got to ~30k views&#x2F;month across all of his articles (probably 99% of the came through them ranking in search). He then used that audience, linked to his new e-learning platform on some of them, and easily got to 1000 new signups.<p>This reminds me of Ghost.org (they&#x27;re currently making $250k+&#x2F;mo [2]) and how John O&#x27;Nolan (the founder) got started:<p>&quot;My blog had a few thousand subscribers who were the first to be notified when I wrote the original idea post.

The other reason that this seems to work is because information can be (in many cases) easier to promote&#x2F;get coverage for than some black-box, software-based tool you&#x27;ve made (the exception here is the so-called &quot;engineering as marketing&quot;, where people make a small&#x2F;useful&#x2F;straightforward tool that people get an immediate value from.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-john-onolan-grew-his-publishing-platform-to-750-000-year-14e5bac2fa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-john-onolan-grew-...</a>')
