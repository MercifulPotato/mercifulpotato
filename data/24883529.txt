You&#x27;re a startup with a business relationship with your customers -- you&#x27;re the common trusted party. Your customers are using your software so if they were worried about you cheating the system they (and you) have bigger problems since your business is reputation.<p>Also what is the point of mining or and proof of $whatever system? The thing your customers provide is a signed attestation of some fact and you provide a signed attestation of the time that fact was received. Why is there a need to &quot;vote&quot; in way on what is true? This is just a database or honestly a folder of signed messages.<p>And I say signed, but none of this really need to be cryptographic in any way since they&#x27;re customers that could just authenticate to you which is as much a proof of their identity as any key.')
