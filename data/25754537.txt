I&#x27;ve found artifacts in probable pre-LGM deposits myself.<p>3) It&#x27;s <i>very</i> difficult &#x2F; borderline impossible for human hands to erase entire cultures. North Americans spent centuries eliminating as much native culture as they could, and it&#x27;s still visible almost everywhere. We&#x27;d expect lots of indications to survive, from faunal population estimates, to sophisticated material culture, to simply drawings and other creative works, not to mention houses and infrastructure. These are all things we find for upper pleistocene groups, but not for hypothetical industrial precursors.')
