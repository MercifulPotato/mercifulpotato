There are story missions addressing rape and misconduct towards sex workers. There are story missions dealing with human trafficking. There are story missions dealing with corporate espionage. The list goes on. None of these things are &quot;juvenile&quot;, I would say, nor can they be watered down to &quot;nudity and dildos.&quot; This game is not Saints Row, it is not cartoony or silly.<p>You can dislike the story, but you should not mischaracterize the subject matter to downplay certain parts of its validity. The story is absolutely &quot;mature&quot;. There is no question.')
