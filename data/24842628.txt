I suspect you’re missing the many ways in which this change can negatively impact valid and fairly frequent advanced usages of macs, in a way similar to the BIOS change you mentioned.<p>When I was in college, Little Snitch was an absolute must for using Macs in our networking labs, because it was the best way to analyze and control our network.
