The amount of intuition you have grows exponentially.<p>The rule of thumb that I live by is that learning mathematics is difficult, and teaching mathematics well is almost impossible - prepare before hand. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve learnt anything in a lesson or lecture post-algebra, that may not be the best thing but I have a very good feel for what I need to learn because of it.')
