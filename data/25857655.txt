Your triceps can&#x27;t tell if you did six reps or seven. Just doing some kind of heavy lift is enough.<p>Kind of... the most important thing for any beginner is to just start doing something; but, there are a lot of nuance on maximizing muscle growth that do mean different reps &#x2F; weight ranges do make a difference. A couple of reps difference either side are going to make little difference but when you have drastically different ranges like 5 to 20 or something then you start training your body for different things.<p>Stick to low reps and high weight and keep progressively overloading and you will be good to go! As you said - for beginners something like SS or SL are great for starting with core lifts and give you a solid program to kick off from.')
