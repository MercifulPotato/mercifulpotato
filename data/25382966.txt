Let&#x27;s say that tax as a way of &quot;dampening&quot; &quot;inefficiencies&quot;. Also, let&#x27;s say that the accumulation of wealth through heritage + accumulation of wealth thanks to tools available to only the wealthy are unfair (in terms of opportunity) parts of the system &#x2F; bugs. Then, taxing the wealthy a certain amount may be a way to dampen the wealth accumulated in unfair ways.<p>I was before thinking that a wealth tax did not make sense, but now that you raise these &quot;bugs&quot; in the system, then it makes sense to tax the wealthy a certain amount. 1% per year, maybe?<p>When the system allows everyone equal access to and equal opportunity to create profits, then it does not make sense any more to have the wealth tax.')
