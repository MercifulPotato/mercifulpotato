Very different audiences and thus different things to say. (And widely different lifespans for the information.)<p>The latter no doubt is hugely useful (I&#x27;m on a long slow effort myself to get my co-workers to document their work more robustly). But writing status reports for managers&#x2F;PMs on a weekly basis is, in my not so humble opinion, a complete waste of time for the company, and a sign of poor organization.')
