A lot of them are one party states for that reason. I still don&#x27;t mind people discussing these ideas or supporting them from a free speech perspective, as long as they&#x27;re not calling for oppression of other views&#x2F;people&#x2F;groups, or inciting violence, or engaging in other criminal acts.<p>But do we need to give them paths to immigrate here? No - we provide those paths when there is benefit to our nation. Why would we provide such a path to those who support an ideology that so consistently results in bad outcomes (both economically and mortally)?<p>&gt; Sounds like you are equally interested in &quot;cancelling&quot; ideologies, you just have a different set you&#x27;d disallow.<p>Not granting visas to members of communist parties is not the same as &quot;cancelling&quot; them, since they aren&#x27;t being publicly shamed, or having their job taken away from them, or having their status quo disrupted in any way. But they&#x27;re unlikely to add value to our society because their ideology fundamentally conflicts with our basic values. As the USCIS stated in their policy guidance:<p>&gt; Membership in or affiliation with the Communist Party or any other totalitarian party is inconsistent and incompatible with the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America, which includes pledging to “support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States.”')
