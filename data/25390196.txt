That the compiler course focuses on compiler backend does not mean it&#x27;s not relevant to the industry. I personally find aliasing, flow analysis, and and optimization very relevant to what we needed to do.<p>As for industry vs academia, wouldn&#x27;t it be fair to say that professors should teach which ever is more advanced? I certainly don&#x27;t believe that teaching Java generics, no matter how relevant that is, is relevant to a PhD program, which is supposed to push the state of the art of a subject.')
