These people don&#x27;t even understand the circulatory system, let alone psychopharmacology!<p>THC is a partial agonist of cannabis receptors.

But concentrates aren&#x27;t magic. They mostly exist for users with a high tolerance from prior use, which includes recreational addicts but also includes pain patients, whether by prescription or not.<p>There is no world in which the effects of concentrated cocaine should be compared to dabs, Doreen.')
