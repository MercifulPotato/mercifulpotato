They are believing things to be true based on circumstantial evidence and wishful thinking because they actively want to believe it is true.  IMO, if Trump and Cruz and all the rest are lying then they first and foremost lied to themselves.  And it is ferociously difficult to convince someone that they are lying to themselves.<p>IMO, folks didn&#x27;t take away the right lessons from the justification for the Iraq War.  Those in charge believed the shoddy evidence for WMDs because they were actively looking for evidence that supported their POV and would justify the actions they wanted to take.  The lesson should be to demand a higher evidentiary standard before you act on it.  To be cold and dispassionate about that evaluation.  I remember watching Colin Powell&#x27;s presentation to the UN.  There is no doubt in my mind that he believed in what he was saying.  Nevertheless, dispassionate observers could tell that this was not hard evidence.  &quot;Trust us, its well-supported,&quot; cannot be sufficient justification for actions on the scale of &quot;invade another country&quot; or &quot;overturn an election&quot;.<p>Nobody should accept that any more.')
