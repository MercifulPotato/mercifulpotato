That may sound like C++, but C++ is also the most complicated programming language in existence.<p>What makes it worse is that complication doesn&#x27;t even exist for &quot;good&quot; technological reasons; it only exists for inertial, industrial reasons like compatibility with C and 1980s naivete -- both because of and in spite of it, since, like the other person said, even more complexity was bolted on to try to force new lessons without breaking backwards compatibility.<p>I used to love C++, since I thought its complexity was somehow, fundamentally necessary for a lang to be a &quot;fancier C&quot;. Once I learned Rust and found out that was not true, I now hate C++ with a passion and can&#x27;t wait until it completely displaces C++, which it should do ASAP[0]. :D<p>THAT SAID, some people (who are much better programmers than I am), say that C++ is the most expressively versatile language around, which is at least a &quot;good&quot; technological reason for its enduring existence. That&#x27;s one I can&#x27;t relate to, though, since the people who are saying that tend to be talking about very advanced, byzantine aspects of C++ that I never got to.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;tbEohzT.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;tbEohzT.png</a>')
