That’s consistent with a loss valuation in the range of millions of dollars. In contrast, Swartz’s lawyers thought that Swartz might get just probation, which is consistent with a loss calculation at or less than $10,000.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;volokh.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;the-criminal-charges-against-aaron-swartz-part-2-prosecutorial-discretion&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;volokh.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;01&#x2F;16&#x2F;the-criminal-charges-against-aa...</a><p>&gt;So, realistically, Swartz was facing anything from probation to a few years in jail if he went to trial — depending largely on how you value the loss he caused — and either a 4 months in jail or 0-6 months in jail if he pled guilty.')
