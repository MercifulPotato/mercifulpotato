I&#x27;m really happy about this news and hope it sticks over the long-run. These new plant-based burgers are basically zero penalty ways to eat more responsibly. They taste about as good as the normal &quot;ok&quot; burger from FastFoodJoint(TM), cost about the same, and are less worse for the planet and everybody on it.<p>It&#x27;s also more accepting for people who have various dietary restrictions and opens up an entirely new, mediocre, but fast&#x2F;cheap dining experience.<p>One thing to note is that after some initial offerings, Burger King has yet to really keep their plant burger in the weekly coupon deluge I get. Meaning if I want like 2 entire burger meals I can get it for under $10 with the right coupon. But if I want their Impossible Whopper I still end up paying full-price for it.<p>So yes, if the plant burgers were cheaper than the alternative there really wouldn&#x27;t be much of a reason to eat the originals any more.')
