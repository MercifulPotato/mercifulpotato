COBOL is a domain-specific language for implementing commercial&#x2F;financial batch processing jobs, no more, no less. With adequate control over decimal arithmetic and established declarative practices for structured file exchange, subroutine reuse, and job control. Based on a language spec with reasonable portability. It&#x27;s not about good or bad but fitness for a purpose. COBOL programs can be  very clear and to the point compared to eg Java programs replacing them with lots of misguided OOP patterns and metaprogramming.')
