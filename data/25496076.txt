Patients go to a hospital that accepts their insurance, for example, but get treated there by an emergency room physician who doesn’t. Such doctors often bill those patients for large fees, far higher than what health plans typically pay.<p>How do courts uphold this? You go to a restaurant, they say you can buy the tasting menu for $100, but they have a temp chef working that day which will cost you $50 extra, which you find out as you&#x27;re paying.<p>I mean you might even be unconscious when this is happening?<p>EDIT<p>Actually someone brought up an important point. If you go to a restaurant, you are kinda expected to know that there&#x27;s taxes and tipping to pay. Do the US courts think the same of healthcare? &quot;You were in a hospital, you should have known that the bill is always higher than the sticker price?&quot;<p>It would surprise me as a European.')
