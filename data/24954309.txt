Item(by='grifball', descendants=None, kids=[24963427], score=None, time=1604171442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947680, text='Edit to my previous comment: there are 10 candidates, not 12<p>I&#x27;m new to these terms, but when I look up &quot;condorcet winner&quot; in on wikipedia, it&#x27;s defined as: &quot;the candidate that wins a majority of the vote in every head-to-head election&quot;<p>So, I&#x27;m assuming &quot;every head-to-head election&quot; would be 10 factorial elections in our case (one for each pair).<p>Let&#x27;s look at a couple of these elections and then extrapolate on the rest of them:<p>J vs A:<p>Voters 2 and 3 didn&#x27;t put A on the list, while they did indicate that they liked J, so they would vote for J. Only Voter 1 would vote for A.<p>D vs A:<p>Again, two voters didn&#x27;t put D on the list (1 &amp; 3), but did indicate that they liked J, while only one voter (voter 2) likes D over A.<p>You can see that, for each candidate besides J, only one voters like them, while all voters at least like J a little. This means that J will win &quot;every head-to-head election&quot; and thus be the condorcet winner.<p>The only problem with this proof currently is that STAR doesn&#x27;t explicitly elect a winner, so therefore it is not &quot;choosing the wrong winner&quot; as it isn&#x27;t choosing any candidate. It is eliminating the condorcet winner though, which is concerning, and I believe a more complicated example would show STAR choosing a non-condorcet winner.<p>I like STAR more than RCV after reading up on STAR more. I believe that approval voting might be better though, as it completely elimintates the spoiler effect I believe. Though it may have other problems.<p>Thinking about this more, I believe a condorcet winner can be chosen with RCV (and STAR with some assumptions) just by changing the tallying system. I was able to dicern from my example who the condorcet winner was, so why not do the same in an election? Just simulate all head-to-head elections to find the condorcet winner. I must be missing something.<p>Here&#x27;s a scenario where STAR elects a candidate that is not the condorcet winner:<p><pre><code>  Voter 1:\n    5 for B !\n    4 for C\n    3 for D\n    2 for E\n    1 for A !\n  Voter 2: \n    5 for G !\n    4 for H\n    3 for I\n    2 for J\n    1 for A !\n  Voter 3: \n    5 for L\n    4 for M\n    3 for N\n    2 for A !\n    1 for B !\n  Voter 4: \n    5 for Q\n    4 for B !\n    3 for S\n    2 for T\n    1 for A !\n  Voter 5: \n    5 for V\n    4 for W\n    3 for G !\n    2 for Y\n    1 for A !\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve marked important votes with a &#x27;!&#x27;. All others are unique votes for candidates with no support.<p>In this scenario, B and G get the top two scores with 9 and 8. B wins the election with 3 votes (voters 1, 3, and 4) over G&#x27;s two votes (voters 2 and 5). A is the condorcet winner though as they win every head-to-head contest (with close elections (3-to-2), against B and G). A was eliminated though, as they only scored 6 points.<p>This was complicated and too much fun to write, so it probably isn&#x27;t practical in a real world scenario.')
