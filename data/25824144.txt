You use the oxygen to burn hydrocarbons, to make energy and water and CO2.<p>To turn that into a closed cycle, you need to regenerate the water and CO2 into oxygen, to burn more hydrocarbons. The only way to do that is to add energy - on earth, we use solar energy via photosynthesis, but in space, you could use solar or nuclear energy via some chemical process.<p>But if you have the energy to regenerate the oxygen, why not just use it? Why make oxygen and then burn the hydrocarbons?<p>And why bother burning more hydrocarbons when a by-product of the regeneration process is carbon, a perfect fuel!')
