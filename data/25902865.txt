It says it&#x27;s legal to store above 30L and below 275L of petrol if you inform the local Petroleum Enforcement Authority.<p>Even above 275L, it says you need a license - it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s illegal.<p>Fuel does go off, but if you have reason to store it, you probably have a use for it, so as long as you cycle the fuel, you can store an emergency supply indefinitely.')
