But this was a situation where I largely didn&#x27;t attend class, but knew what formulas I&#x27;d need to know to pass each exam. Like clockwork, about 48 hours before an exam I&#x27;d lock myself away and make a bunch of flashcards, then spend hours rote memorizing them. It worked, and it got me through the tests, but I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t really learn much.')
