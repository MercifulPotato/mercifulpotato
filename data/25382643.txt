Charging at that speed is only really useful for road trips where you&#x27;re sitting there waiting for charging to complete so you can go. If you&#x27;re charging while the car is parked at home for the night, what does it matter if it&#x27;s ten minutes or ten hours?<p>So then you only really need the very fast chargers at truck stops on the highway and the like, and then couldn&#x27;t those chargers just be given a hefty grid connection? The high voltage lines already run parallel to major highways.')
