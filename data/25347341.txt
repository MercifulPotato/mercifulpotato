It&#x27;s a miracle the two new models of PlayStation aren&#x27;t the PS-1000XM5 and PS-1000XM5D.<p>Same experience as the other commenters with my XM3s, sound great, battery life is great, USB-C charging is great (AirPods Max use Lightning again, thanks Apple), but the touch controls are <i>really bad</i>, using with multiple devices is annoying (XM4 improves the experience with two devices, but will still suck with more, maybe even worse because god knows how you manage which slot gets unpaired when you pair to a third device).<p><i>&gt; AirPods Max come with a soft, slim Smart Case that puts AirPods Max in an ultralow power state that helps to preserve battery charge when not in use.</i><p>Let me tell you about power buttons: you hold the button, and then you can keep your battery from dying without having to carry around a special case.<p>AirPods Max are probably really nice, but have enough stupid Apple things on them that I wouldn&#x27;t be looking at them unless they were the same price as Sony&#x27;s.')
