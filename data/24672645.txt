It&#x27;s a fascinating talk in general - Marty&#x27;s a <i>really</i> smart and engaging speaker. I remember his PowerPoint-less and notes-less lectures with fondness - he just really knew his stuff back to front, having starting dissecting the visual cortext of monkeys and moved on to fMRI imaging, including writing his own analysis software from scratch.')
