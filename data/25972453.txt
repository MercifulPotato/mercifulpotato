Let&#x27;s assume that I made enough from January to March that I exceed a payout position under a negative income tax system, but COVID-19 saw me lose my job in March and my income dried up since then.<p>When I report my income as of December 31st, 2020, I still made enough for the year that I won&#x27;t receive benefits, despite not having an income. That means that I will be unsupported through 2021 and won&#x27;t see the money until 2022, correct?<p>If it were UBI and I were paid on January 1st 2020, it would be clawed back on December 31st as I still made enough money, but I would receive another payment on January 1st 2021 to get me through the year where I have no income. Isn&#x27;t that the intent of UBI and not something afforded through negative income?<p>You could pay out a UBI-like stipend and then claw it back on the same day (December 31st, 2020), but is it really UBI at that point? That sounds like the negative income tax.')
