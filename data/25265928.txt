Item(by='lou1306', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606836258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260883, text='I found this critique misdirected. The thesis is that the <i>ending</i> of Metropolis, not the plot, has some fascist undertones. The author even admits:<p>&gt; while Metropolis might posit some ideas with regard to cooperation between the classes for the ‘greater good’<p>But the movie does not stop there. It actually says &quot;Gee, wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if there was some Mediator guy that made everyone get along?&quot;. That&#x27;s the &quot;slight nod&quot; I was referring to.<p>And the thesis that a movie is not leaning towards a certain ideology because it does not present <i>all</i> of its principles in spades is untenable. <i>Olympia</i> and <i>Triumph of the Will</i> also lack an &quot;evil Jewish caricature&quot; and &quot;enemy-exterminating technology&quot;, but does that means they &quot;object to the pillars of Nazism&quot;?<p>Edit: I should clarify, I do not want to diminish the artistic value of <i>Metropolis</i>, which I love. I am just pointing out that it&#x27;s better seen as a &quot;fairy tale&quot; (as Lang himself said) than as a &quot;political&quot; movie.')
