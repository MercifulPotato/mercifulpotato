No matter what, when it comes down to sitting down with them and asking them to write out a simple program without any technicalities, 9&#x2F;10 of them fail due to clearly not spending enough time just making things.<p>Are these big companies _really_ hiring juniors with this as their laundry list?<p>&gt; ...Write code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then test it out on a computer....<p>A junior to me who has spent a year banging away making real failing programs and can talk about what and where they struggled with is useful to me(and the company).<p>A junior who hasn&#x27;t built a single project, but can tell me about the one time they spent 4 months writing data structures on white boards is little more then a warm, but dead silent body in a design meeting.')
