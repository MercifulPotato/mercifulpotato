There&#x27;s still the obligation for situation response, but not the long, slow, sanity-robbing hypervigelance of 24h alertness obligations in all life activities.<p>Proofing systems against faults, drilling for specific responses, and looping in SWEs (such as yourself) to take on support obligations for their own stack, architeccture, build, and deploy decisions are also strongly recommended faault-proofing and response-expediting measures.')
