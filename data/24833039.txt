Many propositions are difficult to amend and require something as high as 67% of the legislature to change.  That is at least achievable with broad support.  However requiring 87.5% is in no way normal and some are calling it unprecedented[1].  It is high enough to make any changes practically impossible without another proposition.<p>The reason this is a perversion of democracy is because it is fundamentally a handful of companies banding together to buy their own law.  They are only able to do it because of the huge amount of money they have.  This is literally the most expensive ballot measure ever.  They are straight lying to the public about who support it and hoping they can convince enough people to vote yes.  It is a perfect combination of abusing the US&#x27;s lax laws on corporate political speech and California&#x27;s lax laws on propositions.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-07-07&#x2F;uber-lyft-ballot-measure-opposed-by-labor-groups" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-07-07&#x2F;uber-lyft...</a>')
