In terms of performance, feature-richness, customizability, etc it seems to be superior to the more popular browsers. Can it really all be explained by the fact that it isn’t “pushed” by being an OS default (Edge, Safari) or  by being suggested by the world’s most popular search engine (Chrome)? I don’t know what I’d do without Tree Style Tabs and the ability to irresponsibly open hundreds of tabs without worrying that the RAM usage is going to crash the browser!')
