Like the Pluto-Is-A-Planet? debacle, the generally accepted requirements and definitions were drawn up after the fact specifically to exclude ALH84001, in order to end an embarrassing controversy and provide funding for more missions (why go to Mars when you can just pick up rocks in Antarctica instead?) rather than answer a scientific question.')
