Some cancers can be better targeted with chemo by first stressing the body with a fast. The non cancerous cells identify the fast as a time to set up guards for harshness, but the cancerous cells do not. So the cancerous cells get hit full blast by the chemo while the healthy cells are prepared from the reaction to the fast. I would posit though that fasts are probably a better way to generally help fighting cancers than a life of yearly coronavirus infections.')
