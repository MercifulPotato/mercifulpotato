To some extent it&#x27;s hard to explain the benefits because once you get past the more &#x27;ideological&#x27; issues (separation of concerns, etc.), it&#x27;s really much more about how it affects the <i>flow</i> of day to day work. I don&#x27;t think any arguments would&#x27;ve really convinced me, but because of the excitement around here I gave it a shot, and was convinced by seeing how my project grew without many of the usual CSS issues I&#x27;d run into (as well as the convenience of just not having to switch to a stylesheet file most of the time).<p>But I do understand how frustrating a comment like that can be.')
