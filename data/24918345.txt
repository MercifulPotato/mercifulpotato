My final thought is that you should look for another marketing term and to not only label your service javascriptless, but try to find another interesting point like e.g. more compatible for devices for people with disabilities. Also bringing back an old look and feel from a service that changed a lot overs years would be appealing. Try to add value that goes along with javascriptless.')
