Item(by='S_A_P', descendants=None, kids=[24954399], score=None, time=1604165113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951606, text='Once I &#x27;switched over&#x27; Dark Mode completely &#x27;light mode&#x27; is very visually jarring to me. In fact when I opened this article I found it ironic that it was in light mode until I noticed the switch at the bottom left corner of the page. I have even taken to using registry hacks to make SSMS.exe display in dark mode. For the most part it works flawlessly, but you end up with a few context menus that have black text hardcoded so they are hard to read. Im hoping that will eventually become an officially supported option soon...')
