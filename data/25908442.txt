IMO the future of data ownership is self hosting from devices like raspberry pi&#x27;s and upcycled Android phones.<p>What works now:<p>* Tunnel proxies[0] like ngrok. You can get an HTML page on the internet in 2 minutes with ngrok.<p>* Software like Caddy which simplifies certificate management.<p>What&#x27;s needed:<p>* IPv6 and ISPs to drop NAT so we don&#x27;t need proxies. Good luck.<p>* More upload throughput. Good luck.<p>* Services that make it <i>much</i> easier to register a domain name and manage DNS. Should be easier than buying and setting up a phone. This is ripe for the picking.<p>* Software designed with federated self hosting in mind. Like Inrupt Solid and similar projects.<p>OT: Text-to-speech has gotten really impressive these days. Took me a solid minute to figure it out.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anderspitman&#x2F;awesome-tunneling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anderspitman&#x2F;awesome-tunneling</a>')
