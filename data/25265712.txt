If i want to do something (hobby, personal project....), I start at 9, and work until &quot;too late&quot;.<p>If you go to sleep early, and wake up at (eg.) 5 in the morning, start work at 8, you have (eg.) 1 hour to get ready and commute + 2 hours of free time.<p>If anything &quot;goes wrong&quot; in my project, i have to debug, retry, fix, cut and cut again (and it&#x27;s still too short),... doing this in the morning,it  means, that you interrupt your pleasure-work at the moment where you&#x27;re most productive (and where the thing you&#x27;re doing is most &quot;fun&quot;&#x2F;fulfiling). I can always go to sleep an hour later, or two, or five... most people are not that flexible with their jobs.<p>This is just my personal experience and opinion though.')
