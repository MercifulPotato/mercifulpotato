It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re being asked to give up an organ or something; you&#x27;re being asked to protect yourself, and protect those unfortunate enough not to be able to get the vaccine themselves as well.  Rather than quibbling over percentages, why not ask yourself what ethical foundation a healthy person could have to not get the vaccine once it&#x27;s been proven safe and effective.')
