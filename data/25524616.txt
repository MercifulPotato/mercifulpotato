The main issue in this particular case was that I never work with Excel, so I was shipped Excel files via Google Sheets (since I have no Excel license on my Mac). I was mostly trying to get into some environment that I was comfortable with so I could work confidently while others were waiting.  Datasette was the best tool I could think of that would allow me full SQL access while also presenting a web page others could grok easily. The terminal is home for me, but I think it&#x27;s off-putting to some, and Datasette bridges that nicely.')
