Changes to the audio stream such, as stop&#x2F;start&#x2F;volume control, can be achieved with much lower latency using buffer rewriting or by applying changes lower down the stack where the buffers are smaller, or both. By default PulseAudio will buffer ~2000ms of audio from clients [1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedesktop.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;pulseaudio&#x2F;doxygen&#x2F;structpa__buffer__attr.html#aa7e8f3348cbda863b6f1dd55a9024b7a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedesktop.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;pulseaudio&#x2F;doxygen&#x2F;structpa...</a>')
