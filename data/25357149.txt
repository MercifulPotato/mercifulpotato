That trivial case in LaTeX led me to question the whole premise of the article since the example seemed to be cherry picking end users who didn&#x27;t know how to use Word, or at least a case where the person who setup the document didn&#x27;t know how to use Word and the editors did not have the authority to fix the issue properly.')
