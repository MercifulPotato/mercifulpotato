He is a retired hardware engineer&#x2F;software entrepreneur who built a few businesses on top of SCO&#x27;s Unix back in the day. All the licensing (and floppys) are long gone but there exists a few towers that still boot. In the spirit of archiving all his work, he is now systematically DD&#x27;ing the SCSI drives onto external usb harddrives, moving them onto modern hardware and creating bootable VMware images.\nI am sure that once VMware and etc catch up with the new Apple Silicon&#x2F;ARM instruction, we won&#x27;t be hearing much from people like the author who fear architecture and technology changes.')
