Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606879615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25272879, text='<i>&gt; The actual most that objectively happens is such routine banal minor infraction enforcement and intrusive stops that affect a minority of the population</i><p>No, this still isn&#x27;t &quot;most&quot; of what the legal system deals with. It&#x27;s a large fraction of what the <i>criminal</i> legal system deals with, but most legal cases are civil, not criminal. That&#x27;s why I took the trouble to draw the key distinction between those two types of cases.<p>As far as criminal law is concerned, the way to minimize police harassment of citizens for no good reason is to minimize the things that are crimes. For example, the war on drugs is insane: there is no reason to criminalize mere possession of a drug. Just that one single change would drastically reduce the number of people the police can harass (and just freeing all of the people who are currently in jail for non-violent drug possession would drastically reduce the number of people in jail--and a disproportionate fraction of those would be poor and minorities, exactly the people we <i>want</i> to give more protection from police harassment). But there are many, many other laws on the books that could be eliminated on similar grounds: they criminalize behavior that shouldn&#x27;t be criminalized and the laws can&#x27;t possibly be enforced as written, so the end result is to give the police a much larger selection of excuses to harass people when they feel like it.<p>But this &quot;fix&quot; for criminal law doesn&#x27;t work by fixing how the system deals with cases that are before it (things like reducing the variation in sentencing); it works by <i>eliminating</i> a huge set of cases altogether--the system no longer even sees them because the system is no longer criminalizing acts that shouldn&#x27;t be crimes.<p>The problem is that a similar fix doesn&#x27;t work for civil cases, precisely <i>because</i> there is no simple way to draw bright lines to separate disputes that should be dealt with by the legal system and disputes that shouldn&#x27;t.')
