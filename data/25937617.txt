This isn&#x27;t some sophisticated group with plans, this is a bunch of randos making jokes on the internet.  If you have a large enough starting pool (like say a subreddit with 3 million followers), you&#x27;ve got a pretty big force even if it&#x27;s just a small fraction of them buying a single stock for the lulz.  And once the price starts moving up, even more will join in without you asking.  If all of those people are using their play money then they aren&#x27;t getting hurt at all.<p>But with that said, u&#x2F;DeepFuckingValue started his YOLO over a year ago- he was super committed and it finally came around.  How many other idiots did something similar and went bankrupt?  How many will try it because they saw it happen this time?')
