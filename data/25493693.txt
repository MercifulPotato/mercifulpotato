I really think it has the potential to displace both bash and zsh.<p>My impression has always been that zsh is where cool new features go first, and then bash plays catch up.  I remember longing for associative arrays in bash while zsh and ksh already had them.  What finally got me to move to zsh was colorized syntax; it makes some of my typos very obvious before I press Enter.  In general zsh is still more pleasant for interactive use, but I still write scripts in bash since it is everywhere.')
