The fact that git is centralized or decentralized crosses our minds precisely zero times per week.<p>In the absolute worst case where Microsoft somehow loses everyones&#x27; issue&#x2F;PR&#x2F;project data (assuming non-enterprise cloud hosted account), we could still rebuild with whoever has the latest master copy on their local. Presumably, one of our developers must have made the latest commit so this should work out always. We have a process where we include the issue numbers in our commits, so it would be possible to reconstruct a large portion of these with inference across commit history. Personally, I trust Microsoft to safeguard our business data more than I trust our 7 person team w&#x2F; a $2000&#x2F;m AWS budget.<p>Ultimately, I think the objective of making all things around your source control technology look &amp; talk like your source control technology is a huge mistake. Issues and code are completely orthogonal things that intersect in very narrow ways. These intersections are hugely valuable, but we are not interested in aligning the planes of functionality.')
