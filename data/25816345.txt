At first advertising links only tracked origin (website), so announcers could target right website to put links on it. But soon advertisers realized you could gain more granular information in using more active technology like cookies, gifs, flash, etc. So they began tracking users and their journey through all websites with all privacy problems it entails.\nI think in terms of privacy the only level acceptable is the one you have to deliberately have to engage with to start &quot;tracking&quot; (that means advertising content must be displayed alongside publisher content and not personalized nor tracked through advertising company if the user hasn&#x27;t engaged with).<p>I also think that marketing&#x2F;advertising is bad since it distorts value perception but i remain pragmatic and we can&#x27;t ban all advertising that easily.')
