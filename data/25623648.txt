That they get used and abused, or people come up with terrible names (ClassFactoryFactory) is more a lack of taste than anything — but knowing that such patterns exist and their utility is a requirement of any tradesman seeking to move above novice. The name isn’t as much needed, but it makes it trivial to google.<p>But again, these are <i>patterns found in the wild</i> — it intends to document problems &amp; solutions that programmers have encountered, and it’s a pattern because it comes up often enough — which implies that you will likely encounter similar problems and (perhaps discovered on your own) implement similar solutions.')
