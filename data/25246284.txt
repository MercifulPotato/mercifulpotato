Competition in this context means that the end user is free to select any device from any manufacturer, and can expect his applications to run roughly in the same way and with similar performance on comparable hardware, without repurchasing them, without getting locked to a proprietary application store that takes a pound of flesh from the developers etc.<p>The competition between walled gardens, ex. Apple vs. Android, is not conducive to a consumer friendly outcome, see for example the Windows vs. everybody else competition of the previous era. A single proprietary platform will gain a critical mass and people will orient themselves naturally to the system that can run their applications.<p>An Android subsystem running on Windows has the chance to be exceptionally close to the hardware and provide a near native experience.')
