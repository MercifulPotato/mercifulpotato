I do ok-ish on dating apps at home, it&#x27;s not fun but I could get a date or two a month if I made a consistent effort to message people. Maybe a short relationship or a handful of hook-ups a year if I&#x27;m lucky.<p>In northern Italy, Spain, south of France, I got virtually no matches at all. However in the week or so I spent in Scandinavia, almost every woman I swiped right on matched back, many of them messaged as well. I would consider men and women in Scandinavia somewhat more attractive on average than people elsewhere and of course vastly more attractive than I am. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t speak any Danish!')
