Fun fact (though probably not as surprising to an HN crowd as it is to most people I tell this to), VLC can also be used to convert media to different formats, AND works as a quick ad-hoc media server if you want to display something on a TV.  This can be really handy if you have a video file in a weird format and want a way to quickly watch it on a device that doesn&#x27;t support weird formats.<p>I think I&#x27;m going to donate.  Keep up the good work folks!')
