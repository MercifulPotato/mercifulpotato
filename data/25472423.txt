With VS, I&#x27;m <i>very</i> used to slowdowns and even total freezes for several seconds (which people like to attribute to ReSharper, but IME they happen plenty even without ReSharper) - for a big, full-features IDE, once Rider has started, it feels <i>really</i> snappy, and puts to bed the long-held beliefs that Java is slow.<p>Just opened a big solution in both VS and Rider to confirm:<p><pre><code>  - VS was really laggy after opening, pinning all 8 Xeon E3 cores for 2 full minutes!\n  - VS memory sitting at 1.3GB, plus another 0.9GB for ReSharper\n  - Rider took 22 seconds to load the solution, then used a bit of CPU for 30s (but was totally responsive in that period)\n  - Rider memory sitting at 1.1GB\n</code></pre>\nSo assuming you use ReSharper, Rider uses a lot less memory, otherwise it&#x27;s above the same. But still, for me Rider is way more responsive for editing, debugging, everything. And more stable too.')
