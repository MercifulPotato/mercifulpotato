As in, there is a dearth of computer science -- basic data structures and algorithms -- for efficiently reasoning about spatiotemporal relationships of the type common to multimodal sensor data models at scale. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft, companies mentioned in the article, are addressing this technology gap in a meaningful way (I have some contact with their programs). They are solving very narrow cases that don&#x27;t generalize or scale usefully.<p>A question I ask when doing due diligence on &quot;spatial computing&quot; technology is what computer science problems did you solve to create the technology? The common answer is &quot;none&quot; and most people dabbling in the space aren&#x27;t even aware hard computer science problems exist as prerequisites to building such technology unless they&#x27;ve been banging their head against it for a while. That&#x27;s the state of the spatial computing market today. We also know that it is (currently) impossible to build such a thing by sprinkling some magic spatial computing dust on open source technology stacks -- they can&#x27;t express the necessary mechanics. You&#x27;ll be writing a lot of code from first principles, it isn&#x27;t a business execution problem.<p>We&#x27;ve had petabytes of this type of sensor data for decades, and the vision and desire to build digital twins with that data, that part isn&#x27;t new. There are hardcore technical reasons this doesn&#x27;t exist as a real thing, it isn&#x27;t that no one has ever thought of spatial computing before. To make matters worse, most of the companies with the expertise and desire to use such a platform lack the expertise and execution to create it. Creating such a platform has to come from somewhere else.<p>It is <i>possible</i> to build a spatial computing platform today that actually works, the computer science challenges have solutions, but the combination of domain expertise and computer science skillset to execute it is extremely rare at the moment. That said, spatial computing will be a trillion dollar platform business once someone pulls it off.')
