There may be certain features of the system that promote it, but I don&#x27;t think it is close to provable that the US&#x27;s system of government innately requires a duopoly. The duopoly exists for historic and cultural reasons.<p>&gt; Name one country that does so with a strong, separately elected (not by the legislature) executive who is elected (directly or indirectly) by a method which doesn&#x27;t involve ranked choices and uses single-member national legislative districts with majority&#x2F;runoff or plurality elections.<p>First of all the US has a two round system in most states (most states are open primaries). So France falls into this category.<p>&gt; Because some of us have actually studied comparative government and the structural incentives and effects of different electoral systems.<p>And some of us have actually lived under the electoral process and politics of other countries (in addition to studying them).<p>&gt; The duopoly problem is 100% institutional<p>No problem is 100% institutional. That is facile. Culture obviously plays a role in some regard (why is the opinion on whether &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; should have won an Oscar a partisan thing?).')
