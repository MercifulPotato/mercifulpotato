We all know the stereotype of the trust fund kid who is lazy and ineffectual.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of emotional baggage around rich people, but if you strip it down to individual situations it&#x27;s pretty simple.  I&#x27;ve worked for people ranging from small business owners scraping out $50k a year all the way up to billionaires.  How hard they work has no correlation to the money they have.  I don&#x27;t resent a boss with money, I resent a boss who isn&#x27;t working as hard as me, and most founders&#x2F;business owners I&#x27;ve worked for have worked harder than everyone else.')
