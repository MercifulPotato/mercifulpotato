There certainly exist well-validated personality inventories that reflect the scientific consensus that personality can be represented within the  Big Five or similar HEXACO frameworks, but they bear no resemblance to Myers Briggs. Frankly at this point itâ€™s irresponsible and borderline unethical to keep Myers Briggs alive as anything other than an embarrassing historical footnote.')
