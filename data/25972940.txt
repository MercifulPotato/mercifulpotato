Item(by='yarcob', descendants=None, kids=[25973035], score=None, time=1612040479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969675, text='Here in Austria&#x2F;Germany I see these dark patterns only from Amazon. They always try to get you to subscribe to prime, they mislead you with delivery times (my girlfriend has Prime and the website shows LONGER delivery times for her. Same item, browser signed into my account without Prime: shorter delivery time)<p>I want to support the local economy, so unless an item is only available on Amazon, I try to avoid buying from them. I&#x27;ve ordered from lots of different online stores in the past few years, and in my experience these dark patters are pretty rare.')
