Now every application has some sort of Application Manager that requires computer to be online in order to enable access to the app (some require to be online once a week etc.) and these managers send who knows what to their servers. I think for starters it should be illegal to require user to install such managers in order to have access to their app or at very least give an option for offline authorisation. There is no reason for such apps to exist other than to spy on users.')
