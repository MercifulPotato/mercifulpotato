Wikipedia for example does not use OWL and use their own mechanisms.<p>The benefit of OWL is that SPARQL reasoning (i.e. subclass&#x2F;subproperty handling) for OWL is well defined where with Wikidata there is basically no reasoning and you have to do reasoning in your SPARQL query (manually ask for instances of subclasses).<p>For modelling measurements, have a look at the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;vocab-ssn&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;vocab-ssn&#x2F;</a>.')
