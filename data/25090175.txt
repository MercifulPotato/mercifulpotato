Two key characteristics of Northern California today: (1) has most all the State&#x27;s water (2) has a great deal of the State&#x27;s fires. Now as a negotiation offer, the water in theory should be a strong hold for the State to put ample effort for deforestation, but as of today water is a Human Right (thus Southern California has a non-negotiable right to the Northern water) and the bloated bill for forest fire management put perhaps a 100th of the effort needed for forest-management practices.')
