That&#x27;s perfectly acceptable if you don&#x27;t like my opinion. I respect that. No harm done there. :) It&#x27;s true that everything I know about EVs are from personal experience of people I know. Believe it or not I&#x27;m happy that coal is on its way out. I wish it happened sooner.<p>My sister owned a Tesla model 3 in California for 3 years. She had a lot of fun in it and used it as a daily commute. You&#x27;re right that in most cases a regular person won&#x27;t have any problems. They had problems with long waiting times at superchargers at charging stations during long weekends and public holidays. Once they literally had to wait for hours just to get a chance to charge it. She did lose some battery capacity and sold it.<p>Hydrogen takes 4 to 5 minutes to fill up as opposed to 30 to 40 minutes for EV with supercharging. There is no comparison there. Also using a fast charger all the times can damage batteries. I&#x27;m not saying Hydrogen cars are practical now. They could be in future. I hope it is.')
