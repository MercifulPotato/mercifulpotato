No Q-Anon nonsense.  No white supremacy.  No baseless accusations against political opponents.  A place where people carefully consider their positions, post research from reputable sources, and avoid the absolute nuttery that infests all of the conservative spaces on Reddit, Parler, Facebook, Twitter, etc...?<p>One of the reasons moderate Republicans are going the way of the Dodo is they have no place to form a community.
