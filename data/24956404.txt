Item(by='kens', descendants=None, kids=[24956599], score=None, time=1604190861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956275, text='The bits are in a matrix, with sense lines in silicon vertically and row select lines in metal horizontally. When a row select line is activated, 128 transistors are turned on and each sense line is connected to the single capacitor in that row. Thus, 128 bits are read in parallel.<p>Thus, each horizontal row select line is connected to 128 different transistor gates, in other words connected to 64 of the diagonal poly 2 regions.<p>The confusing part is that the rows zig-zag a bit to improve the density. In other words, the physical rows in the photo don&#x27;t quite match the electrical&#x2F;logical rows. Look at the photo and imagine pulling it apart like a zipper. Then shift the middle part up half a step so the capacitors line up. Then the logical rows are all in a straight line. Hopefully that explanation isn&#x27;t entirely confusing. In brief, the two capacitors with the same poly 2 diagonal are in the same electrical row, so they are selected together (along with 126 other capacitors).<p>I&#x27;ll probably write more about this, so let me know if there is a clearer way to explain this :-)')
