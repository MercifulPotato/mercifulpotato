Of course the GPS antennas are probably oriented facing the Earth, but you&#x27;d still see GPS satellies on the far side (with a bit more path loss). Since GPS has a 43 dB processing gain from the modulation scheme, and thermal noise levels on the moon are similar to Earth (I think?), that means you need -150 dBm or so at the receiver. I believe newer GPS satellites have an EIRP of 50 dBm or so, so receiving GPS signals on the moon might work without even using a high gain antenna. Use of a high gain antenna would probably completely compensate for the increased path loss to the moon.')
