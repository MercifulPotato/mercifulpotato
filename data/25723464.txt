Itâ€™s not a design decision against which I have any opposition so long as draggable space remains (and there usually is; I complained to Apple during the Big Sur beta period and they made some spacing adjustments).<p>But I agree, those icons coming and going can make using them something of a pain. It also makes less clear what apps actually <i>have</i> them. An option in System Preferences to make proxy icons show all the time would be lovely.')
