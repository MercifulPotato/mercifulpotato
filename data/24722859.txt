I most certainly support changes to the status quo, and I would simultaneously take the same stance as Coinbase with regards to politics in the workplace. I&#x27;ve never seen a workplace embrace political activism without creating a hostile workplace environment for a significant segment of workers.<p>This is kind of the same kind of fallacy as people who try to say that atheism is a religion. No, it&#x27;s the absence of religion. In the same vein, an apolitical workplace isn&#x27;t support for the status quo. It&#x27;s the absence of any political, <i>either</i> for or against the status quo.')
