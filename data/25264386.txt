The people who make the laws don&#x27;t understand (or really care about) the potential of networked general purpose computers who can send arbitrary messages and perform arbitrary computations. What they know is platforms and services: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Signal, ...<p>The problem is that things that don&#x27;t fit this mold will &#x27;accidentally&#x27; become illegal by virtue of compliance being impossible for the authors of such software.<p>Look at the upcoming EU regulation about encryption, terrorism related content, copyright enforcement. Everything is aimed at the platform companies but in effect regulates all software as though it were a platform. There always has to be an employee who can process takedown requests, or provide access to cops.<p>In the eyes of &quot;serious people&quot; making laws, this problem does not exist, because everything that lives on the internet is a platform, backed by a corporation. There is no attempt to suppress alternatives, they are just not acknowledged to exist and matter, and thus become banned by collateral damage. If they did exist and had tons of users, those laws could never pass.<p>The internet used to be a series of tubes, now it&#x27;s a series of platforms.')
