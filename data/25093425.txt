Their core has a gigantic L1 instruction cache, rather a lot of L1 TLB entries (4x more than Intel), large(r) pages by default, and many other aspects.  L1 TLB entries in particular are a well-known problem for x86 performance so it&#x27;s a real mystery why Intel doesn&#x27;t simply add more of them. x86 is probably married to 4K pages forever, because of god-damned DOS, whereas Apple can make the default page size be whatever they want it to be. People with high requirements can jump through a million hoops to get their x86 program loaded into hugepages, but on Apple&#x27;s platform you&#x27;re getting it for free.')
