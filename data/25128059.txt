Item(by='dubcanada', descendants=None, kids=[25128085], score=None, time=1605639589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127468, text='Seems to be getting hugged to death.<p>From the brief amount of time playing with it, it seems to be rather basic in it&#x27;s outfit generation.<p>For example I picked an orange tennis sweater. And it recommended black full zip jacket (to go over the orange tennis sweater? so basically they recommend you not wear a orange tennis sweater?), hot pink trousers and white espadrilles.<p>So it seems to match color with a random item (hot pink trousers and a black top? and white shoes?). The shoes are also summer shoes, and if you are wearing a sweater with a zip up jacket over top you probably need more then a single ply fabric shoe with rope soles.<p>Second time it picked a brown fleece jacket to go over your orange sweater, with khaki pants, and light blue tennis sneakers. First why would you ever wear a fleece jacket over top of a tennis sweater, usually tennis sweaters are knit so you are wearing sheep on top of sheep, unless you are playing in -20c probably a bit excessive.<p>Moral of the story is it seems to be more of a random clothing articles mixed with colour combinations then an actual outfit generator.')
