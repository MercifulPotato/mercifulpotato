Voting is voluntary, which causes highly-motivated single-issue voters to be overrepresented. Then there&#x27;s the primary system, which is the same problem squared.<p>It used to be that politicians could pander a little to the base during a primary and then &quot;run to the centre&quot; in the general. Those days are gone, because &quot;being primaried&quot; is a real and persistent risk.<p>The practical upshot is that the system is structured to favour fringe voices rather than the median voter.')
