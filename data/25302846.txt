Apple generates largest revenue per processor by a wide margin. This means they can afford to pay premium to be first at everything and have  6-12 month lead. TSMC&#x27;s 5nm volume production and  Apple&#x27;s 2020 launch was timed to go together since 2017 (if go back to TSMC conference call you can hear them talking about it without mentioning details).')
