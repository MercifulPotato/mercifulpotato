Very cool.<p>I loved this little detail as well. Now that I know about this I&#x27;ll probably pull it out of the box and look at it in more detail, where I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered before.<p>&gt; but I also expect Sony will have some PS5 branded SSDs right in the Best Buy gaming accessories isle so hopefully too many people don&#x27;t get burned by this. Definitely prefer it to Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary strategy.<p>I expect that this generation, due to price increases in games, that I do a lot less buying of random games because I happen to be in the store. Which will force me to finish the games I have before moving on, waiting for games to go on sale. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have much concern about storage space this time around. I&#x27;ll keep a couple of online games on for good and some arcade games I can pickup and putdown easily. But otherwise, it&#x27;ll probably be buy game, install game, finish game, uninstall game.<p>We&#x27;ll see how this is impacted by how large the installs get I guess.')
