When China and the WHO claimed they were the basis for China&#x27;s success in containing the virus, pretty much everyone - including publications like the New York Times - uncritically regurgitated that claim. Same with places like (if I remember rightly) Taiwan using it for airport screening. Anyone who got their beliefs from the mainstream media would be left convinced that America was failing because it hadn&#x27;t adopted these successful measures from places like China.')
