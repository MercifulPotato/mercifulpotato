Pumps in IL worked fine with the car, but upon arriving in CA, I found that gas pumps will prematurely shut off, almost immediately upon pumping, regardless of how empty the tank is.  In order to prevent the premature shutoff, I have to lift the pump hose at about a 45 degree while pumping.<p>Any idea what&#x27;s going wrong here?  Is it my car or the pump?  Is there a difference between the pumps in IL vs CA?')
