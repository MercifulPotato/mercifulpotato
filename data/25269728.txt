In my case we used a slow language (although Python’s poor performance and its large bundle sizes are only indirectly related at best) and we had to spend a lot more by moving to ECS&#x2F;Fargate. If we were using Go, our bundle sizes would’ve been 30x smaller (I checked) and would’ve fit in a lambda easily. Not only would it have fit easily, it would have made a lot of progress before the Python version even finished importing its dependencies. And in top of all of that, it would have out-performed the Python version by a good order of magnitude. If anything, my anecdote supports the idea that Amazon wants you to use fast languages, especially now that they offer per-ms pricing for lambdas.')
