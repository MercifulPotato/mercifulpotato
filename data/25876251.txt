You&#x27;ll find it in thin &#x27;n light, budget and business laptops that will have more than enough power from a Zen 2 core. If you really absolutely need more power, you&#x27;ll know it and you&#x27;ll be shopping for a 5800H (or above).<p>If you don&#x27;t know enough about CPUs to even read reviews that compare the CPU to other CPUs, then you either don&#x27;t need the extra IPC of Zen 3 (and you won&#x27;t notice when you use your laptop day to day) or you just... don&#x27;t care.<p>If you care, get a 5600U&#x2F;5800U or H line and it will never affect you. The laptops these come in should be priced accordingly.')
