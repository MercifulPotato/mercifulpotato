There are boards based on their MPSoC family at very good prices (Ultra96 for around $250, only real thing that&#x27;s missing is Ethernet but it has WiFi). Embedded ARM cores and ultrascale+ fabric. Very hard to beat.<p>Zynq 7000 family is a more affordable entry point, but resources are more limited in every regard, and uses a slower, more power consuming process.<p>Lattice-based boards are great because they are supported by open source tooling, and available in many indie buildouts (ECP5 or or ice). They are not so high end though, by far, compared to Xilinx parts.<p>Intel (ex-Altera) seems to have good stuff, but not as advanced as Xilinx. They are used on the mist and mister systems for hardware retro game emulation, a quite active scene.')
