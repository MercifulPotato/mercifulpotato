For example, charging for some&#x2F;all of the the time&#x2F;distance from the driver&#x27;s origination point to the pickup point. That will necessarily make ride sharing more expensive in those places, but that&#x27;s because providing rides in those places is more expensive.<p>Yeah, definitely. I agree that to make it work they&#x27;ll have to raise prices. My guess is that they&#x27;ll have to raise prices by so much that riders decide to just drive themselves. If drivers must be paid minimum wage that might raise the cost of a ride by enough that in some locations there is no clearing price.<p>&gt; Another option that might work in tandem is to allow drivers to log in as a sort of &quot;if the offer is good enough I&#x27;ll take it&quot; sort of tier<p>AB5 is strict enough that this will not save Uber. You are an employee unless &quot;The person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entityâ€™s business.&quot; Though, they did experiment with this model [1] and I wonder why they decided not to pursue it. If they had allowed drivers to set their own prices that might have been enough to prevent AB5 from being passed.<p>&gt; 7 minutes is actually on the lowest end I&#x27;ve seen where I live, and that&#x27;s in a metro area of ~250k people. Usually it seems to be around 15-20 minutes.<p>Yeah, absolutely :) Sorry, I should have been more specific! In major cities it&#x27;s usually something like 2-3 minutes, I would not be surprised if it becomes 7 minutes once prop 22 fails. Wait times in places which are not major cities will increase by even more.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;1&#x2F;21&#x2F;21075062&#x2F;uber-test-california-drivers-set-prices-bidding-ab5-law-gig-workers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;1&#x2F;21&#x2F;21075062&#x2F;uber-test-califo...</a>')
