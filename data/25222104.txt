And to top it off, from this we conclude &quot;the disconnect&quot; is due to the <i>APIs</i>? Not, say, from the possibility that such blazing-fast components may very well not even <i>exist</i> in users&#x27; devices? I&#x27;m not saying the conclusions are wrong, but the logic surely doesn&#x27;t follow... and honestly it&#x27;s a little tasteless to criticize people&#x27;s understanding if you&#x27;re going to base the criticism on things they in all likelihood don&#x27;t even have access to.')
