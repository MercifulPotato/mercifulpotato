The moment I did an incremental compilation of a Rust project (5-10s) the fans kept at very noisy levels for at least a full minute.<p>It was awful. :(<p>I was at 40GB RAM (the stock soldered 8GB plus an extra 32GB stick). And for what it&#x27;s worth, an external 2560x1080 display. Maybe that was it? But IMO no, it activated fans on CPU load only. Still, maybe the extra strain on the video stack kept it at a higher temperature internally so it was quick to turn on the fans at the smallest of loads? Could be.<p>Glad it works well for you though. What OS do you use?')
