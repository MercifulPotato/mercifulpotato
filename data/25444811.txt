Item(by='ttul', descendants=None, kids=[25444882, 25445102], score=None, time=1608137618, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444577, text='My understanding is that a great deal of Bitcoin mining takes place in corrupt jurisdictions where power can be obtained for free from power producers that have been captured through bribes and other forms of revenue sharing with officials. That power is not necessarily carbon free.<p>It seems to me that the nature of Bitcoin as a pseudonymous currency actually facilitates and encourages illicit power stealing arrangements like this. In other words, itâ€™s pretty easy for me to just send you some of my freshly minted BTC from the mining farm your company is powering, and nobody is likely to ever find out.<p>Unless corruption can be rooted out (highly unlikely), there will be no incentive for Bitcoin mining energy to come from legitimate sources, never mind clean sources.')
