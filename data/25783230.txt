Exogenous testosterone will begin diminishing your natural testosterone production immediately. In theory there are ways to counteract this, but in practice it&#x27;s not guaranteed that someone can ever discontinue TRT once they&#x27;ve started. Even those who rebound may not return to their original, pre-TRT levels.<p>Testosterone is also interconnected with other hormone systems, which will also be disrupted by TRT. For many, TRT turns into a game of adjusting various medications up or down to try to get back to how they felt pre-TRT.')
