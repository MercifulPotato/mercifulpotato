In 1642 the Massachusetts Bay Colony made &quot;proper&quot; education compulsory<p>The link I gave points to several other educational models in the US before the importation of the Prussian model, and points out:<p>&gt; In fact, the “Prussian model” superseded an education system that actually did look like a factory. The monitorial system and its variants the Lancaster, the Bell, and the Madras systems, involved schools that were housed in large warehouses – larger often than many of the nascent factories at the time – with hundreds of students in one massive classroom with one teacher. Students were grouped (30 or so together) not by age but by reading proficiency, with more advanced students – “monitors” – assigned to tutor and train the others.<p>adding also that &quot;the major innovation of the Prussian model was in levying a tax to fund compulsory schooling, not in establishing a method for instruction&quot;.<p>I also don&#x27;t know what &quot;exactly like they do today&quot;, given that my experience in the US school system during the 1970s and 1980s seems rather different than what I read about during, say, the Depression era or the late 1800s.')
