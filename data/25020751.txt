(Sorry in advance for imprecise terminology...)<p>Lets say we have a molecule with two energetic orbital states.  An electron in the Ground state (G) can be lifted to Orbital 1 (O1) by photon with wavelength A, and can be lifted from there to Orbital 2 (O2) by a different photon of wavelength B. Photon B alone is too energetic to lift from G-&gt;O1, and not energetic enough to lift directly from G-&gt;O2, where photon A is exactly enough to lift from G-&gt;O1.  So the gate would be set by photon A raising the orbital from G-&gt;O1, and the gate is read by sending photon B which is only absorbed if A has already been absorbed.  Compose multiple such gates by designing a pair (or more) of molecules where the wavelengths of A &amp; B are swapped, so that the first molecule&#x27;s B photon is the second molecule&#x27;s A photon, etc.  Maybe recover energy from excited orbitals by passing a laser of each wavelength through all the molecules at the end of each &#x27;cycle&#x27;, inducing the molecule to emit any absorbed photons in a useful direction to be recycled.<p>Thoughts?')
