They launched the Starship on 3 Raptors, most importantly perfectly controlled the descend and correctly executed the flip and vertical landing. If the fuel pressure had been correct, even the landing would have worked, but that is a really small thing to correct.<p>The main thing, and that is why it was a success, was the in-flight control, especially on the descent and before the landing. Only real loss was 3 engines they might have reused otherwise.  But as the Starships themselves are extremely cheap to build - the next one is already mostly finished - it was basically considered expendable for the test.<p>Beyond understanding and fixing the fuel pressure issue, they just can proceed with their testing plans as scheduled.')
