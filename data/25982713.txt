And even if you do, external links are ranked lower by social media platforms.<p>Maybe, authors should create videos, however it seems people who have important things to say shy from video form. The question is if really video is the right choice for valuable content, or is not.<p>Personally I think it is not a right medium for valuable content, therefore social media lacking features supporting text are just forcing not only enthusiastic readers, but also new demographics to consume brain fast-food.<p>And it really is sad considering how much value has the Internet. I am thus glad that this place still exists.')
