Item(by='francislavoie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603484434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873458, text='&gt; I&#x27;d be willing to bet good money that you don&#x27;t write PHP without typehints and&#x2F;or Psalm&#x2F;PHPstan.<p>Yeah, think of it like Typescript. Same idea.<p>&gt; Also, I believe Swoole is process based, not thread or (true) async.<p>It&#x27;s a coroutine model, like Go. Very fast. But I don&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s primarily a chinese community, lots of the docs are in broken english. But it&#x27;s an impressive thing anyways.<p>IMO, you don&#x27;t need threading in PHP, there&#x27;s not really that many situations where it would help during a request-response flow. People generally delegate slow tasks to job queues, which often use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.php.net&#x2F;manual&#x2F;en&#x2F;function.pcntl-fork.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.php.net&#x2F;manual&#x2F;en&#x2F;function.pcntl-fork.php</a> to fork off workers. Works great.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not what I meant. My wording was poor. I meant specifically `callable`. You can&#x27;t typehint the inputs and outputs of `callable` parameters. So passing around lambdas, etc, is not robust&#x2F;safe.<p>You can though. `fn(SomeClass $foo) =&gt; $foo-&gt;doThing()`<p>&gt; and knowing that the inputs&#x2F;outputs line up with whatever you&#x27;re doing<p>Fair enough, but you can use reflection to look at the callable if you care enough. It rarely matters.')
