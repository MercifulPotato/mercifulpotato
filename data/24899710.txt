This kind of terrible reporting as always existed, but for some reason (luckily I guess) they never crossed over into national discourse the way that stories do online.<p>I never begrudged the store for carrying them and selling them. If Wal-Mart suddenly felt the need to arbitrate on the accuracy of every periodical they sold, I&#x27;m not sure if I would feel better or worse.<p>I also don&#x27;t know how to handle the people who are saying the story is fake or terribly reported, but we have a right to be misinformed if we want to be.')
