The people who seem to push and advance these systems seem to be (broad generalizations follow)<p>-Academics like Andy Matuschak who are trying to create better technology for learning or do work on really hard problems<p>-Productivity gurus like Nat Eliason and Tiago Forte who make money selling tutorials on how to use these systems.<p>For “The rest of us” there could probably be some gains from using these systems... but sticky notes, texts, notes app, Slack, wherever else you jot stuff suffice, and there’s a lot of administrative overhead &amp; habit change required. I think I am gradually implementing more “linked notes” into my work as systems like Microsoft Teams make it possible to combine a wiki and a file directory easily. But I’m skeptical that this is going to become mass market in the near term.')
