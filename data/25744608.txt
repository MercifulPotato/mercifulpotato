Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610445535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741364, text='&gt; It&#x27;s a metaphor.<p>Clearly, here&#x27;s a better beginning:<p>“Let me extend the metaphor a bit&quot;.<p>&gt; Speech is the drought of repeated lies about the illegitimacy of an unwelcome outcome drying out the underbrush of widespread discontent.<p>Did you mean hate speech? A drought is usually a negative. Sorry, I just can&#x27;t make sense of that.<p>&gt; And speech is the match tossed offhandedly aiming the mob you primed and egged on at the target you want to intimidate (and that&#x27;s the most charitable interpretation).<p>All very poetic but, again, I&#x27;m sorry but I can&#x27;t find any substance to it.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think we get to unring that particular bell<p>I wasn&#x27;t the one suggesting we do. You presented two causes - algos and lies, the negative outcome of the latter being magnified by the former - and then chose to suppress one. I think that&#x27;s a false choice as I can think of other possible ways to remedy the situation and would pursue them instead, but even if I only had the false choice then I wouldn&#x27;t pick suppression of speech. I can manage with a chronological feed, I was on Twitter and Facebook pretty early, it wasn&#x27;t bad enough for me to give up the foundation of liberal society. I even remember a time before the internet, it really wasn&#x27;t that bad.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think there is a way for them to back away from algorithmic ranking unless government regulation simply forbids it outright (which isn&#x27;t too likely)<p>What&#x27;s likelihood got to do with it? You&#x27;re just shrugging your shoulders and choosing to support the suppression of speech instead. It&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;ve made the argument that you care about free speech but the alternatives are unlikely. I don&#x27;t even see any evidence as to why it&#x27;s unlikely. Making a decision <i>based</i> on the likelihood makes little sense, it&#x27;s not a horse race.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure how useful HN itself would be if the front page wasn&#x27;t being automatically ranked…<p>I agree. Why would legislation of algorithms mean no algorithms? It doesn&#x27;t and it wouldn&#x27;t. Here are some viable alternatives:<p>- Social media sites give users control over the algorithms that decide their feed\n- Users get access to the tools for blocking et al, and the scoring of users. Why can&#x27;t I know that the person replying to me is likely to be a bot? Or has scored highly for trolling? Why can&#x27;t I know my own score? Why can&#x27;t I choose my own shadowbanning? No good reason other than the centralisation of power.\n- Companies over a certain size lose section 230 protections. This will encourage greater moderation on the large sites and foster competition from smaller ones.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are more.')
