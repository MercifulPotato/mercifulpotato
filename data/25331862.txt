The paper mentions that semantic richness seems to influence visual working memory (familiar but otherwise random geometric shapes are harder than celebrity faces). However, how do you know when an image is semantically rich for a given subject? Similarly, how did the researchers know when the experimental images were morphed enough to be semantically unrecognizable?')
