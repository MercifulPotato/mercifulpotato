Rust documentation and The Rust Book uses it for no good reason. Code in examples doesn&#x27;t change, and the way they are highlighted doesn&#x27;t change. In my opinion it clashes with the philosophy of the language - that as much as possible should be done before the code is run.<p>Aside from my pedantry, it causes computers to make more unnecessary computations and our civilization emits more carbon. It also affects me because I currently have an old CPU and it takes a few seconds for syntax highlighting to kick in. Every time I press &quot;Back&quot; in my browser, syntax highlighting needs to be recalculated as well.<p>Oh well, on the bright side I have an itch to scratch :-).')
