For what it&#x27;s worth I had the same experience with this book, but instead of blaming an artist whose book inspired thousands of Ruby programmers because it didn&#x27;t inspire me, I moved on and got the Pragmatic Programmer&#x27;s Ruby book instead, and I&#x27;ve had nearly 15 years of joyous Ruby programming in my career since. I&#x27;d say the main cause of you not learning Ruby was not this book, but your own behavior.')
