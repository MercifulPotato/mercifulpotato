I haven&#x27;t &quot;bought an album&quot; in over a decade, because virtually everything is instantly available at no additional charge beyond the one simple service I subscribe to. Short of all recorded content being <i>de facto</i> uncompensated, which is what the logical conclusion of Napster winning would have been, it&#x27;s hard to see an outcome here that would be better for consumers than the one we have.<p>I suspect we&#x27;ll be in a similar position with video content in 10 years as well. Already, I think it&#x27;s easy to make the case that we&#x27;re better off than we were in the status quo ante of cable bundles and video rentals.')
