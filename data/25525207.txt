We have all the tools available... Just model a city in Unreal Engine 4 (GTA 6 anyone?). Your sensors, like LIDAR could do ray-queries, cameras could render views, etc. It&#x27;s not 100% real, but probably real enough to learn the basics. Photorealistic graphics should be sufficient for AI to learn real-world interaction. In the end our whole world might be just that, a simulation. So I see zero reason why we couldn&#x27;t train a self-driving car AI in one.<p>And the coolest thing is that this could also be used as a basis for a AAA video game, and these tend to make billions as well these days, so it&#x27;s a win win for everyone. AI companies with funding should invest heavily into virtual reality and gaming, because they will need to perfect this to train their models.')
