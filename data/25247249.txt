Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25251026], score=None, time=1606677430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25246052, text='&gt;You&#x27;ve been living in a cave for the last several years if you haven&#x27;t watched everyone who questioned the narrative about the intelligence agencies and US global military empire smeared as Russian assets, from sitting Congresswomen<p>Is being a congresswomen supposed to be some sort of credential? All it means is you won a popularity contest. Keep in mind there are a few representatives that believe in qanon, so the bar is very low.<p>&gt;Who decides what is fringe, you? The CIA? Apparently Youtube though that the video in question was &quot;fringe&quot;. Who sets the standard for what information people are allowed to see and hear? For decades it has been the CIA.<p>Why is that question relevant? The initial claim was that espousing anti-establishment views will get you censored and&#x2F;or receive retaliation, but my examples clearly show that&#x27;s not the case.<p>At best, being anti-establishment is a <i>necessary but not sufficient condition</i> for retribution.<p>&gt;A false and predictable assertion from someone who forms their opinions based on an echo chamber of children on reddit. Some of us don&#x27;t want the rest of the media and the discourse to turn into the same.<p>I don&#x27;t get it, do the threads I&#x27;ve linked not anti- &quot;military industry&quot;, &quot;crime financial complex&quot;, or &quot;pretexts to war&quot;? Reddit might be biased, but I fail to see how this matters in the context of this arguments.')
