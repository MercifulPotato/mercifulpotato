On the one hand, I&#x27;m against Facebook censorship, especially of academics. On the other hand, the researchers (and journalists) are going to use this research to browbeat Facebook into more censorship (and specifically censorship of the right, though some non-mainstream progressives will be caught up in the dragnet as well) as they have already done with a ton of hit pieces [1].<p>What to do, what to do.<p>[1] Brings to mind the hit-piece:\n&quot;The Making of a YouTube Radical - The New York Times&quot; article. But there is an ongoing effort to continue pushing Facebook, Twitter and YouTube into more and more censorship of anyone deemed on the right and the Overton window keeps getting smaller and smaller. The situation with the Hunter Biden laptop story and NYPost is absolutely bonkers. Not only do journalists at mainstream center&#x2F;center-left news outfits not care that Twitter and Facebook outright decided that the story is false and therefore shouldn&#x27;t be shared by anyone and banned the account of their colleagues at NYPost .. but worse, actually applaud it and justify it.')
