Usually you get some minimal stupid fee of say 50 euro per month for &quot;being on call&quot; (usually during one week per month or so) and you only get paid for the hours if something actually happens.<p>This is shit because the 50 bucks does not make up for the enormous loss of flexibility in your free time.
