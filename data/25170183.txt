Not only it is a laughable notion [0], you make it sound like people should abandon everything and lose all hope. What do you want people to say: &quot;Oh, Mr. Louwrentius said that all this work is kind of foolish and not important, so let&#x27;s pack our stuff and go work at Big Co?&quot; or &quot;Yeah, tech itself is not going to solve social problems, but those societies that want to operate in certain ways will need to have specific technology to support them?&quot;[1]<p>You point out a known and largely acknowledged issue with the current implementation, to which I respond &quot;Yes, it is known and a lot of people are working on solutions to overcome that, and if you want you can take a look at how the progress at Proof-of-Stake is going.&quot; Your only answer is &quot;Oh, 12 years and they haven&#x27;t delivered anything of value yet.&quot; Do you see how non-sensical it is?<p>Bias, &quot;emotional investment&quot;? Yes, of course there is! Anyone working on something based on some form of idealism will keep their biases and will be emotionally invested on their work. But as long as this work is not violating any moral or ethical values, what is the problem? I&#x27;d rather have more people working on things they are also invested in, where they have more skin in the game than anyone else and that they can actually defend what they do for their work. The alternative is to spend your professional life as a corporate drone and perhaps (if they feel guilty about it) try to make it up by the occasional virtue-signaling hobby.<p>Trying to discredit people working on blockchain due to &quot;bias&quot; or &quot;emotional investment&quot; is a terrible mistake.<p>First because you think that the &quot;emotional investment&quot; is all there is to it. It&#x27;s not. You would be fully right to argue if it was &quot;a lot of wishful thinking&quot; if the people were only talking about it and never implementing anything, or if the people never stopped to learn the lessons of failed projects, or if you saw those leading projects making promises but never delivering. It&#x27;s easy to dismiss things when you are only pointing to the scammers and the crackpots, but if you actually bothered to listen to the people that are working on it, perhaps you&#x27;d find people way more grounded in reality than you are.<p>Second, it&#x27;s a mistake to discredit their work because you are not giving any alternative. When you say &quot;none of these issues you pointed out are really worthy&quot;, you are displaying your bias for the status quo.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rlullis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1307420668372430848" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rlullis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1307420668372430848</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub20.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub20.io</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub20.io&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub20.io&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;</a>')
