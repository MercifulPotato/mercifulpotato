The end-game is clear: one browser controlled by one company, of great complexity and continuously changed to discourage others from attempting to compete, shaping websites to that one company&#x27;s desires. Of course everything will be &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;open&quot;, but that hardly matters.<p>One company has clearly invested a lot into the &quot;JS only&quot; propaganda and strongly attempts to silence the opposition. Turning all sites into ridiculously overcomplex &quot;web apps&quot; that only work in their very latest browser is their dream. It&#x27;s obvious that a simple text-only or even text+images browser is not all that complex, so from that perspective, basic HTML and browsers that can handle it is a <i>threat</i> --- and cutting those off by making sites not work in them is the ultimate underhanded tactic. They can cheer all they want about &quot;moving the web forward&quot; --- and unfortunately a lot of the &quot;young and impressionable&quot; gets caught up in that propaganda --- but what they are really doing is helping this company further its control over the Internet.<p>This company is, of course, Google.')
