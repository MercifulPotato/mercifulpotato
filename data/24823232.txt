You learn what you use the most by repetition, know that other things exist, and use a reference  when you need to apply it.<p>Mastering the craft does not mean you know by hand everything in it (every seam, every recipe, every joint, every semi-conductor). It means that you know what exists, when to apply it, and where to find the required information about it.')
