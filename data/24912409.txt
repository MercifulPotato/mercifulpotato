On the other hand, Lightning also works great, USB-C isn&#x27;t an improvement on the merits, and iPhone users have a bunch of accessories for it.  Like in my car, I have a 12v charger with one USB-A port and a built-in Lightning cable, and I&#x27;d have to either junk it or just ignore the built in cable if they went USB-C.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the writing is on the wall with MagSafe: Apple intends to ditch the port entirely. That makes me nervous, frankly, and there are people out there who use an SD card reader who would be furious.<p>But I think that future is more likely than one in which Apple ditches the Lightning port for USB-C. We&#x27;ll see.')
