Nobody lives beside the gate.  We all live in town about another 10km away.  I cannot say what my current recall time is, but a 30&#x2F;60min ride in on a pushbike is unacceptable.<p>It started snowing today.  Soon it will be very cold.  Dont see many bikes at -20 with a fresh 10cm covering the bike routes.  Snowmobles would be a good not-a-car option.  I have seen people come to work on those.  They are very dangerous&#x2F;loud&#x2F;polluting but at least they dont impinge on bike lanes.')
