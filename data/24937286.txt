There may be other things large tech companies do with their power that mean they need to be regulated like utilities, but moderating user generated content so that users don’t leave or so that ads can be better sold over it  doesn’t seem like it fits the bill. It’s not clear to me what is broken on section 230 specifically; I can’t separate a legitimate social ill from the politically motivated attacks.')
