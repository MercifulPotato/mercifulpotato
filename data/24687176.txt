Item(by='MayeulC', descendants=None, kids=[24687562], score=None, time=1601901654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686476, text='Thanks for mentioning it, it looks pretty nice. However, as that&#x27;s something I would self-host, the pricing options do not make sense to me. I&#x27;d be willing to pay a one-time fee of $10, maybe $40 for the family variant (though 6 users feels <i>really</i> arbitrary when you self-host). Not $40 per year for little added value (the thing I&#x27;d be interested in is 2FA via OTP&#x2F;U2F, and maybe that shared item thing).<p>Anyway, I think I&#x27;ll look at something else for now, I can&#x27;t really afford that :)')
