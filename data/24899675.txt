They hold a monopoly on search that I think should be broken up. I have big problems with the power Google wields in finding things online.<p>But, going back to my previous comment, it would in a way be a good thing if Google started capriciously &quot;disappearing&quot; sites like this, in a high-profile manner. It would accelerate the move to other search providers and bring a more diversified Internet to us all. (I&#x27;m not advocating for it, but the end result would probably be better than what we have now: SEO madness all to please The One Algorithm.)<p>Twitter has competition. Reddit, Facebook, Apple News, and traditional media outlets all disseminate information. They all offer notifications on your phone. Where we&#x27;re typing this out is HN, which is another news dissemination and discussion service.<p>The more Twitter does things to make it clear it&#x27;s not a neutral platform, the more other services can find users. I do not want Twitter to be a monopoly platform. Tagging them with some common-carrier-like status, while allowing them to remain private, just entrenches that monopoly.')
