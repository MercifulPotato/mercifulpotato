It&#x27;s accompanied by a lot of social work, together with medical, mental and substance abuse care.<p>The reason for providing housing (not just a shelter, although those exist too) is that social work and care are ineffective when a person is homeless. When someone spends all their energy on staying warm, clean, safe and fed, they are unable to help themselves to a better life.<p>Providing housing was found to be more effective than adding the same amount of funding to social and medical programs.<p>Extensive research has been done with this, I&#x27;m sure you can find some in English language too if you find the article too hard to believe.')
