Started the company, put in the major investment, brought in two other people I knew and trusted as fellow directors, and I still had to walk away 18 months later because all three of us—as first-time directors with more lofty ambition than hard, dirty experience—made a thorough cock of the business.<p>Glad I did it. <i>Not</i> happy about that particular outcome, but at least now I know it’s harder than it looks and some of the errors to avoid in future. And hopefully once I’ve finished dusting myself down I’ll be back up on another horse to try again.<p>It’s real easy to sit in the peanut gallery pontificating loudly. I’ve more respect for those who actually do it, even if they are assholes as people (but really, who isn’t?).')
