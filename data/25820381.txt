I do not work in this field, and to be quite honest, before your comment, I did not even know about ClearLink.<p>I&#x27;ve highlighted something that makes no sense. Do you expect a car manufacturer not showing one of its cars on its website ? Apple not to how its iPhone ? A SaaS company not showing screen captures of its product ? I don&#x27;t. \nThose images should be easily available without having to browse YouTube, or do a search on google.<p>FWIW, I would actually welcome any concurrent to eInk and its monopoly. I totally share the point of view of the top comment, as I&#x27;ve seen this tech stagnate for years. \nMost of the supposed alternatives 10 years ago(PlasticLogic, Liquavista, Mirasol, etc.) either never produced something relevant, either failed the expectations.<p>I actually find your comment quite disrespectful: if you want to promote a product, you can do that without having to resort to ad hominem attacks.<p>Anyway, thanks for the YouTube tip: I was able to see what I wanted to see.<p>Edit: if some employee of ClearInk see this message, do yourself a favor and update your website with some pictures of your product, or even a embedded Youtube video. It will speak more than stock photos.')
