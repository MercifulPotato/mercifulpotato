I use wire fence on the walls facing the antennas and it reduces the radiation from 2 V&#x2F;m to around 0.4-0.5 V&#x2F;m. From my experience, everything below 0.3 V&#x2F;m, or 0.2 uT on the magnetic side, is fine.<p>I would also recommend following the scientific research in this field and to gather your own data. Simple variables, such as pulse and blood pressure, are a good start.')
