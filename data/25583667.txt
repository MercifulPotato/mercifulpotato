He mentions Esperanto, as a made-up language, in his essay <i>New Words&quot;</i> [1] - but not as an absolute negative. The essay, in fact, argues for deliberate invention of language&#x2F;words - but to improve understanding between people, rather than to diminish meaning and so kill concepts, as happens in his Newspeak.<p>The essay is long, and he expresses his dissatisfaction at his inability to say what he wanted to in it, before finishing with:<p><i>To most people in any case the whole idea of reforming language would seem either dilettantish or crankish. Yet it is worth considering what utter incomprehension exists between human beings — at least between those who are not deeply intimate. At present, as Samuel Butler said, the best art (i.e. the most perfect thought-transference) must be ‘lived’ from one person to another. It need not be so if our language were more adequate. It is curious that when our knowledge, the complication of our lives and therefore (I think it must follow) our minds, develop so fast, language, the chief means of communication, should scarcely stir. For this reason I think that the idea of the deliberate invention of words is at least worth thinking over.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;articles&#x2F;words&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_words" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;articles&#x2F;words&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_words</a>')
