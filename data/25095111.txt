Very wrong. But, I think there is one power dynamic that&#x27;s missing in the entire #metoo discussion.<p>The power advantage that young women have on men; due to evolutionary pressures. Harmon didn&#x27;t mean to be attracted to her. It happened.<p>I know biology isn&#x27;t important in 2020. But I listened to his apology and realized that the human nature discussion is never part of this situation.<p>Ted Chiang&#x27;s &quot;liking what you see a documentary&quot; is a good case study of a world where attraction&#x27;s turned off. As a woman, I sometimes think we aren&#x27;t empathic enough about how attraction works in men. It doesn&#x27;t mean they are excused for sexual harassment. I just think evolutionary pressures should be part of the discussion.<p>Neither person should be setup to fail.')
