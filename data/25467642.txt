Riven was released in 1997 and is still a delightful intellectual challenge today, with nothing really like it. It&#x27;s very much the opposite of modern games with a built-in GPS system telling you where to go. Riven is clunky, pixellated, but integrates good puzzles and a well thought out world in a way I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere else. It was also a technical feat at the time.<p>Like I said in my Steam review, I believe Portal popularity comes from the fact it&#x27;s a puzzle game attractive enough to draw people who don&#x27;t play puzzle games.<p>Baba Is You is going to be a classic 20 years from now, despite its ugly graphics. In hands of anyone else, it would be just a gimmick, like Portal. But the idea was masterfully executed.')
