In Rust you need unsafe to implement some types of graphs, for example, which in GC languages are easy to do without any unsafety.<p>It&#x27;s a tradeoff, of course: GC languages let you avoid unsafe code at the cost of doing GCs, which in some applications is an issue. Rust&#x27;s stroke of genius is that it can avoid GCs while giving you almost all the safety of a GC language.<p>Overall I think it&#x27;s safe (no pun intended) to say that Rust is significantly safer than C or C++, but slightly less safe than Java or C#. But of course both of those comparisons have lots of caveats and exceptions. And there are other factors than safety as well.')
