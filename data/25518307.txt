Item(by='jsinai', descendants=None, kids=[25521571], score=None, time=1608736171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516691, text='Other comments point out to Bayesian inference being good for modelling an uncertain outcome, while deep learning is good for prediction.<p>However Bayesian inference is a good choice for prediction when you have few data points (deep learning is sample-size hungry). And it is especially good when you have high uncertainty in your labelled training data (ie large variance in the response variable for given input). Here a Bayesian regression (or even classification) model wouldn’t magically remove the uncertainty but rather you’d be able to account for the predictive variance (instead of being none-the-wiser using just good ole deep learning). You can then take it from there how you wish to treat the predictions, given the predictive variance as well.')
