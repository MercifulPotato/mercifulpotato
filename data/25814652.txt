There is nothing wrong with being an activist. However, IMHO, being a &quot;data scientist&quot; is inherently incompatible with being an activist. No matter how qualified you were, once you became a passionate activist, you are no longer a &quot;data scientist&quot; or a  &quot;data analyst&quot; or a &quot;statistician&quot; on the topic. Again, there is nothing wrong with being an activist, but you can&#x27;t be both. I feel this is so obvious that requires no further explanation, but I might get massive downvotes for saying this.')
