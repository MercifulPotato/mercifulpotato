Twitter already seems like it&#x27;s in the &quot;garbage site&quot; category, and they won&#x27;t be able to fix that without throwing away the network effect that they depend on.<p>Anybody can post anything they want on their own sites, or a number of other completely unmoderated sites. People don&#x27;t go there because their friends are already on Twitter. The conspiracy theorists follow because that&#x27;s where the target is. They don&#x27;t want to just post on their own site, or on sites where only other conspiracy theorists will read it. Even if those sites weren&#x27;t perceived as garbage, people wouldn&#x27;t go there simply because they don&#x27;t know anybody.<p>It feels like Twitter and FB have the tiger by the ears and can neither let go nor continue to ride.')
