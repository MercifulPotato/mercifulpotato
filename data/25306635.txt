There&#x27;s a lot of self promo, a lot of pages about not sufficiently notable topics etc. You could think that e.g. mayor of your local 5K town will have &quot;slightest notability&quot;. Well if that&#x27;s their only claim to fame, then their nice Wikipedia page is going to be deleted.<p>&gt; And I have no issue with it. I see this as one of the (big) advantage of Wikipedia over traditional encyclopedia.<p>Wikipedia is not limited by the physical constraints, but other limits are still present - e.g. the ability to check the validity of claims of the original article and subsequent edits is limited by the available manpower.')
