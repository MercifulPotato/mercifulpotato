The story bits were simply amazing, but the gameplay needed another year or two of development. This is clearly an unfinished game and most of the promised features are not in the game.<p>I reinstalled Deus Ex Mankind Divided and the tutorial level has better gameplay (gunplay, stealth, hacking) than Cyberpunk.<p>I will certainly revisit it in a year or two. Hopefully CDPR will keep on improving the gameplay, not only solve bugs and performance on consoles.')
