I’ll probably meet or exceed that number this year.<p>Generally I’m reading at least two books at a time, one non-fiction and one fiction. I tend to listen to the non-fiction books and read the ebook&#x2F;physical fiction book.<p>I wake up in the morning, make coffee&#x2F;breakfast for me and my wife, and read the ebook&#x2F;physical book while I’m eating. I read whenever I’m in the car (audiobook non-fiction) and when I’m doing simple chores around the house or at work. I recently started reading the audiobooks during my exercise time, so that adds at least an hour a day. If I’m eating alone for lunch I’ll read the ebook&#x2F;physical book. On days off I’ll read the ebook&#x2F;physical book as a form of relaxation for a few hours as well. Finally, I read the ebook&#x2F;physical book every night as I fall asleep. I generally have to go back a page or two the next morning as I might have missed a few paragraphs as I drift off.<p>I generally boost the speed of the audiobook to as fast as I can deal with (depends on the narration), but I can’t do that with any voices I’m familiar with. I read Obama’s audiobook recently and I kept that at 1X speed.<p>I’ve been reading the audiobooks for ~3 years, and before that I averaged around 60 or 70 books a year with a range of 50 on the low end to 82 on the high end.<p>Last year I took notes on all the non-fiction ebook&#x2F;physical books I read. I haven’t done the same this year and I feel like I’m not missing out on anything, although the notes were useful when trying to find a reference quickly.<p>I sleep at least 8 hours a night, and I don’t feel rushed in my reading or anything like that. I think what allows me to read so many books is that I have been reading like this since I was a teenager (~20 years) so I read and comprehend quite quickly. The high-speed audiobooks also almost double the number of books and I don’t see a huge drop off in knowledge&#x2F;usefulness&#x2F;entertainment. I also don’t really watch TV so this is my main form of entertainment, along with movies a few times a week.')
