Spotify is cheaper than a CD a month and provides a superior service than radio or music TV ever did.<p>I have absolutely no need to own a piece of music.<p>I&#x27;d start here about Spotify not paying artists enough. But honestly, the music industry - as a whole - has been screwing over artists for decades, at least, so it is pretty much same thing in a different dress. If I&#x27;m going to support musicians more directly, I&#x27;ll head over to Bandcamp while still giving the artist listens on spotify if they have music there.')
