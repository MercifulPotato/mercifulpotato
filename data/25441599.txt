People adjust behavior based on the tax level. For instance, people can choose to move. Or they can employ different tax avoidance schemes (with their own costs and risks) depending on how high the tax is.<p>On the extreme, both a 0% tax and a 100% tax rate would result in zero income, so there exists some point in between where an increase tax rate results in lower overall revenue. This is called the Laffer Curve [0]<p>Framing matters a lot about these discussions where &quot;tax cuts&quot; illicit an image of cash taken out of a vault somewhere and sent directly to wealthy people. But its just a number. What you really want to look at is total revenue. If we think of taxes as a method of paying for things we use collectively, we should try to optimize for revenue.<p>If you look at federal tax revenue over the last 70 years, you&#x27;ll see that it was remarkably stable between 15-20% of GDP, with spikes and dips being mostly affected by recessions and booms. And during that period we had significant changes to marginal tax rates.<p>I think the framing is wrong and is meant to illicit moral outrage about percentages paid when its much more complicated than that. The top marginal rate is meaningless without context or considerations to other things.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laffer_curve" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laffer_curve</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxpolicycenter.org&#x2F;briefing-book&#x2F;what-are-sources-revenue-federal-government" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxpolicycenter.org&#x2F;briefing-book&#x2F;what-are-sourc...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Progressivity_in_United_States_income_tax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Progressivity_in_United_States...</a>')
