While I&#x27;m sure that HubSpot, its employees, and management may have learned some things about integrity and transparency since then, it&#x27;s probably not enough to be writing this soap-boxy slide deck that announces that software built around their culture is going to solve their problems.<p>On the other hand, I do believe software can shape and guide a culture but only if the culture is also at the pilot seat behind that software. That&#x27;s to say, as long as the implementors of said software are not interested in developing a <i>certain</i> culture. Your employees will inevitably decide what software gets used and what software gets circumvented, the byproduct of which becomes what people colloquially refer to as culture.<p>Culture comes from everywhere. When you recruit gay people, some of the values of gay people trickle into your company. When you recruit Black people, values of Black folks trickle in. When you recruit from universities those values trickle in. Each of those will shape your culture and those people are not monoliths either, they&#x27;re mixes of many vibrant and dark experiences. The last part is key, recruiting is one aspect, but your company culture will continue to evolve and I see projects like this as software trying to drive culture (what the C-suite wants) instead of culture driving software that it maintains itself.')
