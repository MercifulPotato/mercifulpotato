Though thatâ€™s considered the best approach, less than half of Americans who could benefit from medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction receive it.&quot;<p>Buprenorphine has saved my life and I wish everyone could have access to it and that it would be provided for free. Pay for it from grabbing back cash from the Sackler&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m surprised in the article the phrase &#x27;less than half&#x27; which sounds like it&#x27;s on the higher end towards 50.<p>I would have guessed much lower. I can&#x27;t find a great source but this has some numbers [1]. Says only 36% of rehabs have access to at least one replacement therapy.<p>And that&#x27;s people who can access rehab...<p>To be able to prescribe Suboxone - from what my Dr. has told me - MDs have to have a specific DEA certificate. And they limit the number of patients one single Dr. can treat at a few hundred.<p>In my state there aren&#x27;t many prescribers - not nearly enough for the number of addicts. And I live in a liberal state.<p>It&#x27;s easier for Drs to dole out opiates than prescribe buprenorphine.<p>We can also learn from Portugal in more community and healthcare intervention.<p>The big problem here to get there is that DAs, sheriffs, mayors are elected and there are 50 states. We will need to shift public opinion everywhere to make meaningful progress outside of big cities. Plus with Barr&#x27;s Justice Department catholic radicalization who knows what happens if they get another 4 years.<p>It&#x27;s gross that in America those who are poor, BIPOC, are far more likely to have their lives ruined by unequal drug prosecutions.<p>If we ever start treating addiction not prosecuting it, I hope we&#x27;ll do better than marijuana and clear old records&#x2F;convictions for small drug possession.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nam.edu&#x2F;improving-access-to-evidence-based-medical-treatment-for-opioid-use-disorder-strategies-to-address-key-barriers-within-the-treatment-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nam.edu&#x2F;improving-access-to-evidence-based-medical-t...</a>')
