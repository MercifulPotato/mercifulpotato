The protestants tried to come up with some hocus pocus about being able to know that you were one of the elect by reversing the causality here &quot;Oh I&#x27;m not forcing God to save me, it&#x27;s just an indication that he already did.&quot; It is amusing to see that it is the human that takes on the role of God in the AI box game.<p>This is also Hume&#x27;s &quot;is does not imply ought.&quot;<p>From this we conclude that only idiots get tricked by the AI in the box, because it is only possible to prove that you _are_ a superintelligence, it is impossible to prove that you are not. This is also a simple application of Russell&#x27;s teapot. Now, the point of the story is pretty clearly that human beings are idiots when it comes to this kind of thing, but didn&#x27;t we already know that?')
