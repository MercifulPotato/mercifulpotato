In a sense there&#x27;s mirror between what Orwell is doing with his book, in telling our society about itself, and what Ingsoc was doing to Oceania, in limiting thought to goodthink. They both invented a new language in order to relate a new meaning. I like that, and there&#x27;s something...peculiar about books that invent a lot of new terms. Like LOTR and Harry Potter. There&#x27;s something &quot;generationally transformative&quot; about such books, maybe. In a sense sci-fi is all-in on this sort of word coining, Matrix, Terminator, Star Trek.<p>Nineteen Eighty-four is sort of sci-fi. It&#x27;s set in the future. And then the appendix, is set even further in the future talking in staid and &quot;encycolpaedia&quot;-like tone about the time of the events of the book as if it is in the past. What if Orwell was a time traveler, who wrote 1984 after a visit to a possible future, and was told that by writing this book, that future would not persist. Then on his second trip back to the future he verified he&#x27;d changed that timeline by writing his book, and lifted the appendix to 1984 from an encyclopedia on &quot;the rise and fall of English socialism&quot; from the future after the collapse of the political system his book had helped undo. Closed time like curves.')
