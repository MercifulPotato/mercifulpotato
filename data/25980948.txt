Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612116382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980225, text='Portland had amazing potential with its art and food culture. It’s really sad to see it fall apart for very predictable reasons. I imagine that all the violence in the name of politics and the homelessness&#x2F;drug abuse issue will crater tourism. Once the Pearl District loses its draw, other parts of the city will feel the domino effects as well.<p>But how can anyone help? There’s no avenue for intervention in a city where constituents (and the homeless voting bloc) keep voting for increasingly fringe party and politics. The hostility and outright violence towards anyone who is even center-left means people are more likely to leave than spend years fighting a battle to save the city.<p>And once the city falls apart economically, the political grifters will simply move to the next big successful city and damage it in the same way.')
