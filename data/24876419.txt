Like a vacuum or something else? Would the stiffness be dependent on the energy density gradient between what it is embedded in?<p>The technique reminds of those i&#x27;ve seen in sparse eigen decomposition of a matrix, where some non square matrix X is embedded in a larger sparse matrix of zeros of the form:<p>⎡  zeros(X.n_rows, X.n_rows)              X  ⎤<p>⎣  X.t()          zeros(X.n_cols, X.n_cols)  ⎦<p>Except for in this case the larger matrix of zeros would be replaced by a repeated structure. Though I can&#x27;t help but think that using non zeros would get some weird energy feedbacks (due to the interaction of the protein with the embedding matrix molecules) that would require some renormalizations.')
