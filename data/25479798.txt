You can&#x27;t just hide behind &quot;narrative tension&quot; and problematizing the story when you&#x27;re putting out false information that <i>should</i> have been fact checked more aggressively.<p>When it first began to come to light that the subject was likely lying, the creator of the podcast actually said that he was likely telling the truth and it was instead the Canadian police that were incompetent because they couldn&#x27;t &quot;prove he&#x27;d gone to Syria&quot; [0].<p>They were pretty clear they thought it was a true story. I don&#x27;t think adding some mild disclaimers once it starts coming to light that the story is not true abdicates them from responsibility for what they put out there.<p>Even at the time, NYT bureau chiefs (ie. experienced war reporters) were uneasy about the nature of the podcast. Absolutely the Times should be praised for calling out their own errors, but it is definitely embarrassing and (in my opinion) should be career-ending or damaging for the architect of the podcast. She <i>wanted</i> it to be true, so she didn&#x27;t dig.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rcallimachi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1309620500176556032" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rcallimachi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1309620500176556032</a>')
