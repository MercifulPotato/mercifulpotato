We got so much time back each evening. It was life changing.<p>&gt; same amount of soap exposure, and time at the sink, to wash dishes by hand.<p>What are you doing with your dishwasher that requires <i>any</i> soap exposure? With ours there is none. Scrape the dish into the bin&#x2F;compost, stick it in the dishwasher. Every once in a while something will require a cursory rince with cold water before just to dislodge any stubborn food bits, but most of the time no prep is required.')
