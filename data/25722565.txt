A single company deciding not to  do business with someone (over actions, not innate stuff like protected classes) <i>should</i> be fine, but when you let them get to be a backbone service, then issues surface like those discussed by everyone here.<p>If google, for example decided to stop surfacing trump stuff in results, that could be a real issue. Not because it’s google doing a bad thing, but because google has become so big. Maybe “what happens if this service started banning folks?” is a useful thought exercise for whether a platform has accrued too much market share&#x2F;power&#x2F;influence.')
