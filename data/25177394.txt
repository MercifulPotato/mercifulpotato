If you want a profit open a business.<p>Im tired of seeing &#x27;poor landlords arent making profits&#x27; comments.<p>And &#x27;Support local businesses&#x27; everywhere. Why? Are they taking care of their workers? Are they paying them better for taking risks during the pandemic? Probably not. Restaurant&#x2F;fast food chains still open are making a killing with a leaner workforce and collecting far more money, but no workers got a raise ir even sick leave.<p>Are they helping their communities? No. But at least they serve a purpose. Paying rent every month instead of to a mortgage to build someone else&#x27;s wealth instead of your own.<p>At what point in society did building wealth become married to screwing over fellow humans?')
