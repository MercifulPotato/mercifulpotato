Item(by='lukifer', descendants=None, kids=[25735624], score=None, time=1610389471, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732858, text='Networked services intrinsically reward monopolization&#x2F;centralization, due to Metcalfe&#x27;s Law [0]: users are more concerned with going where other users are, than the merits of the service itself. (A curious exception: Uber and Lyft, presumably because drivers can easily use both simultaneously.)<p>Facebook, for example, does not represent a monopoly, defined as a social media company generally; but they arguably have ~99% market share within their social niche (with some FOSS clones as a rounding error, and Twitter&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;etc occupying different niches). Contrast with Netflix, which is more disruptable without social network effects, as we&#x27;ve seen with the proliferation of streaming services in the last 5 years.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the threshold should be to regulate social media as utilities (mandating transparency, interoperability, and due process), but as such platforms become our de-facto political and conversational commons, I don&#x27;t think we should allow those spaces to be entirely controlled by private capital, let alone manipulated by Blind Idiot God algorithms, which happily hijack our limbic systems for a quick CPM buck.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metcalfe%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metcalfe%27s_law</a>')
