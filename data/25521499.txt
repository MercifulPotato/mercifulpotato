It has a solution that is hugely better than the best naive solution, but is basically a giant gotcha that seems obvious in retrospect. I couldn&#x27;t find it myself even though I was stumbling around in its neighborhood. Obviously I gave this question informally to a ton of people as entertainment (Bay Area techies in various companies), and most couldn&#x27;t find it either.<p>However, one guy told me he now uses the question as his actual interview question because he thinks the way people suffer thru a seemingly impossible problem reveals how good of an engineer they are :D')
