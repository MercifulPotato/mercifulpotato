This is especially true for an out-of-the-box Wordpress implementation. I have a React project with 100s across the board, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend a React implementation if high performance is key.<p>This doesn&#x27;t even touch upon the topic of good developer performance, which is just as important as a set of Lighthouse scores. It&#x27;s far easier to jump into an app with established build tools and documentation than it is to wade through a block of static HTML. Though if you&#x27;re the only one working in your zen garden, have at it.')
