And if my understanding is correct, it is related to the speed of sound (&quot;phonons&quot;) in that material. Stressing the material further increases the speed of sound.<p>However, metallic hydrogen is pretty much theoretical at that point, although it looks like we are getting closer. No other material that I know of had achieved &gt;0Â°C superconductivity before.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metallic_hydrogen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metallic_hydrogen</a>')
