Trying to detect if people seem nervous? Well, I&#x27;ve got friends who have nervous twitches under normal conditions.<p>What is normal behavior varies wildly person-to-person. Trying to figure out &quot;is someone glancing somewhere before answering&quot; vs &quot;does someone nod to themselves when they think they got an answer in their head&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound like something AI can do.<p>Figuring out &quot;is this person cheating&quot; from a recording of their face sounds pretty close to phrenology. Determining personality from skull-size, determining cheating from facial-motion... they both sound bogus, and like someone&#x27;s trying to create a correlation that cannot account for the variety of human behaviors and shapes.')
