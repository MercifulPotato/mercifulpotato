Being born in Soviet Union I was always taught not to talk about particular topics. Mostly politics and religion.  Sexual orientation was also not to speak about. I went to Western Germany and it’s the same - a good tone requires not to talk about particular topics.  At work absolutely the same - big Corp has code of conduct and there is clearly written what I can’t say. Freedom of speech lives in a small circle of friends where I can say everything I want.')
