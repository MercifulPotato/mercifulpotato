I actually think it&#x27;s possible with our current cryptographic tool box. This just a quick thought off the top of my head, I might have missed a case or a weakness.<p>Cases normally are assigned a case number anyways already. So lets start from case number 0.<p>First lets choose a nothing up my sleeve number. Let say like the fractional part of the PI with the bit length of some secure hash function. We can treat this case -1 or the initial state.<p>The plaintiff and defendant each generate a private and public key pair. They then give each other their public keys. The plaintiff and defendant each sign the what will become the previous state with their private key. XOR the the two signatures together and then hash the XOR-ed signatures. This gives the new state. We then take this new state and take it to the modulus for the number judges. Just repeat this for each case new case.<p>Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant should be able to directly influence who their judge is in this system. Also both can verify that other party performed a proper signature. Although there could be gotchas depending on the underline primitives from hash function to signing algorithm.')
