Maybe just because it&#x27;s something new and it&#x27;s straightforward in principle so we can fantasize about it actually working efficiently.<p>I imagine UBI as a system where every citizen gets a monthly check, no questions asked. It shows up in the mail or gets direct deposited and that&#x27;s it. And if someone can&#x27;t receive it that way, say if they&#x27;re homeless or don&#x27;t have a bank account, maybe there could even be a place they can show up and collect their money in person. This might still be a pipe dream but it doesn&#x27;t seem impossible, the hard part is actually figuring out how to pay for a UBI program.<p>Contrast that to sticking it into the existing income tax system. I imagine that would mean you&#x27;d only collect the money annually, and only if you file a tax return. Lots of people without much income don&#x27;t file tax returns so that&#x27;s already a blocker. And once the money is gone, a year is a long time to wait for another payment. Of course there&#x27;s no reason a negative income tax couldn&#x27;t still be distributed monthly and made more easily acceptable, but there&#x27;s just a lot of baggage around the thought of dealing with taxes.')
