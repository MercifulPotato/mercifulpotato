Even the more arcane ones, like C++, probably have on the order of 1-200 &#x27;words&#x27; that you ahev to learn to &#x27;speak&#x27; them fluently.<p>Of course, you also need to learn large amounts of library functions and their semantics, but that&#x27;s more like learning who the people at court are and what their roles are than like the language. You could speak perfect French, but you still have to learn that you must call the Comptesse de Barry before calling the King if you don&#x27;t want her to be upset. Even patterns are often more in this area of cultural&#x2F;local context rather than the actual langauge - more like learning the difference between overly-descriptive prose and good prose is (which is why the knowledge about it also tends to translate better between different languages).')
