And they were <i>All</i> Made in Japan.<p>The problem with PC market is how they trained consumers into buying <i>Spec</i>. At first people would compare clock speed, and Memory capacity, later they learned CPU Generation was also important and Memory Speed, and then dozens of other things. And basically becomes a commodity market.<p>Nearly ALL PC manufacture moved their assembly to China. Fujitsu remained MIJ for as long as I could remember ( And may be that is still the case ).<p>There is also a culture problem. Which I think matter a lot more as they are factored into their decision making.')
