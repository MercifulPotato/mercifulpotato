This is codified in U.S. law. Killing someone in self defense, killing someone because you&#x27;re angry with them, and killing someone because they&#x27;re gay and you don&#x27;t like gay people: each the same crime, but treated differently in U.S. law. I don&#x27;t know about arson, but I do think that for example occupying a government building because you want the elected officials there to take action on supporting human rights should be treated differently than occupying a government building because you want your favorite candidate to be president despite losing the election.')
