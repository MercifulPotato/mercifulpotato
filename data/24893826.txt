And the mass of shielding is measured in hundreds of kg to single-digit tons, not hundreds of tons. (You can very effectively reduce your shielding needs by putting the engine on a spar.)<p>The rest of your concerns are still valid. NTRs seem like they would work better if you are going to asteroids, or other such targets that don&#x27;t have an atmosphere you can use to brake with, but I do not see the appeal for trips to Mars, where a more compact atmospheric-capable ship can shed half the trip Î”v using a heat shield.')
