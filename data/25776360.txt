It doesn&#x27;t begin from there, it begins with the sentence I pointed out.<p>This is because freedom of speech is fundamentally a discussion of rights and their justification. It&#x27;s a &quot;freedom&quot;, situated in a concept of society. The actual article discusses the matter from this point of view. I&#x27;m not sure where you expect an article on what is an idea originating in liberal philosophy to start.<p>&gt;Like I said - the _power_ to disallow speech is problematic, not just what gets permitted.<p>This seems like you have a problem with the state itself - or the idea that the state should have powers to compel, anyway. But once you admit some state power over actions (which you may not do, that&#x27;s fine) then speech easily falls within this remit too. If you think no power over individuals is permissible - whether to speak or kill - a discussion of liberal rights and freedoms is irrelevant.')
