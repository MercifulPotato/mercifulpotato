Somewhere right now some poor developer inherits a Angular 1.1 project built with gulp.<p>I think also there have been a shift in regards to fullstack developers versus frontend &amp; backend developers, many companies have woken up to disastrous idea of splitting frontend &amp; backend developers into separate teams and now merging them again, as result the fullstack developer becomes more important. PHP is in my opinion best fullstack web platform you can use.<p>Say after me, No more build steps for rendering a paragraph, no more unhandled Ajax errors, no more REST JSON apis with only the frontend as consumer, no more reimplementing the database schema in JavaScript, no more asynchronous state rendering on the same page. &lt;Insert Braveheart meme&gt;')
