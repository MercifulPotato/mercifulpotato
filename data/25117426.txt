I am currently stuck waiting for a screen replacement for a 6 month old 16&quot; MBP (something that was promised in 3 days but I found today, after 4 calls and as many answers, that it might be ready this week); I&#x27;m using a 4+ year old MBP in the meantime - the latter needs a battery replacement but my numerous encounters with Apple support&#x2F;Store have made me generally allergic to dealing with them. If there&#x27;s a magical Apple cs experience that exists, it certainly has eluded me every time. Edit0: syntax.')
