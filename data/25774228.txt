Bush came across as dumb, true ( I am looking for another word, something like <i>not too smart</i> ).<p>Northern Western media lean heavily towards US Democrats, I remember Reagan basically being described as the devil. In the same vain, Trump is painted as an imbecile.<p>The question I ask people who share these beliefs is : do you really think you can win the presidency of the US when you are below average? Of course not.<p>edit : <i>dim</i> might be the word indeed, borrowed from sibling comment.')
