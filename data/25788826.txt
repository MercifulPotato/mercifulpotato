There&#x27;s multiple public instances, but those are often unable to handle all user requests and get rate limited by google every now and then. I&#x27;m currently using invidious.tube, it has a good &quot;real&quot; uptime in my opinion (the site is up the whole time but might have issues like described above). I&#x27;m considering just self hosting should things get worse.')
