I&#x27;ve been shown other benchmark results (such as this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;h2oai.github.io&#x2F;db-benchmark&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;h2oai.github.io&#x2F;db-benchmark&#x2F;</a>) that demonstrate otherwise. I&#x27;m not really sure what to make of it - maybe try more cases?<p>One possible explanation I could think of is that Pandas support for Parquet is pretty good compared to data.table and Julia. I&#x27;ve been asked to split the read&#x2F;write part and the groupby-agg part for a more complete picture. I&#x27;ll be sure to work on that in the coming weeks.<p>Another hypothesis by u&#x2F;joinr about why Pandas performs better in the smaller dataset:<p>&quot;I wonder if there&#x27;s some default column size allocation that happens up front for the 2^6 case that helps prevent growth in pandas, and maybe the hueristic falls down a little as the dataset gets larger leading to more resizing.&quot;')
