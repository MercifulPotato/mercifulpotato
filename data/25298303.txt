But MMT will incentivize foreign countries to use alternatives, and when the US dollar is no longer a reserve currency, the game is over. MMT also requires the government to rapidly increase and reduce taxes, from my research on it. All of this makes it intellectual masturbation, plus a very terrible idea IMO.')
