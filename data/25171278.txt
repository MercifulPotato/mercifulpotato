Another way to define a polygon is any convex hull of finitely many points in Euclidean 2-space with nonzero area. Then the &#x27;real&#x27; vertices are those points on the boundary curve that are nondifferentiable (&#x27;pointy&#x27; or &#x27;sharp&#x27;).<p>Those are the special points you are interested in when you want to distinguish between vertices and other points on the boundary.')
