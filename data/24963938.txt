I also mix in some of my other interests, but above all I try to stay out of politics. This is hard to do when so many people I follow for professional networking are compelled to tweet and retweet really unhinged stuff. It&#x27;s nothing but virtue signalling, almost never any content, mostly slogans, links to rants by <i>thought leaders</i>, and really hate-filled messages.<p>I&#x27;ve broken my rule recently to tweet covid-19 data and science. I try to make these tweets especially factual, but I have allowed my own views, which have changed over time, come through. This has become a political arena I cannot stay out of. I&#x27;ve been insulted by people I previously respected in the professional community, just ad hominem attacks, no data, no science, really no objective content at all.')
