I know I don&#x27;t.<p>What&#x27;s the benefit of letting anyone know where you stand politically at this point? None.<p>It&#x27;s much more likely - no matter which side you&#x27;re for - that the person asking could have an adverse reaction.  Things are just way too polarized now, not sure how that can change, but that&#x27;s how it is.<p>I mean outside friends&#x2F;family I simply take a neutral, non-committal stance on almost every hot-button issue these days. And honestly even that&#x27;s not 100% true, I avoid getting into deep political conversations with most of my family, I simply don&#x27;t want to cause further rifts in our already frail relations over all this stuff. There is no middle ground.')
