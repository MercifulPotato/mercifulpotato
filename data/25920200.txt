The hope was to drop Jira, which was also being used for project planning, and fully adopt GitLab, but the costs were simply unjustifiable.<p>Basically GitLab ended up being a full order of magnitude more expensive. Even with discounts, which got things closer (but not all the way there), the fear was after a period of time, the discounts would be ended&#x2F;phased out and we&#x27;d be stuck.<p>I&#x27;d love to see those features that compete directly with Jira (like roadmaps and multi-level epics) come down to the Premium level, which is more price&#x2F;feature competitive.<p>We love GitLab, but find ourselves stuck using the free tier and paying for services we don&#x27;t love, rather than supporting GitLab. I&#x27;d suspect we&#x27;re not alone there, either.')
