Of course the larger corporation try to have an internal economogy (with department charging each other), but they&#x27;re still mostly centrally planned.<p>So you could say the modern capitalism with gigantic corporation is already an exercise in central planning.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;To the biologist the problem of socialism appears largely as a problem of\nsize. The extreme socialists desire to run every nation as a single business\n5\nconcern. I do not suppose that Henry Ford would find much difficulty in\nrunning Andorra or Luxembourg on a socialistic basis. He has already more\nmen on his pay-roll than their population. It is conceivable that a syndicate\nof Fords, if we could find them, would make Belgium Ltd or Denmark Inc.\npay their way. But while nationalization of certain industries is an obvious\npossibility in the largest of states, I find it no easier to picture a completely\nsocialized British Empire or United States than an elephant turning somersaults or a hippopotamus jumping a hedge.&quot;&quot;&quot;')
