The NY Post is a tabloid [1]. Tabloids are technically newspapers, but they aim primarily to sensationalize [2].<p>Tabloids are nothing like the NY Times or Washington Post, which attempt to present objective, unbiased news. (Now you may argue that they fail at that -- but they do profess at least to <i>aim</i> for it, while tabloids don&#x27;t even try in the first place.)<p>So seeing a tabloid article flagged doesn&#x27;t seem all that different from a blog post being flagged. Seeing the NYT or WaPo flagged, on the other hand, <i>would</i> be highly unusual.<p>(I&#x27;m neither defending not criticizing FB&#x2F;Twitter here, but just pointing out that the NY Post shouldn&#x27;t be held up as even remotely a trustworthy source of reporting.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;New_York_Post" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;New_York_Post</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tabloid_journalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tabloid_journalism</a>')
