Item(by='tombh', descendants=None, kids=[25619432], score=None, time=1609647645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618726, text='I saw an intriguing comment yesterday on here about how the Extreme Ultra Violet Lithography machines that are producing our cutting edge processors are &quot;the greatest achievement of science and technology on the planet&quot;[1]. I can believe it. And it&#x27;s fascinating how that affects geopolitics, much as other science and technology has in the past (the printing press, nuclear energy, etc)<p>I&#x27;m not OP, but why I think this Wikipedia article is relevant is because the more I actually learn about the world and history the more I begin to wonder whether in fact _mercenarism_ not technology is the defining trait of modern civilisation (and by extension I wonder about whether this is true for HN as a whole too). The great leaps were made by traders, rather than scientists, those willing to exploit and enslave rather than innovate and create. Of course they feed each other, think of the Marine Chronometer[2]. But if indeed mercenerism is the defining characteristic then it makes a lot more sense to think about societal collapse, because the fundamental design of the West, like many other civilisations, is based on logistical exploitation, which, unlike technological innovation, is fundamentally unsustainable.<p>And as a hacker, to me, such a design flaw cannot be patched away. Not that I advocate surrender, but rather, how do we, as hackers, minimise the impending destruction of a failing system? I wonder if one of the first steps is to stop wasting energy on any efforts based on the idea that we can fix this? Rather how can we, if it is even possible, gracefully manage the collapse?<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25361028" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25361028</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marine_chronometer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marine_chronometer</a>')
