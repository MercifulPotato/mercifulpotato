There are many many 1:1 interactions in this world.<p>For instance, we could simply say, as long as your store is low volume, only has 1 cashier, and only lets 1 healthy looking person in at a time, you don&#x27;t represent a &quot;spread concern&quot;.<p>&gt; While most transmission is via super spreader individuals, you can&#x27;t know if the one person you give covid-19 will end up a spreader.<p>Yet as far as we know, no such event has ever been tracked back to a sex worker.   Not conclusive, but if you&#x27;re honest you have to at least wonder why and if we have some mistaken assumptions in our models.')
