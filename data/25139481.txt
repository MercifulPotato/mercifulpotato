If a company manages to save on a salary because the employee doesn&#x27;t have much negotiating power, good for the company.<p>If that&#x27;s a companies goal, then an employee&#x27;s goal should be to counter that, and Unions are a line of defense against companies treating an employee as a resource to &quot;extract&quot; from.<p>Free markets are good and all, but companies leveraging their outsized power against individual people shouldn&#x27;t be surprised nor able to prevent individuals from working to put that power in check.')
