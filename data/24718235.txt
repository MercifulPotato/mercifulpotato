Last post was 6 months ago. Prior to that, only responses to his announcement of Bel. Other than Bel, no submissions since 2014.<p>I&#x27;d guess he has some resentment of increasingly polarised discussions (and maybe procrastination by users?); I&#x27;ve run a forum for 10+ years and resent a lot of the trends in the way people talk to each other, and I certainly read&#x2F;post a lot less on my own site as a result. Or could just be changes in priorities in having children?<p>I&#x27;ve long suspected that he and&#x2F;or a small subset of valued users have migrated somewhere else, even if to a private Slack&#x2F;similar. Often feels like some past regulars are missing.')
