The opinion is available here at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;20pdf&#x2F;20a62_n7ip.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;20pdf&#x2F;20a62_n7ip.pdf</a> and this is all the text for granting it.<p>&gt; The application for stay presented to JUSTICE KAGAN and by her referred to the Court is granted. The district court’s September 24, 2020 order granting a preliminary injunc- tion is stayed pending disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought. Should the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically. In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.<p>The rest of the 6-7 pages contains the dissent of one justice. I wanted to know the reasoning of why the other justices ruled the way they did, but none was provided.')
