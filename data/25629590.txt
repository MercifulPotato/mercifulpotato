Pitchforks and pile are the excesses of a generally good movement to excise mean spirited or just unintentionally demeaning stuff from our culture but growing and learning to respect others is not a bad impulse. So I wouldn&#x27;t pile on the author of this site but definitely will not be sharing it amongst my peers.')
