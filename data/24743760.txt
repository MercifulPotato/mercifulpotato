They&#x27;re still using the same fundamental mechanism of pressure to transmit sound. But light isn&#x27;t sound because the mechanism of propagation is fundamentally different, not just at a different scale or with a different medium. It&#x27;s subject to different laws and behaves qualitatively differently. For example, it can be polarized.<p>I wonder about a neutron star though? Is that still subject to this theoretical speed of sound limit, or is it only atomic substances?')
