Item(by='caconym_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607717630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390268, text='&gt; Well, Apple has had obvious flops over the years, specifically because the price didn&#x27;t match the features. The HomePod, for instance.<p>I would not argue with this and in fact I specifically addressed the does-the-market-actually-exist concern in my comment.<p>&gt; But if you claim that Apple made a product that sounds better than Bose or Sony&#x27;s counterparts, and has better ANC, that is not verifiable, at least not until there are in-depth reviews out there confirming it.<p>I don’t claim any such thing. The point of my comment is that the parent comment implied that there is no real difference, then said that even if there <i>is</i> a difference who cares because does anybody really need better sound anyway?<p>So my point is, what is the point of that comment? What is it bringing to this discussion, suggesting that Apple’s new headphones may be overpriced wrt. their sound quality, and if not then they’re overpriced anyway? Good sound is something some people care about and will pay for.')
