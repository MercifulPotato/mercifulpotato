I have no doubt that for some it will be a game-changer: the ones who will never use anything except a mac but ran into performance limitations with the intel-based models.<p>But for people who do video editing on ThreadRippers and such, the new Mac Mini is a little, not-too-fat nothingburger of a machine. The fact the the &quot;$4000 iMac Pro&quot; was woefully overpriced and underpowered doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>Hint: I can run a faster Mac in a VM on my 16 core threadripper than I could ever have bought from Apple.')
