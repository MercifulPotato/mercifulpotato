It is simply not comparable to some local baker, where only a few citizen will go to on a day.<p>The divide between the have and have not could be stronger, though, when you dont have, maybe that is still a lot more to what you have today (e.g. medical progress), it is just not as much as the ones at the top.<p>And then the cycle continuous, the divide will be used to form agendas, and so on.<p>I think what hinders us the most in installing a proper system for globalization, that all these areas have grown for centuries and it is definitly not easy to unify and agree on something. I hope, people have answers for that. I definitly do not want a system like communist china for that, i just &quot;escaped&quot; one myself, even though it probably has many advantages too. :-)')
