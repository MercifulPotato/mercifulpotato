Predictably, the laws have had limited effect on rich tax evaders and huge negative impact on millions of non-rich expats. In general one should be extremely skeptical of regulations which are sold as &quot;not even applying to most people,&quot; as the unintended consequences will almost certainly hurt a lot of people outside of the scope of the law&#x27;s stated target.')
