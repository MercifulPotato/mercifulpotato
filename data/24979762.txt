For colorectal for example, adenomas and carcinomas are lumped for a change.<p>Prostate is the second most common worldwide, or skin cancer, depending on year. The big 5 are over 1.5 million. (WCRF data. They lump all lung cancers but split immune system and skin cancers. For reasons? Bladder and lung cancer incidence is highly dependent on factors such as smoking and specific chemicals used in manufacturing. Potentially the same with colorectal and diet. Rates for breast and prostate are high because they&#x27;re easy to spot and well tested. So per country data varies a lot.)')
