It&#x27;s frustrating to have the author add his opinion. This sort of thing:<p>&gt; But in the climate of gonzo laboratory experimentation, at a time when all sorts of tweaked variants and amped-up substitutions were being tested on cell cultures and in the lungs of humanized mice and other experimental animals, isn’t it possible ...<p>I confess to having skimmed the article except for the final two sections, but the subject matter expert[2] I see quoted has this to say:<p>&gt; Baric said he still thought the virus came from bats in southern China, perhaps directly, or possibly via an intermediate host, although the smuggled pangolins, in his view, were a red herring. The disease evolved in humans over time without being noticed, he suspected, becoming gradually more infectious, and eventually a person carried it to Wuhan “and the pandemic took off.” Then he said, “Can you rule out a laboratory escape? The answer in this case is probably not.”<p>So the SME thinks it&#x27;s zoonotic. But proving it&#x27;s zoonotic is not currently a question science can answer (apparently), and the SME is being responsible by saying so. The author is taking advantage of that fact (IMO) to write this long-form piece.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nicholson_Baker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nicholson_Baker</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.med.unc.edu&#x2F;microimm&#x2F;directory&#x2F;ralph-baric-phd-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.med.unc.edu&#x2F;microimm&#x2F;directory&#x2F;ralph-baric-phd-1...</a>')
