Enforcement won&#x27;t be 100% effective, of course, and the collateral damage would be enormous. It won&#x27;t have nearly as much effect on the actual &quot;bad guys&quot; as it will on ordinary civilians. However, nothing prevents them from passing bad laws banning encryption. Which is exactly why such disastrous policies need to be strongly opposed.')
