There is nothing recent enough about how they treat the Melee scene to blame emulators or sexual misconduct, it&#x27;s been documented to be happening since the scene was revived post-brawl.<p>The evo shutdown was presumably attempted to avoid any comparisons between their newest game (Brawl) and Melee; similarly, the recent shutdown probably has more to do with how bad Ultimate&#x27;s online is compared to emulated Melee, rather than the mere fact that they&#x27;re on an emulator in the first place. Other emulated online Melee tournaments without Ultimate have gotten away with it so far.')
