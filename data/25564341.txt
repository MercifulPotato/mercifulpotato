Stamford is the tier 1 city in CT IMHO, which seemed kind of lame. i.e. we would have friends in places further east (almost as far as New Haven) who would come to Stamford for the &quot;scene&quot;. I use quotes because the scene in Stamford was pretty muted. We (who lived in Stamford) would drive to Manhattan for our weekends and special weeknights. I thought it worked really well for us. For 2400 a month, we were living in Luxury apartments and life was car friendly. Housing didn&#x27;t seem too overpriced (starter homes were 600K IIRC). IMO, Stamford was pretty neat a few years back .. not sure if it has changed.<p>Bay area housing just went stupid until the pandemic hit. I moved out and so did many people I know. It was just not &quot;affordable&quot; on a 200K salary if you have multiple kids and a stay at home spouse. The housing you could get for $2400 was terrible in most parts that were reasonable commuting distance. I also would take metro north over caltrain any day.<p>Taxes are bad in both places. Stamford seemed more affordable and a lot better culture to me. I love the Bay area but can&#x27;t make the math work :(')
