The slower pace of writing allows for more time to think about what I write.<p>Often it would stick so well I didn&#x27;t need the notes afterwards, but I had to go through that process of writing them.<p>An important part here is that I&#x27;m basically copying the lecturer, so I don&#x27;t have to think about what to write. Once I have to that I learn almost nothing.<p>For me this is part of the reason why I learn a lot less when taking notes on my computer, as suddenly I have distractions like having to care about formatting, drawing boxes and arrows etc. On paper you just move your hand a little, draw bigger letters, or draw a box. It&#x27;s not something you have to think about.<p>I had mainly math and physics though, might be different for other topics.')
