Similarly when Twitter banned political adverts, where do you think political adverts dollars went to?).<p>The crypto community is another community that suffers from this delusion. They think that they can build a technical platform to get around AML laws and regulations. Sure. My good friend worked in the San Fran ICO space and through her I met a ton of crypto people and they were all deluded like this (one of them though he could create a mesh network with drones to get around government control of the internet). Their perspectives were endearing and I appreciate their existence ... but delusional.<p>What do you think you&#x27;re going to solve by introducing yet another platform (centralized or decentralized)? You think you&#x27;re going to be left alone from those in positions of power (whether it be the mainstream media who want to reassert their traditional gatekeeping or governments and their regulatory bodies)?')
