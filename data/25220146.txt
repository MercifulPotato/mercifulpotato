Similarity when Twitter banned political adverts, where do you think political adverts went to?).<p>The crypto community is another community that suffers from this delusion. They think that they can build a technical platform to get around AML laws and regulations. Sure.<p>What do you think you&#x27;re going to solve by introducing yet another platform (centralized or decentralized)? You think you&#x27;re going to be left alone from those in positions of power (whether it be the mainstream media or government bodies)?')
