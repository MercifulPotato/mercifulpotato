You don&#x27;t have to stop using your primary mail client to incorporate a second one into your workflow. Just think of the patches as notification emails in your normal inbox, and then something like aerc as a domain-specific tool. Over time I bet you&#x27;ll find yourself opening aerc more and thunderbird less, though ;)<p>We&#x27;re also working on web-based tools for this workflow, which allow you to create patchsets, respond to feedback, and review them entirely from the web, but these are still WIP. You can submit patchsets and view discussions on the web today, and the rest of the tools are WIP.')
