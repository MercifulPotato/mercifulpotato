Where I live is a ~35 minute flight to Seattle, has several hospitals, everything within a fifteen minute drive, four mild seasons, and an average house price of $300K. It&#x27;s also wine country. Main thing our market lacks is people with capital willing to update and reinvest in older homes and&#x2F;or build out non-cookie cutter new homes.<p>Depending on what you are looking for in life, I suspect there are lots of places in the world that could work for you.')
