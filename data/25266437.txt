Clearly Foxconn&#x27;s promised jobs never materialized, but the threat of them coming to town to spend big money may have had a chilling effect on existing or prospective new employers in the area.<p>Back to the F-35 program, the jobs it creates may be deadweight, deadend careers that don&#x27;t produce real value. And then you can&#x27;t just have these people unemployed and starving, so I guess we&#x27;ll need an F-35+1 program for them and their descendents. And so on forever, until we break this cycle.<p>Versus something else that you could buy with the same money that has a future and does create real value (like say, solar panels?). But you&#x27;re right, its just about the perception of jobs and that photo op.')
