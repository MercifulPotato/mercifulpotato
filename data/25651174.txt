As the company advances your duties will increase and personal time gone.<p>Best thing would be to raise this with your manager, if no real action is taken then leaving or changing team is an option.<p>Being oncall and paid for it is much better. Here your personal time being lost with no compensation is simply not worth it. In fact if you don&#x27;t respond in time it may reflect badly on you.<p>There is an approach that can be taken to focus sprints on only improving oncall but it requires management buy in.
