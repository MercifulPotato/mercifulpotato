For instance there was a display list coprocessor which worked much like the Amiga&#x27;s copper and could modify display attributes independent from the CPU. Of course I don&#x27;t know how much of this was actually used in this Wayout game.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atari_8-bit_family" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atari_8-bit_family</a>')
