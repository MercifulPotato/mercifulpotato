Baking is baking.  There may be similar overlaps but each is its own thing.  I don&#x27;t know about this guy&#x27;s coding but his baking is bad and his analogy is worse.  Preheat oven and greasing the cookie sheet are two separate tasks, it&#x27;ll never be written like together like that.  Nobody writes 350 if peanut butter, 325 if oatmeal raisins.  (Perhaps 350 conventional 325 convect).  Despite the fact the preheat to 350 is probably the most frequent directive, it&#x27;s repeated in every baking recipe ever, code re-use is not a thing. Why? because it costs nothing to print and it costs nothing to adhere to a one-line direction.  Nobody omits the &quot;preheat&quot; line, even though it&#x27;s understood that every recipe follows this.  Has this person read any cookbook other than ones in the local papers?  Recipes have changed drastically over time, eg cooking recipes from colonial America, or cookbooks from another culture. They are radically different from what we know and use at present, and those people could cook and feed themselves perfectly fine.  Modern recipe template is an attempt to modify the professional kitchen&#x27;s mise en place for the home cook.  This article is a terrible analogy.  An excellent recipe does not follow the modern cookbook&#x27;s template, it is extremely customized.')
