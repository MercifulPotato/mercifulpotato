So basically right now it&#x27;s not a casual decision to say &quot;I prefer X over JS, so I&#x27;ll just use that instead because it targets WASM!&quot; Because there&#x27;s this enormous cost of crossing that API barrier (which means you&#x27;ll be using some JS regardless, directly or indirectly).<p>So for now the value-proposition only really makes sense for a fairly narrow subset of projects: mostly ones where client-side pure-compute is a bottleneck. Theoretically API access is being worked on, but I think it&#x27;s still a ways out.')
