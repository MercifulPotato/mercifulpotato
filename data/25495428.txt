The point I&#x27;m trying to make is: what is a fair % of Apple&#x27;s profits for an individual worker, and how much would it cost that worker to buy in as a worker-owner?  Back of the envelope: $2.13T market cap, 137k employees: $15.5 million buy-in cost per employee-owner (~123k shares each).  Dividends per share 2020: $2.615, or $323k&#x2F;yr per worker.  Please check my math, but I think I have the orders of magnitude right.<p>Personally, if you have a spare $15.5 million, I&#x27;d recommend a more diversified portfolio of broad-market low-fee index funds and (IMO) early retirement.')
