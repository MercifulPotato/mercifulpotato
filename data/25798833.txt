I happen to disagree with you on a lot of these things - but I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be so dismissive about manually rerendering and assuming it won&#x27;t scale to larger applications.<p>Speaking to your specific examples: I do agree that some of the new React hooks (especially useEffect) seem to promote an ... idealistic idea of how your component should trigger and react to side effects (especially if you enable the eslint plugins) - namely always due to changes in reference equality. If you need to deal with other things (like an ID changing in a nested object that gets recreated on each render) it can be a big headache and error-prone.<p>On the other hand - most of these hooks (and libraries and build tools you are alluding to) are easy to modify or use something else if you don&#x27;t like them. Personally I find that much easier than building web apps like I used to pre-React and dealing with manual state synchronization. But to each their own! I&#x27;ve seen some pretty clean non-React codebases and I&#x27;ve seen some pretty messy React ones, just as I have on the flip side.')
