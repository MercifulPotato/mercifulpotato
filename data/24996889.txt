Item(by='mikro2nd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604569774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24996354, text='As I understood the article, the brewery is <i>not</i> using the process to generate electricity, but to heat fluids (water and wort).<p>In essence brewing process is a hell of a lot about moving heat around: You heat water to mash the grain to make wort, you boil the wort, then you remove the heat (via heat exchanger) as quickly as possible to get the wort down to where the yeast is happy. What are you going to do with all that energy you&#x27;ve pumped in to the fluid in the first place and have just pumped out again? If you&#x27;re clever (energy conscious) you find a way to cycle that back into the process. There are lots of opportunities to optimise and conserve the energy that gets shunted back and forth in a brewery and it&#x27;s a whole art&#x2F;science in itself.')
