Imagine if you proposed a system that required hours of everyone&#x27;s time, cost them hundreds of dollars, forced them to sit in cramped positions, and subjected them to invasive scans and searches of their personal materials.&quot;<p>&quot;How are schools allowed! They literally imprison our kids for upwards of 7 hours a day, feed them substandard food, and subject them to Orwellian surveillance, exorbitant record-keeping, cruel social hierarchies, and a stress-inducing grading system akin to a dystopian social credit system.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not saying the downsides aren&#x27;t in fact downsides.
