Item(by='hn_throwaway_99', descendants=None, kids=[24736745, 24740174], score=None, time=1602303105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736475, text='As someone who is generally a &quot;slow responder&quot;, I&#x27;ll guess at the root cause. My guess is that being a slow email responder is correlated with (a) higher propensity to procrastinate, (b) general indecisiveness and (c) lower self-esteem, all of which are not hard to see why they would negatively impact business success. Of course, I could just be projecting, but when I am slow to respond to an email, it&#x27;s usually because I want to overthink the response, or that something about writing the response is generally uncomfortable so I practice avoidant behavior (same thing feeds into procrastination). That root cause trait has proven very inhibitory for me achieving my goals.')
