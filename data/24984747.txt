The dead are instead owed respect. If he had wanted particular things to happen after his death he could have written a will. Absent that, I think it&#x27;s reasonable that the people who found him do what they they think most respectful.<p>The duty of respect for the dead also doesn&#x27;t trump the needs of the living. If there are people out there waiting for his return, they should be told. I know somebody who&#x27;s son disappeared, presumably in shame, after he failed out of college. For years and years it hurt her daily to not know . Eventually he got back in touch. If he had died before doing that, she would have deserved to know that her wait was over.')
