There were also likely alternative arrangements that could have legally been made to be more efficient even in the absence of the scheme.<p>Ultimately I would have preferred to know in advance even if the tax had to be paid this way and had the option to discuss and obtain advice on how to proceed rather than be lied to and have tax withheld with 1 day&#x27;s notice.<p>However given the general chaotic and disorganised nature of the startup their poor handling was not at all a surprise.<p>I think the moral of the story is even if you are lucky enough to cash out don&#x27;t expect the company to do &#x27;the right thing&#x27; in any way. It is really out of your hands.<p>I had fully vested shares not options so EMI didn&#x27;t come into it.')
