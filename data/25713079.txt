If you&#x27;re tirelessly doing the wrong thing all day long, how prosperous should you be?<p>But most importantly, what&#x27;s supposed to be guaranteed is the equality in opportunities, not in outcomes.<p>If you are trying to become a programmer while you could make a better living as an electrician, why should someone (&quot;society&quot;, aka people who chose wisely and now pay tax) fund your career aspirations? Complete nonsense!<p>&quot;Hard work&quot; isn&#x27;t guaranteed to make you well off, it&#x27;s just an ingredient that merely increases your chances. Everything else being equal, a harder Bangladeshi fisherman will usually be better off than a lazy one. That has nothing to do with how much Norway invests in its fleet, or Bangladesh in education.<p>No one owes you anything. Lose that entitlement attitude.')
