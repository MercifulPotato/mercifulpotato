But many things just aren&#x27;t that fun or satisfying if you don&#x27;t at least achieve competence.<p>Learning how to play the guitar was frustrating for me, but my stubbornness to be able to play the music I listened to is what kept me going. I&#x27;m constantly listening to music and I knew I would enjoy it in the long run so I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it, but man, the first hundred hours or so of learning honestly wasn&#x27;t enjoyable to me. I love it now but it felt like a chore at the time.')
