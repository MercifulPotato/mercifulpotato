I&#x27;m a (former) lawyer and have never heard of a blanket protection for time and location shifting. It might be allowed for certain types of copyrighted content, or if done by the end-user. But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a blanket allowance for all copyrighted materials, especially when a third party is involved.')
