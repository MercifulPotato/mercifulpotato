This is not just generating LLVM IR.\nJulia also has it&#x27;s own optimization system for language specific optimizations that LLVM struggle to do (due to language specific info getting lost in conversion to LLVM IR).<p>Google&#x27;s V8 (js interpreter) also uses modern compiler tech but I think it is not as capable as LLVM optimization vise (I don&#x27;t think it is designed to be).<p>Python will either adapt or perish. Even if it is not julia it would be a another language.')
