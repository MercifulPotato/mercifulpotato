Item(by='frankfrankfrank', descendants=None, kids=[25735740], score=None, time=1610395521, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735145, text='I find it hard to ridicule conservatives for the members that do them significant disservice through all the rather unhealthy obsessive conspiracy stuff because no conspiracy nonsense has been likely more amplified over about 4 years total at a nonstop pace, day in and day out by the propaganda organs of state than the Russian collusion conspiracy used to try to cap Trump at his knees.<p>But let&#x27;s also not forget that the government clearly does engage in rather evil conspiracies â€¦ Iraq WMD, anyone? And there are hundreds more proven conspiracies.<p>What we are ally seeing here is the onset of a dissolution and dissolving of our social and national cohesion. It was a clear and provable risk from immigration and diversity as shown for decades in research after research from evidence all over the globe and history, but her we are. Social cohesion has been replaced by not only disintegration, but also by a destruction of the methods and ideals that unified the USA before. All that I have read and studied on the topic over years, essentially condemns the USA to breaking up absent of increasing levels of control and repression and imposition of a fake kind of unification around hollow ideals and values not shared among the actual people and cultures that now inhabit the the territory of the former USA (a bit of foreshadowing there).<p>I would love to hear theories on how you keep what are essentially distinct colonies of foreign nationals (by ethnicity) across the country in a cohesive jurisdiction like the USA, especially when you have an increasingly and justifiably angered native population that is noticing that the promise of utopia through immigration was a con job to disenfranchise them of what all people of the world would perceive as their birth right, the right to keep what those before us created for those after them.  I just don&#x27;t see it happening without extreme repression, which of course will see escalating reaction that will either end in victory or vanquish, for one side or another.')
