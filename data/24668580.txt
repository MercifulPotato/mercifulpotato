I don&#x27;t know how building highways is a legitimate use of government power where matchmaking between workers and employers is not. It&#x27;s the type of big government intervention that virtually no one would complain about. The amount of excess effort wasted in matching people to employment is entirely wasted. Minimizing it would be like giving everybody a raise.')
