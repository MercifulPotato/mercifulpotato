Windows has embedded bloatware, and Apple allows no control over your hardware. There&#x27;s really no other option if you care about these things. (Full disclosure - I do own a Macbook for photography work, and use Bootcamp for gaming.)<p>Like you, my Linux installs have been incredibly stable for a long time, even with a rolling release distro which is often considered &quot;unstable.&quot;<p>I use Linux at work, and while I struggle with a few tools others do not as regularly (e.g. video teleconferencing software isn&#x27;t always optimized for Linux, but overall it works fine), I also don&#x27;t encounter tons of errors they do. From Apple updates bricking machines, to obscure Bluetooth&#x2F;Wifi issues that you can&#x27;t fix, or having to run Docker in a VM, I&#x27;m pretty convinced I&#x27;ve got it better.')
