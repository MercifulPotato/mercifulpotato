From what I understand, it&#x27;s more common for business customers instead of residential. (Apparently chillers that freeze water overnight with cheap electricity to run daytime air conditioning is a thing.)<p>But anyway, I have a fancy powerwall and solar, but I only use it for backup. Why? There&#x27;s no incentive to use the battery. It&#x27;s 95% efficient, so if I use the battery at night, I get less net metering credits than if I just use it as backup.')
