There was one non-BLM-affiliated protest in Minnesota in 2015 where this was chanted for a few minutes. It was roundly criticized, and the people involved clarified that they did not want to have anyone killed, but just wanted police to receive the same punishment for murder as anyone else. Clearly the chant itself was stupidly inflammatory, however angry the protestors might have been, and it does not accurately reflect anyone’s serious beliefs, which is why it has not been repeated or endorsed by other protestors.<p>cf. e.g. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;us&#x2F;fact-checking-trump-s-references-to-the-anti-police-chant-pigs-in-a-blanket-fry-em-like-bacon&#x2F;ar-BB16gz4E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;us&#x2F;fact-checking-trump-s-refe...</a><p>The way Trump and others have described this is essentially a lie.<p>* * *<p>I am flattered that my balls have impressed you.')
