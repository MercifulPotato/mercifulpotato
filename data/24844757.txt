It may mostly be a wrapper around rsync, but it’s a very good one. :-)<p>For cloud backups, I’m still looking. My personal criteria are security (of course), good data integrity management, continuous backup, upload speed, and low resource utilisation. I was hoping to find something which was also simple enough that I could also tell non-technical friends and family to just use &lt;whatever&gt;. What I found was:<p>Backblaze… well, you know.<p>Carbonite uses Java and is slow.<p>SpiderOak uses Python and is slow.<p>Duplicacy uses Go along with a local web interface for the consumer version. It currently consumes <i>way</i> too much memory during backups[0].<p>IDrive I never tried installing; I was put off by how it appears to uses a fleet management model where configuration relies on visiting their web site and having stuff get pushed down to the client.<p>Acronis True Backup somehow manages to be 700 megabytes on disk. I thought they must be using CEF, but no, it seems to just contain a truly colossal amount of code along with a 100 megabyte help file.<p>At some point I stumbled across Arq, which looked like it could be a winner: they’ve published a couple CVEs on their site like a good company should; they have a monthly sub or you can just buy the software outright and use your own cheap cloud storage like S3 Glacier; they even publish the format of their backup files[1]. But then they went and released Arq 6 using CEF for the UI. It looks like they listened to feedback from users and will be going back to a native UI for Arq 7, and so I plan to take a serious look at this once it is released.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.duplicacy.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;memory-usage&#x2F;623&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.duplicacy.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;memory-usage&#x2F;623&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arqbackup.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;arqcloudbackup&#x2F;English.lproj&#x2F;dataFormat.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arqbackup.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;arqcloudbackup&#x2F;English.lproj&#x2F;...</a>')
