Item(by='trhway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612026080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25970463, text='&gt;I don&#x27;t think conspiracies suddenly become legal just because they were very large.<p>in theory you&#x27;re right. The practice though says differently- the mass conspiracy and violation of medalion laws (Uber) and zoning laws (AirBnb) got treated as new phenomenon - &quot;sharing economy&quot; - instead of RICO because it was that massive and coordinated.<p>There is also another aspect here. The huge short interest on GME was most probably naked (illegal) in significant part,  and those huge shorts were probably made in order to drive the price down (market manipulation, illegal). So, these crooks wouldn&#x27;t have been caught with their pants down if SEC was doing its job and wasn&#x27;t allowing (by lax enforcement at least) all these shenanigans to their hedge fund buddies. In that situation SEC suddenly becoming a crusader against market manipulation and going after WSB retail investors would look a lot like selective enforcement and a regulatory capture by the crooks.')
