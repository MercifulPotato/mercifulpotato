If the customer is reducing the value for other customers, then they are breaking the virtuous cycle of the business. This is unstable and will result in either the customer or the business being hurt. If the business is hurt, all of its customers are hurt to some degree because the cost will be passed onto them. This is a matter of consumer protection. Bad actors who reduce the value of other customers should not be tolerated.
