I&#x27;ll add: I would be shocked if that were not the case.<p>Regardless of my personal feelings about the NYP, my guess is they probably did verify to some extent and I agree that they are probably authentic.<p>I can understand the temptation of doing this sort of &quot;slow the spread&quot; if you&#x27;re a social media platform faced with Trump, my worry is when that gets turned around and deployed against the Left, or against anti-trust, etc. I&#x27;m already getting near daily push notifications from Uber telling me which way to vote in California elections, I&#x27;m terrified of what the future holds where Twitter et al. can ban certain messages from even being sent to friends.')
