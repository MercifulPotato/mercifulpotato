Unfortunately, this kind of graph structure appears to preclude naive applications of ANNs developed for tabular and sequence data (e.g. LSTMs, transformers, etc).<p>Does anyone know of any good references that demonstrate how to account for the graph structure of such problems? Is it a terrible idea to essentially one-hot encode the adjacency matrix and provide it as an input to an LSTM or Transformer architecture? Are there more efficient ways to encode paired comparisons?<p>I tried something like a neural network version of Elo with more features (i.e. RNN), but I suspect I was suffering from exploding&#x2F;vanishing gradients since I was chaining the same hidden layer update step for thousands of games.<p>Any advice or direction here would be much appreciated!')
