I don&#x27;t have keys right now but they come with hardware all the time and I already have a Suite licence. On the Ableton subreddit sometimes there&#x27;s giveaways.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a gateway drug, because you can do a lot of stuff on the Lite version but all the &quot;fun&quot; things like all the bundled instruments and effects that let you use it like a modular synth or the scripting and automation goodness come only on the more expensive version.')
