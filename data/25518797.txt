It&#x27;s not theoretical, researchers are quoted in the article and papers have been altered.<p>I find it difficult to come up with an analogy from a public institution. What is the product the math department would be pressuring it&#x27;s members to protect?<p>Sure, each department in a university believes it&#x27;s work important. That doesn&#x27;t seem even remotely similar to me as this issue with Google.')
