But making it lighter will make it weaker.  And even today there are limits to computer analysis, hence why they would do pressure tests at all; if the models were foolproof then why would anybody test pressure vessels?  Pressure vessels are tested because their danger is well understood.  Testing would be a waste of time if outcomes were certain, so failure during tests is not concerning.<p>(This rocket falling over was presumably not part of a test to see whether it will fall over.)')
