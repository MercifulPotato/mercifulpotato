Then I realized it was for eight bonded ISDN BRIs.<p>I actually used the exact model I got at a previous job, although it was on ethernet by that point. I remember the codec&#x27;s UI being painfully hard to use. I have a SIP setup here so I might try to get the codec working with it later, but for now I haven&#x27;t even powered it up yet. I did crack it open out of curiosity and it&#x27;s neat how they heatsinked all of the ASIC codec chips to the aluminum case. All around very nice hardware design, which I guess we ought to expect out of Norway.
