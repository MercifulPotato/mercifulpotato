Either this person is only mobile in indoor spaces for some reason or this person lives somewhere they were doing police checkpoints if you leave your house (like Bangalore). I&#x27;ve spent at least 2x more hours outside, walking, riding bikes, hiking, hitting golf balls, etc. There&#x27;s nothing else to do but be outside.
