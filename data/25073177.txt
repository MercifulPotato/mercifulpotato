I have an app that is often expected to open audio files by dragging them from iTunes, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all from Music - nothing in the drop handler logic ever gets activated, even though the user is hanging over the app with the new extra-big drop icon.<p>This seems like something that should be well-known, but I&#x27;ve had terrible trouble trying to find any documentation for it. I am something of an imposter Mac developer, so maybe I just don&#x27;t know the right people to ask.)')
