Apparently, their official court documents site wants $.50 &#x2F; page for the PDFs of filings. That&#x27;s not happening.<p>Many of the court records can apparently be found on democracydocket.com, but my browser is complaining about the site. Sorry.<p>Trump v. Kemp, 1:20-cv-5310 (N.D. Ga.)

The plaintiff&#x27;s first claim is that the election was not conducted in accord with election laws established by the GA legislature. The court decides &quot;<i>Therefore, Plaintiffs Electors Clause claim belongs, if it belongs to anyone, only to the Georgia General Assembly</i>&quot; and since none of the plaintiffs are members of the assembly, they don&#x27;t have standing. (That&#x27;s rather fine logic chopping, but....)<p>The rest of the ruling seems to be that the governor and secretary of state of the state are not the ones legally responsible for verification of ballots, so the second claim cannot apply to them.')
