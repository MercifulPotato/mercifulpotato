Fewer people will have the problems you&#x27;re describing in the first place.<p>Do this over and over, and ultimately, nobody&#x27;s left at the bottom.<p>On the other hand, if you reject all attempts to bring people out of poverty because there&#x27;s currently people in poverty, well, you&#x27;re never going to achieve a single thing.<p>This increase in wages also yields an increase in tax revenue, which can be spent to improve things like public transit, further ameliorating the situation moving forward.<p>Keep in mind this is a 25% increase in what many view as a luxury good, but the minimum wage is going up by... 25%. So, for everyone at the bottom, it&#x27;s a net zero change. On the other hand their buying power in other areas of their lives actually goes up. So who is being hurt? I guess the folks in the donut hole?')
