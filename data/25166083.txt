The value of Youtube lies in the content which its users upload, if you have something worth sharing on there you can also share it elsewhere. Begin by having content both on Youtube as well as PeerTube and point those who are annoyed by Youtube-ads to the ad-free PeerTube instance. Youtube will eventually change its terms and conditions so as to forbid pointing users to alternative distribution channels so the sooner you set up those alternatives and start pointing your viewers there the bigger chance you have of spreading the word. Replace the lost income from Youtube with one of the many sponsoring services, this will aid in becoming less dependent on Youtube. Once the PeerTube channel has gained traction you can put a moratorium on your Youtube presence. Keep to this and, once you are close to the end, replace old content with short trailers which point viewers to the new site. Continue publishing on the new site, if you want you can put trailers on Youtube but it is probably better to refrain from doing so as this might end up annoying viewers. Just leave a message on your channel about the move and keep it at that. Assuming that your content is worthwhile to viewers they will follow you.<p>Don&#x27;t criticise the media, become the media')
