I&#x27;ve seen guides on doing a GPU passthrough to the docker container so I know it&#x27;s possible to do. That might be my next build, a AMD CPU and a GPU for Plex, it will depend on where UnRaid AMD support is at the time (it has had issues in the past from what I&#x27;ve seen on the forums) but I really want my next build to use AMD.')
