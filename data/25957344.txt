Item(by='finnthehuman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611929291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954383, text='&gt;Iâ€™ve read this article twice now and it feels like confused word soup<p>Yeah, that&#x27;ll happen with a lot of the testing &quot;literature&quot; from the 2005ish to 2015ish era.<p>It was a popular topic at the time, and one I was searching for answers on too.  But I was working at a company that was ahead of the curve on testing and I got so frustrated at publicly available resources on testing.  During that time and still to this day, when I read about testing online I kinda feel like I&#x27;m drunk. I have an idea of what&#x27;s going on, things sorta make sense but not really. I&#x27;m only understanding bits and pieces. There are unnecessary and over-complicated details on some things, suspiciously light on meaty topics.<p>There was so much drivel written about testing back then that I still get angry remembering that people would say with a straight face &quot;you don&#x27;t need documentation, tests are your documentation.&quot;')
