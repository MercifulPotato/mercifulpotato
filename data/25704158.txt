I always said &quot;large portion of extremists&quot;, &quot;a large part of climate change deniers&quot;, etc.<p>What I&#x27;m replying to here is the multiple posts (not yours) saying that the problem is that some people on the left have been communicating in a combative&#x2F;ineffective manner.<p>While this is true, I don&#x27;t believe this is <i>the source</i> of the problem. And demanding perfection from one side while absolving the other is not a fair tactic. It&#x27;s pure bullshit. Why must the left be flawless? In fact, it&#x27;s a bit condescending to the extremists.')
