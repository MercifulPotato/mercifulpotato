This lets bundler easily live on top of it providing per-project dependencies somewhat more smoothly than Rubygems does without requiring anything like a venv.<p>&gt; Perhaps ruby was more &quot;hackable&quot; by bundler.<p>Ruby is ludicrously hackable, yes.<p>&gt; (Bundler has now become part of ruby stdlib, but didn&#x27;t start out that way, it definitely started hacking around the way the more fundamental stdlib &#x27;rubygems&#x27; worked).<p>Rubygems <i>also</i> wasn&#x27;t part of stdlib originally, and started out relying on hacking around the way Kernel#require works.')
