My wife is a historian. Every semester or so she gets a student who outright refuses to do the readings because it is all sjw bullshit and insists on spending class time arguing that slavery was actually super good for africa. And then she needs to deal with this student with kid gloves or they will run to FIRE or whatever. A colleague of hers this semester had a student complain because &quot;the course description didn&#x27;t say that it would cover women&quot; after a single lecture on subaltern groups.')
