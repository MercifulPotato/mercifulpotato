If the way to make anim√© &quot;survive&quot; means removing meaningful human authorial input, then maybe it&#x27;s best if it dies?<p>Well respected sci-fi authors of all times have seen this scenario as a dystopia. I remember one short story -- was it by PKD -- where an author inputs a novel &quot;high concept&quot; into a computer, a second later says &quot;wait, I have a minor correction&quot; and the computer replies &quot;too late, I&#x27;ve already written the novel and its sequels based on your concept, it&#x27;s already being distributed&quot;.<p>Surely the answer to &quot;this requires top talent and human artistry, and this stuff costs money&quot; cannot be &quot;replace them all with Machine Learning&quot;, can it?')
