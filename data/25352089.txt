Punctured eardrum out of clumsiness is not a qualifying case.<p>&gt; This warning always struck me as exaggerated caution, like telling kids to never ever touch a pair of scissors, just to avoid the possible risk of them running with scissors, which has a possible risk of them tripping onto scissors.<p>That&#x27;s definitely a qualifying case.<p>It&#x27;s quite valid to want to avoid rare but extreme outcomes.  For instance: maybe most kids can run with scissors with only minor issues, but then there&#x27;s that one kids who gives themselves a horrible injury one day in kindergarten that&#x27;s traumatic to everyone (e.g. ends up stabbing themselves in the eye, possibly resulting in blindness or even brain damage).')
