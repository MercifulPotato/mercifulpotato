You don’t care enough about the issue to educate yourself? Simply cast the vote for the option your government&#x2F;party&#x2F;favourite expert recommends! After all, you <i>already</i> trust them (otherwise you wouldn’t have voted for them), so by “delegating” your vote to them, is equivalent to not having the popular vote in the first place!')
