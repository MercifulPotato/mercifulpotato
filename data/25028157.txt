And none of these editors were meant to be used like that, because their main purpose was &#x2F; is to edit files, not control Spotify with it, write emails, read rss feeds, and whatnot.<p>Yes, VS Code goes in that direction, but I don&#x27;t know many laymans who extend VS Code. They are rather devs with a focus on JS.')
