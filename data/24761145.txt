When I rent one, the &quot;extra hassle&quot; is I spend a minute on a phone app reserving it first.<p>I don&#x27;t see it as a barrier, and at least at my use, way cheaper than a car. But the real gain is not dealing with parking, moving for street cleaning, parking tickets, broken windows, etc.')
