The last reference uses the word &quot;left,&quot; reinforcing the position that Google didn&#x27;t fire her.<p>Have no doubt: this CYA text was massaged and went through several HR and in-house GC revisions, and maybe even a few round-trips to outside labor litigation counsel.<p>In other words, this statement is pure CYA and litigation-defensive. They&#x27;re terrified of a racial discrimination lawsuit.<p>I hope that Timnit can find her way to the courthouse. I&#x27;d love to cross-examine Pichai with this statement in hand. He would deny that these were his words. He would say that he would have expressed it differently. He would say that he wasn&#x27;t involved with the firing decision: every time the question is asked, the noun used is &quot;termination&quot; and not departure.<p>The only question remaining, assuming Timnit does file, is quanta of damages.')
