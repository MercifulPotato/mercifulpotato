This is especially true for Semis as they have a notoriously bad drag coefficient. The range for the Volvo trucks could be up  to 300 km as stated in the article, that is okay for some haul distances but you need serious charging infrastructure if you are going to be charging a Semi every 250 - 300 km. These trucks will probably need 0.8 - 1 MWh batteries.')
