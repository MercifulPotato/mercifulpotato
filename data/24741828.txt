This is law and is unavoidable.<p>Now, whether this pressure drop causes underpressure is another matter and depends on whether the effect is stronger than possitive pressures in the system relative to your point of reference (for example, outside atmospheric pressure).<p>For example, there might be obstruction downstream which means there is already positive pressure in the pipe so the pressure drop from Bernoulli effect is lower than the positive pressure and you still get overpressure  (Bernoulli effect is rather weak at slow speeds as it is proportional to square of the velocity of liquid in the pipe).<p>So, in general, when you have fast flow through a pipe, a hole in the pipe might cause the water to flow out but it could also be sucking air in. It all depends on whether positive pressure is stronger than the effect.')
