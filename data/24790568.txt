The Archimedes machines ran at 8MHz so they ran at the limit of the DRAM bandwidth. There were some early prototypes which could run at 12MHz but that required fast DRAM and careful component selection or the computer would not run reliably - look for “fast A500” at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisacorns.computinghistory.org.uk&#x2F;Computers&#x2F;A500.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisacorns.computinghistory.org.uk&#x2F;Computers&#x2F;A500.ht...</a><p>Other CPUs were not as good as the ARM at using the available DRAM bandwidth.')
