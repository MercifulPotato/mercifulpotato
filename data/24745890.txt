You may want to look up the &quot;Lost Decade&quot; of the S&amp;P 500 from 2000 to 2009.<p>I&#x27;m 50+, my money has been moving around these funds since the late 90s. :) I lived as a tech worker through all the 2000-2010 had to offer us, <i>everyone</i> took a beating not just index funds. Besides that point, holding a fund 5 years is normal - it&#x27;s not like you <i>have</i> to keep a fund longer than 5, make your money and let it go. Roll it over into something else - passive investing does not mean <i>ignoring</i> your investing, you must still tend to your crops from time to time.')
