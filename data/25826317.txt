Item(by='crispyambulance', descendants=None, kids=[25826828], score=None, time=1611002149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825568, text=' &gt; ...nobody cares!\n &gt; Nobody learns.\n &gt; It&#x27;s insane.<p>Estimation is really hard, especially if you&#x27;re dealing with new challenges, new people, and new expectations. Throwing moving targets (unplanned changes) into the mix, as you noticed, makes estimation even more difficult.<p>The thing is, it very rarely is the case that a wrong estimate will sink a project. Things get delivered late all the time. No one dies. Most stakeholders aren&#x27;t like two year olds throwing a tantrum because an unforeseen problem delays a deliverable by a few days (admittedly some are close).<p>The actual definition of failure also needs to be considered. Is it considered a failure because a project manager ended a colored gantt bar at a particular date and the actual time was longer? Or is it a failure because the customer cancelled the contract because a deliverable was not available on the agreed-upon date? Or is it something far more nebulous, like a slow death march towards a misguided goal that burns everyone out and compels them to sip artisanal coffee and daydream about leaving instead of grinding onwards and hitting targets?<p>Ultimately, people &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; because accurate estimates are not the most critical problem on their mind. Most of the time an accurate answer to &quot;When will it [the deliverable] be done?&quot; has about as much gravitas as guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar at a kid&#x27;s birthday party.<p>Doing a retrospective and analyzing what went wrong when a project delivery slipped expectations is certainly reasonable but it so easily slips into a blame storm and&#x2F;or people making commitments that aren&#x27;t realistic. Getting straight answers from folks for this kind of analysis requires a level of psychological safety that just isn&#x27;t present in most workplaces.')
