If I&#x27;m building a message board&#x2F;forum software where I&#x27;m paginating tens of thousands to millions of rows, I&#x27;m probably going to do my sorting in the DB. If I&#x27;m working with a smaller data set like a users music playlist or favorite movies, I may opt to bring that data in unsorted from the DB and do everything else in app code. Even with small result sets, databases often over-allocate memory for sorting (sort buffers are usually pre-allocated) and even though it&#x27;s often tunable, a lot of concurrent sorts on small data sets can waste memory.')
