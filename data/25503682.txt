Item(by='casualbob_uk', descendants=None, kids=[25504126], score=None, time=1608619764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502764, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kin.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kin.org&#x2F;</a> got sued by the SEC for the same reason. They &#x27;got away&#x27; with a 5m fine but were not branded a security (does that automatically declare them a currency?). They&#x27;re now free to carry on development with the SEC behind them. The difference is they just moved to Solana as a token, so they&#x27;re decentralized, whereas what I take from XRP is that it&#x27;s not. I don&#x27;t fancy XRPs chances seeing what the Kin boys and girls went through, but if they &#x27;win&#x27;, whatever that may look like, they&#x27;ll be up and away.')
