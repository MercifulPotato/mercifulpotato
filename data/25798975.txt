Much like a struct can be stored at any memory address - global, heap, stack - a coroutine (&quot;async function&quot;) in zig can be stored at any memory address. Just like `pointer.* = Foo{ .a = 12, .b = 34}`, the pointer decides where the struct memory goes, `pointer.* = async foo();` the pointer decides where the async function&#x27;s stack frame goes.')
