Do you have a large sample set that you are extrapolating your assumptions from?<p>I&#x27;m a person who rents multiple spots next to each other. And yes if the garage is willing to rent out multiple spots to me, I&#x27;ll absolutely park however I like, generally in such a way as to prevent people from boxing me in.<p>Unfortunately parking in Europe is a fairly scarce commodity and a &quot;full sized parking lot&quot; may be barely enough to tetris in a car like this, but you won&#x27;t be able to open the door and get out. Certainly not without hitting the car parked next to you.<p>We can get into the whole theoretical argument of why do people need a Ferrari or why should they be able to get more spots than people who can&#x27;t buy a Ferrari and it just comes down to market economics. In so far as a person can afford 2 spots in a garage, I&#x27;m sure that most garages won&#x27;t discriminate between clients. Nothing stops _you_ from renting out 2 spots and then you can park however you like. If you think that is fundamentally unfair, you should campaign for a policy that garages can only rent out one spot to one client.<p>Maybe this particular Ferrari driver is an asshat and is taking up two spots while paying for only one. Those people exist. But you have zero information that it is the case here and are just jumping to conclusions because (and I&#x27;m jumping to conclusions here) you&#x27;ve been triggered by bad behavior in the past?')
