Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608517928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491366, text='The noun formation that people purport to mock in German is the same that English uses, as in your examples of &quot;textbook&quot;, &quot;motorbike&quot;, &quot;grapefruit&quot;, &quot;airport&quot;, &quot;manslaughter&quot;, and &quot;candlestick&quot;. It&#x27;s unsurprising that German and English grammar would be identical in this respect, since the languages are extremely closely related. It&#x27;s a little more surprising that so many English speakers seem to think the German words are hilarious; I assume they think so only because they were told to and never bothered to think about it.<p>&quot;Television&quot; and &quot;agoraphobia&quot; are different; &quot;downsizing&quot; is less clear than the other examples.')
