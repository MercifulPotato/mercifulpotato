Starting out, you can spend substantial but reasonable amounts for very significant increments in image quality. After a while you hit an inflection point beyond which you&#x27;d be spending effectively unbounded amounts in search of just that little extra bit of sharpness or depth of field or so on. The people with the money and urge to climb that curve are very like &quot;serious audiophiles&quot; in my experience, but there&#x27;s still a range in which you can spend and see a real difference.<p>My 105mm macro and flash kit cost about a grand, and let me take pictures of hunting wasps from six inches away - something I couldn&#x27;t do without them. Likewise, the headphones I use let me hear things I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t. You can get stupid with money for sure in this space, but that doesn&#x27;t make everything in this space stupid.')
