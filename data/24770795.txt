Cross the border from Seattle to Vancouver, suddenly you&#x27;re being paid much less for the same value provided.<p>And basically, it&#x27;s market economics. The wage is determined by supply and demand in the labor market, not on the value provided to the company.<p>This is why it&#x27;s important to have many competing employers rather than just 1 or 2 big ones. Competition for labor increases wages. Hopefully, as more companies accept full remote employees, we&#x27;ll see that- a single huge market not defined by regions.')
