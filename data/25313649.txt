I already know many control codes by heart and can write them inside the printf strings.  For terminfo, I have to include it, link against it, call bizarre functions, and then the library must be available at compile time, at runtime, and also the shared files at runtime.  I have seen each one of these constraints fail for different reasons, and now I simply ignore the existence of terminfo.  It is better to not abuse color, make color optional, but if you need some color you just use the xterm control codes that work everywhere.')
