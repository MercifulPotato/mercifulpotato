Item(by='Leherenn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609350300, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583363, text='I don&#x27;t know, it kinda makes sense to have the reviews for phone (blue) in the phone (red) page. It&#x27;s not like the colour is a major part of the product (in the sense that most reviews won&#x27;t be about the colour, not that it is not important). Same with cable x1 or x2. Though it certainly is an issue if it changes the product in a major way (say, taste of a yogurt).')
