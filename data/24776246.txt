I used to use newsgroups quite a bit in the early 2000s, then moved on to forums, and then of course social media took over (and now I&#x27;m substantially over that).<p>Given that usenet is now past its popular heyday, I thought it would also be past the peak of spam - and it probably is - but having just registered with eternal-september.org, I&#x27;m still pretty surprised by how much spam is in some of these groups. Granted a lot of it is old (because I told Thunderbird to just download <i>all</i> the headers), but there&#x27;s loads of more recent stuff as well: e.g., crap about COVID in all kinds of groups, as if we&#x27;re not hearing and reading enough about it already.<p>This is kind of a shame. If newsgroups had a viable mechanism for combating spam I think they&#x27;d still be a great place to hang out because they were and are a one-stop shop for such a wide range of activities and interests. In addition, and ignoring the spam, the reading and writing experience is still really pleasant.')
