There have been some (minor) gains on disclosure. Somewhat better progress on data selling&#x2F;sharing&#x2F;security. But, no real gains on consent, which is a big part of the regulatory effort and this specific case. Between dark patterns, take-it-or-leave it propositions and predatory defaults... I don&#x27;t think most people have a more censenting relationship with amazon or google than before.<p>Regulators (also prosecutors, often) tend to focus enforceability on easy to prosecute, legible stuff. &quot;Must contain small print&quot; rules. This is how we end up with such meticulous small print norms for advertising pharmaceuticals, financial products and other regulated industries.<p>Fines themselves do not deter profitability monsters like this and the &quot;fix&quot; is going to be an update to the popup, small print, naming of buttons and other things that don&#x27;t really matter much outside of a legalistic perspective.<p>I&#x27;m all for the goals of these efforts. Consent. Privacy. Non-abusive relationships with companies generally. That said, I&#x27;m worried that most of the regulatory enforcement efforts are focused on technicalities without reference to real world achievements.')
