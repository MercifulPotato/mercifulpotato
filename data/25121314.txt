As it turned out, that thesis is fully applicable to President Bolsonaro.<p>During several years he told that his inner circle was conspiring against him. Those statements were skeptically, if not to say mockingly, assessed by the society. They said an insane dictator had made up a conspiracy to remain in power as long as possible.<p>Of course, propaganda mythmaking like that is very typical for lots of authoritarian leaders. History knows many examples of that. That&#x27;s why, there was no reason to take Bolsonaro&#x27;s paranoia seriously until today.<p>However, recently a document has appeared on the web proving Brazilian high officials have been trying to throw down Bolsonaro for a couple of years. Particularly, they organized an assassination attempt against Bolsonaro in Juiz de Fora in 2018. Besides that, they had plans to provide similar operations in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;KuDZetz.jpg<p>It seems like coup plotters&#x27; tactics has been changed.
