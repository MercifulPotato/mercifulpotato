Interestingly landlord wasn&#x27;t charged for renting &quot;inhabitable&quot; premises, so the conclusion is that it was actually habitable and possessed no risk to health of wellbeing of people living there.  _Even_ if it was that inhabitable, and landlord knowing that called police nevertheless, then why it was put on a single mom to improve living condition, not on a landlord to fullfil his duty to maintain premises? Why council housing wasn&#x27;t offered to her when council itself found that her living conditions are not up to standard?<p>- Child was left alone once(!!), peed and pooped itself. There was no evidence of harm caused to her at that moment.<p>- There are 2 more facts,which contributed decision: she was seen  walking drunk on a street barefoot and night noise was reported once.<p>Looking at that, do you honestly think that separating child from her mother is justified? Do you honestly think that forced adoption was the only (as required by law) option left, council did everything they ought to do? How come giving child to sister (another daughter of Laila who was adult by then) or locating grandparents and allowing child to stay there wasn&#x27;t considered first?')
