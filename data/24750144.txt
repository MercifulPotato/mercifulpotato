Item(by='dvdkhlng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602460400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748667, text='&gt; Should the bike lanes be removed, then?<p>Yeah, for Berlin at least it&#x27;s a very difficult question trying to find out how to move forward from the current half-assed state of affairs.<p>There is some sort of new law&#x2F;policy that defines how proper bike infrastructure should look like [1] defining minimum width and stating that bike-lines should not be put onto foot-walks.  However not many actions where performed based on that law which was also drafted in a way that prevents bringing forward proper legal action when not adhered to.<p>Maybe also something needs to be done WRT driving school, where bike-related issues are not really taught as far as I&#x27;m aware of.  Most drivers (and maybe most teachers at driving school) still believe that cyclists do not belong onto the road and do not understand how driver behaviour endangers them.  Minimum car&lt;-&gt;bike overtaking distance (1.5 m) for example is generally ignored by more than half of cars.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Berliner_Mobilit%C3%A4tsgesetz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Berliner_Mobilit%C3%A4tsgesetz</a>')
