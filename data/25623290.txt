Simulated gladiator shows would be a HUGE draw.<p>Right now, the Colosseum isn’t much to look at, just a bunch of rubble. But imagine if they had actors recreate some of the battles they had there. Maybe throw in some holographic lions. Every young boy around the world would be demanding to visit Rome.<p>I would argue the recreated Globe Theater in London is a better tourist attraction than the Colosseum, on account of it being a more immersive experience.')
