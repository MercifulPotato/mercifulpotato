Sure 95% of the time it&#x27;ll look the same to the programmer, and the performance will be worse, but you get inherent stability around infinities, irrationals, NaNs, floating-point comparisons, etc<p>It&#x27;s reasonable to think that ~200 years from now, highschoolers will learn that numbers are all &quot;really&quot; from this structure of surreal numbers, and that most computers and physics processing etc uses them behind the scenes.')
