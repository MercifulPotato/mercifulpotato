Another framing is that it is &quot;guild knowledge&quot;. The incentives in academia are complex and it affects how open some folks are or can afford to be with such knowledge.<p>That said, there are certain open avenues for making such knowledge public. MathOverflow is one. Some academics document their guild knowledge in &quot;technical papers&quot; which they put up on their website. The ML community (which I&#x27;m not part of, but that I&#x27;m able to observe as an outsider) seems to be particularly open when it comes to publishing blog posts -- sometimes to gain reputational points?<p>In some journals, arguments over publications are carried out in the Letters to the Editor section. Sometimes this leads to public feuds however, and some academic communities are small enough that if you make too many enemies your publications may be visited upon with disfavor when it comes time for peer review. It&#x27;s not worth getting into public tiffs unless there&#x27;s a principle at stake.')
