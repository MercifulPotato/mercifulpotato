Thermite has its own oxidizer built-in. So I suspect a pile of iron dust wouldn&#x27;t be that much different from any other combustible dust in terms of fire risk.<p>None of the websites I can find mention iron as an example of a metal fire when talking about the dangers of using water on them. Metals like magnesium and lithium yes.

But from the sounds of it, the simplest solution to that problem is keep your distance, and keep putting water on the fire until it overwhelms the heat capacity of the molten metal.')
