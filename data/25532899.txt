He is also a co-founder of OpenAI, and within YC, he initiated YC Continuity (just to name one of the many initiatives that continue to live on). So if you&#x27;re specifically evaluating him on finding the PMF within his own projects, I think you&#x27;re not giving him enough credit.<p>If we were to evaluate him against his investment record, the score looks even better - he&#x27;s clearly a wealthy guy, and it appears that most of his pre-OpenAI money comes from this area. This is significant, since if he can spot a good startup early on, then supposedly his thoughts on early stage startups are likely valuable.<p>You might go ahead and trivialize those data points, but the reality is that&#x27;s a 100x better resume than the majority of people whose blog posts form a basis for daily discussions here on HN. Why hate on Sam specifically?')
