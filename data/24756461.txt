It uses federated identity (OpenID for instance) and device credentials (see: wireguard crypto-routing) to let you in on any mesh network that you have access to be [on]. It is not something novel but super complicated to do it as simply as possible. And wireguard is a key enabler for just that.</i><p><i>BeyondCorp is obviously much more than just SSO.
