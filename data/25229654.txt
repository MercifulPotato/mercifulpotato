I can&#x27;t imagine that the total number of deaths in NYC this year could <i>possibly</i> be the same as in 2019.<p>But I&#x27;m not an expert.<p>Ed: glancing over the CDC statistics, when COVID-attributed deaths go up, all-cause mortality goes up, too... by approximately the same amount. If a large proportion of those COVID deaths were mislabeled heart disease deaths, why is that? I made these graphs with the same CDC data:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;YejafCE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;YejafCE</a><p>And of course, there&#x27;s the CDC&#x27;s own dashboard on excess deaths, which lets you slice this more finely.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm</a>')
