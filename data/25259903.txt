It&#x27;s completely irrelevant as the system works and never gives me any trouble. Why temp fate by letting Microsoft near it?<p>The point is that ongoing updates and upgrading Windows is a much worse option since Microsoft began stealing user information.<p>As I mentioned, my bugs are friendly ones in that they&#x27;ve not caused me any significant problem since 2012!<p>As for security, I couldn&#x27;t give a damn about security updates, everything is backed up and there&#x27;s no user data of any significane on the machine worthy of stealing. (One way to ensure private information can&#x27;t be stolen is not to put machines containing it onto the net. I observe this rule and have always done so.)<p>The fact is that by not using JavaScript, I likely have better protection anyway.<p><i>Addendum, another way of looking at the problem is that I no longer have a relationship with Microsoft. I paid them good money for multiple copies of Windows in 2012 and as far as I&#x27;m concerned that&#x27;s the end of it. Finito.<p>This ongoing umbilical tethering of software after it&#x27;s  purchased is something I&#x27;m strongly against, especially so with software from Big Tech, they&#x27;re forever adding stuff in patches that benefits them well ahead of the user.  I want no part of that \ntype of operation.</i>')
