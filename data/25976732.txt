I was a Honda loyalist and my first 4 cars were all Hondas and the reliability steadily decreased over the years.  My first car, an 88, only ever needed regular maintenance and an alternator at 250k miles.  My last Honda, an 07, was costing $2500 a year in maintenance when I got rid of it with 127k miles in 2015.<p>The three most reliable automobile manufacturers according to Consumer Reports Reliability Indexes, by a large margin, are Toyota, Honda, and Subaru.')
