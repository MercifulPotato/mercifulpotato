I never had a &quot;what would I use this for?&quot; moment. Kotlin comes close, but is less elegant and especially lacks full pattern matching.<p>Unfortunately, sml is used approximately nowhere. Not sure why, but I also haven&#x27;t used ocaml yet. Maybe one day. My hosting provider (hcoop.net)&#x27;s domtool is written in SML, and I hope to hack on it at some point.')
