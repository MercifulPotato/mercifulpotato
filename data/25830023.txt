The wife and I have been talking about fostering or running an orphanage. Hmmm. I&#x27;ve never really considered how much it would benefit the foster children to experience a healthy home.<p>I was told by my Aunt that fostering kids that they weren&#x27;t supposed to &#x27;get attached&#x27; but I never realized this as apart of the process b&#x2F;c she always broke the rule, lol.<p>Caring and attachment is extremely important. IMHO, this training (to not grow attached) is the source of the problem. There is numerous research studies about the importance of healthy attachment to nurture the development of a human into the next stage of their life.')
