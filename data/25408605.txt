But there also seems to be a more active sort of intense denialism, fueled by a need to score political points at all costs, that leads even people who _have_ been directly impacted by COVID to continue insisting it&#x27;s not a big deal.<p>It&#x27;s why Herman Cain&#x27;s staff kept tweeting even after he died from COVID. And why people in the White House have been making a big show of hosting superspreader events, even as so many of them have to rely on the best medicine other people&#x27;s money can buy to recover. Ultimately, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to understand it rationally, because as you say, it&#x27;s not rational; it&#x27;s an emotional response.')
