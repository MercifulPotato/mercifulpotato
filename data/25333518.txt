I cook a lot, and I moved from a kitchen with a modern electric range, to a gas one... and it was a definite <i>downgrade</i>.<p>Quite simply, modern electric ranges will heat your pan <i>faster</i> than gas ones can. It&#x27;s seriously crazy. And of course they heat more evenly, instead of in a single &quot;ring&quot; in the middle or outside of your pan.<p>I&#x27;m not even talking about expensive inductive ranges. I&#x27;m talking about electric resistance ones -- but modern ones that are a single smooth surface of glass&#x2F;ceramic.<p>The only change you have to get used to is that if you need to <i>instantly</i> reduce the heat, you need to move the pan off the burner rather than just turn it off. But that&#x27;s just a change in habit.<p>Also modern glass-top ranges are infinitely easier to clean. Just a single smooth surface.')
