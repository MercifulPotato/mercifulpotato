They use this data to determine what products (specifically, what SKUs) to re-order from their suppliers.<p><i>Only till the time when their store brand starts selling much better and consumers develop a relationship with that.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know why techies keep pushing this like it means something. The store brand product <i>IS MADE BY THE NAME BRAND SUPPLIER.</i><p>I repeat, the store brand is just a different SKU offered under the name brand&#x27;s white label product line. For example, Home Depot&#x27;s RIGID tool like is made by the same company that makes Milwaukee and Ryobi. Those store brand cereals are made by General Mills. The store brand milk comes from the same regional dairies as the local regional name brand. Every single one of Costco&#x27;s Kirkland signature products is made for them by a supplier that makes their own name brand products.<p><i>Isn&#x27;t this very similar to the third party sellers having their own Shopify store and someone discovering it through Google Search&#x2F;FB Shop instead of Amazon Search. The only argument that makes sense here is the usage of data. </i><p>No, because Shopify doesn&#x27;t compete against its own sellers. The antitrust concern arises solely because Amazon is both the platform <i>and</i> a competitor and it uses its access as the platform provider to acquire data to compete.')
