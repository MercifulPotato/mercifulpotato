They tried to justify it that most installs didn&#x27;t need that stuff so by splitting them off you could pay less for just that parts you need. But that kind of doesn&#x27;t wash when the most basic subset was already ridiculous.<p>But I liked it in most other ways. It was limited and annoying by todays standards, and definitely osr5 failed to advance and became terrible to use in comparison with everything else after a while, while still somehow demanding a big price tag.<p>But earlier, it was as good or better than anything else at that same time. People did a lot with it. I did a lot with it.<p>One thing that was wonderful from a small custom back end  software seller point of view, practically zero support overhead. You install the box and your software, and forget about it. The customer calls when they want something new or when some hardware breaks. Proper administration was what they would call neglect today. One guy could have 150 customers out there and spend 1% of his time supporting past installs.<p>And 10 years after doing your first install, your latest install used practically identical steps and knowledge. All those 150 systems that were installed spread over a 10 or 15 year period, they all worked the same way. They were all practically identical to each other even though version numbers and hardware drivers changed.<p>That is a level of efficiency and low overhead that we&#x27;ll never see again.<p>Today you might be able to magic up 150 servers in a few seconds and a few lines of cloud orchestration config code, but tomorrow everything you learned to do that today will be different, and you better stay actively on top of monitoring them, none of this fire &amp; forget like ye olden dayes.')
