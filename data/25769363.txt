Item(by='hbosch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610579780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25768310, text='&gt; and it&#x27;s an increasingly difficult case to make for a home user, as all of the alternatives are pretty good.<p>I think this is the first thing that came to mind when I saw this article.<p>I very recently signed up for Apple One, for Music&#x2F;TV&#x2F;iCloud (family photos in particular)&#x2F;all the rest and the fact that I now use iCloud sync instead of Dropbox bothers me nil. Prime also comes with Photos, unlimited photo backup. Used to use that just fine. Google Photos is like $1&#x2F;mo.<p>Honestly, if Disney bundled a cloud storage service into Disney+ I&#x27;d probably give it a shot. File syncing is a commoditized feature these days for the average Joe.')
