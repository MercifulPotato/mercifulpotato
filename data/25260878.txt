It was vicious AF but they were all so romantic and corny as it came to the german nation and its heroes. All those calls for patriotism, and nationalism, where if anything emotional. Why do you think the culture minister was such a powerful figure? The nazi were the most disgusting sentimentalists ever.<p>I get why your assumption they disregarded sentiments exists; we are living in very similar times where undue public importance is given to sentiments. And we would like to think they were completely different to us, but the reality is we live in similarly sentimental times.<p>Edit: looked up on the author of that review, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herbert_Ihering" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herbert_Ihering</a>,\napparently liberal-left leaning and not a darling of the Nazis.<p>PS. if you want a trip into weirdness, watch the uncut version of Metropolis.
