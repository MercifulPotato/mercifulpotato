The 538 piece points to a ~10% swing away from the (in the case of black voters) <i>82%</i> that favored Hillary.  This is <i>very</i> different from a swing all the way to a 10% preference for Trump.  A bigger turnout by (these) minority voters, assuming they cast votes even vaguely in line with this polling, is more votes in Biden&#x27;s column than Trump&#x27;s.  That&#x27;s bad news for Trump.')
