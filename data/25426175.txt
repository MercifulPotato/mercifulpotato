Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607997799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425683, text='&gt; Invariably this will come out of tax dollars to which I’m contributing by way of income tax.<p>This is no different than paying taxes for any number of other social programs, however its a singularly bad place to draw the line.<p>&gt; Why should I be charged for wrongs - however horrible - in which neither myself nor my ancestors were involved?<p>Because you aren&#x27;t being charged. The government that legalized and regulated slavery is being charged. This government is (one of) the legal institutions that permitted slavery and benefitted from slavery that still exists. Therefore they are responsible for satisfying legal claims that are still pending.<p>&gt; When there was still slavery in America, my people were enslaving members of their own ethnic group back in the old country. Forgive me for not wanting any part of this current dispute.<p>If you don&#x27;t want any part of it then you are free to remain neutral in discussions of this issue. By arguing against reparations you are participating in the dispute.<p>&gt; And to those who will certainly tell me that I’ve benefitted from the modern spoils of slavery: I beg to differ. My first decade in the US was all about climbing out of the pit of “you’re not white enough for us because you didn’t go to a top school”.<p>That doesn&#x27;t challenge the assertion that you benefitted from the accumulated capital that was in part built on the forced labor of slaves.<p>&gt; That shit still haunts me to this day.<p>I&#x27;m truly sorry for your traumatic experience.<p>p.s. I&#x27;ve upvoted this comment because while I disagree with the substance, it raises important arguments that need to be responded to and the comment itself contributes to the discussion. I&#x27;d like to ask down voters to consider why they feel this comment needs to be suppressed because I disagree with their opinion on the value of the comment and its contribution to the discussion.')
