This is the NFL scouting combine:<p>40-yard dash, Bench press (225 lb repetitions), Vertical jump, Broad jump, 20-yard shuttle, 3 cone drill, 60-yard shuttle, Position-specific drills, Interviews â€“ each team is allowed 60 interviews in 15-minute intervals, Physical measurements, Injury evaluation, Drug screen, The Cybex test, The Wonderlic test<p>I would consider this set of proxy tests to be roughly analogous to the FAANG interview loop for screening world-class engineers. They&#x27;re representative tests with predictive validity for the separate, more meaningful task of Game Day athletic performance -- since you obviously can&#x27;t hold a real Super Bowl as a scouting combine.')
