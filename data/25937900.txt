Item(by='darren_', descendants=None, kids=[25938766], score=None, time=1611805648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937018, text='&gt; Does anyone actually prefer the experience of an integrated Smart TV compared to a separate device? If these users exist, they probably wouldn&#x27;t be found around these parts.<p>Sure, I&#x27;ve got a Sony TV with built-in netflix&#x2F;amazon prime&#x2F;chromecast receiver in it. Works great. There&#x27;s no tv-inserted ads while watching TV or streaming services or anything like that. There&#x27;s a couple of rows of icons on the homescreen below the app icons that are &#x27;recommended content&#x27; which i guess some people consider to be ads (they&#x27;re not, as far as i can tell) but i pretty much never use the homescreen anyway.<p>I do always see a lot of negative sentiment around these TVs on this site but really, I&#x27;m not bothered by mine at all and in fact quite like not having another device to wrangle.')
