Item(by='girzel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610303696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717050, text='&gt; I use a metal spatula to scrape anything off (after boiling some water in it to loosen it up), or a lodge plastic scraper, and scrub it lightly with a sponge and a bit of dish soap. Don’t put it away wet. It’s simple.<p>This is pretty much what I do, except I use a nylon brush instead of the scraper – same deal. I think the boiling water and brush are perfect because they leave just the right amount of oil still on the pan.')
