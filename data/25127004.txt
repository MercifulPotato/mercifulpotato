Item(by='Gehinnn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605635729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25123356, text='It is very hard to detect self-referential statements and restricting yourself to &quot;non-self-referential statements&quot; might be quite severe.<p>Given a set of &quot;domino&quot; tiles - each having a top and a bottom. Each top and bottom has some word on it - these words can only use the letters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.\nYou can duplicate domino tiles and also align tiles so that all tops and all bottoms are aligned.<p>Now, given a finite set of such tiles, can you say whether there is an alignment so that all tops concatenated, read from right to left, equal all bottoms concatenated?<p>In fact, given such a set of tiles S, you can easily create a formula P(S) that is true iff such a valid alignment does not exist. Obviously this formula is true for some sets of tiles and false for others.<p>Now the funny thing: Given a (correct) fixed theory T in which you can state P(S) for every S and in which proofs can be computationally checked, there must be infinitely many S so that P(S) is true, but cannot be proved in T. Thus such theory T is incomplete.<p>Where is the self-reference?<p>This problem is also known as the Post correspondence problem (PCP). The halting problem can be reduced to it, which is not decidable. If T was complete, you could enumerating all proofs and see whether they correctly proof P(S) or its negation. Due to its completeness you would eventually find a proof for either of them and thus you could decide the halting problem.')
