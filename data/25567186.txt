Houses can be had this cheap all over the country.<p>To use my hometown as an example, consider this 1948 house that Redfin believes is worth $30K: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redfin.com&#x2F;AR&#x2F;North-Little-Rock&#x2F;707-Gardenia-Ave-72117&#x2F;home&#x2F;82955744" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redfin.com&#x2F;AR&#x2F;North-Little-Rock&#x2F;707-Gardenia-Ave...</a><p>It&#x27;s 3 miles from the downtown of a half-million person metro area. If you&#x27;re willing to go up into that $50-100K range, you will find plenty of fine houses in mid-sized cities throughout the Midwest&#x2F;South.<p>The apartment I rented was an 1100 square foot, 2 bedroom townhouse a block from the bus stop -- $350&#x2F;month.')
