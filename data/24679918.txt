I am wondering what an individual could take offense to. As far as I can tell I made two assertions:<p>1. Girls who are interested in STEM tend to abandon it at the high school &#x2F; undergraduate level [factual]<p>2. That one factor in that may be a gender bias favoring males during this period in a students education. [well supported by academic research, though I presented the information casually and without citation]<p>If we can believe the research that there is a gender bias against males at the middle school level surely the opposite may also be true at the high school &#x2F; college level where there are more male teachers.')
