Yes yes, we input from more sources than books, but electronic NNs can too. And it&#x27;s not clear which inputs are or aren&#x27;t important. Humans that are blind from birth are still intelligent.<p>The only thing we know for certain right now is that order-of-magnitude increases in the complexity of NNs produces dramatic results.
