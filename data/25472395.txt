Artemis is a program for which the SLS and other vehicles are under development. SpaceX and other commercial launch providers are also being engaged by the Artemis program to develop vehicles.<p>While Starship (and maybe New Glenn) does look more attractive than SLS now, a effort as large as Artemis is more concerned with capability than immediately driving the cost down. SLS is a capable vehicle moved forward by proven methods by experienced vendors. The lower risk drives higher and more predictable up front costs.<p>Check out Everyday Astronaut for some interesting perspective on what is going on with SLS and Starship:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everydayastronaut.com&#x2F;sls-vs-starship&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;everydayastronaut.com&#x2F;sls-vs-starship&#x2F;</a>')
