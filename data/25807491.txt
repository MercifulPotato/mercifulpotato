I probably wouldn’t have noticed that there was more than one page if it wasn’t for your comment as I was only skimming over page 1.<p>All others coming to the HN comments make sure you catch the demo video on page 4.<p>Direct link to video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jtmNOZVrz98" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jtmNOZVrz98</a><p>Also to the author of the page, if you see this: I would recommend putting the video embed at the top of page 1 so that it is the first thing that visitors see. Nothing beats a good video for me, and the video you made is very good. So best to put it first IMO and then people can read about the details afterwards.')
