Item(by='geocar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608449024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483914, text='&gt; Over a decade ago I was trying to get the C++ committee to support multidimensional arrays via overloading, so we could have 2D collections.<p>You might&#x27;ve asked operator[] to take multiple arguments separated by semicolon, so:<p><pre><code>    foo[a;b]\n</code></pre>\nwhich is at least unambiguous. Maybe it would have been less offensive.<p>&gt; So I asked the question, could anyone find an example of the comma operator used in C or C++ inside square brackets in any production code.<p>If you&#x27;re still referring to operator overloading, there&#x27;s things like Boost.Assign and Boost.Phoenix, but if you&#x27;re referring to use as a sequence operator, i.e. where a[b,c] could potentially be b,a[c] except for the different sequence point, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me you had a hard time finding an example: I&#x27;ve only ever seen people like Arthur do that (people writing APL in C)')
