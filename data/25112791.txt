Explain<p>Not GP, but it seems to me that given the large consumer spending portion of GDP (~70% in the US) in developed countries, anything that will limit folks going out and spending money, like:<p>1.  Retail sales;<p>2.  Air&#x2F;rail&#x2F;bus travel;<p>3.  Going to bars&#x2F;restaurants;<p>4.  Hospitality (hotels&#x2F;cruises);<p>5.  Theater&#x2F;concerts;<p>6.  Public transportation.<p>Is likely to have significant negative effect on the economy as a whole <i>until</i> the majority of the population is convinced that they won&#x27;t become sick and&#x2F;or put their vulnerable loved ones at risk.<p>As such, it seems to me that we won&#x27;t be able to resuscitate the economy fully until we have some semblance of herd immunity.<p>Whether that herd immunity comes from a vaccine or millions of deaths and tens of millions of long-term effects, or from a broadly deployed vaccine will also have significant economic impact.<p>tl;dr: if many&#x2F;most won&#x27;t go to the mall, the pub or Mallorca, the economy will continue to flounder.  We won&#x27;t get past that until people feel safe around others.')
