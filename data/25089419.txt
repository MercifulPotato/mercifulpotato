In this situation, from a technical perspective, which are the similarities and differences here?<p>Yes they do. the differences are that they are still dependent on goods that their own firm doesn&#x27;t produce, so the prices of those goods discipline their budget&#x2F;plans to some degree, the firm is unable to use violence to compel the behavior they need to survive, and that as they call victim to the same central planning problems as governments, their marginal profit decreases so that the owner sees less profit and the price of a share of ownership decreases because of that.')
