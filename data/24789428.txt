Through every job I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;ve met some of my very best life-long friends. My wedding party is over half people that I met at work. A couple of my former bosses are people I see every couple of months (pre-covid) and are invited to my wedding. Even one of my past clients is someone that I keep in touch with regularly (for nothing related to work).<p>Not <i>everyone</i> at work is going to become your best friend, but if you&#x27;re automatically assuming that anyone you meet through your job is completely &quot;off limits&quot; for friendship, you&#x27;re really hurting yourself. I can&#x27;t imagine working at a place like that.')
