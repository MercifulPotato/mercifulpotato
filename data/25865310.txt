Tesla wanted to use stiff stainless steel for their &quot;tough&quot; vehicle. The use of stainless steel for the SpaceX BFR (aka Starship) may have also been a factor.<p>Problem is that the usual techniques for making nice curved shapes don&#x27;t work on such a material, so they used folded metal sheet instead, resulting in that &quot;low poly&quot; look.<p>Considering that the DeLorean is also made of stainless steel and also has a rather angular shape, you are bound to make the comparison. The necessarily noticed it at Tesla and I am not sure what they intend to do with that. The DeLorean is iconic and (back to the) futuristic, it also had the reputation of a terrible car and was a commercial failure.')
