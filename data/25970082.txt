It&#x27;s connected to batteries, and gives you a 230&#x2F;120V network. Then, you had a normal solar inverter. It&#x27;ll recharge the batteries when the inverter gives power, and power your equipment when it does not.<p>Big plus is that if someday the grid arrives at your home, you can simply take it away and you won&#x27;t have to touch your solar panels.')
