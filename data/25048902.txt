Devoid of humor and personality in favor of some kind of robotic logic-only approach. I get some people want it to be purely academic but it&#x27;s a public forum and is inherently non-academic. And that doesn&#x27;t even mention the &quot;impartial&quot; moderation. It&#x27;s no wonder HN commenters get made fun of mercilessly outside of HN.')
