You have to assign copyright to the FSF in order to contribute anything.<p>This is one reason for its demise.  I&#x27;ve done the copyright assignment for both Autoconf and Automake.  It&#x27;s one reason why there are external macro archives (e.g. Autoconf Archive), when much of this functionality could be in the core projects.<p>Example: Why, in 2021, should you have to rely on external support to do something as trivial as enabling multithreading [ACX_PTHREAD].  It&#x27;s not even portable to non-pthreads platforms.  So much for portability.  Contrast with CMake [find_package(Threads); use Threads::Threads].<p>Compared with CMake, which doesn&#x27;t require copyright assignment, and anyone can contribute to.  It has hundreds of contributors, tons of built-in functionality, and more third-party extensions than Autotools could ever dream of.  Copyright assignment is a big part of that, but also so is upstream attitude to third-party contributions.  Kitware do this very well.  The Autotools maintainers not so much; partly down to their own historical bad choices which prevented change to the internals due to the potential for breaking compatibility.')
