In the summer I usually do OK with 6-7 hours, in the winter I need 8-10. And it makes sense! In winter the days are short and food is scarce, so the best strategy is to save energy and wait for summer.<p>My mood follows a similar seasonal cycle.<p>On another note, I highly recommend the r&#x2F;n24 (named after non-24 hour circadian rhythm) subreddit and their Discord for support and discussion on all kinds of sleep disorders. It was very validating for me to find people with the same struggles.')
