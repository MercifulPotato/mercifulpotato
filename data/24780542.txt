This is the Z80 book published by Howard Sams. I believe that the book was also re-sold by Radio Shack. It was my first introduction to microprocessor hardware, sometime around 1981 or 1982. I remember it for being extremely clearly written, making it a good introduction to concepts that tended to be applicable to all of the mainstream processors at the time.<p>If someone were to ask me how to learn about hardware today, I&#x27;d start them with one of the early 8-bit machines, where the concepts are straightforward. I think that many of the features of modern machines can be understood as an evolution of overcoming the shortcomings of the early machines.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pestingers.net&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;other-computers&#x2F;the-z80-microcomputer-handbook-william-barden.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pestingers.net&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;other-computers&#x2F;the-z80-micro...</a>')
