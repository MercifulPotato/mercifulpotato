Moreover, the language is still working to get its parallelism story out the door and Windows support is either lacking or non-existent (I forget which). The documentation is also rather poor, to the extent that I would often try to infer the OCaml solution from F# documentation. Moreover, when I’ve asked (polite, good faith) questions about how to do something in any online OCaml community, I was met with defensiveness and hostility (apparently if you have problems that Jane Street doesn’t have, you’re building software wrong). Lastly I just can’t get my head around the syntax and style guidelines; I also tried Reason, but it introduced other problems (typically related to build tooling and integration with the rest of the ocaml ecosystem) which may or may not have been worked out in the intervening years.<p>OCaml has a lot of features that other languages lack, but they aren’t enough to make up for the table stakes features that it lacks.')
