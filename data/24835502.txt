I started playing and liked the game but I did not want to spend my time playing the game, so I wanted to write some code to play on my behalf and I would get human satisfaction from my code playing the game by proxy.<p>I started looking into the requests&#x2F;responses, and I found something cool in the HTTP response headers that was something along the lines of &quot;If you are reading this, please consider applying to work at our company&quot;.<p>One other instance of this is a company here that posted an opening for software developers. The page was blank, so naturally I opened the console to see what&#x27;s wrong. There were comments in the page that said &quot;Congratulations, you passed the first step. To get the link of the page, please decode this message in Morse and send us the code you used to do that&quot;. I didn&#x27;t write any code because I was familiar with Morse code, so I got the link directly.<p>I was contacted by their CTO shortly after. I had already been hired in the meantime (by another CTO at another company and they knew each other apparently). I told him I found it pretty cool and interesting. He said that very few people found the link and applied.<p>These things can be fun.')
