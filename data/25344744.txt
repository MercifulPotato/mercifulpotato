We&#x27;re preparing to roll it out to billions. That&#x27;s not &quot;significant testing&quot;. If there was a 1 in 500,000 side effect, you&#x27;d never see it in the trials.<p>That is significant testing. It is correct that you might not see a 1 in 500,000 side-effect in testing, but a 1 in 500,000 adverse effect is probably a risk factor that most people could accept.<p>&gt; And yes, these vaccines are doing something &quot;magical&quot;. We&#x27;ve never had an mRNA vaccine rolled out to the general public before.<p>Our cells regularly process strands of mRNA by the billion. I don&#x27;t believe the vaccine is doing anything particularly &quot;magical&quot;. It&#x27;s completely right that we should test that, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason to be more concerned than any other new type of treatment.')
