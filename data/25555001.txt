Their &quot;normal&quot; prices are about the same as any other non-discount grocer like Safeway, but they&#x27;re very aggressive with large discounts for store &quot;members&quot; who use their tracking card.<p>For example, when I shop, I&#x27;m not that particular to specific brands, so if I&#x27;m buying soup or cereal, I will always choose the one that is on sale that week, usually around half price (e.g B1G1). I end up paying about 60% of what a normal customer pays who is loyal to specific brands no matter if they&#x27;re on sale or not.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the normal prices haven&#x27;t really gone up all that much, but the discounts are very small and there are far fewer of the really good ones (e.g. $3 per lb. of chicken, the $0.99 carton of eggs, half price cheese, B1G1 soups, etc).<p>Thus, I&#x27;d say my grocery bill has gone up about 50% or more in just the last year, whereas it had really held stead for the last decade.<p>This is, of course, on top of home prices in my area nearly doubling in 10 years when considering increased taxes, HOAs, repair costs, etc.')
