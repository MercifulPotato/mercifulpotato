We got into the habit of saying &#x27;Hello &lt;cat-name&gt;&#x27; every time a cat walked into the room.<p>Now the cats say &#x27;eh-owww&#x27; whenever they see us, and also say the same phrase in different ways depending on what they want&#x2F;need. It took us a while to work out the meanings of the intonations, but now we are pretty good at working out if it&#x27;s a greeting, request, or just acknowledgement.<p>I&#x27;m not sure who trained who, but it seems to work. :D')
