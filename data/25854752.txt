It is the locus of control.<p>Under Catholicism, the church enjoyed a monopoly over interpreting and proclaiming the word of God.  The Catholic Church secured this monopoly by encoding the bible in Latin, and requiring priests to know Latin before they could participate in religious dissemination, the source of which was the Vatican.<p>Protestantism, enabled by the printing press, changed the locus of control to parishes, and ultimately, to individuals.<p>Rome no longer held a broadcast monopoly on the word of God.  Suddenly, the bible was in English.  And German.  And French.  And Dutch.  And Belgian.  And American.  It was possible for congregations to roll their own sermons, without instruction from the central authority.  It was even possible for an individual preacher to break the shackles of the institution by speaking his own interpretation of the bible to his congregation.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; Americans still have a profound faith that our individual destinies are in our own hands. That’s why many people who have only the remotest prospect of ever making their way into the top income-tax bracket nonetheless favor keeping that tax rate low, and why people who have no chance of inheriting money from a taxable estate passionately oppose “death taxes.”')
