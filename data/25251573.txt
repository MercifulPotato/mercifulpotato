Item(by='gugagore', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606722548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250742, text='This is not very clear to me. Can you be more precise?<p>If we&#x27;re talking about the Lie algebra of space rotations, then the elements of that are infinitesimal rotations. Those elements form a vector space, and there&#x27;s also the Lie bracket, which is the cross product as you say.<p>I don&#x27;t see the sense in saying &quot;rotate b about a&quot; when both a and b are to represent infinitesimal rotations. If we&#x27;re taking b to be a position in space, and a to be an infinitesimal rotation, then your explanation makes sense (though in a backwards way from how I think of it. a x b is the vector you rotate a about in order to get the derivative of the tip to be b). How do you reconcile that with the Lie Algebra?<p>More importantly, what if your vectors don&#x27;t model rotations to begin with? Then you still are left with giving a meaning to the cross product. How can you clarify anything by taking your vectors to be infinitesimal rotations, whose cross product gives a third infinitesimal rotation, which carries information about the non-commutativity of the [non-infinitesimal] rotations?<p>It is one thing that the cross product does, but I don&#x27;t see how it explains, for example, what the cross product has to do with calculating volumes of parallelepipeds, or torques.')
