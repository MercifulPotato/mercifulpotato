Do you envision going to 2+ control processes that soon?<p>Any consideration given to running the KV store inside the control processes themselves (either by embedding something like an etcd or by integrating a raft library and a KV store to reinvent that wheel) since you are replicating the entire DB into the client anyway?<p>Meanwhile I&#x27;m working with application-sharded PG clusters with in-client caches with coherence maintained through Redis pubsub, so who am I to question the complexity of this setup haha.')
