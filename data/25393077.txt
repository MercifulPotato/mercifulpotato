Most time for software engineering ought to spent ensuring you&#x27;re building the right thing which requires a lot of collaboration, writing design docs, thinking about the problem, etc to avoid &#x27;building the wrong thing&#x27; which is probably the &#x27;default&#x27; behavior and hard to avoid.  Software engineering is only really valuable if you can easily extend and build it on it to enable whatever product or service you&#x27;re selling to change as the business changes.  If you&#x27;re churning out throw-away code you never reuse you don&#x27;t realize any of that value and you will lose.<p>I did have the idea of directly tying value to a graph of code that enabled a certain user journey. Sorta like &#x27;CUJ-coverage&#x27; instead of test coverage. So if a user spent $20 at checkout, every line of code that was touched to enable that user&#x27;s journey would be credited with that $20.  I think this would be an interesting metric I&#x27;d probably respect but there are still probably a lot of blindspots this methodology doesn&#x27;t capture.')
