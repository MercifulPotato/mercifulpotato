Within the last ~4yr I did a $1500&#x2F;mo single bedroom in Boston and a $1300 single bedroom in Waltham (which is a nice but not &quot;surgeons and lawyers buy houses here suburb of Boston).  Yes there were mice but I think that is a pretty reasonable trade for the price.<p>Things start getting stupid expensive when you try to live how you think a white collar professional should live.')
