Perhaps some lay-people (of which I am definitely one!) believe it, but as you point out it is so obviously implausible it falls down on first inspection.<p>There are other models (lots of them!) and they don&#x27;t rely on this pure randomness.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-01-chemical-evolution-dna-rna-early.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-01-chemical-evolution-dna-rna-ear...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;journal&#x2F;life&#x2F;special_issues&#x2F;evolution-RNA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;journal&#x2F;life&#x2F;special_issues&#x2F;evolution-R...</a>')
