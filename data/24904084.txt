Facebook censors delete cp, suicide videos, torture etc. You can’t have a “censorship free” platform.  There must be rules, but should those rules be decided by tech guys or politicians?<p>I suggest quitting social media. Because truth is buried in a sea of lies.<p>Social media promotes what is popular (shocking) not what is truth.<p>Millions of bots spread shocking fake news like Qanon, covid conspiracies.<p>This is damaging your country.  \nSeveral terrorist attacks happened in your country, inspired by propaganda on social media.<p>The amendment was written for humans. Sure free speech, but should free speech apply to millions of robots spreading fake news?<p>It’s not like tech companies don’t know bots are spreading propaganda, they just ignore it because it’s “not a priority”.<p>While platform rapidly censor nudity, they seem to ignore anti American botnet propaganda. Stories like “covid created by NATO”, “bill gates made nano bots vaccine” etc.<p>Should social media be a platform for hatred? Lies? Terrorists?<p>Today it is.<p>The AI terrorism of social media will only get worse. And your tech companies seem to ignore it.')
