That they will jump through all those hoops because it is “the right way” so of course they will do it. Well, news flash. A lot of people don’t and if you have a security breach, its cold comfort that it was because someone took a shortcut on step 438 of your pointlessly difficult process.<p>Imagine if airline safety operated that way. “Well, it is up to the pilot to make sure they pay attention and keep up with their training. They will do it because it is the right way.” No, they look at how can they make it impossible to do the wrong thing. How can they make this alarm impossible to ignore? In this very specific scenario, is it possible for this problem to go unnoticed or undetected? How can we train pilots and ensure they understand in a real world situation? Etc. Which is the right model, in my opinion. It isn’t “on paper, does this technically solve the problem” it is “regardless of user error or equipment failure, will this still solve the problem”.')
