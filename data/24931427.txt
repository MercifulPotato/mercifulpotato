Not saying you&#x27;re wrong, but you&#x27;ve worked with people, right? Hopefully not been a complete ass :) ? Done work on a team with or adjacent to them?<p>That&#x27;s a start!<p>Networks aren&#x27;t created overnight, and people try to hack them poorly all the time.<p>Think about it like a garden, not a project. It can&#x27;t be created overnight: the right way is repeatedly, but at a low-intensity, tending to it.<p>Set yourself a goal: reach out to one person you&#x27;ve previously worked with on LinkedIn a week. Don&#x27;t ask for a job. Just say you were thinking of them, {insert memory, if you have one}, and hope they&#x27;re doing well. If they reply, maybe steer the convo to what technologies or challenges they&#x27;re working on now...<p>I get it. I&#x27;m an introvert too. I&#x27;m €®£÷ing <i>terrible</i> with people. But it&#x27;s improveable with repeated effort, like anything else.<p>A few ideas (in preferred order): (1) Take coffee (or now, Zoom?) with folks to catch up, (2) Volunteer with tech groups (pref charities, in tech, with people you want to network with, not just you giving free labor, and make sure to introduce yourself and talk about what you do), (3) Attend tech meetups (eh... unless you&#x27;re presenting, this can be a waste of time), (4) Attend conferences (again, be seen, introduce yourself. Many are remote and free this year, good for attending, bad for networking)<p>The end goal is that if that person thinks &quot;I need someone to X&quot; then your name pops into their head. If you haven&#x27;t talked to them in 5 years, that&#x27;s not going to happen.')
