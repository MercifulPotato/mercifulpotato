This is just an application of the physics of high frequency \nelectromagnetic signals.<p>I haven&#x27;t personally done work with SAR, but I imagine it&#x27;s much the same as dealing with EMI&#x2F;EMC in PCB development: extend Maxwell&#x27;s equations from a simple case to the general principle, simulate, test, and tune. I&#x27;d have to go back to my textbook and review to figure out the exact mechanisms and the limiting factors for resolution and power, I think I have Johnson&#x27;s &quot;High Speed Digital Design: A Handbook of Black Magic&quot; on a shelf around here somewhere...')
