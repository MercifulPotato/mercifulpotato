We obviously had setups that mirrored production long before docker and CI&#x2F;CD became a thing, but spending time configuring those things, for every project is just insane.<p>Even pythons virtual environments take less time to use than .NET.<p>Sure I actually liked the &quot;double click&quot; thing in Visual Studio, but that had nothing to do with &quot;if it works on my computer&quot;, it simply saved bundles of time because we&#x27;d publish every project to the same damn IIS instance and not have them all run their independant web-servers with their independant setups.<p>Hell we still put things behind the same damn IIS instance and it&#x27;s load balancer and all that, because why wouldn&#x27;t we? We&#x27;re not Netflix, we don&#x27;t need to scale to two billion people. Our max load is 50.000 concurrent users, yet our build load and our deployment pipeline is now so best-practice, SOLIDVOLID, Buzzworded, CONSOLELIEK and complicated might actually work for Netflix with enough iron.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that, it&#x27;s now your job. Not the operations dude who actually specialize in this, no yours, along with keeping up with you know, actual programming.<p>Being the public sector, we benchmark everything, and the things we don&#x27;t benchmark we hire E&amp;Y to benchmark, and you know what our most expensive resource has seen the biggest increase of their time going into over the past 30 years? Configuring and maintaining their tooling. Not developing new things that are useful for our actual business, no sir, but working with the tools that allow them to develop things. It&#x27;s up by 130% compared to 1998.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;d call that inside big-tech, but in non-tech, we tend to call that, a waste of resources.<p>At least we can lower the cost by vendor-lock-in with azure, right?')
