Cores already exist or are coming that satisfy the existing platform.  They would be obsoleted by a change in the requirements.<p>2. RV64GC is already quite big.  Piling more requirements onto it will make it harder to introduce small cores.<p>3. V is pretty complex and I don&#x27;t agree with your assertion.
