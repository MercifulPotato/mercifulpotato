Item(by='batty_alex', descendants=None, kids=[25866819], score=None, time=1611265644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863668, text='&gt; A big piece of career advice I have for any folks that feel like they&#x27;re in dead-ends or are just getting started is that, in modern society, you should be constantly expending time and energy to ensure you&#x27;re in the most personally rewarding position - the world is a cruel place where the socially awkward and introverted have a constant uphill battle to not be exploited.<p>This was both uplifting and an apt commentary on how to survive in the modern age.<p>Well said.<p>&gt; Oh and we&#x27;re all super lucky to be in tech because in a lot of other fields there is just no way to advance yourself.<p>I feel like this is a pretty cynical take. Really, what&#x27;s happening is that more and more jobs are becoming tech jobs. It may not be as glamorous as going to stand-ups each morning, but there&#x27;s plenty of opportunity out there and we&#x27;re just in an awkward transition period where societies are trying to play catch-up with, historically-speaking, a lot of changes in a short amount of time.<p>Whether that transition ends with peace or chaos is going to depend on how easy the transition is made for everyone')
