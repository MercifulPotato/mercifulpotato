I&#x27;ve had to deal with some Java code that the ide was useless to help figure out.  Usually made worse by some over optimized build system that was non Google friendly to see what was supposed to happen.<p>Worse, the abstractions made it so that even a simple feature would require about six files.  Not counting the tests.<p>Not to say that clojure has been a breeze.  Worst I see there is developers refusing to use libraries it external programs and instead taking a ridiculous &quot;first principals&quot; approach.  Even if they get it working, it is typically not search friendly, as everyone else is using some other tool.  Basically, the same trap I see in build systems,')
