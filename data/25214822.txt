Item(by='wryoak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606342078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213827, text='As someone who uses bitcoin as a currency, not as an investment asset or ideological flag, the only valid argument I have against it is that it&#x27;s functionally worthless without electricity and an internet connection. If I&#x27;m at a music festival trying to purchase goods, bitcoin is not going to work because my phone can&#x27;t be used for digital communication when there are 10000 other people connected to the same tower which was only engineered to service the 50 or so rural families who live in the area the rest of the year.<p>Slow processing times suck but it&#x27;s not an argument against it, it&#x27;s a growing pain. Huge electricity usage sucks but, again, a growing pain rather than a fundamental challenge to bitcoin.')
