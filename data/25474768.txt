Even if pigs did have this dramatic power at some point, surely it is lost after they are cooked.<p>I can get on board with being honest with yourself and trusting your stomach, but I wouldn&#x27;t call that a psychology or a trick&#x2F;hack. I would simply call that listening to the signals your body has been sending all along. But if you are interested in psychological manipulation in other contexts maybe it can be helpful to frame it that way.<p>&quot;Willpower&quot; methods are usually set up to fail because they approach the problem from a bad angle. It takes sustained effort to look at a delicious food while abstaining. It takes less effort if the food is far away, out of sight. It takes no effort if you decide it&#x27;s not that delicious after all. But if you have something that works for you by all means stick to it.')
