In fact, the Biden campaign and his son Hunter have not denied any of the information either.<p>Given that Twitter has allowed people to publish anything and everything about Trump regardless of source (or lack thereof), this is a clear cut case of bias to push their preferred candidate.<p>A different take on the same idea, Google now adds &quot;fact checks&quot; when searching for videos of Biden, in his own words, describing his flip flopping position on fracking. Try it for yourself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;results?search_query=biden+fracking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;results?search_query=biden+fracking</a><p>I&#x27;d love to know what other fact checks they&#x27;ve added. I can&#x27;t find an explicit list. I submitted an Ask HN to see if anyone knew how to get that list.

Whether they&#x27;re allowed to do it on a private platform is a separate topic.
