Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since it all happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, Principiis obsta and Finem respice — ‘Resist the beginnings’ and ‘Consider the end.’ But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One must foresee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinary men or even by extraordinary men? Things might have. And everyone counts on that might.<p>The problem is the road to hell and heaven are both paved with good intentions.<p>History is littered with so many warnings of false positives and false negatives, it&#x27;s hard to be know what to resist and what to accept.<p>But power corrupts absolutely and I think it&#x27;s safe to fear unchecked power and those who are loyal to people instead of loyal to ideas. Ideas don&#x27;t change when they gain or lose power, but people always do.')
