The empire they were breaking away from was the #1 slave-trading nation in the world at that time. Slavery was a pre-existing fact when the United States was founded. It wasn&#x27;t the motivation for the founding.<p>And &quot;The US was founded on white supremacist principles&quot; can both simultaneously be true.<p>&gt; Even slaveowners in Virginia began questioning slavery at this time. Jefferson, despite his own ownership of slaves, wrote the clause that forbade slavery in the Northwest Territories, and even proposed a new constitution for Virginia that would have freed anyone born after 31 December 1800. This was extremely early, in an international perspective, in the global anti-slavery movement. Britain wouldn&#x27;t ban slavery until the 1830s.<p>Sort of, some antislavery sentiment in the UK predates the revolution. In 1772, slavery was ruled to be prohibited in England under English common law. It was still allowed in British colonies, but calling any founder a &quot;leader&quot; in this regard doesn&#x27;t hold up to scrutiny. No law needed to be passed banning slavery in England, because it was already illegal prior to the founding of the US. The 1930 law you cite banned slavery in British colonies, but it had already been illegal in England for 60 years, and the slave trade was made illegal in 1807. In other words, in <i>every</i> aspect (partial abolition, total abolition, etc.) the UK led the US.<p>Article 1, Section 9 of the US constitution likely delayed that British law (the US and UK banned the slave trade simultaneously). Are you really going to tell me that Article 1, Section 9 <i>isn&#x27;t</i> white supremacist? It literally prohibits the government from banning the slave trade until 1808.')
