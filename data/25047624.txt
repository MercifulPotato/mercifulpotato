With no Mac upgrade path, it&#x27;s likely that all the different Apple II form factors would have been upgraded with the 65816 to give the platform more life. Then a next generation &quot;Apple IV&quot; system might have combined a 68K and 65816 to offer 32-bit performance and Apple II backwards compatibility like the PS2 having a PS1 built in. (Apologies rbanffy, I wrote this before seeing that you posted almost the same idea earlier.)')
