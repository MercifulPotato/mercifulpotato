More reasonable would be to talk about &quot;anatomical knowledge&quot;, which is finitely bound to understanding the expected structure&#x2F;distribution, function of and communication between each part of the human body to a sub-cell level. We&#x27;re most of the way there on the first facet, but our models of the latter two are still hilariously incomplete at this point.')
