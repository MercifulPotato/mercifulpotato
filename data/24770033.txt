This was just driven by realizing that a couple data lookups in an inner loop were themselves O(n^2).<p>If I recall correctly, that raised the &quot;feasible&quot; value of K from about 4 to about 14 on the hardware at the time, which was more than enough for our purposes. I wanted to keep optimizing, but my boss correctly reminded me that shipping the paper was more important.')
