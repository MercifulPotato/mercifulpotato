I suspect they must really be trying to keep the BOM cost down though.<p>I was struck by just how little there is on that board other than the Spartan-6 FPGA; which looks to be one of the smallest versions of what is now a 10 year old design.<p>There&#x27;s one SOP&#x2F;SOIC-8 package by the FPGA which I assume is configuration flash. One 50MHz crystal near to that. Some power regulation on the right-hand side of the board. One Alliance SRAM package. And that&#x27;s it other than the passives and connectors!<p>I guess it&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s some interesting stuff on the other side but I&#x27;m doubting it.<p>EDIT: Wow I see they are selling this for GBP 300; which is over USD 400. You really aren&#x27;t paying for the hardware; this has less content than a USD 70 dev board.')
