But even accepting the explicit with statements, it&#x27;s still not as composable in more general situations. For example, I don&#x27;t see how to reliably pass an active context manager to a function for it to unlock part way through its execution, or return one of two active context managers (if you tried using your technique then both would still be active if you couldn&#x27;t exit the undesired one before the yield). But maybe you&#x27;re right that these are a bit less common, except for memory management, than I&#x27;m imagining.')
