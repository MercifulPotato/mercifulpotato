Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25663787], score=None, time=1609971881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662466, text='&quot; this is the price we pay for abandoning free speech.&quot;<p>This is completely upside down.<p>This is not the &#x27;erosion of free speech&#x27; - it&#x27;s actually the &#x27;explosion&#x27; of it.<p>Free from any kind of filters of credibility, people can now promote whatever fictions they want to promote.<p>When fictions are emboldened by those in positions of legitimate authority, aka The President, the truth falls by the side.<p>The ratio of &#x27;noise to truth&#x27; has blown up, and it&#x27;s mostly a result of our ability to communicate in a more direct manner.<p>The voices of mostly uninformed individuals, free to express themselves on the soap box, are now much louder. That&#x27;s not a slight: we&#x27;re all busy and have different roles in life. We can&#x27;t be experts in everything, ergo, most of us are not legitimate sources of truth on that much. We allocate those responsibilities to people within whom we entrust a certain degree of trust. Like the free press as one example, Science as another.<p>Far from &#x27;restrictions&#x27; on speech, the internet itself, Facebook, Twitter - whatever their policies provide for 100x more communication than existed before.<p>We used to get information from news, politicians, bureaucrats, teachers - and some gossip from the neighbours. Now the &#x27;gossip, youtube and TikTok information&#x27; factor is 10x greater - and that&#x27;s mostly a function of free expression.<p>Random people on Facebook will &#x27;like&#x27; and &#x27;propagate&#x27; whatever &#x27;science&#x27; they want to believe is true - which is obviously not going to result in rigorously verified information, rather the opposite.<p>&#x27;Good or Bad?&#x27; - that&#x27;s a more complicated issue - but what we are seeing now is &#x27;much more expression&#x27; not &#x27;limited expression&#x27;.<p>I challenge anyone here to demonstrate, over the last 25 years, how there could possibly be fewer channels and sources of public information and expression.<p>Edit: I should add that obviously there are issues with freedom of expression, on campus, and the in the commons with certain forms of shaming for certain opinions, but that&#x27;s an entirely different issue from &#x27;public information&#x27; and &#x27;how people are misinformed&#x27; about things like election results. The public commons is several orders of magnitude bigger than it ever was. It&#x27;s not even comparable to 25 years ago, this is a completely different era we live in.')
