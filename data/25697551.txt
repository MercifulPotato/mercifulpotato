Item(by='mattbgates', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610170152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695985, text='After looking over all the terms of service generators including big tech terms of service and privacy policies, I also searched for &quot;shortest terms of service&quot; and &quot;shortest privacy policy&quot; and I noticed they all have a few things in common.  The issue is:  The big tech companies have lawyers who write up a bunch of legal jargon.<p>Is it necessary? No.<p>Does it help these tech companies from getting sued? Yup.<p>I keep mine short, simple, and easy to read. I try to keep it around 10 points.<p>But this is basically what I&#x27;ve got it down to:<p>1. By using this product, you agree to these terms &#x2F;&#x2F; stating your company name and the copyrights to your name (that no one can use it but you).<p>2. Service: what the service is and what it does.<p>3. Privacy policy: letting user know what info you collect, including cookies &amp; usage.<p>4. Disclosure of any of that data: do you keep it for yourself or share it with third-parties?<p>5. GDPR-compliance and protection of the data you collect (including sharing it with government agencies if you are running a platform that might have some questionable materials, etc.)<p>6. Analytics: while you are talking about data, are you using any third-parties to collect data?<p>7. Pricing&#x2F;Payment&#x2F;Refunds: if you have a third-party service running the charges, they are collecting data -- so you should divulge the service you are using and also show they have a privacy policy. Or in regards to pricing --that it may be subject to change but notice will be given.<p>8. Changes to terms&#x2F;privacy policy: letting user know that these terms may change -- if they do, you will email them or you are allowed to change them on your own without letting them know.<p>9. Statement about what they own when they are using their product -- for example: if your product creates something for the user, do they own that or do you still own everything or are they able to claim ownership?<p>10. Final statement about ensuring proper use of the product, your state&#x27;s laws (you will use this product accordingly within reason of the State of California laws), etc.<p>There can be subcategories within these or you can create your own. But I&#x27;d rather keep the legal jargon to a minimum. Basically, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy just shows who you are, that you are acting to the best of your ability and with good intentions with your own product and service, as well as user data, and that should anyone try to sue you -- you have some &quot;legalities&quot; set up to protect yourself and your own customers.<p>I hope this helps. It is great to use a generator, but sometimes... it&#x27;s easier just to write up a quick template for all of your products and follow it.')
