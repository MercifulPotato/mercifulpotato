We sometimes forget they are sitting on mountains of money because they execute good company decision making, not because they are doing weird things to protect a monopoly. Like there is some meeting near the top between execs happening where someone goes &quot;lets do X!&quot; and another exec replies &quot;no but doing X would harm our monopoly, we cant&#x27; do that&quot;.
