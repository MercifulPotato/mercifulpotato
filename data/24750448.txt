I&#x27;ve had to live with 5 or so years of tearing with multi-monitor support on Ivy Bridge, and even single monitor tears inexplicably with some software (that shouldn&#x27;t). The Intel Xorg driver is unmaintained and the generic modesetting driver doesn&#x27;t work quite as well. When I first got my Ivy Bridge system, triple head mode didn&#x27;t work for a while either, so it&#x27;s not like they have great support when the hardware is current either.<p>I&#x27;ve switched to AMD now and things are much better. Go with AMD.')
