All things considered, the documentary was very supportive of Fincher&#x27;s point of view, that he was a victim of an overly controlling studio that didn&#x27;t give him the funding he needed. So I guess there&#x27;s a difference in point of view there regarding precisely when he stopped heeding others&#x27; advice. :)')
