Apple as a whole has an ego complex and it shows in so much of what they do. They always, to the point of harping, emphasize the Pro label and premium experience and premium materials. Even their head quarters is an expression of pure ego.<p>So when compared to other companies which do put out products with similar materials the difference is that Apple never reaches low. They won&#x27;t sacrifice their premium material usage and expression to reach lower end markets.<p>Air Pods Max might be the situation backfiring on them. They were so wrapped up in having aluminum enclosures for the headphones they ended up with an overweight and overpriced to many product. It is going to be real curious what a lower cost version of these entail; the rumor is they will come but when and of what materials?')
