I got to help them with the usual network runs and whatever.<p>Everything was as default as they could leave it.  The techs were told not to change anything unless absolutely necessary.  I asked about passwords and they just smiled and shook their head.<p>A quick google search later and i got in via ssh as root....   i did let the GE support know that “our network scanner bruteforced its way into the scanner” but they didn’t care.  They “made a ticket.”   Before i left a few years later i was still able to ssh in.')
