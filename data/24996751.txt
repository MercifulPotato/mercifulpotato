I find that I can do the generic add&#x2F;zoom in&#x2F;copy&#x2F;settings&#x2F;blah and then when I need buttons for &quot;Show wiring&quot; and &quot;Set milking schedule&quot; or &quot;View restaurants&quot; then it&#x27;s tricky to use an icon, but too time consuming to try to create a new one. The usual antipattern is &quot;OK I&#x27;ll use this lightning one as a placeholder to mean do-thing, and I&#x27;ll create a better one later&quot;. That never happens, so you have these monochrome overly generic icons around.')
