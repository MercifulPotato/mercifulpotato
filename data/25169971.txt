It used a self-signed certificate which requires clicking through security warnings in every browser.<p>As a bonus, it seems to <i>generate</i> the certificate based on a random seed at boot time.  So if you power it off for long enough, it generates a new <i>different</i> self-signed certificate that causes un-click-through-able security warnings in all browsers other than IE11.<p>For Safari, I can at least delete the saved certificate from the keychain and get the usual &quot;untrusted certificate&quot; warning which I can click through instead of the hard stop &quot;impersonation&quot; warning.<p>The kicker is that you can&#x27;t even do anything other than reboot from the modem status page.  It doesn&#x27;t even expose a firmware upgrade; that&#x27;s controlled by the ISP.')
