Also I highly recommend reading up on the psychological effects incarceration has on felons.<p>Quarantined people aren&#x27;t prisoners but there are parallels due to effects of isolation. Every re-socializing attempt of a prisoner even in the most &quot;progressive&quot; manner, has at its core idea to _first_ rob that person of their own agency.<p>Isolation opens up minds to new ideas and to cause them question everything. What minds are being fed in such a state is absolutely crucial to how they&#x27;re reorienting themselves and what they latch on-to. Isolation breaks everyone except the hardest psychopaths, which is why it&#x27;s used in every society (since earliest civilizations) as an instrument of control.<p>This lancet research paper isn&#x27;t talking about felons but there are some hard to ignore parallels, maybe this is why politicians avoid the subject.')
