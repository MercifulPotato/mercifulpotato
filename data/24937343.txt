But generally, when showing&#x2F;hiding&#x2F;navigating with JS, you are short-circuiting a lot of stuff you get for free with the browser (focus reset, announcing of changes etc.) and you have to reimplement a bunch of stuff in JS to get the same effect.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth it if what you are doing with JS is highly interactive &amp; there&#x27;s a payoff. But in this case, each thing of content could be its own page, and that plus a little more semantic HTML would do wonders.')
