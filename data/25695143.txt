I don&#x27;t see anywhere where someone is broadcasting messages that some people have been conditioned to believe are orders to terminate pregnancies.<p>Where is that happening?<p>And &quot;not an easy choice&quot; is exactly my point. Are you under the impression doctors council in favor of terminating pregnancies outside of cases where there is a health risk to the woman? I&#x27;ve seen a few claims of that from anti-abortion activists, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything resembling proof of those claims. Given how strong such proof would be in support of their argument, I would be surprised if there is any pattern of such behavior. (Yes, I&#x27;m aware they have some videos they claim are exactly this, but given that the only videos they release are highly edited, I&#x27;m rather suspicious that those edits removed a lot of important information. An unambiguous problem wouldn&#x27;t need a lot of editing.)<p>Doctors will provide abortions to the people who choose to get them. I don&#x27;t see any evidence that there are people who believe they are being instructed to have or perform abortions.<p>I see quite a lot of very strong evidence people are being told the election results are invalid, insurrection is necessary to right an injustice, and that there are people who believe they are being called upon to carry out that insurrection. My source? The claims the president has made repeatedly and the insurrection attempt on Wednesday.<p>These things are different. One is very obvious to everyone with their eyes open. The other one still lacks evidence. When the important part of the situation is the link between an action and its effect on others, the ease in observing that connection <i>is</i> the context.<p>So no. The same argument doesn&#x27;t work. The pattern of facts is quite different.')
