Item(by='tomduncalf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605784648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148359, text='Discord etc. also requires a lot more regular attention to keep up with I find. The threaded nature of forums makes it easy to come back once a day or once a week or whatever and catch up with it, whereas in a Discord most of the valuable content will be lost in noise.<p>I do like that these chat groups are popping up for communities though, would just be nice to have the forum option too.... but I guess you have to go with what the majority actually use! And I&#x27;d much rather Discord than Facebook.')
