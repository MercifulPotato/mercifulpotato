I&#x27;m pretty sure all the dialogue alone adds up to that much.<p>Even completing the main story, gigs and side-missions is probably going to take me around 100 hours. Maybe someone faster could do it in 40, or maybe 20 if you skipped all of the dialogue and played on a low difficulty. I spend&#x2F;wasted a lot of time just exploring the city and surrounding areas, doing &#x27;bounties&#x27; or climbing on random places to see if there&#x27;s something interesting&#x2F;loot to be found.<p>I suppose you mostly played the main story line on a low difficulty, ignoring all the side activities (which do impact the main story and vice-versa) and likely rushed through or past everything else.<p>If you were looking to have a good time you didn&#x27;t exactly set yourself up for success. A bit like reading a book and skipping all of the chapters that follow minor characters for world-building purposes.<p>I agree that the life paths don&#x27;t have major consequence, which is a bit disappointing, but saying &quot;choices don&#x27;t matter&quot; as a blanket statement is just factually incorrect, considering there&#x27;s a long list of choices that have a lasting effect on the game world, and there are at least 3-5 different endings depending on the choices you made earlier in the game.<p>There&#x27;s a list of (so far known) <i>major</i> choices here if you want to spoil yourself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ign.com&#x2F;wikis&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077&#x2F;Choices_and_Consequences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ign.com&#x2F;wikis&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077&#x2F;Choices_and_Consequ...</a>')
