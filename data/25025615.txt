It would demonstrate that I don&#x27;t respect the company&#x27;s ownership of the code, and everybody will assume I cannot be trusted.<p>&gt; Letâ€™s say hypothetically that the company does not have a work issued laptop and that the company has invited developers to the organization with their personal github accounts.<p>If you care about the privacy of your code, that&#x27;s not how you do it. You&#x27;d have your own private gitlab instance (or github enterprise, if paying LOTS is your thing) with company-specific accounts, likely tied to your Active Directory or so.<p>And as others have said, treat your employees fairly, pay them well, educate them about code ownership, private data and so on.')
