And knowing that the hardware I am using is perfectly capable of supporting it but just because the greedy Android ecosystem wants to sell me new devices bothers me. And not only new features but there can also be bugs. For example I have an Android tablet which stopped getting updates after just 1 year. It has bugs which did not get solved during this period so they will never get solved. Also I like using dark mode that is introduced with Android 10, which will never come to my tablet. So I need to buy a new tablet if I want dark mode or less buggy experience.')
