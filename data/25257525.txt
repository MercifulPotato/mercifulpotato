The last version was version 5, in 1995, though I&#x27;m not sure how much EA was actually involved with that one.<p>The first Amiga version they released that could handle 256 colors came out in 1993, designed for the then new AGA graphics chipset. It became such a favorite that Psygnosis (after being bought by Sony) reportedly used Deluxe Paint on Amigas to create some of the graphics for Wipeout. I also know of other companies that used Amigas well into the early noughties for creating pixel graphics for mobile phones.<p>Avril Harrison is an artist whose &quot;A.H.&quot; signature can been seen on many of the example pictures that were distributed along with Deluxe Paint, including her rendition of Botticelli&#x27;s Venus and the iconic Tutankhamun gold mask[1].<p>LucasArts, however, seemed to be using PC:s exclusively. AFAIK, Monkey Island was ported to the Amiga by another company hired specifically for that task.<p>At the time when Monkey Island I and II were made the Amiga chipset didn&#x27;t have support for 256 colors. The maximum was 32 colors, plus 32 darker shades of those colors, in a mode called EHB (Extra Half-brite). Monkey Island, just like most other Amiga games, was made to run in normal 32 color mode.<p>Avril Harrison later started working for LucasArts and it&#x27;s claimed the original art depicting governor Elaine Marley[2] is based on her likeness.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;hk6hkm84xv011.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;hk6hkm84xv011.png</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sporting04.it&#x2F;general&#x2F;explorers&#x2F;ddb&#x2F;MonkeyIsland04.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sporting04.it&#x2F;general&#x2F;explorers&#x2F;ddb&#x2F;MonkeyIsland...</a>')
