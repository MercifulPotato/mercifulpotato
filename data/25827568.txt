When you ask someone for their estimate, you&#x27;re getting a quote from them.<p>When you actually want to predict the length of time something will take, you rely on historical data and create a projected forecast. It never involves asking somebody for their best guess. That&#x27;s how every single &quot;other thing&quot; we predict is handled, so why is software done differently.<p>Actually, I&#x27;ve seen some of these ideas being talked about in KanBan circles, like tracking lead time and cycle time, and then using monte carlo simulations to forecast, but I&#x27;ve never actually seen them in practice.')
