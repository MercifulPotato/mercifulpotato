Today&#x27;s proof-of-stake systems probably never would have existed without Bitcoin.<p>When proof-of-stake systems become mature then Bitcoin could adopt one, or perhaps if Bitcoin users can&#x27;t reach agreement on that then maybe a new proof-of-stake based cryptocurrency will gain enough trust to overtake Bitcoin.
