For some strange reason, they shipped the case immediately, then the phone a few weeks later.<p>When I got the phone, I realized that the case had never arrived. Google refused to do anything, citing a 2-week limit on disputes. They told me to take it up with the shipper, but provided no guidance on how to do so and never responded when I asked.<p>Given that the cases are clearly high margin items, I was blown away by how terrible their customer service was.')
