That is why protestors taking over the floor of the legislature is a fairly common thing (e.g. Taiwan not too long ago). The US Capitol is a major tourist site, tours are held daily and the building is supposed to seem open to the people whom it represents. What is secured is a nearby facility to which legislators can be evacuated in emergencies.')
