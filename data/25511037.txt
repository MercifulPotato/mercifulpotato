There are laws that prevent someone from being fired 1 day before vesting for the purpose of clawback.<p>EX: \nThis source is about retirement vesting.

They may delay the termination date, extend it by using &quot;paid time off&quot; days, or accelerate the upcoming vesting to avoid appearing to terminate an employee merely to forfeit soon-to-be vested shares.&quot;<p>So companies specifically try to avoid this situation, because they know it is illegal.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mystockoptions.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;can-company-fire-me-or-reduce-size-of-grant-just-before-the-vesting-of-options-restricted-stock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mystockoptions.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;can-company-fire-me-o...</a><p>Here is a source that says the following:<p>&quot;These cases provide very powerful ammunition to employees who are either negotiating for additional severance or engaged in litigation with their employer.<p>First, Kelly and Newberger provide an employee who was wrongfully terminated with a legal basis to become fully vested in any options that were previously granted.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sebastianmillerlaw.com&#x2F;fired-employee-entitled-accelerated-vesting-unpaid-bonuses&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sebastianmillerlaw.com&#x2F;fired-employee-entitled-accel...</a><p>And here are a bunch of lawyers agreeing with me that this is illegal:<p>&quot;AT will is one thing, this is quite another. This is an obvious scam by the employer to avoid having your stock vest, which is not only not fair, its illegal in my view&quot;<p>&quot;In Mass., if an employer terminates an employee for the purpose of preventing a right to compensation to vest, the employee has a claim for the compensation. &quot;<p>&quot;There are certain kinds of showings that you need to make in order to be able to collect in this circumstance. The short answer is that you may very well be entitled to the stock.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avvo.com&#x2F;legal-answers&#x2F;i-was-terminated-one-day-before-my-stock-vested-an-227103.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avvo.com&#x2F;legal-answers&#x2F;i-was-terminated-one-day-...</a><p>Thats why I am saying that this threat needs to be documented.  It is quite clear, that there are many cases where terminating someone, for the purpose of getting back shares or retirement or bonuses, is very illegal.')
