I had 125mbps Comcast for years and the upload speed was around 30mbps.<p>You&#x27;ve been very fortunate. Upload speeds are atrocious. I&#x27;ve lived all over the US, and been stuck with cable Internet almost everywhere. I&#x27;ve never had more than 10M up with cable. Right now, I have 230M down and 5M up with Comcast. Once I was lucky enough to live in a FIOS area, and had 100M&#x2F;100M.<p>At Comcast speeds, it&#x27;s impossible for me to do offsite backups (except for selected files) and forget about streaming any video. I started building a Plex server for the family but gave up when I realized it wasn&#x27;t possible for even one outgoing video stream.<p>There are valid technical reasons why cable has such terrible upstream bandwidth. I just wish FIOS would roll out faster. And StarLink.')
