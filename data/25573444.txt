The same thing happens with violence, but the majority of people aren&#x27;t going to engage in direct violence against someone else, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if they think fights look the same way they do in anime or video games. The discussion is about video games making a normal person into a violent person, not about giving people unrealistic expectations about what happens during violent encounters.<p>You should also try writing with less question marks, it&#x27;s condescending, especially when you completely missed the point of this whole conversation.')
