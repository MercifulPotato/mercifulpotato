Colonialism or any other system of injustice has winners and losers, heck even &quot;perfectly just&quot; systems would have winners and losers. The winners are less motivated to change the system that might create different winners, even if those outcomes are &quot;more just&quot; or &quot;just as fair&quot; or completely arbitrary in the assignment of new winners and losers. This was the basis for a lot of the colonial systems in fact, the British intentionally aligned themselves with minorities in many places to ensure a reliable partner that both profited from the rule and depended on the British to maintain their status.<p>Is the great Chinese famine relevant to a discussion of colonialism? Not really! The Bengal Famine on the other hand, pretty relevant! It killed a good 10 million people. Look it up!')
