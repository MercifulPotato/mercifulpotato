I needed to be a customer of the specific bank to receive my salary. Luckily, this changed many year ago after government intervention, though. Now you&#x27;re allowed to have an account in a bank other than the one chosen by your company. The problem is that every other bank still has the same requirement.<p>And my father still needs to be a customer of a specific bank to use government-backed credit for small companies that was best for him. There was nothing in the contract about Diebold controlling every single bit coming in or out of his computer.<p><i>&gt; Apple has created an exclusionary economic zone and put 50% of Americans in it. This is unprecedented.</i><p>It&#x27;s still not a sacred right of developers to fuck with my computer or threaten my ability to conduct business. My computer is my property, not yours or any other developers. Having asshole developers out of this zone is great for me.<p>I&#x27;m not saying what we have is perfect. I want more freedom, but only for myself and for other users. What I don&#x27;t want is this freedom to be abused by third-parties, so that I and other users are the mercy of asshole developers, which seem to be the majority in 2020. Freedom is difficult when it comes to closed source software.<p><i>&gt; A sandbox will protect you from everything you claim to be worried about.</i><p>Still doesn&#x27;t excuse it, nor completely fixes it.<p>And I tried everything and couldn&#x27;t find anything that works with Warsaw by Diebold, other than buying Apple stuff. If you have suggestions I&#x27;m all ears.')
