Unfortunately it&#x27;s not nearly as good :-(<p>I&#x27;d like to try to record my usage of Dragon that I could fine-tune my own model, but it&#x27;s harder to get around to hobby coding projects like that now that coding is more of a pain in the ass.<p>The unfortunate reality in my case is that using Dragon is the least frustrating way to keep working. I don&#x27;t think closed paid ASR models will stop being noticeably better better than three open ones until the state-of-the-art error rate is basically zero.<p>I do like that caster is open source where talon isn&#x27;t, but preferences like that are pretty low priority when say your career is on the line.')
