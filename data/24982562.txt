We have no disagreement there. The question is whether GPUs have a durable architectural advantage for versatile SIMD workloads. Their inverted cache hierarchy and lack of persistence between kernel launches is a concern for memory locality.<p>Regarding L3 bandwidth on EPYC, I have PDE solvers that exceed V100 global memory bandwidth for problem sizes that fit in EPYC L3 cache. I use NPS4 and eschew sharing data structures between CCX. This is the sweet spot for a sizable fraction of apps. The V100 is better value if you have more patience (and are thus able to batch or run larger problem sizes per device).')
