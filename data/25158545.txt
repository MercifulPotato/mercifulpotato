If you only had 16GB or of RAM in your system, all of your ARC space would be wasted with L2ARC mappings and you would only have 2GB of the entire rest of your system.<p>Am I misunderstanding this?  140,000,000 bytes is 140MB (salesman MB, not 2^20 bytes).  It looks like they&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s 14GB.')
