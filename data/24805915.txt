Machine learning, computer vision, etc. These usually require quite a bit of creativity and a good understanding of math to solve problems. It&#x27;s also low stress because working in research means you don&#x27;t have to deal with customers directly. Also, the software you write can usually be research prototype quality and not production quality.')
