Item(by='zenexer', descendants=None, kids=[25620221], score=None, time=1609658721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620155, text='&gt; All I&#x27;m seeing is this statement which is factually correct: 50,000 IU dosages arenâ€™t really available by prescription only when 5,000 IU pills are OTC.<p>I think it was probably intended to be somewhat humorous, and yes, it&#x27;s technically correct.  However, it makes little sense if taken as factual rather than humorous: you shouldn&#x27;t be exceeding the OTC dosage unless you know you need to; you can&#x27;t know you need to exceed the OTC dosage unless you are tested; if you&#x27;re tested, you&#x27;re eligible for a prescription to get it cheaper anyway.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure why you seem to feel so compelled to argue so strenuously that everyone here is missing some important details about how the poorest of the poor live in the US.<p>Money is only one factor, and I think that&#x27;s something people on HN tend to forget.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure why you seem to feel so compelled to argue so strenuously that everyone here is missing some important details about how the poorest of the poor live in the US.<p>I should clarify that this is largely anecdotal.  I only know a handful of people who have been in these situations.  I wouldn&#x27;t even say they&#x27;re the poorest of the poor: there are often other factors at play, be it mental disorders, language barriers, or a combination thereof.<p>&gt; I also think HN is fairly well informed these days overall on such topics because they put up with me being openly homeless for nearly six years and I still sometimes write about that and sometimes hit the front page on such topics. So the crowd here isn&#x27;t generally all &quot;la la la, not listening.&quot;<p>I would agree; it&#x27;s certainly one of the better communities in that regard.<p>&gt; This just seems honestly not relevant to the discussion, at least not in the way it is being approached.<p>Quite possibly, especially considering that the ancestor was probably joking.  Still, I can&#x27;t help but cringe at the thought of someone I care about hearing that the solution to their COVID troubles is to waltz into the nearest pharmacy, spend their food money on a bottle of vitamin D, and down 10 of them at once.')
