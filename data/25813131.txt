Item(by='peter_d_sherman', descendants=None, kids=[25813375], score=None, time=1610906998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813068, text='&gt;&quot;In electronics, negative resistance (NR) is a property of some electrical circuits and devices in which an increase in voltage across the device&#x27;s terminals results in a decrease in electric current through it.[4][5]&quot;<p>PDS: Which, conversely, would mean that a <i>decrease</i> in voltage -- would result in an <i>increase</i> of current...<p>So, next question: What happens when the voltage is zero?  Does current&#x2F;current capacity increase to infinite?  Or is there some limit?<p>What about just before zero, like 0.0001 volts?<p>Also, what about negative (reversed) voltages?<p>(Note To Future Self: Investigate this...)')
