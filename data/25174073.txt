We can&#x27;t confirm experimentally that a given mass can be composed of &quot;multiple possible combinations of objects whose masses can sum to that same mass&quot;. The mass number for an object can exist and yet it may be impossible to duplicate it with other objects. Imagine every object having unique ID with infinity of digits.')
