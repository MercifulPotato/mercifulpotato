If you make the error bars around Trump&#x27;s numbers larger in both directions, it doesn&#x27;t change your guess if you&#x27;re trying to minimize your expected error.<p>What you and the author are implicitly saying is that the only certain thing was that Trump&#x27;s upper tail decreased over time. The betting markets and I disagree with you. Did Trump getting COVID increase his vote share or lower? I have no idea. It&#x27;s a coin flip. I have no idea what the aggregate thinks&#x2F;thought. The coin flip changes the variance of the outcomes possible but it doesn&#x27;t change my guess of Trump&#x27;s voter share.<p>You should review stock behavior around binary events like Apple v Samsung lawsuit. Just because the outcome is uncertain, it doesn&#x27;t mean the stock jumps wildly from pretending they will win to the next minute treating it like they might lose. Your criticism is akin to being surprised that the price is neither 0.00 or 1.00 because someone can&#x27;t &quot;40% win&quot;.')
