I have heard it as early as 2011.<p>A number of other anecdotal experiments, such as one performed by myself, failed to show this behavior. A more tightly controlled but still informal experiment by a vaguely related security firm failed to find this behavior[1]. An academic effort by researchers at Northwestern failed to find this behavior [2]. This is by far the most thorough academic effort on the topic I have seen.<p>Facebook has clearly denied it [3]. Google has not issued such a clear statement but has been reasonably open about changes in their policy on voice data [4]. After considering the issue from several angles, P. J. Vogt concluded that no such thing happens [5]. Even the paper you cite notes the total lack of evidence.<p>Perhaps most notably, almost all of the popular media reporting that bears headlines saying that your phone <i>is</i> listening to your conversations, actually say no such thing when you read the article. Instead they are talking about analytics on voice assistant activations and, frequently, voice memos in Facebook Messenger. Amusingly I&#x27;ve run into two cases where popular press had to issue retractions or corrections after they said that smartphones were always-listening.<p>The only serious sources I have ever seen assert that this <i>is</i> happening are Vice&#x27;s Sam Nichols based on Dr. Henway. Henway makes some very specific claims to two different reporters but provides no explanation of how he came to that knowledge. To an almost comical extent, nearly all reporting in favor of this theory (that even claims to have a source) is based around the exact same quote from Henway, who has never published anything formal on the matter or even really elaborated beyond a single paragraph. Nichols only performs a very basic experiment and it is easy to come up with other ways he may have gotten the result he did - in fact, the experiment he performs is nearly identical to the ones performed by others that have failed to show results.<p>Look, I&#x27;m not totally unreceptive to the idea that this is happening, but I don&#x27;t like people repeating the assertion-as-fact that it is a widespread behavior when major tech companies that have denied it, and no real evidence has ever been amassed to show that it does happen.<p>Just my opinion, but... well, just all of our opinions. Let&#x27;s be careful about calling them facts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wandera.com&#x2F;phone-listening&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wandera.com&#x2F;phone-listening&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;public_events&#x2F;1415032&#x2F;privacycon2019_elleen_pan.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;public_events&#x2F;141...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;amitchowdhry&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;facebook-ads-microphone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;amitchowdhry&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;faceboo...</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;5&#x2F;21354805&#x2F;google-email-audio-privacy-opt-in-human-reviewers-assistant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;8&#x2F;5&#x2F;21354805&#x2F;google-email-audi...</a>\n[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gimletmedia.com&#x2F;shows&#x2F;reply-all&#x2F;z3hlwr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gimletmedia.com&#x2F;shows&#x2F;reply-all&#x2F;z3hlwr</a>')
