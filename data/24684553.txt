Further, an expert opined that the source code for Apple’s recommendations system was similar to the source code for Hooked’s. That evidence does suggest the engineers drew on knowledge and skills they gained from Hooked to develop a product for their new employer – but California’s policy favoring free mobility for employees specifically allows that.

Further, an expert opined that the schematic for Uber’s LIDAR system was similar to the schematic for Waymo’s. That evidence does suggest the engineers drew on knowledge and skills they gained from Waymo to develop a product for their new employer – but California’s policy favoring free mobility for employees specifically allows that.
