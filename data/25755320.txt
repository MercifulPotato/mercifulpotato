Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610493045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753316, text='One of the key difficulties is crossing from Semitic languages to Indo-European languages.<p>Semitic languages generally rely on a triconsonant root pattern, with the vowels in between those consonants effectively forming a kind of inflection. So abjads dropped the vowels entirely.<p>Indo-European languages, by contrast, place a lot heavier emphasis on the importance of vowels (consider all the different words in English that have the sound &#x2F;b&#x2F;-vowel-&#x2F;t&#x2F;). So Greek adapted the consonant for &#x27;aleph (which represents a glottal stop, something Greek did not have) into an alpha (representing one of the five main vowels). On the other side, Brahmi adopted it by adding mandatory vowel marks to the character, so that each letter effectively represents a consonant-vowel pair [1].<p>However, there&#x27;s a second complication, which is that Indo-European languages <i>also</i> tend to have complex consonant clusters rather than simple CV or CVC syllables. For example, the English word &quot;strengths&quot; has a 4-consonant cluster. So Brahmi also solved this problem by making a consonant cluster stack the consonants onto the character.<p>[1] It should be noted that the evolution of most scripts seems to follow a pattern of marking logograms, going through a rebus stage (using homophones to represent words), then simplifying the inventory to have each letter represent a syllable, or at least a CV pair, as most languages tend to follow a CV or CVC syllable pattern. It was a single Semitic language (Proto-Sinaitic) that went all the way down to a single phoneme, probably thanks to the underemphasis on vowels in Semitic languages--and almost all abigudas, abjads, and alphabets derive ultimately from that one invention.')
