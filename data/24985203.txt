Writing a system and simply specifying what resources and queries it needs as function arguments and it magically getting them for me makes it really quick to get to the fun part of writing game code. Are other ECSs this ergonomic?<p>Still struggling to really get in the flow of where what data should live, but with time it&#x27;s getting easier. The realization that you don&#x27;t need all data to be in components also really helps. For example for my game grid I store it as a Resource and inside I store entities I care about such that I can run a normal path search algo.<p>Overall very impressive and fun project and the discord community is active and friendly.')
