Item(by='ryukafalz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604850788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025301, text='Guix is very nice, but suffers a bit from:<p>- Having less development effort than Nix involved in packaging; some packages end up broken&#x2F;out of date as a result<p>- Its more &quot;pure&quot; packaging ethos (no bundled dependencies, all dependencies must themselves be packages for Guix, etc). I like this in theory but practically it makes packaging some applications (Go&#x2F;Node ones especially) effectively impossible. Debian seems to have the same issue: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;SubscriberLink&#x2F;835599&#x2F;b4de94c924ae4463&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;SubscriberLink&#x2F;835599&#x2F;b4de94c924ae4463&#x2F;</a><p>- The build farm often doesn&#x27;t have substitutes available for certain packages, which tend to be precisely the ones that take ages to build on older hardware. Cue multi-hour IceCat builds<p>- There&#x27;s not much documentation available on packaging beyond the trivial cases. Packaging many applications is pretty simple, but for the ones that aren&#x27;t it&#x27;s a bit of a guessing game and trying to read through definitions of other involved packages<p>All that aside... these are complaints that I have as a dedicated Guix user, and I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed my time using Guix System. It&#x27;s the first distro I&#x27;ve ever used that I haven&#x27;t felt has gotten &quot;polluted&quot; after over a year of tinkering with it - I&#x27;ve installed (and uninstalled) multiple DEs, and I know I can trust the package manager to actually remove every single thing that was installed as part of that.<p>And it&#x27;s really nice to use a distro whose entire configuration system and package definitions are written in a single language (Guile) - I&#x27;ve written a few simple package definitions myself and I think the fact that it&#x27;s all written in the same language has made it easier to dive deeper into how the system works after having written a few packages.')
