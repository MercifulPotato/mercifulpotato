It means a lot of things to different people, but those things still vaguely refer to similar ideas. I tend not to support stringent definitions on things (&quot;The US is a republic, not a democracy&quot;) because basically it ends up being word games.<p>If you look at economics, the idea is that people are rational agents. At least the orthodox idea which people are not told to question. From there you get all sorts of efficiency ideas that are the support for that government intervention idea of free markets. It goes free thinking -&gt; efficient decisions -&gt; government shouldn&#x27;t intervene.<p>So of course if people aren&#x27;t so free thinking, doesn&#x27;t that change something?<p>The issue with advertising is that we have indeed agreed that certain interventions are legit. Externalities are another one of those things they mention in economics, and you&#x27;ll find all sorts of models for how to deal with them. There are in fact loads of regulations, all grounded in the idea that even rational agents sometimes cause things to happen that we don&#x27;t want, and should be fixed by intervention. Typically to do with information problems.<p>So then if actually we think government should intervene in some situations, why not in this one? Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of time, as evidence builds up. I suppose there&#x27;s already controls for things like addictive gambling.')
