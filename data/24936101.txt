While I do want to binge, I also like the delayed gratification you get from watching a series spread out. Part of the reason I want to binge everything is because there is no new content. It&#x27;s self defeating insofar that new content becomes old the same day it comes out.<p>And for a production company, churning through years of work in a day only to start demanding a second season has to be rough. I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s helped studios in terms of timelines.')
