However, I&#x27;m not so sure that is the case. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear at all.<p>Knowing that Elasticsearch is (was) open-source, I&#x27;d assume that I&#x27;m getting an AWS hosted installation of Elasticsearch... which is entirely accurate. If you can install the software on your own server, and AWS offers a managed version of it, I have no expectation that the original developers are involved at all.<p>Ever since the original release, it looks like AWS has been much better at avoiding any mention of Elastic.co. The original announcement Tweet was definitely misleading.<p><i>&gt; In hindsight, maybe it would have worked better for ES, had they called the open source product something else, like how centos isn&#x27;t called RedHat.</i><p>I think this is the major problem, and you&#x27;re right. Elasticsearch was the original trademark and is the accurate mark for the software. They only formed Elastic.co later, and this is where a lot of confusion originates. Elasticsearch != elastic.co<p>It might be better for AWS to just include a disclaimer like &quot;AWS Elasticsearch Service includes the open source Elasticsearch software, but is not supported by the original developers.&quot;  Something like that...')
