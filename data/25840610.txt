In an absolute sense, China&#x27;s level of economic development on Bulgaria, Mexico or Kazakstan. They&#x27;ve had a long period of high growth, but that&#x27;s only because of the abject poverty the Maoists left the country in. Before Deng&#x27;s reforms, the country was essentially North Korea.<p>China&#x27;s prosperity is much more of a &quot;most-improved award&quot; rather than a gold medal. Their current system has certainly proved better than Stalinism, but that&#x27;s a pretty low bar. There&#x27;s no reason to believe that Xi Jinping thought can produce an economy that in any way is competitive with liberal capitalist democracy.')
