I have almost the same setup except use 120mm fans on the NH-U14S (to clear the RAM, I populated all 8 slots ;)<p>I am very tempted to switch to water cooling.  Seems like I could make it a little quieter, and get a little bit more performance.  $1000 more performance?  Probably not.  But it would be a fun project.<p>(In general, I am blown away by the Threadripper&#x27;s performance.  I have C++ builds that took 15 minutes on my 6950X that now take 2!)')
