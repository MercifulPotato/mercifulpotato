Item(by='andy_ppp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605686084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25120207, text='I find this trope quite boring; you know who is good, people who can code, people with high IQs and people with the right experience. Being able to write is probably about the same as people who can design as well as code. Sure it’ll be useful but hiring experts in these areas should be your ultimate goal. No startup was killed ever by a bad prose style.<p>So after reading the article (ha imagine) these are NOT about writing ability, they are about the company prioritising documentation and communication. Documentation, sure, but communication is another truism I don’t have much time for; we’ve all worked with extremely productive clever programmers who don’t communicate well, if you’re a founder getting the best from each persons character might be better than just hiring only extroverts.')
