But for the result for men at &quot;normal&quot; weight, 18.5 &lt; BMI &lt; 24.9, the p value is given as p&lt; 0.05.<p>The first strangeness is that this <i>hints</i> at a much weaker effect. The second strangeness is reporting the p value rather than the effect size. I clicked the link to a pdf at the bottom of the article, but it is <i>not</i> the paper. <i>shrug</i>')
