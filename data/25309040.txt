You have to dig yourself to find good content and niche subreddits, but I vastly prefer it to the centralised, &#x27;overlord AI&#x27;, algorithmic stuff on every other service.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both, if you have decentralisation and pretty free expression you get a lot of garbage and responsibility is on you to find what&#x27;s worth looking at.
