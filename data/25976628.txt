I know it is anecdotal, but I heard lots of white people behind closed doors talk about the LA riots and the OJ Simpson trial at the time and they were not offensive about it.  That&#x27;s what I mean by happier time.  Bad things will happen in every decade, but how we respond to it and how we treat others defines how happy we will be.  I&#x27;m hoping 2021 can be the year that empathy and unity starts making a comeback in America.')
