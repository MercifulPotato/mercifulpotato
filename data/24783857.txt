Item(by='wrmsr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602725869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774964, text='The whole point of python is to eschew &#x27;magic&#x27; in favor of dumb explicitness, and this is about as big of a conflict as you can get to that. Python lacks statement lambdas not because they&#x27;ve never considered the possibility but explicitly because &quot;if it&#x27;s that important it deserves a name (as an inner function)&quot;. Type annotations work so well in python as compared to ruby or clojure exactly because of this philosophy. The PEP seems to make no mention of things like reproducibility, IO in macro expansion, static analysis like in mypy, or any of the other realities of things like this. If macro expansion is limited to something carefully statically interpretable like constexpr then I&#x27;m cautiously receptive to it, OR as it positions itself to be &#x27;for experimenting with language features&#x27; and that&#x27;s genuine then I&#x27;d be fine with it if it&#x27;s only enabled in debug builds, but in lieu of those the instant it&#x27;s released generally it&#x27;s a python 4 flag day.')
