Why, to show other people<p>Try this approach instead:<p>Would X (&quot;a trip to Athens&quot;) happen if there was no perspective to ever mention X in any future communication between humans? (Yes&#x2F;No)<p>In this take the theory can become verifiable with some work.<p>Alas, the assumption is that you know you&#x27;ll be cut off from transferring* bits of information from your brain to other brains. As humans are very social, this is almost useless. In actual world, even if you&#x27;re going solo to Mars one-way, you probably will communicate back to Earth and more colonists may come join you (think =&gt; social status). If I am sailing around the world alone, I can still expect to return and write memoirs. So the only remaining things are the most shameful i-am-never-telling-that-anyone personal secrets. And that&#x27;s quite a narrow use.<p>So, saying that Ivy League wouldn&#x27;t happen in &lt;some out-of-this-world scenario where humans do not socially interact&gt; is very impractical.<p>[*] I&#x27;m saying the theory doesn&#x27;t judge whether the signal (the information that flows) is to be trusted or untrusted. I think most commenters here wrongly conflate &quot;signalling&quot; with &quot;slightly lying&quot;.')
