Item(by='waterfowl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607887275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407825, text='I recently &quot;kondoed&quot; my books down to like ~2xx total volumes and once I had them all organized it only took me an hour or so to scan all of them into the LT iOS app. Very few wouldn&#x27;t scan but those were mostly findable by manually searching. Having an up to date list of all my books is pretty satisfying and LT seems to have a decent reputation in the serious-about-books-online community. Even inspired me to schlep into the office to catalogue my work related collection.<p>Made me realize how many booksellers(especially used) put proprietary barcode stickers on top of the &#x27;actual&#x27; barcode stickers.')
