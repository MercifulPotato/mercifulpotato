Maybe the answer lies on the other end of the pipe?<p>Could it be because large numbers of these &quot;careers&quot; don&#x27;t last beyond middle age for a multitude of reasons? Could this persistent shortage all be due to the less publicized fact that companies use up, burn out and dispose of STEM workers at an exceedingly high rate? Could it be that the career trajectory for STEM often resembles that of professional baseball with only a tiny fraction of the payout?<p>Could it be that the realistic, overall perspective on these high paying &quot;careers&quot; isn&#x27;t all rainbows and unicorns?')
