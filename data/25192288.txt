I&#x27;m sorry; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever met them, but I don&#x27;t see how this could possibly be excused, unless Apple Legal signed off on that bribe (stranger things have happened — Apple&#x27;s then General Counsel once created a backdated paper trail for a fictitious meeting of the executive team — but still find that exceedingly unlikely).')
