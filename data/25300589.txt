The first thing I look for is whether the touchpad has physical buttons.  With every clickpad I&#x27;ve ever used, the chance of &quot;misclick&quot; is too high (and that my hands can&#x27;t <i>know</i> if it thinks I clicked).  And the impact of a misclick is too problematic especially on the modern web.<p>My XPS 15 lets you choose tap-click or physical click-down of the pad, but to push the touchpad requires so much force that it&#x27;s painful.  So I have to use tap-click and it is a daily frustration.  My MBP&#x27;s touchpad is not so bad until I need to drag something, I&#x27;ve noticed I avoid interactions such as resizing that I do all the time with a mouse or a touchpad that has dedicated buttons.<p>I know I&#x27;m in the minority but I don&#x27;t even understand why we moved away from separated buttons, because I find them a <i>joy</i> to use.')
