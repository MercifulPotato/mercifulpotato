I&#x27;ve got a ton of vested RSUs that I&#x27;m sitting on because I see my company as a growth stock.  I really should sell it and buy a low ER S&amp;P500 index. We&#x27;re an S&amp;P500 stock, so I&#x27;d still retain exposure to my companies performance, but the risk would reasonable I think.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m irrationally fixated on the potential gains.  It&#x27;s doubly stupid because I have more RSUs vesting soon, so even if I sell, I&#x27;m still invested in my company.')
