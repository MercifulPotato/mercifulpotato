Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25830128], score=None, time=1611029191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829494, text='&quot;If a President shall not have been chosen before ...&quot;<p>&quot;If, by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify ...‚Äù<p>So Biden will not have been &#x27;chosen&#x27; or did not &#x27;qualify&#x27; ?<p>If the Jan 6 vote did not happen or if the results were not approved - Joe Biden was still unambiguously &#x27;chosen&#x27; by in a free and fair election by  all accounts?<p>Would the factual legitimacy of his election result in SCOTUS validating his claim to the Presidency?<p>Can the voting procedure (Act of 1887) [1] meaningfully deny the Biden his ascension to President?<p>VP Pence himself (a lawyer) indicated that he did not have the authority to stop the process.<p>It seems pretty ambiguous, and that legal scholars would be all over the place with this, no?<p>But my question was rhetorical - to illustrate that there&#x27;s a wall of legal ambiguity in that situation, enough to enable considerable populist rancour to take hold, whereupon the winner may not have enough political momentum to actually take power, irrespective of what some entity like SCOTUS says.<p>Would Democrats even remotely accept anything other that Biden as President?<p>Why would they ever submit to &#x27;Pelosi&#x27; as being President - which would be an <i>admission</i> of defeat, or even or possibly another election?<p>If the &#x27;election was rigged&#x27; - doesn&#x27;t that invalidate the entire Congress as well? Including Pelosi? And all the Senators?<p>If a free and fair election were already held in November, and it was overturned for political reasons, what would be the point of having another one, if the results can be ignored on the basis of populism?<p>It would be total chaos.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;3&#x2F;15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;3&#x2F;15</a>')
