Their prices are higher than a local hardware store but on par with other industrial suppliers. What makes McMaster amazing is the breadth of product and speed of delivery. In San Diego if I place an order for network patch cables, toilet valves, asphalt paint, and a hydraulic pump by 11am I will have it by end of business day. The site workflow is also great. Filtering is quick and easy even if you don’t know the name of what you are looking for. You can call them 24&#x2F;7 and get a human that responds. When I call I don’t give them my name or shipping address. Part numbers, quantity, and PO# and your done. It’s a 45 second phone call. I place probably 3-5 orders a day on the site and I am still blown away every single time.')
