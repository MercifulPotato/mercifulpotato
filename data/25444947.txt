Item(by='matlag', descendants=None, kids=[25446357], score=None, time=1608138164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444059, text='&gt; FB has done sketchy things in the past, but thereâ€™s so much government regulation and increased scrutiny, none of that would fly in 2020.<p>You really believe that? Because FB was caught in scandals after scandals, and never seemed to change its approach on any issue.\nAt this stage, it&#x27;s not &quot;some sketchy things&quot;, it&#x27;s a mindset at top level.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: If we were scrutinizing all large corporate the way FB is, and ask people to quit if we found anything ethically questionable, there would be no large corporate and probably a high unemployment rate.<p>But let&#x27;s keep in mind how FB &quot;behaves&quot;\n-Cambridge analytica\n-Selling users pivate messages to third party with a highly questionable excuse of users consenting\n-Threatening to leave Europe or Australia if they pass regulations FB doesn&#x27;t like<p>And what fundamental changes were made at top management to give the company a radical different orientation preventing more scandals in the future:\n-<p>But my final point will be: all of these were well reported and described in details.\nFB users cannot say &quot;we didn&#x27;t know&quot; in good faith.\nFool me once: shame on you. Fool me twice: shame on me.\nUsers have the absolute right to not give a damn, and FB has the absolute right to test the limits of acceptance. We&#x27;re not talking about a charity organization here.')
