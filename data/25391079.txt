Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607721270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390937, text='Yeah, I think any law creating restrictions should also provide protections so it&#x27;s not abused.<p>For an example on another topic, gun rights groups want a punishment in the new red flag laws for people who file false red flag claims against others so that it can&#x27;t be &quot;weaponized&quot;, as restraining orders have increasingly been used as a &quot;standard&quot; part of divorce proceedings by some lawyers (in cases without any abuse). Seems to make sense, but like most laws it doesn&#x27;t seem to get any legitimate debate because both sides are just passing laws on mostly partisan lines instead of investigating possible tweaks that would make both sides accepting (no empathy or devil&#x27;s advocate).')
