No click-bait headlines, auto-play movies, or hijacking standard browser scrolling. Images are fine if they actually help to convey useful information, but beyond that less is more. I&#x27;d also prefer to see less opinion-based content out of Google News and more factual reporting... and a lot of times I feel like these &quot;story&quot; type articles tend to cherry-pick the facts to fit into whatever narrative they are trying to tell.<p>I understand that other people might have different preferences, and I&#x27;m sure Google has a bunch of data that proves this stuff improves click-through rates and engagement. But I have been checking Google News several times a day out of habit for years now, and I think it&#x27;s time to break that habit. Much better I think to just frequent a small number of high-quality sources than to try to drink from the firehose of crap on Google News.')
