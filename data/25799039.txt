Item(by='swagasaurus-rex', descendants=None, kids=[25799277], score=None, time=1610760926, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797674, text='I find similar issues with z-index in CSS.<p>Early in a project, people stick to some heuristic, like using small z-index values like 0, 1, 2, 3... etc. But this has drawbacks because you can&#x27;t add new z-index items in between without also shifting everything with a higher z-index<p>Using z-index values with a gap is a better bet. 0, 10, 20, 30, etc. Of course, you are limited to only a few items in between the original. You&#x27;ve also lost an expectation of ordering in the values.<p>Larger gaps make more sense, as long as you don&#x27;t exceed the size of signed integers Â±2147483647.<p>The author of the post mentions how floating point has a similar problem in the amount of floating point precision you can wring out before you end up with rounding errors.<p>The true crux of the problem is one of items related to one another, in other words it&#x27;s a graph problem. I want these items to show up underneath these other items.')
