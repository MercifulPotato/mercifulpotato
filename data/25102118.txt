It&#x27;s therefore not practical for people to keep up with the news without entering an echo chamber. You would have to, for each instance of &quot;news&quot;, read at least 3 versions of it to ensure you are considering all perspectives. No one is going to do that.<p>Do people <i>want</i> to consume net unbiased news? Everyone says they do but consumption patterns says otherwise. Is it commercially viable to produce unbiased news? It used to be favorable but now distribution is cheap and there is more competition so the incentives are to be more biased and find a niche.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a solvable problem, the genie is out of the bottle. This is just a price we pay societally for having the Internet.')
