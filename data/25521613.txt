If you have a pre-existing condition and if insurance company is denying your normal insurance it tells me that the insurance market in India is highly inefficient. This like like leaving money on the table and sounds very stupid in the insurance company&#x27;s part. What I feel is happening is that insurance is often a side product for some companies which they accomplish as best effort.<p>Google&#x2F;Fitbit might actually help insurance companies gain better data and offer far more optimized products even they themselves do not have that capability. Of course individual rights to privacy etc. should be protected and government has a very legitimate role to play here. But monetization of health data would be beneficial to consumers.')
