Item(by='habosa', descendants=None, kids=[25727295, 25727311], score=None, time=1610361125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25715411, text='Here&#x27;s what I want: an always-on group audio chat app with:<p><pre><code>  * A virtual 2D &#x27;office&#x27; with positional audio\n  * Super low latency (~10ms)\n  * Minimal data&#x2F;power&#x2F;CPU usage\n</code></pre>\nThis would simulate what it feels like to be in an open office (when they work well). I can hear interesting things going on around me but because the audio is in 3D space I can pretty much filter it without thinking. If I say &quot;hey has anyone gotten this error before?&quot; the context clues of my volume and position make it clear to others who I am talking to.<p>I actually started building this last year but then the pandemic hit and I figured someone would beat me to it now that there&#x27;s infinite VC money flowing into team chat. Still nothing!')
