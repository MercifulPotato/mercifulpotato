At that point, the ecosystem was a bit more mature for Haskell.  More libraries, better editor support, etc.<p>In some platonic sense I like small languages, but I had come to appreciated all the extra comfort Haskell provides.  OCaml was just too much in the uncanny valley of being almost Haskell, but then missing some nice-to-haves.  I might grumble, but OCaml is a pure pleasure compared to C++.<p>Btw, they finally added (optional) stacktraces to Haskell a few years ago.<p>About all the language extensions in Haskell: I like them, but they can be overwhelming.  Luckily, the language extensions your libraries use has almost never any bearing on what language extensions your client code uses.<p>So you can ignore the extensions, and still use your favourite libraries.')
