The non-touchbar 13&quot; MBP has always had only 2 ports, as has the Air.<p>They added the touchbar to the &#x27;low end&#x27; 13&quot; MBP but it just happens to have better performance than the Intel 13&quot; MBP because the Intel one hasn&#x27;t been replaced yet - it&#x27;s still the &quot;low end&quot; model.<p>The only one I&#x27;m missing is the Mini -- I&#x27;m not sure how many TB ports it had in the past or has now.')
