Unless China messes around with rivers that originate in Tibet that is.<p>Possibly my biggest worry is water - providing water for 1bn+ people (and agriculture, and industries) is going to get harder and harder. I&#x27;m a techno optimist, so I&#x27;m hoping some variant of desalination tech will pull through if things get really bad.<p>The other big worry as you say is the heat waves. If we do get emissions under control, I think we&#x27;ll also end up doing some form of carbon scrubbing and don&#x27;t just sit around in a 2C warmer world. None of our current climate engineering approaches are enough to arrest global warming by themselves but I&#x27;m hoping we can eventually control the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.')
