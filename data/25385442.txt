The screenshot feature is nice and it seems to be a little less flakey, although E2E tests using a browser are always going to be more prone to flakiness than unit tests.<p>This last project we’ve actually been running true E2E tests by spinning up the backend in GH actions (looking for a branch with the same name or falling back to master), seeding it, and making snapshot-style assertions about the UI. It’s more complex and slower but tests a lot more code now that the backend is involved as well as the API layer. It has helped a lot in major refactors.')
