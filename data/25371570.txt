I also seriously doubt any competitor will ever outdo them, due to the nature of their monopoly.<p>I did not vote for the people at Youtube to control anyones election. Even if what they are doing now is good, this kind of control over media and information will be used for catastrophic consquences in the future.<p>When the political climate swings from it&#x27;s current position to another, the people in control at Youtube are going to have a very hard case to make in court at what they are doing right now.')
