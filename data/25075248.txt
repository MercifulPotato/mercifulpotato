Nobody is forcing you to live in California, you could sell your house and get a different job and a different social cohort and move to Florida. Nobody is forcing you to use an iPhone, you could sell your phone and replace all your apps and convince everyone you know to switch away from iMessage.<p>&gt; where you are forced to abide by its laws and pay its taxes.<p>How are you distinguishing the app store rules and fees from laws and taxes?<p>&gt; Walmart is the biggest store in town, but you do have alternatives and nobody is forcing you to shop there, even if it&#x27;s kind of hard not to.<p>Walmart doesn&#x27;t own all the real estate for a hundred miles and then prohibit anyone else from building a store that people who shop at Walmart could reasonably patronize. They don&#x27;t condition your use of their store on buying their car, which in turn refuses to let you drive to any other store, so that if you want&#x2F;need any product from Walmart you have to get every product from there.<p>&gt; Their markup? Pretty similar to Apple&#x27;s fee, roughly 25%.<p>For a brick and mortar store which is paying for local real estate, physical inventory and human cashiers, none of which Apple does and yet they&#x27;re still charging higher fees.')
