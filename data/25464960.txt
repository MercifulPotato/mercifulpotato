It was solving a problem people just <i>didn&#x27;t really have</i>. I mean, yes, it <i>did</i> both simplify and improve the situation for this sort of document flow kind of thing but we were all using tables for a reason:<p>Because what people <i>needed</i> was a mechanism to describe <i>structured layout</i>. Inside that, document flow is important, but we spent 20+ years just getting back to the structural power of tables and it&#x27;s fucking ridiculous.<p>And it did it all in a way that <i>required</i> the exact constraint solving complexity you&#x27;re lamenting. But it didn&#x27;t really have to be that way.<p>CSS was a disaster and has almost certainly wasted incredible amounts of time and money that could have been better spent if a better solution had come along in time.')
