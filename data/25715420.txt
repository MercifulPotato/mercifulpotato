Item(by='rleigh', descendants=None, kids=[25715557], score=None, time=1610291900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25715191, text='That would be a terrible idea.<p>In times gone by, that would have prevented people spreading information about the world being a sphere and orbiting the sun.  The flat earthers and proponents of the earth being the centre of the universe would have suppressed Copernicus&#x27; and Kepler&#x27;s discoveries of heliocentrism and elliptical orbits.<p>New ideas displace old ideas all the time, and that displacement can only occur if there is both a rational evidence-based reason for displacing it and there is the opportunity to do so.  To suppress an idea is to remove opportunity for discussion and to entrench the established viewpoint irrespective of its merits.  It&#x27;s the very antithesis of modern liberal thought.<p>Suppression of ideas also conversely prevents the objective discussion of bad ideas and dismissing them.  Too much conversation in the present days is not grounded in objectivity, and this lets bad ideas fester.  Open and fair minded discussion is a basic requirement for living in a free society.<p>There is a disturbing tendency to wish to suppress discussion of &quot;sensitive&quot; or &quot;controversial&quot; topics in recent years.  That is a path which will lead to tyranny.  Because it boils down to other people telling us what we are and are not allowed to say, think and do.  This would not be a fair or free society.')
