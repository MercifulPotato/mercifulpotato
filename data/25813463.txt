They&#x27;ve been working on a building site 2000km away for months. He and his helper have been uploading pics and video every day. They also use the chat now and then. I&#x27;ve shared pdf documents with them too.<p>Mind you, they were used to Whatsapp, so I had to nudge them into downloading yet another app and explain. As their client, I had the necessary leverage, so they did install Element (well, riot at the time). These are people who don&#x27;t speak a word of English, from a remote countryside village, and totally unfamiliar with computery stuff, and they managed.<p>Thank you for helping to make that possible!')
