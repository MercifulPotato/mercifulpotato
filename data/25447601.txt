Are there any good tutorials? Is it possible to &quot;lockdown&quot; the Google Chrome engine in our electron apps so that future chrome changes don&#x27;t break our apps? What is the process of developing - how do we launch our apps, compile our apps, change them and re launch?<p>I&#x27;m such a newbie in this space, any help would be much appreciated.<p>I really believe in the power of Electron -- even though it can be bloated, it lets us use the power of web browsers in our development. It also makes it easier to transition to a full blown web app later down the track. To me, its amazing :)')
