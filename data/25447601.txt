Are there any good tutorials? Is it possible to &quot;lockdown&quot; the Google Chrome engine in our electron apps so that future chrome changes don&#x27;t break our apps? What is the process of developing - how do we launch our apps, compile our apps, change them and re launch?<p>I&#x27;m such a newbie in this space, any help would be much appreciated.')
