OR, alternatively, changing to a public sector provision model like plumbing or roads.<p>What actually bothers me the most is the rules that (in most places) prohibit cities and towns from offering new municipal broadband service as a competitive offering. This used to be more common in smaller towns that had not been able to get good commercial service, and it adds valuable options and competition, but my understanding is that it&#x27;s extremely hard for cities who don&#x27;t already have municipal broadband to start offering it now.')
