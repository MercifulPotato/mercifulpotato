You only have to look back a short time and there was no such thing as &quot;child care&quot;. The children were cared for by their mothers. Imagine that! A mother having time to raise her own children! Now they are &quot;free&quot; to be drones in the corporate machine instead and can&#x27;t get out because the family needs that money. The children now get the privilege of being raised in a child care farm instead of by loving family. Oh, and nobody has time to cook or clean any more so it&#x27;s ready meals and takeaways every night. What progress...')
