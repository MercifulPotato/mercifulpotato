If the key derived from entangled particles is bad, and communication does not work with the observed key, you know for sure the particle collapsed pre-entanglement and you resync. There is no way to tell without comparing communication whether or not your observation collapsed the key.<p>Most of the engineering effort is preserving the entanglement for farther travel from the source of entanglement.')
