If the key derived from entangled particles is bad, and communication does not work with the observed key, you know with high probability the particle collapsed pre-entanglement, and and you resync to agree on a new key. There is no way to tell without comparing (classical) communication whether or not your observation collapsed the key.<p>Most of the engineering effort is preserving the entanglement for farther travel from the source of entanglement.<p>Note: I&#x27;m using &quot;key&quot; here because it&#x27;s presumed the shared state would refer to an encryption key, but you could use it for other types of communication (eg agreeing on a novel primary key for some common database).')
