Part a sounds ok, but sounds more political than practical.<p>I don&#x27;t like requiring proof that a person knowingly broke a regulation to criminally charge them. I can think of a few examples where that would have been good. But I think generally the US doesn&#x27;t prosecute large scale violations enough. Deep Water Horizon, the Flint water crisis, the housing crisis, and the Volvo emissions scandal are all examples where almost no one went to jail. This seems like it would cripple environmental protection and make corporate legal defense much easier.<p>It might have some benefit for small businesses. But it doesn&#x27;t protect against heavy fines. And my current assumption is agencies are already not likely to settle with criminal charges.')
