I think a can-do attitude is something one should have within oneself, but it is something completely different from the emotions a person emits to the outside world.<p>Having a critical but positive look at the world is most likely very healthy, in the spirit of &#x27;Change what you can and accept what you can not&#x27;. Constantly emitting a positive image, on the other hand, leads to the problems described in the article. But the problem is not the positivity, but the need to express it even it is not coming from within.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid, to share your true feelings, but try to view the world in a balanced way (now I was preachy myself...).')
