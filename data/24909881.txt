A recent example is the wrong mapping of the Starliner thrusters. This wasnâ€™t found until the simulator changed due to brownouts after it was already in orbit. Just by luck, the new simulator was of sufficient fidelity to catch the mapping error.<p>Had 1) they not missed the correct orbit due to a different issue and 2) not had to switch simulators it could have potentially collided with the space station.<p>So yes, the requirements are there but often not followed but luck was on our side')
