Having one driving around your home town sends the message that you live in a war zone, and guess what - you, the citizen, are the enemy.<p>Even if they are reserved for &quot;gang shootouts or riots&quot; you are wasting  money in the 95% of US towns that don&#x27;t have gang shootouts or riots on such a regular basis that police need to engage in military operations to contain them. So I&#x27;m outraged as a taxpayer to see my money being wasted.')
