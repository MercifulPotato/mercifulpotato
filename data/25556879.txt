They have competent programmers.<p>Those wages would have gone up  if the Latvians didn’t figure out this niche existed.<p>So many developing countries have and incredible about of opportunity in front of them just copying what the US did and our pays lots for. If I was born in any of them I’d look around at what the developed countries had that works without the usual awful gov meddling and do a top end offering of it for my country.<p>The great thing about programming is you can really think of anything and just do it (like wise with entrepreneurship). If you want to make money either exploit existing obvious underserved markets or build a new one with actual value creation people pay for.<p>The suckers in developing countries sit around waiting for their gov to figure everything out for them. They’ll be waiting their whole life until gov agencies catch on to value creation opportunities.<p>It’s always those who go out to look for it. Small businesses and whatnot used to be the for new immigrants to North America and largely is.  But too much of the existing population forgot that and blame the past generations or gov or their culture pushing  useless degrees instead of going out and trying to find opportunities themselves.')
