It&#x27;s really subpart and does not help users to get a clear idea of how some basic features work, neither do they present examples of how Cmake is designed to be used.<p>I feel cmake&#x27;s appalling docs are the main reason why so many Cmake projects are god-awful messes that even fail to try to follow the &quot;modern Cmake&quot; conventions which is modern in name only as it&#x27;s already made available since the inception of Cmake 3.')
