If you&#x27;re ranking the size of groups, the result heavily depends on how you define the groups. That &quot;4th largest&quot; makes no sense because the 3 above it aren&#x27;t broken down the same way and should really be split into 5 groups for consistency. Then there&#x27;s the fact that the USA is the 3rd largest country by population so it should be weighted by population. It&#x27;s a complete fail of a statistic obviously designed to shock without informing.')
