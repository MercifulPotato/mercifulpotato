So in that sense you&#x27;re right that the question is a tradeoff of x% of performance (which may never be a problem) but with added complexity vs ULID which is simple&#x2F;elegant and signifcantly less cognitive overhead (easier to maintain) but will cause bigger indexes vs bigint. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.. and your post has me thinking again that realistically the maintainability and agility that ULID provides may actually be better than a potentially error-prone but x% more performant instagram-like bigint generator. I just don&#x27;t know enough to properly compare the two, so I suspect opting for the easier cognitive load &#x2F; maintainability &#x2F; agility is best.')
