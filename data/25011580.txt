Using the language &quot;tech debt&quot; makes it appear that there is a correct way to design something and that if you&#x27;re not doing it that way, you will need to pay a debt on it, now or later.<p>The reality is it&#x27;s all trade-offs and sometimes those debts never need to be paid at all. &quot;Bad code&quot; that is reliable within the constraints it is exercised and that is isolated may appear to have to tech debt, as in &quot;if we changed the design, we <i>could</i> support XYZ feature&quot; but if XYZ feature never materializes, it&#x27;s a waste of time to touch it.<p>Maybe we can come up with more appropriate language for this? Something akin to &quot;inflexible&quot; code. Calling something &quot;debt&quot; assigns too much subjective value to it while making it seem objective.')
