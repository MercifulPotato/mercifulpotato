Item(by='sbierwagen', descendants=None, kids=[25950047], score=None, time=1611800474, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928129, text='&gt;I need to finally read the Culture books.<p>Beware. There is significant variation in quality between Culture novels, and there is substantial disagreement between fans on which novels are good and which are bad.<p>I read Consider Phlebas first, and liked it. (Kind of a gritty Hitchhikers Guide) Player of Games was okay. I found the ending of Use of Weapons to be obnoxious in the extreme. And after I read Hydrogen Sonata I resolved to never read another Banks novel.<p>Side note: basically every novel takes place on the edges of the Culture. (A story requires conflict, and there can&#x27;t be conflict in utopia) If you want to read <i>about</i> the Culture, then you&#x27;re better off reading its fandom wiki.')
