I keep feeling like I&#x27;m missing something. I don&#x27;t understand why the puzzles are on their own page, let alone their own domain, so if I&#x27;m in a section and I want to do a puzzle I need to click back to the main site, click on the puzzle, then find the equivalent chapter heading, and then dive into a puzzle.')
