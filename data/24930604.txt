If there&#x27;s no Code of Conduct, some bad actor will take advantage of the ambiguity to do things they know make other people uncomfortable, just because they can.  If there&#x27;s an overly broad Code of Conduct, or one which doesn&#x27;t protect the rights of the &quot;accused&quot; (either in how it&#x27;s written or how it&#x27;s enforced), then other bad actors will take advantage of it to exert power.<p>That&#x27;s why laws have to be written &quot;defensively&quot;, like code exposed to the open internet.  You have to try to anticipate exploits by bad actors ahead of time; and fix the ones you didn&#x27;t spot as they&#x27;re exploited.')
