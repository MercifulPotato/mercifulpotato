However, during this period, researchers saw that fluctuations in the free oxygen concentration were interpreted at the cellular level as a lack of oxygen – rather than interpreting the absolute level of oxygen.<p>&gt; In other words, repeated intermittent hyperoxic (increased oxygen level) exposures induced many of the mediators and cellular mechanisms that are usually induced during hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) – something Efrati explained is called the hyperoxic-hypoxic paradox.\n“The oxygen fluctuation we generated is what is important,” he told The Jerusalem Post. “During this process, a state of oxygen shortage resulted, which caused cell regeneration.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;health-science&#x2F;israeli-scientists-say-they-found-a-way-to-reverse-the-human-aging-process-649798" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;health-science&#x2F;israeli-scientists-say-...</a>')
