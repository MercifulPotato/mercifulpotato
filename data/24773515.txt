Here the quality of the school has more to do with the education of the patients and the general &quot;proper raising&quot; approach.<p>Take Versailles for instance. The best school there attracts peuple from vastly different backgrounds and wealth. This is not a discriminant but rather how parents educate their children.<p>Private schools have a payement system that takes into account the revenue of parents.<p>Sure,you can buy your way to education but you will never hit the best (or even good) schools.<p>Then you have the worse neighborhoods, the problem there is a lack of interest or time of the parents rather than money on schools (they get more than the affluent neighborhood ones, take the north of Paris as an example and look at their infrastructures vs the ones in, say, Versailles).')
