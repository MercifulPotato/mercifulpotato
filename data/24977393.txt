In fact in Europe the affluent pretty much always move into cities, not out of them, even though those cities also have a lot of the issues surrounding urbanisation. Melting pots and culture clashes, immigration, crime, it&#x27;s universal to most cities. Pretty much the same in most Asian countries as well, the affluent and poor coinhabit cities. White flight and the giant suburb sprawl is pretty uniquely American.<p>Even in a place like England, which is traditionally very classist, you don&#x27;t see the kind of segregation in schooling or housing you have in the US, and London is not super-safe either.
