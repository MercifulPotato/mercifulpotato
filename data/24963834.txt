Did or did not Stalin take a feudal, agrarian nation and turn it into an industrial power in less than 50 years?  Well, yes.  Sputnik, 1957 is my citation.  Did he do a lot of bad things?  Hell yes.  Did he do a lot of bad things in the process of industrializing the USSR?  Again, yes, but you have to weigh that against the good that was done.  All of that is within epsilon of what I literally wrote in my comment.<p>I submit that it looks like it is you who is being intellectually lazy, and using &quot;scary genocidal mustache man bad&quot; level reasoning, unless you&#x27;d like to explain yourself.<p>Please note I never said genocide was justifiable.  I&#x27;ve merely stated that Stalin did a thing which had some good effects for the Soviet people.  And, yet, here you are deliberately misreading my original comment in bad faith, and all but saying &quot;scary genocidal mustache man bad.&quot;')
