Load up vans with storage capacity and drive to peoples homes. And deliver the vaccines.<p>Mobile medical vans are not uncommon in Africa and Asia and India. This is how they get billions of people vaccinated.<p>Surely I can’t be the only person who thought of it. Either it is not practical(I don’t buy it) or there is some other reason why there is so much inefficiency even in CA where everything is ready for vaccination roll out.<p>If developing nations can do it..why are we lagging behind in California??')
