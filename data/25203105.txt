Looking at entities considered &quot;masterminds&quot;, what I often find is ... some intelligence, yes, but <i>a lot</i> of shielding from, or disregard of, risk.<p>Impunity is actual <i>or believed</i> freedom from consequence.<p>There are a few categories:<p>- The proficient:  extremely good at their game.  Effective, so long as it works.  Covert.<p>- The well-protected -- friends in high places.  State actors and their contractors, generally.  Often under diplomatic covered.  &quot;Too big to jail&quot; and politically-conneccted (Brock &#x27;Stanford Rapist&quot; Turner <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;us&#x2F;brock-turner-release-jail&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;us&#x2F;brock-turner-release-jail&#x2F;...</a>) The Mossad team assassinating Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Assassination_of_Mahmoud_Al-Mabhouh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Assassination_of_Mahmoud_Al-Ma...</a>) (though most of the team were effectively burnt). May include some non-state actors:  warlords, terrorists, narcotics gangs, though most of these fall below.  Covert, but can retreat quickly to safety, or are at low risk if caught.<p>- The brazen.  Operations with overwhelming force, whether shown or used.  Military campaigns, many criminal organisations, warlords, militias. Overt.<p>- The uncaring:  those who have no care whether they live or die.  Most suicide attacks, 9&#x2F;11 bombers, the original &quot;hashīshīn&quot;, etc. 2008 Mumbai attacks.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2008_Mumbai_attacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2008_Mumbai_attacks</a>   Overt or covert.<p>- The ignorant:  Simply unaware of the risks.  Child soldiers, the Boxers (China), &quot;wrong way &#x27;round&quot; Pan Am flight 18602 landing at Surabaya, Dutch East Indies, unknown to the pilot, in a heavily-mined harbour.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;lapsed-historian&#x2F;the-long-way-round-part-2-dff698a18a60?source=---------35------------------" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;lapsed-historian&#x2F;the-long-way-round-part-...</a><p>- The expendable.  Assets who need  only be used once, whether burnt (retired) or killed afterwards.  This includes a segment of the consulting or management workforce, who have a certain ablative funtion.

Signals intelligence relied not so much on exceptional decryption capabilities, but on the widespread use of a backdoored technology.  The strong focus of US intelligence policy on similarly backdooring networking hardware (Cisco), telecoms switches (Greece), computing hardware, operating systems, and softwaare, speaks to the probable usefulness of this method. \nIt&#x27;s not OpSec but influence and immunity that enables this.<p>Update:  Parent&#x27;s question, if brief, was entirely fair.  Which is why I answered it.')
