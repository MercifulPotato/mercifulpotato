You will only know that once the ball is observed it will have a certain color.<p>The only way I can foresee this being used to transmit data faster than light is that if you both agree to perform an action depending on what color ball they see. If you both view the ball at some agreed point in the distant future, you will instantly know what action the other person will do.')
