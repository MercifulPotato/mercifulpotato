Most people will follow the rules, so simply closing the borders will get you most of the way there.<p>The issue is not whether it&#x27;s possible - it is - it&#x27;s whether the cost of doing so is too high. It&#x27;s a fair consideration to make, but it should be clear that that&#x27;s the consideration being made, rather than pretending that only island nations have this option.')
