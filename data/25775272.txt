Item(by='Jochim', descendants=None, kids=[25775699], score=None, time=1610624980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775089, text='&gt; That&#x27;s not a strong argument at all.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a strong argument either, I just think it&#x27;s slightly stronger than the one people are trying to use for why AWS should be forced to host Parler.<p>&gt; Spouting death threats gets you arrested if you do it in public (and someone records it or calls the cops), so it should also lead to a time-limited or permanent ban from social networks.<p>The argument from people coming out against the moderation of these threats seems to be that FB&#x2F;Twitter etc. should only remove this content after receiving some sort of court order&#x2F;government mandate to do so, that they shouldn&#x27;t &quot;play cop&quot; as it were. Personally this seems like a pretty stupid take.<p>&gt; Social networks are not a free-for-all zone.<p>Some people are arguing that the should be, that they should be treated as the equivalent of a modern town square. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with this take, but I can see why people might think that way.')
