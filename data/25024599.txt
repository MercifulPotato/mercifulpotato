Yes, having almost seventy million people vote for 45 is alarming but we don&#x27;t have any option but to dig in because it is clear that the right is not digging in. They are stuck in a perpetual tracter control beam right as to speak.<p>I know what the counter argument will likely be: you have to be in power to be able to do anything at all but this appeal to moderation is what I&#x27;d argue has allowed the right to go to the extreme right: the overton window.<p>The whole premise of &quot;both sides&quot; is flawed here. Of course, it is silly to think 45 is a monster and things will be good once he is no longer in the picture. However, it is just as silly to think that just because seventy million people voted a certain way that their grievances are legitimate. They are not. And as long as we coddle them with &quot;both sides&quot;, we can&#x27;t begin the work we need to do to to undo all the lunacy of the last four years.<p>The will of the majority is incredibly overrated. Just because a large group of people believes something does not make it true. Often, you need to teach people and help them understand. We have to understand that we can&#x27;t default to a middle ground approach because there is no end to this spectrum: the right continues on its march right and if we continue reaching for the middle we will be where they were n - 1 time ago.<p>I can get behind one thing though: we have to be grateful to the 45 administration because he has exposed some serious systemic flaws that we must address if we are to avoid a repeat of the last four years.<p>Edit: spelling')
