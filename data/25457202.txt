Writing NLP code with  non-ML methods, to the same level of quality, would be essentially impossible without an operation on the scale of warfare.<p>Even with the efficiency benefits that it already has, we all know ML still stands to be further optimized, and a lot of people are working on it.<p>Comparing the exponential increase of &quot;intelligence&quot; of computers versus our own, computers will be as smart as humans with similar energy efficiency in around 50 years, and they require no cars, food, etc. It will be hard to criticize the efficiency of ML when it is already moreso than our biological selves, but it will be done, and we will be wholly outsmarted.')
