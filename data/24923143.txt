There are plenty of ways to attain success and happiness.&quot;<p>- You meant to say &quot;early stage&quot; and of course there are many ways to attain success and happiness. That&#x27;s why we allow people to make their own choices, elect their own representatives, and speak freely. We don&#x27;t force them into accepting one single system, like they do in China. In America, we believe humans have inalienable rights that the government has no authority to usurp. The government exists subserviently to protect our rights to pursue happiness as we see fit, provided we don&#x27;t infringe on the rights of others. If you want to go live in a communist community within a free society, you&#x27;re more than welcome to share your income with a group of people. What you have in China is totalitarianism &#x2F; authoritarianism, which we believe is axiomatically immoral, as it removes option for people to decide on their own, it removes the inalienable rights that all humans naturally have at birth. Don&#x27;t you agree that you own your physical body, and you own the fruits of your labor? Don&#x27;t you think you have the right to express criticism against leaders? What gives them the authority to restrict your ability to speak? I would love to hear why you think restricting freedom can (even in theory) lead to greater happiness. Thank you!')
