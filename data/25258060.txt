All I heard growing up was &quot;go to post-secondary.&quot; Zero concern for what the actual degree would be. Any degree would do.<p>Now, I&#x27;m a big believer in education and post-secondary. 100%. The top earners across the board are more educated than the lower half.<p>BUT: It depends on the degree. So many of my friends are still paying for degrees that went nowhere, and I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.<p>I&#x27;ve got 4 kids and my message to them is to keep their options open, figure out what kind of work they want to do for the rest of their lives, and get the right education for that. If they want to be an engineer, fantastic. University it is. But so many degrees lead to poor job prospects or low wages that do not in any way justify the cost. It&#x27;s crazy town.<p>If the type of work you want to do doesn&#x27;t pay especially well, that&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s more to life than money. But don&#x27;t go into debt over it.')
