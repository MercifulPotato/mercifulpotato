To anyone reading this; if you believe everyone not in your bucket is in the other bucket, and there are <i>only</i> two buckets.. I would caution you to step back and consider:<p>1.) Everyone not in your bucket is NOT in the other bucket<p>2.) Everyone not in the other bucket is NOT in your bucket<p>Your arguments just appear to be a bunch of straw men to me. I can&#x27;t identify a single one of those as mainstream viewpoints. Nobody I know who voted against Trump holds them. I&#x27;m personally a &quot;liberal&quot; that owns guns and am against bans an buybacks.<p>People, please, be warry of people trying to convince you there is a binary set of beliefs and it&#x27;s all-or-nothing.')
