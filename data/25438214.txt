And, children may well enjoy sharing the experience of parenthood with their parents, so the premature loss of one life can hurt many people.<p>Your whole take is based on a bunch of assumptions that everyone is miserable towards the end of their lives, that children and community feel no loss when elders die, and that just is not true. Life takes on a different meaning as we grow, and no age is of less worth.')
