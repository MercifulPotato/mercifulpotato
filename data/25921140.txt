We’ll have 20+ YC startups that are looking for sales people, marketing experts, growth specialists and operators, among others.<p>The need for go-to-market experts is becoming more and more critical to the success of YC startups. Many are seeing rapid growth and product adoption, and need early business people to setup and run new functions like sales or marketing. Others are fundamentally operational (like Instacart or DoorDash), and your help operationalizing large teams of contractors, vendors or creators. Here are a few of the companies presenting:<p>- Whatnot (W20) started as a live-auction marketplace for Funko items, and is looking for partnerships people to enter adjacent markets like trading cards, Pokemon and comics.<p>- Welcome (W20) offers a virtual event platform that has been used by Salesforce, Oracle and Okta, and needs sales people to drive revenue &amp; adoption.<p>- OneSignal (S11) offers developers a simple API for push notifications, and is looking to scale with an experienced partnership manager.<p>At the event, founders will share a quick pitch about their company and open roles, followed by a virtual expo hall to meet with people 1-1, where you can learn more. We’ve also prepped founders to have their teams ready for light interviews — something that attendees of past events have asked for.<p>You don’t need years of experience to work at a startup. You do need a do-what-it-takes mindset to solve problems and help scale the business. You’ll also need to learn faster and be willing to adapt as you learn, especially as some of startups are in emergent industries or domains.<p>If you’re considering something new — or even if you’re just curious to know what’s out there — apply to join YC and our founders for a great evening of pitches and networking:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;2020-gtm-expo')
