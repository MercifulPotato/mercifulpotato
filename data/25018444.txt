That&#x27;s never what it has meant. Court packing is when you create new positions (and thus, vacancies) to fill. Filling a lot of court vacancies <i>is not court packing</i>.<p>And you know this. And Joe Biden knew this when he made the same claim in one of the debates. It&#x27;s gaslighting, and it bothers me that absolutely nobody called him out on it. Court packing is a red line that nobody should cross. I feel it&#x27;s important that we all choose our words carefully so that it continues to stay off the table.')
