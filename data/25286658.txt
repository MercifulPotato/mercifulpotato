Even if you wait a few years it could be easier to rewrite from scratch than fix a large bug.<p>Btw, people bring up a features vs. speed tradeoff here and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true - in my experience perf issues come from stupid random bugs more often than they&#x27;re fundamental parts of new features.
