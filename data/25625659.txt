A few others have pointed this out, but to restate: in our situation, compression was costing us almost nothing.<p>60TB of logs was 60 days worth of retention, so 1TB a day. That means we process about 11MB&#x2F;s on average, peaking at 100MB&#x2F;s.<p>A single CPU core can manage 100MB&#x2F;s of compression, so if you assume we compress and decompress in multiple places, let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re paying about 4 CPU cores constantly for this.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty worse case scenario, and it would cost us $37.50&#x2F;month on GCP for those cores, in order to save about 100x that amount.<p>The takeaway (for me at least) is that compressing an in-flight transfer is almost always worthwhile if you&#x27;re working in the cloud and the transfer will eventually be stored somewhere. The economics of CPU vs the total amount of data storage cost is a no brainer.<p>Hope that makes sense!')
