I feel like we could do better by adding some modifier that differentiates removing &quot;undesirables&quot; and terminating pregnancy which is likely to result in death or low quality life under constant care. Otherwise talking about eugenics in general becomes a bit silly. In the same way we have different words for murder and euthanasia.<p>Bunching those together only seems to empower religious extremists who want to prevent any kind of abortion.
