This is unprecedented. The largest transfer of wealth program continues on and we continue to have a 9&#x2F;11 worth of deaths at an alarmingly increasing frequency. Unemployment is high, food lines are staggeringly long, small businesses are cracking, and we don&#x27;t support people to stay home: more stimulus money going directly to the lower socioeconomic classes is absolutely needed to help them stay home and stay safe.<p>So the markets are totally decoupled from the economy. Reality is gonna hit that someday and then, only then, will we see the panic go through Congress once again as they pass all kinds of amazing bills that while they do in the name of helping the little guy, it mostly provides protection to all these zombie corporations that need another dose of easy money to stay alive. So we throw away all this capital and keep the transfer wealth program alive that sucks the future out of the younger generations to keep the shareholders happy.<p>Socialize the losses, privatize the profits. It feels like we&#x27;re about to reach a tipping point. The number of scammers, grifters, conmen is too damn high, even the president is one. What&#x27;s happening?')
