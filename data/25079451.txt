I&#x27;m not talking playing games (they actually work well), just having a desktop with a browser and editor running at 4K. Ive tried Gnome, XFCE and Plasma on Wayland and X11 and they are all the same. The desktop feels slower, but strangely running tests (backend TypeScript and Scala) is noticeably much slower.<p>- Multiple monitors mostly works, but it&#x27;s not always plug and play. Sometimes when I plug in an external monitor it doesn&#x27;t always switch to it, so I have to set it up manually. Other times it just doesn&#x27;t detect the monitor so I need to reboot. See note above about testing different DEs.<p>- Bluetooth audio mostly works (including LDAC) but the sound system often gets confused about which output device should be used. Sometimes Bluetooth audio connects, but it still defaults to the speakers. Sometimes the volume control turns down the Bluetooth audio, but turns up the speakers. See note above about testing different DEs.<p>- Suspend&#x2F;resume mostly works, but sometimes it has the same issues as when connecting monitors. Sometimes when I resume I get a black screen, but if I go to a virtual terminal I can restart X11 and everything works. Other times it doesn&#x27;t without a reboot.<p>Now of course these aren&#x27;t the end of the world. I&#x27;ve been using this system and dealing with these issues for a couple of years now. The tradeoffs vs Apple privacy and better developer tooling (native Docker is so much nicer) on Linux make it worth it for me. I also have a desktop system which works perfectly, so it seems to mainly be issues with laptops (or this laptop?). But yeah compared to macOS or Windows, Linux really lacks a lot of polish.')
