Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603302098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849628, text='&gt; This view of conservative america as some kind of embattled minority is very strange to me. We own the Senate. We own the presidency. We are the majority of the Supreme court.<p>While half the country might be conservative, liberals control key junction points in the whole system. The people can send Republicans to Congress and the Presidency in a landslide, but the laws are ultimately implemented by an unelected bureaucracy, which is overwhelmingly Democrats. (Trump won just 4% of the vote in DC. He won 19% of the vote in New York City, by comparison.) Elected officials communicate with constituents through the media, 90%+ of whom donated to Clinton. Nearly every professor at Harvard identifies as a liberal: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.campusreform.org&#x2F;?ID=14469" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.campusreform.org&#x2F;?ID=14469</a>. And now, there is increasing concern that online platforms are headed in the same direction.<p>That&#x27;s a big problem, because that gives liberals tremendous control over the means conservatives use to talk to each other. When Twitter can keep people from direct messaging a New York Post article to each other, or lock the account of the duly elected administration, that correctly alarms people.')
