So I decided something much simpler: the render determines the schema. This is an important aspect that I am working on. If you choose some specific render, your JSON will have a specific shape. For example, if the render is for a landing page, the JSON could be something like &quot;about&quot;, &quot;products&quot;, &quot;team&quot;, etc. (never &lt;section&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, etc...). But it is too soon to tell I&#x27;m still thinking about it.<p>(but an interesting corollary is that the render could be also a program with the &quot;config&quot; part. It would be an alternative to website builders. Every render would be a different WB tailored for the website)<p>&gt; I&#x27;m curious how you plan to prevent your JSON format from being (ab)used for presentation purposes, where people add extra content to make the page display a certain way. And if you have a plan, is this plan feasible using HTML as well?<p>I don&#x27;t have a plan for that yet, and it will be difficult because we are accustomed to mixing data+markup. But I think the mindset is to stop thinking the website for just the browser. The website could be information first, presentation later.')
