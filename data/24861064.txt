How is it different from other tests on the market?</i><p>&quot;<i>The FDA recently granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for a new diagnostic test for COVID-19. Results from this inexpensive test are available within 15 minutes.</i><p>&quot;<i>The BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, as the test is known, detects antigen proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Unlike other diagnostic tests for COVID-19, BinaxNOW does not require a laboratory or other equipment to process or analyze the test results. This makes it portable and fast.</i><p>&quot;<i>This test is approved for use in people who are suspected of having COVID-19, and must be done within seven days of when their symptoms began....</i><p>&quot;<i>Positive test results are highly specific, meaning that if you test positive you are very likely to be infected, particularly if you are tested during the first week of infection when you are experiencing symptoms. False negatives are a bigger concern. As with other antigen tests, BinaxNOW can miss infections, producing negative test results in people who are actually infected.</i>&quot;<p>They also say, previously,<p>&quot;<i>Antibody tests can tell if someone has been infected with COVID-19. But the infected person doesn&#x27;t begin producing antibodies immediately. It can take as long as three weeks for a blood antibody test to turn positive. That&#x27;s why it is not useful as a diagnostic test for someone with new symptoms.</i>&quot;<p>So if the test is positive, you probably are infected. If it is negative, you may be infected. Presumably the reports on BinaxNOW have the actual numbers.<p>Also,<p>&quot;<i>The time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is thought to be three to 14 days, though symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure.</i><p>&quot;<i>We know that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms. Emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms....</i><p>&quot;<i>Most people with coronavirus who have symptoms will no longer be contagious by 10 days after symptoms resolve. People who test positive for the virus but never develop symptoms over the following 10 days after testing are probably no longer contagious, but again there are documented exceptions. So some experts are still recommending 14 days of isolation.</i>&quot;')
