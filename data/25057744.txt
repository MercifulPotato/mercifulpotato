I thought &quot;firmware&quot; was the code loaded internally in the hardware, and &quot;driver&quot; was the software in the OS that interacted with it (to &quot;drive&quot; it to do what it needs)? This confused me for a long timeâ€”I used to think &quot;I&#x27;ve already updated all the firmware on all of my laptop&#x27;s components, so I don&#x27;t need extra bundled firmware&quot; at some point, until I realized that&#x27;s not what they talked about at all. Any idea why they call their drivers &quot;firmware&quot;? I feel like I might not be the only person who&#x27;s been misled by this in the past.')
