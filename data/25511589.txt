Stocks go up; bread doesn&#x27;t.  If I have to buy bread, I&#x27;m not instantly worse off.  But if I own stocks, I&#x27;m instantly better off.<p>Why do stocks go up?  Because the money gets pumped into financial institutions, and from there into financial instruments.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t bread go up?  Because the number of people who own large amounts of financial instruments, and who don&#x27;t already buy as much bread as they want, is zero.<p>But this situation - they&#x27;re suddenly magically richer, and I&#x27;m not - magnifies existing wealth inequality.')
