Item(by='the_only_law', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609013005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541939, text='I have all sorts of other issues. I had a package supposed to be delivered Monday, before I would be out of town. Of course, while USPS can haul it across the country in a day, they cannot delivery it 45-min away in that same time (yes I’m being disingenuous here). At the end of the shipping Window I decided I needed to get them to hold the package because I don’t want the product to be sitting in front of my door given what I paid for it, and the replacement cost which would be at least 3X more.<p>Obviously I can’t call because they close stores and call centers prior to the end of delivery, so I tried to go online and have my package held. The website was bugged and the checkout form always posted back with no error to the cart page and I was unable to have my package held. I figured I’d call the next day, before it was delivered, but it was delivered the next morning before USPS even opens. Now I’ve had a lot of money worth of difficult to replace packages at my door and I won’t be able to get them till next week. Hope they don’t get snatched.')
