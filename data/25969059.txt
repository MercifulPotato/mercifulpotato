Except for a 2-year hiatus some 8 years ago where I got a Mac and used Mac OS.<p>I can 100% relate to your experience. It was painful. There were oddities all over the place. Some software I was used to use was simply unavailable. Package managers... oh I missed apt so much... And it was much <i>slower</i>.<p>Let alone the main compelling factor for Linux for me: that it is open source, and that I can inspect anything, even the kernel, if I need to. Surely, you occasionally need to fix some driver or configuration &quot;CLI-style&quot;, but I&#x27;m more than used with this.<p>But basically, with Linux I feel I control and own the system. With Mac is pretty much like Windows: they own you, and for the most part you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on --except that MacOS is still orders of magnitude better than Windows.')
