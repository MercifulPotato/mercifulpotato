It&#x27;s more of a gold replacement: finite supply, great malleability, but with modern benefits regarding storage and transfer.<p>This is <i>an</i> opinion that Bitcoin advocates throw out every time someone criticizes Bitcoin&#x27;s ability to be a currency. As soon as someone criticizes its ability to be an asset, someone trots out that its <i>actually</i> been a currency this whole time. It&#x27;s bad at both.<p>It&#x27;s bad at both in no small part because it tries to bring back the asset-backed currency approach, which was dreadful last time around, and that&#x27;s why it was ended.')
