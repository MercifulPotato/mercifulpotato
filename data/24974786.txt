Even if other accounts are breached&#x2F;suspended&#x2F;etc, I will still have access to this account and can recover my way down from there.<p>I&#x27;m putting all my eggs into the AWS basket here, but I&#x27;ve had a good experience with them in the past and I really can&#x27;t find any examples of people being locked out of their accounts in the same way I can with Google. And I know from experience that it&#x27;s not impossible to get in contact with a real live person when it&#x27;s required to resolve an issue.')
