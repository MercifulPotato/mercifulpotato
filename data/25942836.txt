They were pretty much always network or server related, sometimes unrelated to the business entirely (a T1 line got cut accidentally by the city in one case).<p>Those corporations didn&#x27;t want to go down, and often lost some serious money as a result. I imagine Coinbase loses out on a good amount of money every time they go down as well.<p>I also expect it&#x27;s at least somewhat overreported or only a partial outage as well. One person has an issue and announces it and everyone just repeats it without checking themselves. There was at least two instances when I saw people say Coinbase was down and I tried logging in myself and had no issues.')
