These were people that did sophisticated calculations, not just simple arithmetic.<p>While there was a decline during the initial decades of computing, that trend reversed. The fraction of women in computing peaked in the early 80s just before the PC era took off. This is fairly well known stuff you can google for sources on easily (example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerscience.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;women-in-computer-science&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerscience.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;women-in-computer-...</a>).<p>There&#x27;s no simple single factor explanation of this, but it is very clear something changed significantly during the PC era. The socialization of boys and girls surrounding home computers does appear to be one of the big factors, and it likely echoed forward by creating hostile educational environments as this cohort aged. This isn&#x27;t enough to explain the current situation completely however.')
