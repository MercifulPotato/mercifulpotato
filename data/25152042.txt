Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605807676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145039, text='&gt; The movie Jurassic Park has impressive visuals but is almost completely lacking the social commentary the book has about [bio]tech startups evading regulators and &#x27;moving fast and breaking things.&#x27;<p>I don&#x27;t see it. That&#x27;s literally the entire frame of the main plot of the movie.<p>&gt; The movie also turns the park&#x27;s operator, John Hammond, into a sympathetic character.<p>I don&#x27;t recall Hammond being sympathetic in the film in any way that he isn&#x27;t in the book, though the balance may be a little different. In both he is a mix of profiteering showman and naive optimist. The kind of warning that you seem concerned for in the book but miss in the movie (which I disagree about being absent in the latter) would work less well if Hammond was a mustache-twirling villain.')
