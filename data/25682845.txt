There is no way it wouldn&#x27;t I believe, of course in short term, we gotta worry about stuff like politics, solving hunger and world peace.</i><p>There will never be world peace, unless humanity is no longer human, or alternately, under the boot of an all encompassing empire ruled by force.<p>To believe otherwise, is to believe history teaches us nothing, nor our knowledge of human behaviour.  To assume that we somehow have a culture which &quot;can do this&quot;, that our modern beliefs are &quot;enlightened&quot; enough to allow this, is the ultimate in hubris.<p>Sure... humanity couldn&#x27;t do it before, but now?  Now, we&#x27;re just ever so enlightened and perfect enough to enable world peace.<p>There are only two real ways to enable world peace.<p>1) Genetically engineer the entire species to become more... social.  Kill or prevent any &#x27;old style&#x27; human reproducing.  End the old species.  There are innumerable issues here, including &quot;we&#x27;re just messing around with what we barely comprehend&quot;.<p>Yet our entire culture is predicated upon how the human brain works, and the human brain works more on genetics, than post-birth learning.<p>OR<p>2)  Take over the entire planet, killing everyone who disagrees with you, and ensuring that due to the technology involved there can NEVER be a revolution.  Further, destroy and hunt down every single person which does not swear fealty ; allow no external empires to form.  Ever.<p>NOTE: I am not happy about this, yet, this is reality.  Let me put this another way.<p>You want world peace?  OK!  Great!<p>First, you&#x27;ll need to end all murders, thefts, all anti-social behaviour.  &quot;World peace&quot; is denied because of the genetics that create this behaviour.  They&#x27;re the same problem.')
