Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[25281481, 25280550], score=None, time=1606937117, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279468, text='&gt; HN hates lazy comments.<p>We really don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not difficult to find plenty of hyperbole, boilerplate polemic and low-effort cynicism which gets voted up (or at least not voted down) and many comments here have no more effort or insight put into them than a joke or a meme. Most people here don&#x27;t even seem to bother reading the linked articles, they just riff on whatever they think the title is about on first glance.<p>It&#x27;s mostly elitism. Jokes and memes are associated with the commoners on Reddit and there is nothing Hacker News despises so much as being considered common.<p>It&#x27;s also particularly ironic, given how many brilliant thinkers also had great (and sometimes even puerile) senses of humor. There was plenty of humor on USENET and BBSs in the halcyon days of hacker culture that HN looks back on so fondly. Obviously humor and intellect aren&#x27;t inversely related but a lot of people here seem to believe so.')
