Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606937117, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25279468, text='&gt; HN hates lazy comments.<p>We really don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not difficult to find plenty of hyperbole, boilerplate polemic and low-effort cynicism which gets voted up (or at least not voted down) and many comments here have no more effort or insight put into them than a joke or a meme. Most people here don&#x27;t even seem to bother reading the linked articles, they just riff on whatever they think the title is about on first glance.<p>It&#x27;s mostly elitism. Jokes and memes are associated with the commoners on Reddit and there is nothing Hacker News despises so much as being considered common.')
