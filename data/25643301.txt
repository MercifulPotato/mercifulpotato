As I understand it, this is a contentious issue, and most commentators had previously expected the political offenses exception to hold. If people can now be extradited from the UK to the US for political offenses, that is a major development with extremely worrying consequences. Now that the US is treating national security reporting as espionage, if UK journalists are no longer protected by the traditional political offenses exception, they are open to prosecution in the US.')
