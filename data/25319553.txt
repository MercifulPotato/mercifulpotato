However this can be a bit too narrow and circumstantial.<p>The number one question is : is civil debate possible? And, and second, is the platform suitable for civil debate?<p>My own viewpoint is from my experience that mass moderation is not possible, or at the very least unlikely to yield results that are favorable to either the platform (say Facebook) or the user. And probably even damaging, as in your banned words example.<p>In terms of debate, one thing sticks out if youâ€™ve done a lot of philosophical debates, that people are bad at it. That is to say, you need to learn how to debate. I would think moderating can suffer from the same lack of experience. However this entirely depends on the circumstances. I am not quite sure which platform you are thinking of in the first complaint you state.')
