It&#x27;s more like a self-documenting, persistent repl, or perhaps an interactive doc.<p>I&#x27;ve used it as a way to document data exploration for later use and as an interactive teaching tool. For that, being able to plot inline and embed interactive widgets is great. Also, mixing in rendered markdown content.<p>If you&#x27;re using Jupyter to write python software and the software is the end result and not the data analysis&#x2F;process, I think you might be doing it wrong.<p>Not that I&#x27;m discounting data scientists (or the like) who use it as their primary environment. Their end result is not a packaged&#x2F;deployed software and the code itself is just ancillary. For those users, the code and environment is a tool, and the extra weight of what a full IDE (like VSCode or PyCharm) and the features they bring to the table are unnecessary and likely counter-productive.')
