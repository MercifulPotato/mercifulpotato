Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605648434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127949, text='&gt; No, I&#x27;m claiming that a document should not be treated as signed if it has not been signed. And drawing attention to (not &quot;claiming&quot;) the fact that attaching^Whaving some third party such as Google attach a piece of networking metadata to it, does not constitute signing.<p>It sounds like you think that a &quot;signed document&quot; carries some sort of significance that an &quot;unsigned document&quot; does not carry, other than the value of the signature as evidence of a contract. I&#x27;m not aware of any such significance, at least not in the context of Finnish legislation. Perhaps if we are emailing a draft of a contract back and forth, the signature on a document can be used to specify which version is the agreed-upon contract as opposed to draft. But a similar proof could be attained without a signature, for example by recording audio of a verbal agreement which specifies the agreed-upon version of the contract. The signature does not carry any special significance.<p>In any case, no, I do not think that a DKIM signature is comparable to a handwritten signature. I would rather compare DKIM signature to fingerprints on a physical document. You might say &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen this piece of paper in my life!&quot; to dispute the validity of a paper contract, but your fingerprints on that paper would constitute significant evidence against your statement. DKIM signature of an email could be used in the same fashion.')
