I mean, sure, I bet you could find people who mentioned it, but it seemed like popular opinion was on the effectiveness of masks, lockdown, etc.<p>And when asked for evidence they point to the drop...which oddly enough coincided with the season change.<p>It&#x27;s like seasonality is always brought up as a reason to fear the virus (Biden with the &quot;dark winter&quot;), but then casually dismissed when the virus recedes (you never hear &quot;bright summer&quot; - you saw that idiot lawyer with the reaper costume on the beach).<p>Cuomo was doing a victory lap, selling his bizarre posters claiming NYC figured out how to beat it and get over the hill.<p>Anyone paying attention can see the curves are seasonal and if any of these interventions worked we wouldn&#x27;t be facing another rise.')
