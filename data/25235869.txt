I made a table where you could click lines to expand them. Now, clicking a line would request the subcontent and insert it, easy-peezy. But now i want you to be able to click the line again to close. Hmm, in htmx this means that i’ll have to return a new parent line from the server as well... guess ill make a special template for that. Repeat this a few times and my backend templates were getting so many special cases that i just switched back to jQuery.<p>Perhaps i just need to learn more “htmx-like” code patterns, but they didn’t come that naturally to me.')
