The black vote is fairly united on the opinion that Democrats offer a better option for black people. That isn&#x27;t classed as &#x27;racists voting for democrats&#x27;. Ditto hispanics. It follows that whites are voting as a racial block doesn&#x27;t mean that whites are racist. And if they think Democrat policies noticeably favour blacks and hispanics then they are probably right, because that is what the blacks&#x2F;hispanics think.<p>The study is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t support &quot;they&#x27;re voting that way because they are racist&quot;.')
