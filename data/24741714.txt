There is some cost related to starting the other processes and sometimes libraries may stumble (e.g. several instances of ML libraries allocating all the GPU memory) but once it&#x27;s running it&#x27;s literally two separate processes that can do their work independently.<p>Multiprocessing could be a pain if you need to pass frames of a single video stream. Traditionally you&#x27;d need to pickle&#x2F;unpickle them to pass them between processes.')
