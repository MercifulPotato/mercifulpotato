On the other hand, this criticism isn&#x27;t new and widely known. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called out a lot, and tbh both (paraphrased) <i>other unrelated apps have problems too</i> and (unsourced) <i>people surely understand that it&#x27;s just advertising and Telegrams limitations</i> are really bad defenses.<p>EDIT: and I suspect Telegram is especially annoying because it&#x27;s otherwise really good, so if it <i>also</i> solved the security question it&#x27;d be a no-brainer recommendation.')
