The biggest eye-opener was learning that the output of some dynamical systems described by deterministic diff equations cannot be predicted because infinitesimal changes in initial conditions lead to exponential changes in the output (popularly known as chaos).  This was profound just like Godel&#x27;s Theorem - we cannot know everything.')
