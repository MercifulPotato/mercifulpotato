As individuals, the people at the top are always virtually powerless without support.<p>This is why dictators always take control of their country&#x27;s media and spin a narrative that makes them seem innocent, heroes, or victims of foreign intervention.<p>If no one had any means to hold them to account they wouldn&#x27;t bother doing any of this, nor would they bother to spy on, much less assassinate any opposition figures, and their acts would be a lot more brazen, without any attempts to disguise them or feign innocence.<p>Russia has had multiple revolutions in the last century, not to mention constant power struggles within the government itself.<p>Anyone in power in Russia is going to be keenly aware of this, and know how important it is to keep public opinion on their side and crush any opposition.')
