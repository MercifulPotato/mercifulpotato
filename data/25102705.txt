Spacemacs and Doom Emacs (my recommendation) are highly useful distributions that make a lot easier to achieve that goal.<p>But, even so, Emacs will still not be an actual IDE like those made by JetBrains.<p>You sacrifice some specificity for a world of flexibility.<p>An IDE-like Vim would be a negation of everything that Vim stands for. I don’t see any point in that.<p>If you really need an IDE, just use one.')
