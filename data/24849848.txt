You do nothing whatsoever to support that with evidence, which is itself an admission that it&#x27;s bogus.<p>That last quote is basically how the original Russia conspiracy started, BTW.  You know that we&#x27;ve untangled the citogenesis a long time ago, right?  They bootstrapped the conspiracy with the original FISA warrant against Carter Page (one of our <i>own</i> spies against Russia, who provably worked on an opp against them not too long prior), leaking some things to the media, then using the leaks themselves to bolster their claims for the FISA warrant.<p>But unlike that, which relied on anonymous leaks (since de-anonymized by Strzok &amp; co&#x27;s text messages), the drip drip drip here is of stuff like Hunter&#x27;s signature matching the form of the one from the legal papers, having recordings of him calling the repair shop for his laptop, having pictures of him with a meth pipe, etc.<p>But sure, go on and tell us how that compares to the Russian conspiracy&#x27;s anonymous leaks of unverifiable information.')
