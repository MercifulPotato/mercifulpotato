The way to bypass it is identical to what it was before.<p>But, the big change is in their issue[1] they opened about it:<p>&gt; Can I still use self-hosted map tiles?<p>&gt; Yes. Developers simply need a Mapbox account and access token to use this v2.<p>&gt;<p>&gt; Can I use data or tiles from Google Maps or other non-Mapbox services?<p>&gt; Yes. GL JS is fully interoperable with third party map sources that provide vector or raster tiles in supported formats. Usage of v2 is billed by Map Load to the Mapbox account owner. The license terms make no distinction between data sources.<p>They&#x27;re charging for Mapbox GL JS, even if you don&#x27;t actually use their tiles.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mapbox&#x2F;mapbox-gl-js&#x2F;blob&#x2F;c7ed000f6d628531e0620df9d141dd6e2237477e&#x2F;src&#x2F;util&#x2F;mapbox.js#L131" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mapbox&#x2F;mapbox-gl-js&#x2F;blob&#x2F;c7ed000f6d628531...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mapbox&#x2F;mapbox-gl-js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10162" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mapbox&#x2F;mapbox-gl-js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10162</a>')
