There aren&#x27;t endless computer magazines devoted to learning about programming the arduino and all the interesting tricks to get better graphics. Sure we have tutorials and all the information available on the internet, but arduino is niche, while commodore 64 was completely mainstream. You can definitely learn the same concepts on both, but I think it&#x27;s subjective (depending on how someone learns) which is the better platform to learn on. In fact, I&#x27;d argue to learn on both!')
