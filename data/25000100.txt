There&#x27;s no evidence that Tether is backed by anything, yet these newly minted cryptodollars are used to buy Bitcoin and thus pump up the price.<p>It&#x27;s not that different from Fed stimulus creating money that ends up being used to buy stocks and inflating prices across the market. Fed does it in the open, Tether is doing it surreptitiously. Caveat emptor.')
