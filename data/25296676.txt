If I got an emergency request to retract a published paper (note that I would have already followed all the necessary steps for publication approval internally), I&#x27;d retract it immediately, if there was a legitimate reason (you can see on retractionwatch the sorts of things that lead to retractions).  If there wasn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d ask &quot;can we pause the retraction and figure out a better solution based on data&quot;, and if the answer was &quot;no&quot;, I&#x27;d retract it immediately, but follow up with a vigorous protest.<p>Industrial researchers and non-PIs (IE, research analyst working in a PI&#x27;s lab) don&#x27;t have the same freedom and integrity rights as a PI.  To me this seems like a reasonable (and probably the only reasonable) policy for industry.<p>I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s dystopian- if a paper I wrote reached the point of needing a retraction it means some serious messup occurred or there&#x27;s a major PR fiasco.<p>Note that in this case I am not sure if there was a retraction, or an desubmission- the paper hadn&#x27;t been published yet so it&#x27;s not really a candidate for retraction.  The term for this is &#x27;withdraw submission&#x27;')
