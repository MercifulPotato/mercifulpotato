Few people dare come out under their own name and condemn the bullying behavior of Timnit, for fear of being subjected to that very bullying, which has drastic real life consequences. The letter demands to push the conversation into the public sphere, where one sided Twitter and media pressure can be fully applied. One has to be very naive and sheltered to sign such a letter.')
