(I always build my own since I&#x27;ve found neither X toolkits nor distro packagers to reliably produce a stable Emacs, but if you&#x27;re thinking about Yamamoto&#x27;s port, building your own is already on the table. Besides, it&#x27;s not any harder than building any other software, it just takes a while.)')
