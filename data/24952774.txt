It‘s mostly very slow adoption rate of new channels, so it‘s mostly lag. Additionally FB Sales internationally has been mostly horrible, so I think they just did a horrible job in their ad sales in Europe. OF course some parts of it like the split between digital and other channels is not only FB responsibility, but still... I think they are just horrible in this. I just had a client who invests Millions with Google every year and nothing with FB, there might be a good argument for let‘s say 60% Google or 90% Google but there is nor argument for 100%. So lag, less availability marketing budget on total and a stupid sales process.')
