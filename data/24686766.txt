Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601898479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686698, text='I squash, but it&#x27;s not something I do regularly.<p>In my case, it&#x27;s generally because I&#x27;m preparing training material.<p>When I do that, I have two branches: dev and master. master is the one that is exposed to students, and dev is the one I use for prepping, testing and staging.<p>Sometimes, I may even have the dev branch in a private repo, or one that is associated with a different GH ID, like so: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;24ways.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-private-on-github&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;24ways.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;keeping-parts-of-your-codebase-priva...</a><p>The main &quot;gotcha&quot; for me, is to make sure that I merge the master back into dev, after doing the squash. Makes life a lot easier, for the next squash.')
