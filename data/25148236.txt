And that was back in 2017, developing countries are growing faster, so Germany&#x27;s share probably went down.<p>Regarding Europe:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Economy_of_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Economy_of_the_European_Union</a><p>&gt; EU GDP: $18.292 trillion, $18.377 trillion GDP.<p>So Europe is 22% of the world GDP in nominal terms and 14% in PPP terms. And it&#x27;s definitely going down as a share of the world economy.<p>Germany also is only only about 20% of EU GDP in nominal terms and 24% in PPP terms. This part is also going down.<p>You&#x27;re conflating the EU with Europe. Europe has quite a few economies outside the EU: UK, Russia, Switzerland, Norway, etc. Germany is probably 12-15% of the European economy, or maybe less.')
