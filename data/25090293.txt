Now that I am a little bit wiser and much older... I don&#x27;t feel it is worth doing as most of the times I did it, I ended up putting in way more time and effort than I estimated and ended up making far less per hour than even a minimum wage job would have paid.<p>For myself, I still do. The most recent was buying a bull dozer and backhoe from an auction eventhough I had zero experience operating any heavy equipment. I should note that for the first year using these I had noone else around me and on my own land so I was not risking hurting anyone else or damaging anyone&#x27;s property other than my own.<p>I think it comes down the morality of making promises to other people and potentially not being able to fulfill them.<p>If someone asked me to do a project and after I explained that I did not currently have the skill set to do it but thought I could figure it out, and they still wanted me to take it on. Maybe I would consider it but that would be a big maybe.\nHonestly I am more the asker than the doer these days.')
