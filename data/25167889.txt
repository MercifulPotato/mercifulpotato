If you click the icon in the bar, it switches JS off&#x2F;on for the domain - using Chrome&#x27;s built-in allow&#x2F;block list for JS.<p>I honestly could not live without it. At this point I have pretty much every news and recipe site on the internet blocked. Visiting a new site, as soon as I hear my fan spinning up I reach for the &quot;no-JS&quot; button and the page suddenly becomes responsive again.<p>I&#x27;m not quite to the &quot;no JS as default&quot; level but I&#x27;m close.')
