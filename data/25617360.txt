I’m not sure what line you’re drawing exactly ... if you mean that it will take 3 or 4 years before the industry will be able to stop using CPUs for production rendering, then I totally agree with you. If you mean that it will take 3 or 4 years before industry can use GPUs for any production rendering, then that statement would be about 8 years too late. I’m pretty sure that’s not what you meant, so it’s somewhere in between there, meaning some scenes are doable on the GPU today and some aren’t. It’s worth it now in some cases, and not worth it in other cases.<p>The trend is pretty clear, though. The size of scenes than can be done on the GPU today is large and growing fast, both because of improving engineering and because of increasing GPU memory speed &amp; size. It’s just a fact that a lot of commercial work is already done on the GPU, and that most serious commercial renderers already support GPU rendering.<p>It’s fair to point out that the largest production scenes are still difficult and will remain so for a while. There are decent examples out there of what’s being done in production with GPUs already:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chaosgroup.com&#x2F;vray-gpu#showcase" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chaosgroup.com&#x2F;vray-gpu#showcase</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redshift3d.com&#x2F;gallery" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redshift3d.com&#x2F;gallery</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arnoldrenderer.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arnoldrenderer.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;</a>')
