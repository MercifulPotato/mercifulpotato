But more than once I got bitten by doing this for a feature or project where things were still very much in flux, and&#x2F;or in a prototyping phase. In those cases, starting with &#x27;NoSQL&#x27; (JSONB columns in Postgres though) would&#x27;ve saved me a lot of trouble, and it would have been much easier, relatively speaking, to migrate my data into proper tables once things solidified.<p>Still, I do find that going for &#x27;SQL&#x27; by default has usually been the better choice.')
