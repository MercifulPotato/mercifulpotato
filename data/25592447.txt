The only effect that minimum wage laws have is to render low-paying job illegal. Minimum wage stops potential employers from creating low wage jobs. That&#x27;s all they do. If unemployment rate is low enough then society doesn&#x27;t notice, but if unemployment rate is high then people just work ilegally.')
