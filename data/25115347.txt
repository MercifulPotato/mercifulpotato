This is the easier niche for me right now, but probably not the best niche.<p>I 100% agree with your second point too. My first step was <i>supposed to be</i> &quot;Choose a problem&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themvpsprint.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;choose-a-problem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themvpsprint.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;choose-a-problem</a>).
