I had a CompSci professor who had worked at Bell Labs, which was all of 10 minutes down the street from the college.  I remember he was having problems with printing something in the computer lab one week, so he wrote a driver for the printer over the weekend. This would have been about 1997 or so.  And he talked about it like it was nothing, the simplest thing in the world.<p>It looks like my professor was just taking after the people he worked with.  For that level of programmer, writing new drivers for hardware was a weekend project.<p>One of our CompSci textbooks was written by that same professor -- I just took it down off the shelf and looked at the intro.  Brian K. was thanked for being an early reader of &quot;several revisions.&quot;<p>In retrospect, it&#x27;s really cool to have been only a couple degrees away from that kind of history -- and I probably didn&#x27;t quite realize how awesome that was back then.')
