After the Pentagon Papers hit in 1971, the FBI transitioned away from bulk domestic surveillance &amp; toward law enforcement. By 1975, domestic attacks were down to a single digit percentage of 1970 levels.<p>US right wing groups have mostly dominated FBI&#x27;s terror stats since 1990 (unsure if before). I tend to omit the perps who were clearly mentally ill and FBI&#x27;s handcrafted terror plots. While that doesn&#x27;t change the numbers overly much, it does help clarify the actuality.<p>sidebar: Trying to make the case that only LW or RW stats matter seems especially dumb to me. History and reality are what they are.<p>other sidebar: It&#x27;s been a decade since FBI (literally) officially abandoned it&#x27;s law enforcement mandate, to pursue the perks that come with a national security mission.  It doesn&#x27;t seemed to have made us any safer.')
