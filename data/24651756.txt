The 32&quot; Dell and 27&quot; LG work flawlessly: usb ethernet dongle, usb ssd drives, USB audio interface, mouse and keyboard work great. They don&#x27;t even crap out on sleep&#x2F;suspend. My LG 32UD89 has been rubbish though, it needs to be powered on before the macbook wakes up or it needs a hard power cycle to detect USB-C input.<p>They are all very pricey though.')
