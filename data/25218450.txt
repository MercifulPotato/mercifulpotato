I think it might be a kind of chicken and egg. No point in thinking of products that would leverage having internet access outside your home coverage if there&#x27;s no way for them to do so. But once there&#x27;s a grid of outdoor  internet to be used, maybe there&#x27;ll be many cool products I can&#x27;t think of that get released.<p>I think this is quite experimental in that sense.<p>For now, they seem to say it could be used to find a lost dog or cat that would have a sidecar enabled collar. Or it could be used for controlling outdoor smart lights. Or to be able to check on your outdoor appliances, like say, how much gaz left in your lawnmower, etc. Things like that.<p>It caps the amount of data it can use in a month from your WiFi to 500MB and caps the bandwidth to 80Kbs.<p>Also, the neighbor thing is probably exaggerated. Basically, if you want say outdoor smart lights and your WiFi doesn&#x27;t reach. You can use existing Amazon devices as an extender, like an Echo or a Ring camera. It&#x27;ll use low frequency signals to extend it to the furthest possible (though limiting how fast it can go).<p>The only thing is, this extended network won&#x27;t be something you can set a password too and all that. Instead it&#x27;ll form a mesh with like all other extended sidecar bridges. So those of your neighbors included.')
