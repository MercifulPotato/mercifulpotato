That&#x27;s 0.91% of the population vaccinated so far (first dose). There aren&#x27;t many more doses available so distributing them to pharmacies would not accelerate the process very much if at all.  The rate at which the vaccines are being administered is getting faster all the time.  Once the vaccine starts arriving in the country in greater quantities they will start distributing them to local doctors.<p>As for making an appointment; here in Norway people will be notified by the local authority when they can get it.  Doses are being dealt out in age groups, oldest first plus those especially at risk.')
