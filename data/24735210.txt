If contacted with a comment about the grammars (as opposed to a spam missive from a head hunter), I&#x27;ll typically respond.<p>What I really need to (finally) do someday is publish my hacks that I added to byacc to increase usability (I think I called it jryacc).<p>I&#x27;ve always felt that yacc&#x27;s &quot;error reports&quot; are kindred to having a compiler error listing limited to:<p>&quot;you have 7 severe errors, 3 errors, and 23 warnings,&quot;<p>and a reference:<p><pre><code>  &quot;to understand the issues, please read the machine code.&quot;\n</code></pre>\n:-)<p>With yacc, verbose output suggests (at best) that you read the &quot;state transition diagrams&quot; &lt;ugh&gt; to make sense of &quot;n shift reduce, and m reduce-reduce conflicts.&quot;<p>jryacc provided the shortest sequence of terminals to reach any state, identifies any non-terminal that is both left and right recursive (a common malady in grammar construction, which ensures ambiguity), the shortest sequence of terminals to construct each non-terminal, etc.<p>...oh... and not to fear... I have copies of the grammars and files mentioned... so hopefully they won&#x27;t be too lost too soon.<p>Thanks again for the interesting comments.<p>Jim')
