I got a pair a year and a half ago and consider them one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for productivity at work. They fit over my behind-the-ear hearing aids, they are great for concentration when the kids are being kids, and the mic is fantastic for zoom calls. It&#x27;s also the first time I&#x27;ve seriously used a bluetooth device and the novelty of being able to seamlessly switch between music on my phone, youtube on the computer, and work calls still hasn&#x27;t worn off.')
