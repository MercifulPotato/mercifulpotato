Repeated testing and choosing (unless it is on a fresh draw) is an optimization step, you are optimizing on the test set.<p>Using a fresh draw is difficult and expensive, especially since the labels may not be available. Using A&#x2F;B is expensive, multi-armed bandits are more efficient, but again there is an optimisation element there (waits for shouting to start)<p>Additionally surely there is a really significant qualitative judgement step about any model that is going to be used to make real world decisions?')
