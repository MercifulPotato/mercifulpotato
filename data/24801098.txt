Having Hangout or Slack constantly ringing because three people want my attention at the same time is a sure way toward madness.<p>The lack of async culture also often manifests that way : a manager&#x2F;lead&#x2F;whatever sends a grossly imprecise demand as a one-liner email ; then developers ask questions about what the hell that person is talking about ; then the first person gives a few more details (the minimum amount) and concludes with &quot;can we have a call? It would be simpler&quot;.<p>I think the main problem is that many companies, while they want to try remote work as it &quot;attracts top talents&quot;, don&#x27;t have the proper culture for it, which is, ultimately, the culture of writing. Not only being able to type down the words you would have spoken, but to actually perform thinking writing - which implies to draft a few ideas, then read them, modify them, change their order, remove some, add others, and only when you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;ve nailed the issue, hit send to share it with everyone.<p>The typical non-remote employee won&#x27;t want to do that and prefer to throw vague ideas in the room so everybody contribute to making them clearer at the same time. I&#x27;m biased of course, but I think this is highly inefficient.')
