I&#x27;m also not looking for general help or a diagnosis from anyone, which people tend to do inappropriately sometimes on the internet. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been somewhat vague. I&#x27;m just looking for other people&#x27;s experiences specific to either starting a company or being a programmer. That&#x27;s not something I can really get from my therapist.')
