Recently worked with a large Java codebase spanning back more than a decade.  There&#x27;s <i>plenty</i> of mistakes that have been made.  And... there&#x27;s plenty of &#x27;language shortcomings&#x27; around Java too (go back to Java from 15 years ago, lots of shortcomings).<p>I was on a team that picked node for a project; the whole thing failed.  Should I blame it on the language, or the people who made bad choices?<p>Perhaps the issue is mostly around people&#x2F;teams that either aren&#x27;t very good or more to the point don&#x27;t have a structure in place to guide them and help them get better.')
