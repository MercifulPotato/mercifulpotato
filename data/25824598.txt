The reason I think this sounds like satire is because the post presents the &quot;there are NPM modules for doing iseven or isodd, but there&#x27;s too much dependency&quot; as the problem this is solving.<p>The ironic thing is, this service is creating a totally unnecessary &quot;dependency&quot; that&#x27;s even worse than NPM dependency hell, basically you&#x27;re relying on someone else&#x27;s centralized API (which he proudly says he&#x27;s planning to monetize) for something as trivial as checking even or odd, which I&#x27;m sure can be written in a single line of code with any programming language.<p>The &quot;iseven&quot;, &quot;isodd&quot; NPM packages were ludicrous to begin with. This &quot;solution&quot; takes it to another level. Really, this is a satire, right?')
