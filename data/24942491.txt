It&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s being squatted, especially considering the only people with that surname are directly related to me (great grandpa legally changed his last name to something made up when he left a certain criminal group) and don&#x27;t do anything with tech. I&#x27;ve been relegated to using a &lt;surname&gt;.me domain.')
