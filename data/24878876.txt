First, dangerous waste is extremely small. All of the French high-activity waste for the past 50 years is currently in one single storage pool (a cube of less than 50m).<p>Second, deep storage is safe. Oil and gas stayed safely deep in the earth crust for many millions of years. Nuclear waste has no particular reason to be so much more difficult to store.\nBuilding nuclear doesn&#x27;t preclude a very high reduction of our energy use. Fossil fuels are currently 80 to 90% of our energy. So we&#x27;re already talking of a very steep reduction ahead. Do you want to try reducing by 95 or 99%?<p>Regarding energy use, please consider that the fact that there are about 8 billions humans roaming the earth is because of high energy availability. We already face the very serious challenge of reducing drastically our energy use without making it a genocide of unimaginable proportions. I&#x27;d rather stay prudent and modest in our abilities.')
