Item(by='lefrenchy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611104776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839199, text='&gt; People hate Biden for stances he has in the past and they bring them up regularly.<p>&gt; People are thrown in prison for decades to keep them away from everyone and then theyâ€™re denied jobs on then basis that they were once a criminal.<p>These two things are related though, are they not? Biden wrote the &#x27;94 crime bill, which contributed to this criminalization. Sure it&#x27;s good that he admits he was wrong, but do we just forgive and forget? People&#x27;s lives were ruined. Considering he is accountable to the public, doesn&#x27;t it make sense this poisons people&#x27;s opinions of him for good?<p>For instance with gay marriage, Bernie Sanders was supportive of gay marriage much before Joe Biden was. Should Bernie not be credited with being ahead of the curve with this, and should it not give him more credibility that he did not flip his opinion when it became popular?<p>I think this applies even less to large orgs like the FBI where the is a lot of inertia with regards to cultural shifts')
