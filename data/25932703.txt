There is an element of intention to the exemption and it serves a specific purpose.<p>A 401k has the specific purpose of helping large businesses maintain a competitive advantage over small businesses.  If the government wanted to help individuals fund their retirement years, then there is no reason to involve employers in the tax code.  They could simply issue the same rules and contribution limits for IRAs.<p>But they don&#x27;t.  They punish you if you&#x27;re employed by an employer that doesn&#x27;t offer a 401k, by setting your contribution limit to a paltry $6k while 401k participants get tens of thousands, and your contribution limit is zero if your spouse is eligible for a 401k and your income is over a certain amount.')
