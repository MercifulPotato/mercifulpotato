They make almost no money when they sell you the car but they make all of it back from overpriced optional extras, the maintenance services you have to take at the overpriced authorized dealer and through their financing services.<p>I live in Europe and keep pondering moving to a bigger city and downsize just to give up the need of a car since the maintenance and the rest of the costs are going up faster than my pay. I can see a lot of low-middle class people getting screwed by the rising costs of car ownership long term.')
