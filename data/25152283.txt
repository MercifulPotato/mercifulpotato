However, the high resolution is only along the directions between pairs of telescopes.  Since you don&#x27;t have telescopes in all directions, there are some directions with low resolution and others with high resolution.  (In the technical parlance they talk about &quot;UV-coverage&quot; and filling the UV plane&quot;.)  This produces patterns in the Fourier domain that look like this: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aoc.nrao.edu&#x2F;~vlbacald&#x2F;idx&#x2F;snap_uv.gif" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aoc.nrao.edu&#x2F;~vlbacald&#x2F;idx&#x2F;snap_uv.gif</a>. [1]<p>As the object moves in the sky, these dots move around and sort of &quot;fill out&quot; the image in Fourier space, so you get coverage that could look like this: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aoc.nrao.edu&#x2F;~vlbacald&#x2F;idx&#x2F;lowd_uv.gif" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aoc.nrao.edu&#x2F;~vlbacald&#x2F;idx&#x2F;lowd_uv.gif</a> but it&#x27;s still not 100% full.<p>The advantage of a telescope that is a single large dish like Arecibo is that this plane is completely filled.  The resolution is more or less the same in all directions.  The main disadvantage, of course, is that it is embedded in the ground and can only look at what is directly overhead.  (They can maneuver the secondary dish to look at things a little bit away from directly overhead, but I seem to remember it only being a few degrees.)<p>[1]: See this page for those images and more details: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aoc.nrao.edu&#x2F;~vlbacald&#x2F;read.shtml" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aoc.nrao.edu&#x2F;~vlbacald&#x2F;read.shtml</a>')
