And I do my Linux-based development in Docker, remote VPS and servers, and so on.<p>But, on the other hand, I wouldn&#x27;t carry two laptops, a &quot;Linux&quot; one for running postgres and redis and gnuplot, and a Mac one for running XCode and Instruments and Photoshop, out of some principle that Mac is Mac and Linux is Linux and &quot;never the twain (use cases) shall meet&quot;.')
