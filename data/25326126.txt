I have to decide whether to open the comments or open the article. I almost always regret opening the article because i have to go back to hunt for the link to comments; even if the article turned out worthless I&#x27;m still often curious about the comments.<p>If I open comments, I have to make a second tab anyway to see any of the article, and often don&#x27;t even bother doing that, thus missing out on some content. Can we have a way to see both from one click?')
