But back to the main point - maybe look at it this way: diplomats are offered diplomatic immunity as a courtesy. Countries basically say to each other &quot;look, we&#x27;re not going to bother your representatives, if you don&#x27;t bother ours, deal?&quot;. Same reason why embassy terittory is technically out of jurisdiction of the hosting country. You could also ask &quot;how is that fair?&quot;. Well, perhaps it isn&#x27;t - but international diplomacy requires some concessions on each side, and that&#x27;s the concession we agreed on to have good relations with each other. Diplomats are not bothered, embassies are not bothered - but both can be kicked out if needed. Good arrangement if you ask me.')
