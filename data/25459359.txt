But they don&#x27;t always produce the most sensible result.  In fact different algorithms produce different diff visualizations for the same input.  I&#x27;m just a little uncomfortable with a feature that uses diffs for purposes other than display for humans, since they don&#x27;t seem to be consistently defined.')
