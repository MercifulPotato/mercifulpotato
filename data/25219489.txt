Insurance companies have list of prices for operations. If the hospitals rate is higher than their price they have negotiated only to pay their list price. On other hand if the hospital price is lower they only get that much. So logical result is that hospitals maximise their prices to always be above what insurance is willing to pay. And then they can just negotiate lower rate for someone promising to pay in cash, which could be fraction.<p>That is my understanding from Europe. From outside the logical way would be to mandate single pricing structure and ban any direct discounts.')
