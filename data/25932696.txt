Around the 0%-20% background-info ballpark. For me, my most successful MOOCs have been:<p>- CS50 at they very beginning of my career ~2015 that brought me to the fundamentals of CS and all that it can do in a very fun way.<p>- Jazz Appreciation from UTAustin (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;jazz-appreciation-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edx.org&#x2F;course&#x2F;jazz-appreciation-3</a>). I lived near a Jazz club and I often heard snippets of performances while walking by, but I felt like I needed a music background to really appreciate what I was hearing. I randomly spotted this course and I learned which eras of Jazz I like best, common themes in music, common instrument combinations, and the final project encouraged me to go listen to Jazz myself. It&#x27;s become a fun part of my life in a way that a short YouTube intro or just walking into the club wouldn&#x27;t have been able to inspire. Part of that was likely the predefined path it offered and Jeffrey Helmer&#x27;s enthusiasm for teaching the course.<p>Ultimately, MOOCs can very well be a way to procrastinate on a professional or personal level from just diving into the thing you already have the basics for. But it can just as easily be a way to open you up to something you never thought was in your wheelhouse in a structured path. Blog posts, documentation, and most YouTube videos are too static to serve an absolute beginner that needs questions answered early, consistently, and frequently.')
