Can anyone point to a man ever being labelled in such a way on HN?<p>Edit: comparing the number of comment hits for &quot; his tantrum&quot; vs &quot; her tantrum&quot; to the relative numbers for &quot; his &quot; and &quot; her &quot; shows that &quot;tantrum&quot; is, indeed, used 2.5 times as often to describe women as it is for men.')
