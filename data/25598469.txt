Would you really bother with subsetting if each participant had fewer than, say, 100 connections? Put a different way, is the reduction in connections from 280k to 25k at the end of the article a thing worth achieving? Any single Linux process can deal with 280k connections, so having that be the aggregate number of connections in a distributed service architecture strikes me as a non-problem.')
