Just hashing the IP address along with other static values is too easy to reverse and not considered anonymization under GDPR.<p>For <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plausible.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plausible.io</a> we added a daily salt to the hash for this exact reason. By deleting the salt at the end of each day, the hash becomes impossible to reverse and visitor data can be considered anonymous.<p>We lose unique visitor tracking beyond one day, but for most sites this is a small price to pay to remove annoying consent banners.')
