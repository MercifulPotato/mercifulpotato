I&#x27;ve learned to accept that I may never have 100% relief.<p>Having most of my mobility and only some small bone growths at this point is my current normal, and I understand that I can&#x27;t control whether it stays at this level or progresses.<p>(Using the word &#x27;progresses&#x27; instead of more negative variants actually helps my frame of mind as well.)<p>Life is just adjusting to what is and what might be and being grateful for now.')
