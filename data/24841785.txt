It&#x27;s interesting to compare the hybrid between deep care and deep recklessness of Belters in various scifi (e.g. The Expanse) vs. historical oceanic explorers on Earth.  Setting off across the ocean in little more than a canoe doesn&#x27;t seem particularly safety oriented, and maybe there is a civilization that evolves a similar approach to space.  That could be as simple as &quot;spray and pray,&quot; or more deceptively sophisticated like Polynesian navigation.')
