Companies need success stories of that kind of ad-hoc innovation happening from within the company remotely. Otherwise someone will 100% kill it. Somewhat a function of how long until return to normalcy if that’s possible.<p>2. Another uncontrolled viral outbreak in the next decade changes the math on financial sustainability of the large campus and externally forces companies to go all-in.<p>From what I’ve seen I think companies hedge #2 happening by allowing remote in perpetuity, and it solves gnarly issues with “forcing” people back in. But at this point I don’t think #1 happens with this pandemic.')
