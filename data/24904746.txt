Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24907347], score=None, time=1603777272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24902996, text='&gt; It was not a nuclear explosion.<p>The claim upthread was not “nuclear reactors don&#x27;t have nuclear explosions” (which would also be overgeneralized), but “nuclear reactors don&#x27;t explode”. The reactor at Chernobyl did explode. The fact that it was a steam explosion induced by energy from a nuclear chain reaction and followed by a reactor core fire does not change the fact that it was a nuclear reactor, and it did explode.<p>&gt; If it were a nuclear explosion there wouldn&#x27;t be anything left of the building and other reactors around it and capping it with a concrete and steel structure would be rather pointless.<p>You seem to be confusing “nuclear explosion” with “nuclear explosion whose yield is maximized via explosive containment, in the manner typical of deliberately engineered nuclear weapons”.')
