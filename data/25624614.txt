That means even if you have &quot;United States&quot; selected as your target, your ads will still show mostly to people outside the US who &quot;show interest in&quot; the US.<p>To fix it: Campaign Settings &gt; Location &gt; Location Options, and under &quot;Target&quot; select &quot;Presence&quot;. Never use the default &quot;Presence or interest&quot; option, as it will result in exactly the scenario you&#x27;re describing.<p>This is my #1 pet peeve with Google Ads. Using the default setting is an incredibly common (and expensive) mistake people make setting up new campaigns.')
