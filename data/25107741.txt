That isn&#x27;t true of poor Ukranians I bet. But my gut says there&#x27;s some dynamic with the Roma whereby remaining separate and different is highly valued by the community, and they punish their own for doing things that erode that separation. Which may be self-sustaining, but it&#x27;s probably bad for them in aggregate.')
