Over 11 years, we lived in three different apartments, always within 10 minutes bike ride to Caltrain, and every place I worked was within a 10 minute bike ride from Caltrain.<p>Bicycling around takes time, but I considered it worth while since it doubled as good, low impact cardio.<p>We also stayed primarily in Mountain View because of the schools.<p>But yeah, from 2009-2020, traffic went from somewhat manageable to batshit crazy.')
