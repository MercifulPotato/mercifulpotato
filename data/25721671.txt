I think the goal for those companies is to not lose business over this. This is the free market at its best. Market pressure has made the math pretty simple: if N customers won&#x27;t do business with my company because we do business with Abhorrent Co and the potential revenue loss from losing those N companies is greater than the revenue I generate from Abhorrent Co, then drop Abhorrent Co.<p>If any of those companies felt the ethical&#x2F;moral value of Parler was more valuable than the lost revenue, they wouldn&#x27;t drop them. Obviously that&#x27;s not the case.<p>The moral here is pretty simple: don&#x27;t be a Nazi.')
