Item(by='jusssi', descendants=None, kids=[24978003], score=None, time=1604394802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977580, text='&gt; Personally I don&#x27;t think it is fair or likely healthy in the long term for the society to let vast majority of the income&#x2F;wealth of wealthy and thus powerful people to go untaxed<p>But this is already happening even with the current system that attempts to tax company profits, isn&#x27;t it? My point is that taxing the person instead of the company would enable taxing the wealthy. There are already quite severe restrictions of using company assets for your personal benefit, at least where I live that is taxable as income.<p>I should amend how I expressed the idea: I never meant that companies pay no tax at all, only that they&#x27;d pay no tax on profit (which can be hidden for the yearly checkpoint by creative accounting). That leaves all sorts of tax categories still available for use (land, transactions, resource usage), which are much harder to hide or deny. A company making profit would be involved in some activity that would be taxable through these. Money on a bank account is by itself a bad medium to store wealth, as it&#x27;s generally subject to 1%~5% yearly inflation.<p>Whether wealth (aside from income&#x2F;profit) of individuals or companies should be taxed is a different discussion. Many countries choose to tax wealth only when it&#x27;s in form of land or constructed property.')
