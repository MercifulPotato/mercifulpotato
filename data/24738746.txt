Even acts that would normally be criminal can be exempt from extradition if they were carried out as part of a larger political crime (like rebellion). These sorts of exemptions date all the way back to the mid-1800s, and are standard, in my limited understanding.<p>The US-UK extradition treaty goes even further and states that extradition will not be granted when the charges are politically motivated:<p>&gt; extradition shall not be \ngranted if the competent authority of the Requested State determines that the request \nwas politically motivated<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone can deny with a straight face that the prosecution of Assange is politically motivated.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;extradition-treaty-between-the-uk-and-the-usa-with-exchange-of-notes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;extradition-treat...</a>')
