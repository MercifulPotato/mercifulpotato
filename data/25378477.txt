Then you can put that BAT into a wallet on your Brave browser, enable a setting, and every month your browser will automatically disburse the BAT proportionally to the content creators you are consuming, as long as they have their own BAT wallet.<p>That&#x27;s what I do. I don&#x27;t opt in to the Brave Ads. But you can if you want, and it&#x27;s worth pointing out that Brave&#x27;s ad system is very privacy focused, in that all classification of you as an ad-target happens in your browser. The only thing sent to Brave is basically just a list of keywords. Then Brave lets advertisers bid on putting up ads for people with certain keywords.')
