For example, many drivers don’t support partial refreshes.<p>I just bought the B&#x2F;W version of this screen and read the data sheet. \nInternally, it is four different screens. So I think (haven’t yet received it) each quadrant takes about 2 seconds to refresh (2 seconds is a pretty common refresh time for eInk). A better driver could do all quadrants at once for a ~2 second refresh.')
