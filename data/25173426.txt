I didn&#x27;t find it informative.<p>To me, bricked means &quot;requires exotic recovery procedure (or more) to repair.&quot;  Existence of tooling in one manufacturer lab doesn&#x27;t make something not &quot;bricked&quot;.  Releasing that stuff to the public makes it &quot;soft bricked&quot;.  Making it so that an ordinary user can do it makes it &quot;not bricked anymore&quot;.  When we say something is &quot;bricked&quot;, the permanence is unknown.<p>Sitting with the drive powered for an hour without a data connection to let its firmware do internal housekeeping and maybe have the drive come (partially?) back, in an undocumented recovery procedure, is definitely somewhere murky on this spectrum.')
