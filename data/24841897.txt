Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=[24842054], score=None, time=1603224787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840354, text='&gt; which defines the living wage at $20,000 per year before taxes.<p>But why? Just an arbitrary number? What that number means? Defining &quot;functionally unemployed&quot; as &quot;earning less than an arbitrary number we pulled out of our noses&quot; is hugely misleading. Maybe that person can&#x27;t earn more because they don&#x27;t have skills, or have personal issues that prevent them from being more productive, or maybe earning high wage is not their priority right now (e.g. internship or apprenticeship). Unemployment has specific meaning - e.g. that by creating more employment opportunities you could fix it. Stuffing anybody that is not earning over $20K, for any reason whatsoever, under the term, just confuses the matters.<p>I get that it looks flashy - &quot;the government is lying to you, the Real Truth is only available from us!&quot; - but it&#x27;s not useful to just change definitions of established terms because it sounds good in a soundbite. There are many other terms - like &quot;labor participation&quot;, &quot;underemployment&quot;, &quot;economical hardship&quot;, &quot;working poor&quot;, etc. - one could coin many more. Redefining existing one while slapping the misleading label &quot;true&quot; to it is not helping.')
