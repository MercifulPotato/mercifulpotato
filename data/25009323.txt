Part of why I wanted to do Mavis is because I wanted to make it easy for developers to make their own custom overrides and ship it with their libraries, especially for Elixir protocols[0].  still haven&#x27;t figured out how to architect that, but I have an idea.<p>&gt; I think you have to see typing as helpful information<p>Indeed.  Selectrix will allow you to chain your inference with fallbacks, so, maybe the first level is a fast cache, second level is checking files for user overrides, third level is dialyzer specs, fourth level is inference.<p>I think it should also be possible to create an addon module with Mavis that lets you type inbound messages for GenServers, given a set of constraints (all possible calls and casts are present in the module itself as an API)<p>[0] it&#x27;s a big problem that in elixir, Enumerable protocol destroys typing information, so I want to make an typing override for Enumerable an &quot;example&quot; typing override system.')
