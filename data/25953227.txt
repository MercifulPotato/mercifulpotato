(Like how Mint operated in its clients&#x27; names upon their online banking accounts, with full explicit consent.)<p>Ironically, I believe Robin Hood themselves offered a similar &quot;AI Investment-bot-as-a-Service&quot; system; though theirs was a much more mundane design, legally, in that it operated upon the clients&#x27; accounts within the Robin Hood brokerage, rather than upon the clients&#x27; accounts in external brokerages.')
