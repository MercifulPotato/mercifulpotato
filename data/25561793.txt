I vaguely remember reading on Anandtech that Haswell was the last generation that Intel was able to increase the IPC (instructions per cycle) by 15% over the previous generation, and nowadays the typical generational improvement is ~5%.<p>According to my calculations, that would mean that the latest generation of Intel chips would be ~27% faster than the Elbrus:  (1 + 5%)^5 - 1')
