They can see that cars don&#x27;t necessarily get you women despite of what the ads say. This can also be indirect learning by someone pointing it out.<p>If you start making certain things illegal to say, you can use that against people. For example, given enough money for lawyers, you can sue people for saying that &quot;these cars don&#x27;t get you women&quot; using the same anti-free speech regulations by finding holes and exceptions in them.
