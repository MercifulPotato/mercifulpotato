The ECT (Eastern Continental Trail) links Pinhoti Trail with Florida Trail (through some road walking in Alabama) and further north part of Benton MacKaye Trail in Georgia until Mt. Springer where it takes on the AT.<p>Given that he made it to Georgia on December 1st, and that the A.T runs through 76 miles of Georgia, if he made it to where he was found dead by foot along the ECT, the mileage breakdown from where he was last seen would be:\n76 (Georgia A.T)  + ~300 (port of BMT) + 335 (PNRT) + 220 (road walking in Alabama) ~1000 (FT until Big Cypress NP) = 1931 miles from December 1st 2017 until the day he died (in July 2018 I assume).<p>In total, we have at most 8 months (minus the days that have passed since his death), which are ~240 days. Most hikers will take a day off (&quot;zero&quot; as in zero miles) once a week or so, so that could make it 205 total hiking days.\nHis average mileage in that case would be 1931&#x2F;205 = 9.4 miles a day, which is very close to what his max mileage was reported to be!')
