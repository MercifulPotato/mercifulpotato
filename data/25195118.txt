The fact that resources like BetterExplained, Paul&#x27;s Math Notes, 3Blue1Brown&#x27;s YouTube Channel, Ben Eater&#x27;s YouTube channel, and the entire body of high quality MOOCs are just available for free over the Internet is probably one of my favorite accomplishments of the human race in the 21st century. While researchers, inventors, startup founders, and all other types of entrepreneurs are pushing the envelope on what&#x27;s possible, there are literally thousands of creators and educators who are doing their best to bring some of that knowledge to the common man.<p>My own experience with academia has lead me to believe that there problems that are truly difficult and complex, but there are also problems which are described as difficult because so many people were exposed to the topic through a resource (typically another person) who had little experience (or interest) in effectively teaching the subject.')
