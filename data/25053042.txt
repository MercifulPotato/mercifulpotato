It seems as likely as not to be perceived as an escalation, and in those types of situations an escalation is likelier to mean you get permanently injured or killed.<p>Of course, the best martial art is de-escalation and the next cross-country, but if you&#x27;re cornered and there&#x27;s an unbalanced distribution of force, you&#x27;re kind of screwed regardless of what you do.')
