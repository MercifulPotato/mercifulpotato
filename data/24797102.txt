A very large fraction of tests in school reinforce that every question has only one right answer.  The notion of minimizing error is seldom even imagined.  Instead it&#x27;s taught that all learning must seek only one goal: “knowing the one and only truth”.  Yet all too often, competing facts are not mutually exclusive and can change with time.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on the poor coverage of concepts like “necessary” and “sufficient” in judging evidence in support of an assertion or model.<p>After working in science for the past 15 years (drug development), I&#x27;ve come to appreciate how little in medicine we know in absolute terms.  With any system as complex as the human body, generally the best you can hope for is to be less wrong.')
