Consumer space prioritizes decent displays at the cost of poor quality-control&#x2F;cheap components to keep costs down because that&#x27;s what sells, and Enterprise space seems to drive costs down by aiming for better reliability at the expense of display options because the buyers are not the users, so the bad display kind of &quot;doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; to the buyer and doesn&#x27;t actually <i>prevent</i> work getting done like insufficient RAM might. The final nail in the coffin is Lenovo et. al, leaving off good display options so they don&#x27;t cannibalize adjacent or higher product lines. :( Pretty massive first world problem, but annoying nonetheless.')
