Not a perfect solution for sure.<p>I used to only rely on tmux, but nowadays I often prefer opening more terminals windows. I found out that by overly relying on tmux, I kept opened a way too high number of shells (browser tabs, anyone?).<p>Now for most tasks I open a terminal without tmux, that way I&#x27;m forced to close it if I don&#x27;t want to have a cluttered desktop (I never minimize or hide windows, I don&#x27;t even know how to do it on my wm).')
