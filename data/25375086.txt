I feel the excitement when seeing the project getting traction. I had similar experience building a [SaaS API request scheduler][1]. Promoted mostly in Q&amp;A communities like Quora and Stackoverflow, took couple weeks to get the first user. Then after a few weeks, started getting 1 new free plan user per week, sometimes when lucky it got 3 per day :). And after 9 month of initial release, got 100 users and the first paid user! The registration and payment are self service. It’s very exciting to feel that someone from somewhere in the world who you haven’t met is willing to trust your product and give it a try, and hey, it’s a product that you built from ground up and you know it’s bringing value to people. The entire bootstrap experience is just awesome.<p>Still way to go, lessons learned? Just get started, and keep doing it. Doesn’t matter if you wasn’t sure what exactly to build, maybe try begin with a real small feature, don’t need to worry about whether somebody else is already doing it, or someone is telling you this won’t fly - just get started and chances are you will identify some problems that you want to solve that is related or completely orthogonal with you current feature&#x2F;product, you will find your way if you keep trying.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihook.us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihook.us</a>')
