You&#x27;re trying to select tests to run. Instead of using educated guesses about parameters (combinatorial interaction designs), you&#x27;re going to look at the system under test. You could generate lots of tests and see what worked by looking at coverage of those tests (line coverage or mutation coverage). Instead, you&#x27;ll analyze the code with symbolic execution and make choices. Klee seems like best-in-class for symbolic execution. A more popular alternative these days is concolic execution, which combines concrete execution with symbolic constraint solving. That&#x27;s in Pex and Intellisense.')
