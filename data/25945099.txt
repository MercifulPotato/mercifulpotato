Sounds like plausible reasoning; a state like China could pump out a million drones per day if they wanted to.  OTOH, what&#x27;s good for the goose is good for the gander; with a tweak to the target identification AI, such systems could easily be used against humans.<p>It occurs to me that a simpler technology could be employed against drones: grapeshot.  Also banned by the Geneva convention.  Sounds like the lesser of two evils, but not nearly as profitable to the military industrial complex')
