Figuring out how to design a large system still takes an appreciable amount of time even if you only end up gluing a bunch of other stuff together at the end of the day. And chances are you have <i>something</i> original in there somewhere. If the market is particularly cutthroat it might be a bad idea to risk giving your competitors even a slight edge.<p>I do appreciate the sentiment of proprietary source available projects though!')
