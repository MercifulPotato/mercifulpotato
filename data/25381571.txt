Item(by='csnover', descendants=None, kids=[25381752], score=None, time=1607653889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381302, text='&gt; The universal existence of motivated reasoning, emotional reasoning, confirmation bias, and other cognitive distortions is precisely why no person or group can be expected to perform better at evaluating evidence and determining which ideas are too dangerous to allow other people to be exposed to.<p>This isn’t what I was hoping folks would take away from my comment.<p>Have you ever been too invested in some problem, or too upset by something, to see the truth of the situation? And when you ask someone else, who is not emotionally invested, they easily point out the way forward? <i>That</i> is the kind of phenomenon I am talking about.<p>Most humans have the capability to objectively assess ideas <i>in general</i>, but when someone has a strong emotional attachment to a specific idea—such as partisans who are predisposed to believe voter fraud misinformation—they are <i>not</i> going to be capable of evaluating that <i>specific</i> idea as well as someone who <i>isn’t</i> predisposed to believe it.<p>I am not claiming that there is any single entity that is capable of being a gatekeeper of <i>all</i> truths. I am saying that there are people who are going to be less capable than others to evaluate the truthfulness of a <i>specific</i> idea. In this case, YouTube moderators are almost certainly going to be more capable of objectively evaluating whether or not a video is proof of widescale voter fraud than a poster who is strongly motivated to lie (intentionally or not), or an audience member who is strongly motivated to agree with that lie. And in that way, there <i>are</i> some people who are more capable of evaluating the objective truth than others.<p>&gt; Because cognition is costly, if someone reaches a conclusion while they are in tribal mode, its going to be difficult to reevaluate their position later when they are in scientist mode. This is why its so important to have access to a variety of opinions, thinkers, and perspectives. Even the best of us are vulnerable to motivated reasoning and other cognitive biases.<p>Yes. Exactly. I’m confused how we are arriving at such different conclusions from the same basic understanding. I hope that this added explanation helps.')
