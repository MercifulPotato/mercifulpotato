The granularity I&#x27;m speaking to is at the lab-notebook level, give or take.  If I&#x27;m performing an assay, formally documenting the premise, evidence supporting that premise, and result under that grant heading would mean we could easily publish both negative and positive results for a given study.<p>One of the areas I helped write a paper for as an undergraduate was later proven to have a completely different mechanistic understanding than we proposed.  I think having this more detailed set of observations would have helped both us and any people citing our paper come to this conclusion earlier.  Physics is great at this [1] - seeing &quot;dark matter&quot; or something unexplainable is an opportunity, but many fields treat presenting something as &#x27;unexplainable&#x27; as a weakness.<p>[0] I don&#x27;t have experience in particle physics or anything of that nature where you&#x27;re working on constructing something like the LHC<p>[1] Once again, outside observer bias')
