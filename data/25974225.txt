Media publish picture guy raising sword, but not explaining why. Media didn’t publish pictures about events that lead to. Day before govt supporters warned that they will tomorrow unless they vacate the protest site. Next day even police barricade  in the view of warning , still they let govt supporters in and local senator arranged trucks dump stone piles close by. Govt rioters move in start stone pelting and police watching , infact escorting them eventually inside the protest site and rioters strat damage. Meanwhile police also fire tear gas at protest site even protesters weren’t attacking back as they know govt want to provoke them. Eventually one of guy picked up sword to scare the roiters to save women and others. That’s it, 6-8 police and government supporters beat him  with batten mercilessly, strip him and took him. I can add all pictures if this platform allows.')
