Roughly 2 years ago I launched Checkly on HN and Product Hunt. Both launches bombed completely.<p>I was a solo developer with no audience, no traction, no team and no customers. But HN has been crazy good to me over the following years. Blog posts reached the homepage many times. I got to know many interesting developers, investors and entrepreneurs.<p>Today, ~24 months later Checkly is a distributed team of 10 people, 200+ customers, a bazillion new features. And, as mentioned in the title, we now have a free developer plan.')
