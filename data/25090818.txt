It&#x27;s hard to set effective policies at the federal level for a country as diverse as the US. Even boring things like the minimum wage need to vary drastically across the country.<p>At the same time, while you&#x27;d think more local policy is the answer, state boundaries that cross metro areas create regulatory headaches. Portland, Or. is across the river from Vancouver, Wa. Washington has no personal income tax, Oregon has no state sales tax.<p>It&#x27;s tricky because there needs to be a policy baseline so living can happen, metro areas need some amount of sovereignty they don&#x27;t have right now, and rural areas need something else.')
