But I think they like the current situation, high enough to make the short sellers bleed, but not high enough to knock them over fully, so they can still merrily sell to them (OTC) and Jane Doe, while happily pocketing some sociopaths money for extending the lease on their remaining shares... They don&#x27;t profit at all from the WSB-proposed rockt-squeeze, where the stock goes up, then trading is stopped for everyone and they can not liquidate everything and they also won&#x27;t get everything back, when their borrowers default. But this is heaven for them: who could have expected that investing in a company slowly sliding to bankruptcy could be so profitable!')
