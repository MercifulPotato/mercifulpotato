Two people come to an agreement. Who are you to say that you know what they want better than they do?<p>I don&#x27;t want to claim that this argument applies to all situations, there are some genuinely non-consensual or otherwise exploitive arrangements that the government ought to ban, but if someone wants what looks to me like a bad job why should I stop them from taking that job?<p>Before COVID I used to frequent a coffee shop where everyone needed to bus their own tables. The cost of labor in SF is so high that it&#x27;s not reasonable to pay someone to bus the tables. While there I would frequently see a man outside who was clearly homeless. I&#x27;m sure he would have happily accepted less than minimum wage to bus the tables, but it&#x27;s a moot question because that kind of relationship is banned, it&#x27;s &quot;exploitive&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s happier being unemployed than he would be being &quot;exploited&quot;.<p>&gt; A measure of success here would be a higher unemployment<p>I&#x27;m roughly with you on this. Technically, unemployed means looking for a job and unable for find one so high unemployment will always be a bad thing. But yes, when fewer people accept bad jobs we&#x27;ll know that everyone is being taken care of.')
