Is it really the boy’s role to make the experience beautiful for girls? in which case, boys would have the gendered role of explaining the games to girls.<p>&gt; gatekeeping games<p>You see, that is my point. Pretty much all activities of real life are gatekept. Programming is the only one that isn’t.<p>As a boy, 7 years old, my father took <i>both</i> my bigger sister and myself to explain the MS-DOS commands he knew. But does reading the 500-pages book on GW-BASIC by myself to understand how it works, even though I was French and 7yo and I had zero knowledge of English, sound like good gatekeeping to you? But my sister was then invited to various activities in school, including the school programming club if she wanted, but she chose the football club (and this was in the 1990ies). I wasn’t.<p>So I stuck with programming. No gatekeeping, no social inclusion, just RTFM until you understand the commands.')
