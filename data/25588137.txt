That it pointed to Google because Google&#x27;s search engine was the best search engine for Firefox&#x27;s users.  Just like Google was the default search engine <i>before</i> Mozilla ever signed a deal.  Just like Wikipedia was added to the searchbar without anyone paying to make it happen.  That any royalties were icing on the cake. (See &quot;serendipitous&quot; in the previous comment).  What&#x27;s hard to understand about this or the earlier comment?')
