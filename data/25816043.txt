For example as soon as one gets too big, they split it up into smaller groups. It diminishes the audience for your post.  I&#x27;ve also observed some odd behaviors in the buy nothing groups on Facebook I&#x27;ve been on where it seems like people are putting way too much effort into a posting for one single t-shirt or dress with elaborate descriptions. It seems like there&#x27;s something going on that&#x27;s not just about getting rid of stuff.<p>Freecycle on the other hand has broader distribution in one sense in that they don&#x27;t force you to limit your audience.  And no reliance on Facebook.')
