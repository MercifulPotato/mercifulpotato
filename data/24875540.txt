I am saying it is <i>possible</i> to <i>imagine</i> a scenario in which someone looks at Youtube-dl as something other than a totally harmless aid to users.<p>Youtube has legitimate reasons to try and prevent people from downloading content from their site.  Youtube-dl is clearly there to enable people to do that.  Rightsholders can use this as another argument that Youtube-dl violates (or is designed to violate) the DMCA.<p>I&#x27;m not defending the RIAA or DMCA here but I can understand their argument and why they are making it.')
