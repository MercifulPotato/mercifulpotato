We saw an issue in the trading ecosystem: trading beginners were flocking to popular forums like Wall Street Bets and other Reddit groups to find their investment advice, polarized by the screenshots of large gains only to lose half or more of their account value. Our goal is to provide a platform that shortens the experience gap between beginner and advanced traders, allowing everyone to invest their money with confidence, without the hours spent researching and waiting to enter or exit a trade. Feel free to ask me any questions about the product or engineering side of the platform.')
