So here every user gets &lt;username&gt;.notebook.host for their notebooks (in the future I might completely randomly generate it instead). This is also the domain used for static embedding.<p>starboard.gg is used as the main entrypoint: it is just a static website (SPA-like). And the APIs are hosted on starboardapi.com. Those two could technically be combined.<p>And finally there&#x27;s another one.. starboardproxy.com which acts as a CORS proxy for use in notebooks.')
