Item(by='pintxo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607376138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25337475, text='&gt; For me artists are nothing more like the embodiment of the survivor ship bias. I can appreciate something that takes skill to create, be it a craft, a poetry, or even a photorealistic drawing. I can appreciate something that raises emotions in me (I&#x27;m aware that rasing emotions is a highly subject criteria as well). I can appreciate something that is new and unique.<p>A lot of reasons to like art.<p>&gt; None of these things is true for 99.9% of art, this artist included. I think these artworks are not different from atleast thousands of other graffiti doodles from other people. Somehow people start to praise this guy (seemingly random?) instead of anyone else. That&#x27;s just survivor ship bias.<p>I would rather say it&#x27;s some sort of network effect. The better known you are, the more interest in your art, the higher the price. Interest and higher prices attract more interest generating even higher prices, loop.<p>&gt; I know people say it all the time but it&#x27;s true &quot;I could have made this&quot;. My point is that probably most of art critic&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between a random doodle of some random art student and most famous abstract art.<p>Isn&#x27;t this the same every developer said about Dropbox? Amazon? Writing an online file-storage&#x2F;sharing app is not hard, writing an online bookstore is not hard. But actually executing it for 26 years (in Amazons) case and building in from there to the empire it is today, that&#x27;s the art.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also not about having an unique idea, banana on the wall is not something special, people do crazy things all the time. There are probably thousand of wanna be artists that tape things on walls and make some random things in hope of getting famous and could tell you some deep thinking why it criticises our modern society.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about execution as well as marketing, sometimes one can compensate for the other.<p>&gt; So for me art is just a random circle jerk of people telling each other that this special guy is good and the rest isn&#x27;t and if you don&#x27;t agree or see it you are just someone that has no idea about art. And my take on really high expensive art is that it&#x27;s just a form of tax evasion or similar goals.<p>It certainly is also an investment and way to signal status, probably always was. But does that minimize the value for you, if you find an attribute of it to be appreciable?')
