Sure you pay the privacy tax to Google for this smoothness.<p>My biases:<p><pre><code>  - I&#x27;ve installed and maintain Littlest Jupyter Hub instance for teammates at my organization.\n  - I teach using local Anaconda installation. \n  - I use myBinder and Google Colab. \n  </code></pre>\nIf I did not have a smooth experience I would imagine someone starting out would have a harder time.<p>At the very least you should curate the packages so they run out of the box, without fiddling with requirements.txt, yaml, pip install, conda etc.')
