If the Fed can gain access to the coins they will auction them off.<p>But if I understand correctly, this is the Fed basically laying a legal claim to and flagging coins that it doesn’t control therefore making them much more difficult to redeem, after seeing that they moved, which implies a hacker did manage to crack a wallet.<p>This story is the perfect example for how little privacy is actually afforded by the Bitcoin blockchain.<p>It’s unlikely the Fed has access to the coins, and that’s why the Bitcoin price just went up 7% because whoever cracked the wallet certainly isn’t going to hand over the coins.<p>Either those coins will never be spent, or the hacker will have to find a country willing to launder them and somehow keep the Fed at bay (doubt it), or if you’re the Fed maybe you arrange a settlement with the hacker to split the coins.')
