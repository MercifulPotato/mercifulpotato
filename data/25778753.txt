If you run windows deployments the bitlocker key backup to domain &#x2F; azure &#x2F; whatever is a must &#x2F; lifesaver.<p>FAR FAR too many situations where users don&#x27;t keep their keys. It can be as simple as upgrading the chip on your computer - which happens with AMD machines because they&#x27;ve had a long run of AM4 socket support. Boom, you fTPM is gone now, and user is complaining they&#x27;ve lost their irreplaceable stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this on IT side with backups. They set up an encryption key on the backups (pub &#x2F; private) 6 years ago. 6 years later, when it comes time to recover under some time pressure, no one has a CLUE where the key is and old staff are long gone. Absolute nightmare.<p>For all the folks saying managing encryption keys at scale is like tying your shoes - 100% false. To manage keys (especially ones where the private key is rarely if ever actually used) takes very very HIGH levels of care.<p>One solution - have encryption keys periodically &quot;fail&quot; so you are forced to prove you know how to recover your key - but no one does that.<p>Same issue used to occur with 2FA apps on phone upgrades before they made it easier to move stuff over to new devices.')
