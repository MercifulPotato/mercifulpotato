Nobody was arguing that newspapers are obligated to reprint every letter to the editor they receive, rather than picking and choosing. It&#x27;s pretty much always been about government interference, which is why cases like that were about public spaces, <i>not</i> private ones.<p>Acting like free speech is about what businesses let you say on their property is ahistorical, and reveals that the speaker is either ignorant of this history, or being deliberately disingenuous.')
