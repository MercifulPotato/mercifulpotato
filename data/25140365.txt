By lowering interest rates and offering low interest loans in an attempt to prevent deflation the fed has pushed a ton of money into the economy with the result that deflation is increasing. Because of that people have to put their money in something that will increase in value as inflation increases, the result being that tons of money is being pumped into equities which further drives up the price making them more attractive, because the government is pumping more money into the economy to prevent deflation.<p>This pandemic to me shows the fundemental problem with a lot of the fancy economic theories we&#x27;ve been living off of and the parasitic &quot;financial engineers&quot; fundamental failing. You can play all the games you want with numbers and spreadsheets to make it look like there is more money than there actually is, but you can&#x27;t magically change the amount of stuff their is to buy. As such it doesn&#x27;t matter what measure you use or what KPI you look at for the economy, if there isn&#x27;t enough crap being produced for people to buy it at a reasonable price there isn&#x27;t enough crap to buy, and telling people the economy is doing great when I can&#x27;t afford a roast for dinner doesn&#x27;t mean jack to me or anyone else.')
