At the time, there was basically nothing like it on TV. It wasn&#x27;t just the scifi stories themselves, it was the <i>budget</i>. Nothing like it had been seen. Star Trek: TOS reruns was a <i>high budget</i> show for the time. It&#x27;s primary competition is Doctor Who reruns on PBS, and while it may have had good stories at times, it&#x27;s a series whose idea of &quot;high budget villian&quot; is wrapping a guy in bubble wrap and spray-painting it green.<p>So at the time, the first season didn&#x27;t seem so bad. It was probably on par with what most people of the time expected. In hindsight ST:TNG may seem like &quot;a decent show with a bad start&quot;, but at the time it seemed like &quot;a pretty decent show that just kept getting better&quot;. ST:TNG is part of what set the modern bar, and it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of what set the modern bar if you kind of lump it in with Deep Space Nine.<p>By modern standards it is weak because the tech of the time didn&#x27;t support season-long arcs because there was very little rewatchability, but if you try to delve into science fiction prior to ST:TNG, be prepared to... make concessions.')
