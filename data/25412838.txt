There are cases where it is OK and there are cases when it isn&#x27;t.<p>There was an Uber blocking traffic on my street today and I went past them. It would be ridiculous to have to just sit behind the car until their passenger showed up, and I&#x27;m sure as hell nit gonna ride my bike into oncoming traffic<p>&gt;Do you think the law should be changed to allow this?<p>It doesn&#x27;t need to be changed.
