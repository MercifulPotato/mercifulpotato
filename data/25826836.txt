The biggest uncertainty is trying to estimate what it is we&#x27;re trying to build in the first place. i.e. the details of the spec. Often times where I&#x27;ve seen estimates really off is when the scope changes, or more details are discovered etc.<p>To borrow the usual building a house analogy, if during software estimation we&#x27;re actually given how many rooms, how many floors, where are the doors and windows etc, then I think estimates will be a hell of a lot more accurate. Instead, what we typically get is, build a house that can be used by the family of 4, and we&#x27;ll discover exactly what the family wants as we build.')
