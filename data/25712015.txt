I&#x27;ve released a few versions under license X. I decide to switch to License Y for all versions. Say a problematic set of users I&#x27;m revoking a licesnse from.<p>Why should my versioning scheme create artificial constraints on my license? Why should someone be able to &quot;just go back a version&quot;?<p>Not that I&#x27;m a big fan of that type of thing, but it is an interesting legal question.')
