I think Vue is far and away the best developer experience in terms of FE frameworks that I&#x27;ve ever used. React is more popular (rightfully so) and has better employment opportunities, but I think Vue is a legitimately much better FE tool in terms of productivity and usability.<p>If you look at the additions graph, though, you&#x27;ll find Evan You with +500k, and the second highest contributor with +7k. I just couldn&#x27;t feel comfortable trying to build a company on a single person like that.')
