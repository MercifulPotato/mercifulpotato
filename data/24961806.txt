Why would you trust them to take your privacy seriously? They pre-install malware that harvests your data just to drive the unit cost down by a few dollars. Google isn&#x27;t interested enough to pressure vendors to provide sources, so you need their garbage blobs to make the phone work, even with a custom ROM. Apple is even worse.<p>TLDR they have the budget, but no actual reason to take good care of your data.')
