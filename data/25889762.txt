Keeping your code in a monolith requires a lot more investment in tooling (to manage a large monorepo, because apparently our industry has collectively forgotten that you can actually build separate libraries and keep them in different repositories) and coordination between multiple teams working on a single large project. The simplest solution is often for management to throw their hands in the air and let each team stake out their own territory and own their own services. You certainly pay a cost for it in terms of overall infrastructure complexity, but maybe if you&#x27;re lucky you get some resilience and scalability out of it.')
