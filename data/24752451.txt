Timezone issues aside (which this does simplify), I&#x27;d like to see both &quot;N hours ago&quot;, plus the actual date and time it happened (in my local timezone).<p>With hours it&#x27;s not so bad, but gets worse with longer time periods. I find it incredibly aggravating when services say &quot;N days ago&quot;, or &quot;N weeks ago&quot;, because this simply serves to obscure when an event actually occurred. Just give me the damn date and time in my local timezone!')
