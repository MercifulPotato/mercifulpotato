Uptime Monitoring for other websites.\n2. Traffic Analytics<p>I had to learn a lot from August 2020 and am still learning and adding up features to the site to make it more valuable to the user.<p>To genuinely see the number of traffic coming to my site, i used my own traffic analytics and made it public on weblister.co&#x2F;demo\nI blocked my self so that the site does not count me as a visitor when i open it and that i should see the real number of visitors coming through.<p>I posted on appsumo.com&#x2F;weblister and I got 6 sales in the last 1 month of being active. I know, its not much,  but I treasure my clients with my heart.<p>Thanks to that one guy from here who gave me a critic and inspired me to make something people can pay for.')
