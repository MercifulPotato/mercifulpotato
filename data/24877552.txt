The fact that you bypassed the viewing of ads changes nothing in this matter.<p>Otherwise, if we would allow this interpretation, then the entirety of modern internet technology is potentially infringing. This is ludicrous.<p>Nothing substantially different happens when you view the video in your web browser than when you download it using youtube-dl (mpv, the media player, even wraps youtube-dl so you can directly stream a youtube video). In both cases HTTP requests are made, followed by some processing of the data. Does that mean adblocking software is infringing too?<p>I don&#x27;t know, maybe the US has totally lost its mind and this kind of thing <i>would</i> fly there, but certainly not in Europe.')
