Item(by='billyoyo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612006103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25967881, text='You state that &quot;a drop in overall intake as more students realise it likely isn&#x27;t worth the money&quot;. This is completely unfounded and not supported by statistics at all [1]. University intake in the UK across all ethnicities has been on a steady increase.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s true to say UK degrees don&#x27;t care about the beauty of number&#x27;s. Again, the statistics show that the number of mathematics students have been according to the overall trend [2]. And anecdotally, comparing with friends from other countries the UK actually seems to have a university system unusually geared to purely academic degrees.<p>It&#x27;s my personal belief that while of course university is about getting a job, it&#x27;s also about learning about adulthood for many people. People use it to delay the start of their working life and enjoy a few years of adult freedom, as well as to get a degree. Anecdotally, I know a lot of my friends went to uni almost entirely for this reason and had no idea in their head about what they&#x27;d do after yet. But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with that. In fact with increasing lifetimes I think it only makes sense we continue to delay the age at which we enter the workforce.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk&#x2F;education-skills-and-training&#x2F;higher-education&#x2F;entry-rates-into-higher-education&#x2F;latest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk&#x2F;education...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hesa.ac.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;16-01-2020&#x2F;sb255-higher-education-student-statistics&#x2F;qualifications" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hesa.ac.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;16-01-2020&#x2F;sb255-higher-educatio...</a>')
