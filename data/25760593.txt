A few times an image didn&#x27;t load, and it was replaced by a small square. The problem is that it was an object and I had to jump over that object, but the small square was too small and I couldn&#x27;t jump. It solved after reloading, but I had to restart from the beginning.<p>(Fun small game. It&#x27;s worth reloading a few times to try it.)')
