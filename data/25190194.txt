You don&#x27;t get any of those things with kubernetes &quot;out of the box&quot; unless you&#x27;ve got an ops team or someone&#x27;s got a year plus experience running one cloud provider&#x27;s version.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure cloud providers give you logging and monitoring out of the box (as well as a bunch of other stuff) and Kubernetes itself is a process manager with its own &quot;SSH&quot; (kubectl exec) and so on. I&#x27;m not wed to Kubernetes either--you could use ECS&#x2F;Fargate or whatever. But to do something comparable in an EC2 environment requires a fair amount of experience just to get to get the basic things that Kubernetes (or ECS) gives you out of the box. Of course, if you&#x27;re well-versed in VMs already then I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get much value out of a container solution for simple workloads, but if you&#x27;re not familiar then I think container solutions are easier. But again, I might be biased by my experience.')
