Okay, fine, you don&#x27;t want it in Chrome that&#x27;s your choice. But not indexing .swf in your search engine product because you don&#x27;t support it in your browser product is crazy. It&#x27;s going out of their way, doing more work, to hurt people.<p>I guess this is just another example of being unable to count on profit motivated corporations. It&#x27;s a good thing the IA is trying to help.')
