From the article (p. 5):<p>&quot;We can better understand the problem if we note that in ordinary life, many human beings seem to follow a simple rule: people generally do not say things unless they are true, or at least substantially true.&quot;<p>His way of dealing with this is, as you say, rule by experts. But the obvious alternative is for people in general to <i>stop assuming that others generally do not say things unless they are true</i>. And the way to do that is to make people responsible for their own beliefs--to let people suffer harm if they have a false belief that they shouldn&#x27;t have adopted in the first place because the source it came from was not trustworthy. Then people will have the proper incentive to actually <i>think</i> about the trustworthiness, or lack thereof, of various sources of information.<p><i>&gt; Maybe that idea has merit</i><p>Based on the actual track record of &quot;experts&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it does. But Sunstein&#x27;s own stated principles don&#x27;t even leave room to ask the question. That&#x27;s the real problem.')
