They suffer from a free rider issue: I benefit from clean air whether I pay for it or not.<p>In addition I don&#x27;t know enough about traffic safety to figure out what the best speed limit is for certain roads, nor how the road should be constructed (especially given local environmental conditions, estimated use etc).  It&#x27;s cheaper overall to outsource it to people who know.  Otherwise how can I decide if I want to subscribe to that safety rail at the edge of a certain roadway?')
