But this does not directly imply a certain business model.<p>Some people do donation-based development. And that&#x27;s fine. And some people do things entirely for free, that&#x27;s also fine. (But don&#x27;t be angry that somebody then takes your code and does what the license you put it under permits them to do, e.g. not pay you.)<p>And others are corporations that have full-time employees write code and publish it as open source. See all the Red Hat work. Or Intels and others contributions to the Linux kernel.<p>Open source is more than the lone dev in their basement doing selfless acts and sometimes begging for donations.')
