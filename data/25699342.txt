I’ve seen three local communities here migrate over in the last few days. The reason they did that was due to a couple of vocal members. That includes my wife’s company, the school parents group and the local cycling club all of whom are about as technically aware as a potato (I end up doing most of their out of band IT support)<p>I suspect it’s a little more complicated though. Some of the WhatsApp groups are quite fatiguing to belong to due to politics and quite frankly unbearable individuals and this allows people to have an excuse to exit them without having half of your contact list trying to get hold of you and drag you back in again.<p>As for features, absolutely no one I have seen locally here use anything other than basic use cases that signal supports.<p>Me, I just uninstalled it. I’m going to see if I need to replace it. It appears after all that everyone I need to talk to so far uses iMessage.')
