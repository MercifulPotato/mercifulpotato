One major aspect of reliable software is composability, so that may ensure correct large systems are out of correct smaller systems. Correctness in the small, trivial bits and their glue is what makes correctness at large. You say you just have to think about what&#x27;s best for your project. Why not think about and understand the problem in general and build tools to tackle the specific complexities you have.<p>Feel free to not use Haskell. Just keep in mind that you too live in a bubble with a certain mixture of doctrine and trade-offs.')
