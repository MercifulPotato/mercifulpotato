One of them says a number and the rest laugh. Then the next person says a number and everyone laughs again.<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asks them.<p>&quot;We&#x27;re telling each other jokes, but since we keep telling the same ones, we&#x27;ve assigned each a number and rather than telling the whole joke all over again, we can just reference it quickly that way&quot;<p>&quot;Can I try?&quot;<p>&quot;Sure, go ahead&quot;<p>&quot;42&quot;, the guy says.<p>Everyone starts laughing and laughing and won&#x27;t stop.<p>&quot;What did I say?&quot;<p>&quot;Well you see, the joke you told us was:<p>A guy walks into a bar and sees a group of people. One of them says a number and the rest laugh... etc. etc.&quot;<p>---<p>In the original joke the last answer was simply &quot;We hadn&#x27;t heard that one before&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to think my recursive version has more depth to it.')
