That may well be worth it for the company, so I&#x27;m not sure this scheme would actually stop dishonest reviews, only make it worse.<p>Sometimes when I see a product being sold FBA I will do a search on Alibaba (they’re <i>always</i> on Alibaba) to find the wholesale price. I’ve found that the markup on most products is high enough that if a seller were to give <i>every</i> buyer $20, they’d <i>still</i> be making money.')
