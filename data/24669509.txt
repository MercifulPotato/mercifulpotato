Item(by='vram22', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601698874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668282, text='Re: &quot;macro life form&quot; and &quot;trees communicate&quot;, Gabe Brown and&#x2F;or Elaine Ingham also talk about that. IIRC, Brown (regenerative farmer for ~20 years), quotes Ingham (soil biology scientist - soilfoodweb.com). So do some other regen ag  people whose videos I&#x27;ve been watching, e.g. Richard Perkins of Ridgedale Permaculture, Sweden. Recommend his and Brown&#x27;s YouTube videos for good overviews and even good solid technical details of <i>what</i>  regen ag techniques are, <i>and why</i> they work (well, and cheaper than &quot;conventional&quot; ag). Both are regen ag farmers who have been doing it successfully for years.')
