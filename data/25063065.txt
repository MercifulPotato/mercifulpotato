The moment I realized it was an Electron app, I stopped using it. Nowadays, I sporadically open the web application, which is one click away from my browser bookmarks.<p>Safari executes JavaScript code much faster on my computer than Chromium, so the experience of typing and navigating Notion is much better on the web (native browser) than on the other web (hybrid Electron). The same thing with Slack. It is much more reliable in the native-web than in the hybrid-web&#x2F;desktop Electron wrapper, which continuously restarts and consumes an unnecessary amount of memory that other more essential applications (Docker, IDE, debugger) could use.')
