Taking photos of the ugliest people available or from food sellers picking their noses in the job <i>-after you are hired to promote tourism in that place, none less-</i> is clearly not what your employer expected from you.<p>Going ballistic artsy and finding something nice to photograph at the sea in winter wasn&#x27;t so complicated after all; the ocean is gorgeous in winter.
