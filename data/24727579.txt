A typical Wi-Fi chipset has a noise figure around 6 dB, in principle, if a high-performance LNA is used, connected via a circulator (so the Wi-Fi doesn&#x27;t transmit into the amplifier), 3 or 5 dB improvement for RX should be possible (and without violating any radio regulation!). But I don&#x27;t have to tolerate the horrible campus network since then, I don&#x27;t have any motivation to try it anymore...<p>&gt; <i>Take home message, if you have enough SNR (the media converter bridges are designed for 15 km) you can get away with all sorts of hacks. </i><p>It&#x27;s said that all communication accomplishments are ultimately a problem of adding a bunch of positive and negative numbers in your link budget. ;-)')
