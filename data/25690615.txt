As far as I know there&#x27;s no difference between say the French or German republic or the Dutch (symbolic) monarchy in this regard.<p>Dutch representatives are accessible by the people. They have a walk-in hour, you can call them, email them, write them, you can join hearings and meetings where they&#x27;re present, they go out into the country to talk to citizens. But what you can&#x27;t do is waltz into their office. This has obvious reasons in a post 9&#x2F;11 world, and it has nothing to do with the fact the Netherlands has a king who has a purely symbolic function and does not participate in politics, no different from say France which is a republic, or Germany which saw a mob storm the Reichstag a few months ago and was easily held off by the police, which is also a republic.')
