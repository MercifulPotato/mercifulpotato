Item(by='trentnix', descendants=None, kids=[24841802], score=None, time=1603222390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24841304, text='<i>Bringing a weak case now guarantees that DOJ won&#x27;t pursue another case in the future after it gets its ass handed to it in court</i><p>Simply because a complaint was filed does not mean that investigation doesn&#x27;t continue. It&#x27;s not as if the complaint cannot be amended or new complaints cannot be made.<p>But your question begging aside regarding this being a &quot;weak case&quot;, if Barr felt (justly or unjustly) that the case wouldn&#x27;t have been brought by a Biden administration then this may have been the best opportunity to make the complaint. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to think that a Biden administration might be more sympathetic to Google. After all, Google was a prominent advising figure during the Obama administration and Harris is a San Francisco politician with Google relationships. Maybe that&#x27;s a cynical view of the Biden administration or maybe it&#x27;s not sufficiently cynical in evaluating Barr&#x27;s motives. Such is politics and I don&#x27;t really trust any of them.')
