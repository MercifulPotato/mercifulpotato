But apparently they just don&#x27;t have a good model of how large or how volatile that propensity attribute is, and how it relates to political leanings.<p>I was polled this year. One of the first questions I was asked is if I was answering the call on a landline or on a cell phone. They weight those differently. Also of course my basic demographic info (wage, race, marital status, education level, home ownership status, etc.)<p>I think your whole comment is correct, but instead of not accounting for the propensity factor, they do... just <i>badly</i> :)<p>I have no idea what the solution is to this. Maybe there isn&#x27;t one, and instead we can get a silver-lining effect: If people trust the results of polls less, they&#x27;re hopefully less likely to think the results are preordained. More voter turnout?')
