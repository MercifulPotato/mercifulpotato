There is a history of gout in my family. More recently I&#x27;ve had the odd time where I have mild symptoms - pain in foot rather than toe and still able to limp around without too much issue. I have wanted to avoid taking allopurinol daily and have done a lot of research to find more natural &#x2F; dietary solutions without really finding any silver bullet. Interesting things i have come across:<p>1. There is at least one study showing Lemon Juice it can lower uric acid levels in humans[1] seemingly by lowering PH of urine.<p>2. Tart cherry juice is mentioned a lot as a cure. There are a quite a few studies[2]. Make sure and get the tart cherry (Montmorency) juice, you can get it in a concentrated syrup. My uncle says he has not had an attack since he started drinking a generic supermarket tart juice every day. I have never had an attack whilst taking cherry juice but i haven&#x27;t been taking it consistently.<p>3. Interesting article linking fructose and gout which matched my intuition a lot more than the link with meat - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;2009&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;gout&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;2009&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;gout&#x2F;</a><p>4. Hot bath with epsom salts seems to temporarily ease symptoms.<p>I personally haven&#x27;t noticed a correlation between eating meat &#x2F; fish and gout attacks. I have gone from eating meat twice a day to about once a week now and there has been no noticeable change in the gout.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0304423817301851" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S03044...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fasebj.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1096&#x2F;fasebj.25.1_supplement.339.2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fasebj.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1096&#x2F;fasebj.25.1_supplemen...</a>')
