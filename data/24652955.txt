Bear in mind that can (depending on the state) include, for example, possession of even small amounts of cannabis.<p>Mark Wahlberg is a convicted felon for what seems to be a pretty vicious race-based assault 30 years ago. Even as someone who is famous and extremely rich this actually causes him a lot of problems, so much so that for awhile he petitioned the Massachusetts governor for a pardon.<p>Personally I was (and am) against a pardon for him. There was enough of a backlash that the request was dropped. The problem with him getting a pardon is that&#x27;s (yet another) exemption for the rich and famous. Kind of like how only people with 100K Twitter followers can be customer support on anything these days.<p>What about all those people who are convicted felons for minor drug offenses including drugs that can now be legal for recreational use? They don&#x27;t have the wealth and fame to bypass this scarlet letter.<p>Even worse, this can be triggered by more cruel measures like three-strikes laws that disempower judges from making informed decisions.<p>The problem here is the permanent scarlet letter and there shouldn&#x27;t be exemptions for wealth, fame or power.<p>The level of incarceration in the United States should be a huge source of shame. It&#x27;s an institutional failure and yet more cruelty, especially given the prevalence of prison rape.<p>It&#x27;s good this woman learned a new skill and (even better) is allowed to use it. It&#x27;s just sad that this is such an exception it&#x27;s newsworthy.')
