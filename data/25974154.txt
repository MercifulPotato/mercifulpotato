I find that hard to believe, given that LEDs emit the same amount of light at approximately 1&#x2F;10 the wattage.  That would mean we&#x27;re replacing 100W of incandescent bulbs with 1000W equivalent of LEDs?  Or, is this versus fluorescent, which would be more of a 1.5-2:1 wattage equivalent exchange rate?<p>As for LEDs being &quot;cold, sterile, and unnatural,&quot; that seems to be primarily a property of older LED bulbs.  Newer bulbs are perfectly capable of emitting light at virtually any color temperature between 3000-6500K, which encompasses everything from &quot;soft white&quot; to daylight.  Personally, I prefer daylight balanced bulbs, because I do some color sensitive work, and those bulbs have the highest available CRI of any non-incandescent bulb, but many people do prefer the &quot;soft white&quot; style.  Even for non-color sensitive work, I find them too yellow for my liking, but I get that this is all down to personal preference.')
