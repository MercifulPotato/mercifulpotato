The biggest advantage for everyone, the Numba team as well as its users, is that it is opt-in and done with intent.  The programmer is saying, &quot;I am willing to constrain my code to get perf&quot;.  And that you can do that inside an existing runtime is pretty damn cool.<p>I think for Python to get decent speedups the semantics for the code being optimized needs to be highly constrained.<p>Optimizing full in the wild Python code is a huge huge task. Optimizing for operations over constant type arrays is much much easier.<p>Yes this doesn&#x27;t speed up the call or the allocation rate, but start with some easy stuff or nothing will improve.')
