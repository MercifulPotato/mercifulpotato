Because procrastination.<p>There used to be &quot;white-collar cost of living comparisons&quot;, maybe there still is. The headline in the newspaper would be &quot;Copenhagen most expensive city in the world&quot; or somesuch. The major reason for that was that hiring a full-time nanny to look after your children was <i>expensive</i> in Copenhagen, and a full-time nanny was included because that was considered necessary for white-collar professionals in some of the cities om the survey, and for fairness it was included everywhere. But in Copenhagen, there are excellent creches and kindergartens. Only a kook hires a nanny, so those attempts at fair comparisons compared kooky behaviour in Copenhagen with sensible behaviour in, say, Pune or Bangalore, and found that being a kook in Copenhagen is expensive.<p>But how can you do it better? How can you compute the cost of living (which is tightly connected to purchasing power) so well that you can compare year-over-year and capture 2% changes reliably? If the city provides more&#x2F;better creches, should you start counting 19.2% of the cost of a nanny instead of 19.4%?<p>People don&#x27;t need a car where I live. I know areas nearby where a family like mine would have at least one, perhaps two cars. Cars are cheaper there (renting off-street parking space costs a fortune here) but how would you factor the cost of a car into purchasing power and compare fairly? If the city builds new metro rail, how do you change the weight of the family&#x27;s first car in your calculation, and the cost of the second car?<p>This is difficult stuff.')
