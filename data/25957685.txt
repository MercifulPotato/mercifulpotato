Not the kind of attention they wanted.   They seem to basically not care until something big happens and they could appear to have helped&#x2F;allowed it to be organized on their platform.  This seems clear as day.  There is still a ton of foul, lewd, right leaning, left leaning, offensive, racist, x-phobic, etc content on these platforms, it’s just not drawing attention to the platform.  Ironically or maybe it’s more indicative of the intelligence limitations of those taking part, them shuttering these groups becomes more ammunition for the falsehoods and antiestablishment ideas the groups promote.  It’s probably a lot less fishy than you might think.  You can’t have fight club anymore when everyone knows about it...')
