Someone might simply be mistaken; lying implies that they know the truth and deliberately seek to deceive. That makes what you said a personal attack, and you can&#x27;t post like that on HN.<p>If you wouldn&#x27;t mind reviewing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and sticking to the rules when posting here, we&#x27;d be grateful. We&#x27;ve had to ask you about this multiple times already, and if you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t use HN as intended we&#x27;re going to end up banning you. I don&#x27;t want to ban you so can you please fix this?')
