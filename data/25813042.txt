Of course, I prefer the freer model, where I can install whatever software I want on my computing device.<p>I grew up with this possibility since I was 14 (first apple, later Linux and Windows). I&#x27;m still irritated by app stores today and I personally don&#x27;t understand the appeal of a &quot;walled garden&quot;.<p>This leads to the following value question, which I will illustrate with an example: \nShould a company like Nestle be prevented from contracting with a municipality to pump and sell its spring water? Why would anyone want to regulate this? I am not forced to buy this water and support such business practices. No consumer is forced to do so. \nAnd if the people in such a community have democratically decided that short-term profit is worth more to them than the long-term supply of groundwater, no one should be able to prevent this community from selling their water either.<p>And that&#x27;s how I see Apple.Every company has the right to set the rules for their platform that they see fit.  And every user has the right to go to the self-imposed prison that protects him from &quot;evil software&quot;, pornography, fake news (and what else). Or not to enter this ecosystem.<p>[edit typo]')
