Item(by='rvense', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607278040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25324914, text='&gt; My viewpoint is: calling for ethnic cleansing through violence creates real harm (people have been murdered!), so private citizens and organizations should not support people who advocate for ethnic cleansing.<p>Oh, I wholly agree on that part! It&#x27;s absolutely not that. I think deplatforming that stuff is good. Good for society, and good because you get to watch them complain about being oppressed.<p>&gt; Also, blaming the two party system misunderstands US politics. Most Democratic politicians have not called for deplatforming of white supremacists â€” it&#x27;s mostly a leftist idea.<p>Precisely. My point was that the original article and much American political discourse has trouble distinguishing between the Democratic party and &quot;leftists&quot;. And different groups of leftists - that often can&#x27;t get along. It also kind of exists in the opposite direction, in that centrists aren&#x27;t fascists. That&#x27;s the distortion, and I think the two-party system makes the tribalism much worse than it needs to be.')
