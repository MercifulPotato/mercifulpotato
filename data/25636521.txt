Because the comic was painted in a set of watercolors, this was going to be difficult.  I ended up tracing the lines (for the deeper engraving) and then stomping on the color palette for the etching.  Finally, I settled on different newspaper halftone sets for each &quot;color.&quot;<p>It took several tries for it to come out alright.  This might have saved me a few runs.')
