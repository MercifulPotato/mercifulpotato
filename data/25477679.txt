There is a _really_ large interpretation gap between what is written and what really happened depending on how you encode the data into the dataset and the analysis model.<p>I am a clinical researcher. And TBH, I think it&#x27;s not really possible to conduct truthful and fundamentally believable clinical research given the current social and technological environments of academic research. I&#x27;m far from the only one slaving for professors who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. If I did not have a family to feed, I would not accept doing the work I am doing right now.')
