And, of course, of almost everyone involved acting in good faith.<p>That depends on the definition of &quot;working&quot;, I think. I don&#x27;t doubt the good faith of those involved, but &quot;some form of train service between two locations&quot; is a very low hurdle for &quot;working&quot; if that train is late, slower then advertised, only half the size it was announced to be, or running it costs three times as much as trains elsewhere. If you consider quality and price, not just binary functionality, &quot;working&quot; becomes a lot fuzzier.<p>It&#x27;s hard to compare public services and government actions because we don&#x27;t have competing government in the same locations, but &quot;something happens&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;everything working almost all of the time&quot;.')
