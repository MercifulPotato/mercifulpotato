If someone did that as a feature on top of matrix you now have a situation where some clients support it and some don&#x27;t so the feature never really gets used as its too unreliable. Maybe over time the feature rolls out to more clients but there will always be some devs who think &quot;No I don&#x27;t like this feature, I won&#x27;t ever add it&quot;<p>I guess things are a little simpler here since it might be possible to implement new features without server changes as they may just work on top of the standard matrix spec.')
