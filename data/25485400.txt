Its equally likely that you just don&#x27;t have the education and experience to perceive their contributions as valuable. Lots of people say the same thing about professions they don&#x27;t respect such as artists, educators, police officers, mental health professionals, dog walkers etcetera. It says more about the person holding the opinion than the profession itself.')
