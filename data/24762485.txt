Any comments&#x2F;thoughts will be appreciated.<p>(Begin cut and paste)<p>From the perspective of\nunderstanding the principles\nof design, development and\nmanagement of settlements,\nKautilya prescribed that it is\nimportant to know the kind of\nurbanization he conceptu-\nalized. He mentions a well\ndefined hierarchy of the\nurban centers and the\nadministrative divisions. These\ndivisions were based mainly on\nthe size of population and\nwere influenced by the\nresources available in the\nregion and opportunities for\neconomic development. The\nsmallest division was a village\nconsisting of each not less than\na hundred families and not\nmore than five hundred\nfamilies of agricultural people\nwith boundaries extending as\nfar as a kr√≥sa (2,250 yards).\nApparently Kautilya also\nenvisioned certain quality of\nlife for the inhabitants by\nspecifying population density\nand kind of physical\ndevelopments in various parts\nof the town. Further, in his\npolicies on urbanization,\nKautilya encourages migration\nto the countryside in order to\nprevent overcrowding into\nthe cities. This ensured a\ncontrol over population as well as building densities and thus also reduced the hazard risks in city centers. The policy might also have been implied on widely spreading out the population across the nation, not just concentration in particular cities or national capitals thus supporting integrated and comprehensive growth of the regions. However, such outward regions were essentially with well developed agrarian economy.(&#x2F;end cut and paste)')
