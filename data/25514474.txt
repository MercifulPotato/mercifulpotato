Hope it is more clear. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is if you are trying to sell $100 million worth of share it is going to be at a lower price then selling $10,000 worth of shares. It seems like critics of IPOs just take the number of shares issued and multiply it by the highest price on the IPO date and say &quot;Look at all the money those bankers left on the table!&quot;')
