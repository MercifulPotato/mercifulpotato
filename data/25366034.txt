In simplest terms, it is an open source web service that enables on-demand translation between over 100 languages using machine learning.<p>You can deploy it on your own AWS account if you want to try it out. It uses Cortex (an open source ML deployment project I help maintain) to automate deployment and implement multi-model caching, which allows the API to access the models from a remote S3 bucket and cache them in memory as needed. As a result, it only needs one EC2 instance to run, despite serving predictions from +1,000 different 300 MB models.<p>There’s a ton of room for optimization and customization here. Please feel free to hack it however you’d like. The API uses models trained by the Language Technology Research Group at the University of Helsinki, hosted publicly by Hugging Face.')
