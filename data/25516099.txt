Our `all-in-one` docs are still under writing, we will cover that part later.\n2. For the performance part, we are now showing real-world cases, not a well-designed benchmark.(We selected the best result to show our work few years ago, don&#x27;t want to do it anymore)\n3. About why TerarkDB is faster than RocksDB will be explained in our `all-in-one docs` in one week, and most of the reasons are not magic, just engineering efforts<p>Thanks again for your remembering us.')
