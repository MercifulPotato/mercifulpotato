Generally if people aren&#x27;t dying or aren&#x27;t living in pain it&#x27;s unclear what&#x27;s a good measure or if it can be considered indicative of physical &quot;health&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also pretty rare that something would cause great suffering without reducing life expectancy.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely a ton of evidence showing improvement to some markers. But similarly you could &quot;improve&quot; them with many drugs and people would naturally be skeptical on whether there&#x27;s a real improvement to health without trying to treat some specific condition. And you&#x27;d usually defer to life expectancy to make the determination.')
