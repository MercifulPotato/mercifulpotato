Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=[25161928], score=None, time=1605888619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159707, text='&gt; With &#x27;pure Elisp&#x27; I mean no FFI. Most Wayland compositors call low-level interfaces to manipulate graphics, but we can not implement such a compositor since those interfaces are largely absent in Elisp and the performance would be of a great concern. So I tend to make a subcompositor that runs on top of another compositor (mutter for example) to offloads most dirty work and only deals with window management. But even this simplified design can not be realized due to the inability of Elisp to send&#x2F;receive file descriptors through a socket.<p>It seems like in this case it&#x27;s a limitation of elisp, not wayland.')
