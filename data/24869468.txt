Item(by='gravitas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603461123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867006, text='I found during my journey (Google Music -&gt; Youtube Music autoconvert -&gt; Spotify import) several online tools which could read a public Youtube Music Playlist (mine are 500+ songs, so not small, not gigantic) and one which allowed me to copy my &quot;likes&quot; over (read YTM like, find same Spotify song and Like it) so there are tools out there even though we don&#x27;t have official or supported APIs. I could not find one single service to do it all, it took.. I think 3 different services to work through the process.<p>The largest problem I think happened is many of the origin tracks from Google Music were incorrectly named or identified; I had to repair the process in both YTM and Spotify to try and find the actual track which I had in GPM but with bad metadata around it. The mistakes were high enough that I thought to myself &quot;wow, Google Music really had a lot of bad metadata&quot; during the work.')
