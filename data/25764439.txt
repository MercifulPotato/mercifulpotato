Item(by='klmr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610556122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25759710, text='You need to have Xcode installed, but you don’t need to actually <i>use</i> the Xcode GUI for notarisation, you can use command line tools via `xcrun {altool,stapler}` to achieve the same. My company is distributing a Java application with a compiled JNI component written in C++, and I created the macOS distribution process for the app. It’s fully command-line based for automated deployment.<p>Packaging and notarisation is a pain, but it <i>is</i> possible, even though the app we’re distributing is self-contained, so it includes a minimal JRE distribution, dynamic libraries, utility binaries, and a loader. All of these components must be code-signed and notarised (not individually, only the complete bundle is submitted, but all components are inspected).')
