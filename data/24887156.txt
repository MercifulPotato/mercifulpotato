Item(by='fractionalhare', descendants=None, kids=[24887334, 24887358], score=None, time=1603640887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886903, text='If we&#x27;re being charitable we can say that the core thrust of Taleb&#x27;s point remains unchallenged, while the details he quantified are either wrong or lacking in sufficient rigor to be refuted. The author makes good points, but realistically it&#x27;s a fool&#x27;s errand trying to disprove tweets using a litany of R^2 incantations.<p>There are important caveats to what the author&#x27;s done here:<p>1. Taleb&#x27;s real point is that IQ is mostly useful for avoiding (extreme) incompetence rather than selecting for competence. Taleb constructed his argument using statistics which are either incorrect or underspecified, which invites the kind of analysis the author made. But that also means the author isn&#x27;t substantially engaging with what Taleb <i>means</i>, because Taleb is abrasive and doesn&#x27;t care to be specific.<p>2. You should be skeptical of any statistical analysis which leads with Pearson&#x27;s <i>r</i> (or Spearman&#x27;s <i>rho</i>, or whatever correlative measure) or the associated <i>R^2</i>. It is a top line measure which is useful but incomplete. You may miss out on the nonlinear relationship or nonperiodic relationship entirely, either of which could hold most of the variance. There are also many ways in which the variance of two things can be associated without there being a predictive relationship. Simply stated: as a statistician would tell you, if all we needed was R^2 then there would be no papers, only abstracts.<p>A little bit of statistics can be a dangerous thing. I&#x27;m not defending Taleb per se; rather I&#x27;m saying that both sides are arguing past each other and we probably shouldn&#x27;t draw a conclusion from either.')
