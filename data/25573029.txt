In the JVM the class loader checks this with an analysis phase during loading.<p>(The JVM design makes this harder than it really needs to be, since it doesn&#x27;t insist on reducible control flow, iirc. You could say OTOH that irreducible control flow is more valuable than trivial analyzability, which is a reasonable take, but conflicts with the above comment&#x27;s design point of a stack machine being both very simple for an interpreter and not an obstacle to quickly compiling to decent register-machine code. Needing a fancier stack-depth analysis would be that sort of obstacle.)')
