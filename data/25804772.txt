Companies and organisations go bankrupt but just seem to keep on going as normal? Bankrupt airlines flying people as normal for example? The NRA being bankrupt but still going? What&#x27;s up with that?<p>In the UK I think if you&#x27;re bankrupt (insolvent) then that&#x27;s it you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;re not trading anymore, and they will call in a third-party company to wrap you up and sell all your stuff and you&#x27;re not likely getting any money out of it as an owner or shareholder.')
