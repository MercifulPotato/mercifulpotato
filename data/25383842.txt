Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607678587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370559, text='&gt;I find the act of castrating an animal horrific, first because of the violation of its bodily autonomy and second because genitals are not just a piece of meat but alter how the brain works which to me means it&#x27;s also a violation of the mind. I think people who care about animals should think twice about having a pet if it means forcing that kind of procedure on a living being.<p>There are two different situations, though: preventing reproduction and preventing potentially undesirable hormone-fueled behavior. You don&#x27;t need to castrate just to prevent reproduction.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be anything wrong with performing a vasectomy, for example. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a similar analog for female animals, though.')
