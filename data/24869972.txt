It&#x27;s another thing to expect this to work for 95% of the freshman class at Random University. Many will ignore the videos or not mentally engage, muddle through the assignments or cheat. Others won&#x27;t have the meta-learning skills to identify where they&#x27;re stuck and resolve the confusion.<p>So I&#x27;m not quite sure what you have in mind when you say &quot;active teaching&quot;, but I completely agree at least with &quot;interactive&quot;. At least the TA staff hours-per-student has to scale linearly. Professor time probably does too, but as you say, it&#x27;s managerial.')
