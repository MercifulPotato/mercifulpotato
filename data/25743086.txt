That&#x27;s how something like CHAP works.<p>You&#x27;d actually end up hashing it twice. Once using the salt to go from plaintext to what the sever has stored and then again using the challenge.<p>It has problems though. The strength of your password hashing would be limited by what the weakest client could do, rather than what the server could do. Asymmetric encryption ends up being simpler.')
