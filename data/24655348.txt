Walk across the Colorado border and smoke weed - no problem, it&#x27;s completely legal. It&#x27;s also completely legal to spend your free time carting your AR-15 and Nazi flag down to the village square and recruiting supporters for your &quot;Turn America into a white ethnostate&quot; movement. The point I&#x27;m making is that not all criminal behavior is even widely considered objectionable and plenty of legal behavior is.<p>Thus, why would you consider having a criminal record to be &quot;a [big] blemish&quot; that justifies employment discrimination, yet no personal views extreme enough to allow an employer to disassociate from their employee?<p>When you consider that the ratio of those affected by criminal record-based employment discrimination to those impacted by twitter-based discrimination is on the order of <i>millions to one</i>, it seems strange to be more concerned about the latter than the former.')
