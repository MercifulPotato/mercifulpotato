This way they can see that you&#x27;re curious and trying to solve a problem even if you don&#x27;t know its solution beforehand. (And by looking at your attempts they your mind is even working in the right direction. They could give you small hints and observe how you process them.)<p>I never conducted interviews myself, but some years ago my supervisor asked me for advice on interview problems for his interns. He wanted something that will help spot a person inclined to algorithmic thinking, but the job was not 100% algorithmic, he needed programmers. If he asked me the same today, I would have advised him to look at these xor search problems.')
