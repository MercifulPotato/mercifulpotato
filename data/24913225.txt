In that context, it&#x27;s absolutely true.  I personally experienced this with google vs. all of the other portal search sites like yahoo, excite, etc - google loaded much faster, and on my shitty 28.8 modem that was a matter of minutes, sometimes.  So I switched to google.<p>The thing is - most web software isn&#x27;t comparison shopped.  It&#x27;s developed on contract.  I work at a company that does a lot of this, and, hypothetically, maybe we&#x27;d get hired to do an internal app for some retailer (imagine Best Buy or Walmart).  When you build something like that, there&#x27;s a gun to your head about time-to-deliver.  <i>They don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s good</i> â€” it&#x27;s just got to meet a &quot;reasonably decent&quot; metric of quality.  The only thing they really care about is getting it released on a certain timetable.<p>And all of this is because of contract law - timetables are provable breach-of-contract.  You promised you&#x27;d make something by February, but you weren&#x27;t done until April - that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s a provable failure-to-deliver.  That&#x27;s got financial penalties.   But quality?  Quality&#x27;s gotta be astoundingly bad to be &quot;provable&quot;.  &quot;Lag&quot; or &quot;the site&#x27;s kinda slow&quot; doesn&#x27;t hold up in a lawsuit.  (These things rarely lead to lawsuits, but do lead to &#x27;punishment&#x27; by a refusal to renew a contract, knowing that the contractor can&#x27;t sue the company because the contractor provably failed to deliver what was agreed on.)  So they optimize for what&#x27;s punishable according to the terms of the contract.<p>That&#x27;s why all of this corporate enterprise software sucks - because nobody gets punished if it&#x27;s slow or crappy; they just get punished if it&#x27;s late, or if it&#x27;s provably broken, because that&#x27;s the stuff that&#x27;s easy to pull out of a contract for.')
