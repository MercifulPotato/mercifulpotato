I use my 2018 2.6GHz i7 15” MBP with two 4K monitors plus the laptop monitor. It’s fine for me. (But I do believe you!)<p>If it’s useful: It’s fine here including reasonable loads on the video card, like <i>a lot</i> of GPU-accelerated terminals and pretty heavy use of a tiling window manager and Exposé window swishing. Or, say, Sketchup in a browser? Plus a pretty serious IntelliJ setup with the JVM’s stops pulled out, running ReasonML and C++ source compilation, and use of Docker.<p>It is sensitive to setup, and I <i>can</i> get it to spin its fans up. Docker is especially prone to wasted cycles. And I did seem to have to do some SMC resetting at one point because the fans were a little eager to get going. I also think it makes a bit of difference if I charge through the right-side ports rather than the left.<p>But the main point I’m attempting to make: I do think your case is solvable.<p>That said, I have felt that Apple are losing their way in some respects. The fact that there are fan issues with some machines and that it’s not clear how to solve them <i>is a problem with these machines</i>.')
