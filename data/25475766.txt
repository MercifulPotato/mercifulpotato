Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25476397], score=None, time=1608362386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475504, text='Suppose everybody gets a $12,000 credit (i.e. a UBI) and then everybody pays a universal 30% marginal rate.<p>If you make $20,000, your effective tax rate is -30% -- it&#x27;s negative, you got more than you paid. If you make $60,000, your effective tax rate is 10%. If you make a million dollars, your effective tax rate is 28.8%. This is what you want, progressive effective rates.<p>But anybody who makes a dollar, the government gets 30%. If growth of small businesses transfers a trillion dollars from billionaires to the working class, there is no reduction in government revenue. If growth of small businesses adds a trillion dollars of new value the economy, Congress &quot;profits&quot; just as much as adding a trillion dollars solely to Microsoft, so they wouldn&#x27;t have the incentive to prefer the latter.<p>Worth pointing out that we don&#x27;t actually have low marginal rates on the poor as a result of benefits phase outs -- the lowest marginal rates in practice are paid by the middle class. And then we unsurprisingly get federal policies that destroy the middle class to the benefit of billionaires and international corporations.')
