One may think that such data stores solve those problems; they don&#x27;t - they push it to the application.<p>Therefore, it takes many genius engineers-years... anyway. Solutions provided by the data stores, like FKs, just happen to solve the problem out of the box (where applicable, which of course, it&#x27;s not always the case).<p>The article actually mentions this, although not so dramatically :-)')
