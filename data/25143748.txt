There was more than 2000 systems in that portfolio to various hospitals under the same policy.<p>After checking with other employees if found the reason; they had to make sure the supplier did not have to many levels of sub contractors, and had to be close to the core development.\nSo not open source in it self, but open source was seen as a big red flag.')
