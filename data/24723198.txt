Well over half the country doesn&#x27;t trust the guy, and the international community basically doesn&#x27;t trust him at all.<p>Anyway, look at Belarus: a free and fair election was won by an ~%80 margin by a Trump-like figure. Big deal, he still is in the process of getting removed from office.<p>Macron just last week welcomed the 20% Belarus loser as the &quot;President-elect&quot; to France, and refuses to recognize the Trump-like winner. That&#x27;s Color Revolution 101: the election really doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is its <i>legitimacy</i>. Protests, the media, and any kind of election problems all help to delegitimatize an election, and allow Trump-like figures to be removed in the name of &quot;fairness.&quot; This playbook <i>works</i>.<p>As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, I think Biden will win big electorally, including on Nov. 3rd, so all of this ground-preparation will ultimately not be needed. Better safe than sorry thoughâ€¦')
