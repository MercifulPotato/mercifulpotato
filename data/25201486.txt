I badly wanted (and would have paid more for) a dumb TV, but couldn&#x27;t find any.  So I bought a smart TV and will simply never connect it to the internet.<p>But ... my new TV is Alexa enabled.  I guess that means that no matter how hard I work to keep the damn thing offline, if my neighbor has an Echo, my TV will exfiltrate it&#x27;s data on me completely circumventing my own network.<p>I try not to be a luddite, but good grief this is starting to feel like a sci-fi horror movie.  Pretty soon we&#x27;ll have to wrap our houses in a Faraday cage in hopes of maintaining some privacy.  That or be excluded from modern conveniences like &quot;television.&quot;')
