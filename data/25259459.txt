When they released the 2018 results tbey field did embrace it (for sure I&#x27;d consider the groups organizing CASP as at least forward thinking) but was still skeptical on how much more progress it can make; now they blow everyone&#x27;s minds again by a monumental leap and again people want to come say of course this is the last big jump!<p>I understand the self preservation instincts that kick in when there&#x27;s a suggestion that the entire field has been in a dark age for a while, but I hope you can see that there might be something fundamentally wrong with how research is done in academia and that is to blame for why this didn&#x27;t happen sooner, and why it&#x27;s so hard for many to embrace it.<p>Regarding your comments on the inapplicability of this current solution for docking, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the next project they&#x27;re taking up, and let&#x27;s see where that goes.<p>This is exactly the same type of progression that happened with Go, where when their software bet a professional player everyone&#x27;s like &quot;yeah but I bet he wasn&#x27;t that good&quot;. A few years later and Lee Sedol just decided to retire. I am interested to see what happens to that entire academic field in a similar vein, though my interests are more in knowing how science can advance from more people thinking this way.')
