They then say &quot;Much bigger problem than other forms of theft&quot;... Implying &quot;Much bigger problem than [all] other forms of theft&quot; instead of &quot;Much bigger problem than [some] other forms of theft&quot;.<p>And, if you&#x27;re going to go with broadly estimated (and somewhat questionable) numbers, then surely you need to consider the ~$50B estimated lost to retail theft each year.  Don&#x27;t just compare $933 million proven lost to wage theft to the over-precise $340,850,358 aggregated from <i>some</i> robbery reports (really, 9 sig figs?) and call it &quot;other theft&quot;.<p>Not to mention that that $933M &quot;recovered&quot; includes many cases of trebled damages...<p>Wage theft is important.  But make an honest case.')
