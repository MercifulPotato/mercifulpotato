So it ends up with a spectrum of &quot;he&#x2F;she worked here&quot; vs &quot;he&#x2F;she was REALLY good&quot; (in German).<p>I&#x27;ve come to the (sad) conclusion that review systems are inaccurate, even when well intended. There was likely a moment during their existence where they were accurate. I would guesstimate this moment is generally before it gained momentum. E.g. early days of IMDB, early days of Amazon, and early days of tbat German law mentioned earlier (I don&#x27;t know the name).<p>Since Metacritic is an aggregation of paid and amateur reviewers alike, it might very well be more accurate.')
