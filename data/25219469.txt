The difficulty isnâ€™t knowing what society wants, it is knowing the path to get there.<p>Now I am one of those people who does desire this from tech products.<p>But admittedly, the general population (&quot;people&quot;) does not care that much.<p>At least from my experience, people care more about the quality of the product and its ease of use. By far much more than the encryption of data etc...<p>This doesnt mean I don&#x27;t think companies should make efforts in this direction, but I think it&#x27;s important not to project these aspirations to more mainstream people who don&#x27;t care')
