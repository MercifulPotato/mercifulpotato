They prioritize safety over rushing to get a vaccine out the door. When the opportunity cost changes (i.e., there is a new global pandemic and lives are on the line) those institutions have trouble updating their behavior accordingly.<p>Conversely, authoritarian regimes are much more militant. You see this in China&#x27;s approach not only to the virus, but in audacious economic initiatives (e.g. Belt &amp; Road) and the defense of its political ideology on the world stage.<p>That mindset is actually similar to the democracies that have responded best to COVID. Israel (very much a &quot;wartime&quot; country - mandatory military service, surrounded by its enemies, etc.) is blowing the rest of the world out of the water in its vaccination implementation. In normal times, it is a powerhouse of innovation, largely due to elite technological groups in the military. South Korea (another country with mandatory military service, enemy with nukes to the north) had a great COVID response. And Taiwan, a country that faces constant existential threat from China,<p>&gt; [E]xhibited the exact same sort can-do attitude alongside a free press, elections, and pig intestines in the legislature.<p>The US last had a &quot;wartime&quot; mindset during WW2. Many of the innovations in the following period (nuclear physics, space race, computers, etc.) can be directly attributed to the massive mobilization effort and public-private partnerships of the time.<p>So the question to ask is: How do we cultivate the wartime mindset that leads to innovation? And if COVID can&#x27;t catalyze this, what can?')
