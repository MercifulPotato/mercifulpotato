Two big annoyances jump out at first glance: it assumes you want to use port 22120, and it puts its config in ~&#x2F;22120-arc. Maybe both of these are configurable, but the directory is a terrible default. Use XDG (~&#x2F;.config&#x2F;22120) or <i>at least</i> use a hidden directory in the home dir. And the port it operates on should be completely configurable. Naming the project 22120 is a terrible idea, and assuming that port won&#x27;t need to change is bad practice.<p>I&#x27;m not making any value judgment about the actual tool. It sounds interesting enough. But it should behave better.')
