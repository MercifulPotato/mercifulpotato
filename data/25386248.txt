If the battery moved a little too much, the computer would shut down.<p>So she sent it in for service.  When she got the computer back, they had replaced the entire bottom of the computer, plus replaced the battery.  Great, right?  Except now the bottom of the computer is a different color than the top of the computer, and the battery is a 3rd color!<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous, but that&#x27;s the thing you get with plastic.  UV light changes the color over time.')
