Reagan lowered taxes, increasing  the incentive to move money out of your buisness and into other investments. Globalism startedly picking up, meaning a lot of wage growth for the lower classes was outsorced to other countries instead of kept in America. The graph doesnâ€™t capture how total employee compensation has risen a bit more than in that graph due to the explosion of costs in the American Medical sector eating up a lot of the potential compensation increase. Perhaps most importantly, Reagan began the attack on unions, resulting in there being less ability on the employee side to argue for increased wages. You could argue the massive money printing starting with the Iraq wars and going through the 2008 crisis has led to a massive funneling of that created money to the upper class, further increasing the inequality, and further exacerbated again by the death on unions meaning workers had less advocates in washington arguing for the lower classes to get a piece of that pie.')
