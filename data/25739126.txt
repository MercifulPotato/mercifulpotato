Item(by='manfredo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610406144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734660, text='&gt; The NYTimes is a centrist liberal publication that is widely reviled by anyone on the left.<p>This is a very different characterization than what most people would offer.<p>The New York Times is a staunchly left publication, and the past few years have seen the few centrist people at the company driven out (e.g. Bari Weiss). It is definitely not &quot;reviled by anyone on the left&quot;, it&#x27;s by far one of the most widely read publications among liberals.<p>I say this as a lifelong Democrat and liberal. This seems like one of those statements that only olds true when one draws the line between the left and right such that the overwhelming majority (easily &gt;90%) are categorized on the right.<p>&gt; People who two weeks ago would claim that companies should drive out employees who disagree with them, now wish these companies were subject to the will of the people.<p>Can you elaborate on what this is referring to? If you&#x27;re talking about Coinbase, the company was asking employees to check their activism - of any political leaning - at the door. Not that people should be driven out. In fact, a big part of why this was well received is because often times activism in the company leads to employees trying to drive each other out.')
