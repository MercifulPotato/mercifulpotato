They just simply change the UX and features for products for seemingly no reason. e.g on Android, when I want to save a link to Pocket, I&#x27;d use the share button and it&#x27;d pop a list of all the apps I could share to. Now that has disappeared and has been replaced with a smaller list of apps(4-5) and the most recently used app to share or the most frequently used (pocket in either case) is not on this list. I have to scroll to the right and click on more apps.<p>Another example - on Android the pull down settings menu has now changed such that the list of apps is again restricted. I have to pull it twice to see the full list.<p>I&#x27;ve been holding onto Android for a while now but Google is trying their best to make me to iOS.')
