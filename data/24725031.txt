Foo was declared as a public class, but was it meant for public consumption? Or is it intended for internal use, and was only declared public because, for practical reasons, it couldn&#x27;t be declared package-private?<p>Moreover, there are certainly rational distinctions that <i>could</i> be drawn, but that does not mean that they are legally relevant. The issue at hand really doesn&#x27;t have anything at all to do with how programmers understand things. The law is not what we think is right, the law is what is written in the books.')
