AIUI, Google was annoyed at people meddling with DNS results, and with ISPs providing terrible DNS performance for their customers.<p>Google wins when the Internet is fast.  Google&#x27;s goals here are that you can use Websearch quickly and without hotspots etc meddling with traffic.  The story is simple: If companies meddle with DNS results, or provide poor performance, then users don&#x27;t use the Internet as much, and Google doesn&#x27;t get to sell ads.  Google wants you to have the fastest, most reliable Internet it can, because that means you don&#x27;t get frustrated and go do something else.    Google doesn&#x27;t need to scrape the logs for whatever people think google might be scraping the logs for.<p>Google _does_ log some data for dealing with abuse (as you can probably imagine 8.8.8.8 gets a _lot_ of intentional and unintentional abuse), but tries to be as clear as it can be about what gets logged, what it&#x27;s used for, and how long it&#x27;s kept.  Google treats these logs very very carefully, carefully limiting who has access, and when you need to use the logs to debug something, it&#x27;s very carefully audited.<p>Disclaimer: I used to be one of the SREs oncall for Google Public DNS (but not any more â€“ I now work for a different SRE team at Google).')
