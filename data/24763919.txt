Dutch people tend to not capitalise their Ds in surnames. When only mentioning the surname, it is treated as a mini-sentence, hence the capitalisaiton.<p>In northern Belgium (AKA Flanders), Dutch speakers tend to capitalise their Ds in surnames, so you would see &quot;De Zwart&quot; regardless of where it appears in the sentence. In case you&#x27;re wondering: yes, there are quite a few surnames that exist both in The Netherlands with &quot;de&quot; and in Belgium with &quot;De&quot;. The same goes for &quot;van&quot; (of) and &quot;vander&#x2F;van der&quot; (of the), for instance.<p>Then again, if they&#x27;re nobility, they might not capitalise the &quot;de&quot; because it might be the French &quot;of&quot; as opposed to the Dutch &quot;de&quot;, meaning &quot;the&quot;. Confusing stuff.')
