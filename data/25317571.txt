One side will point out all the bad ways censorship can be used, and then the other side will point out the misinformation that spreads when there is absolute free speech.<p>The thing is, both sides are right. However, neither side ever talks about trying to take any steps to mitigate the negatives of their position.<p>I am anti-censorship, but I think that people on our side can&#x27;t just ignore the damage misinformation is causing our society right now. We also can&#x27;t just rely on the old adage that &quot;the truth will win out in the end&quot;. Free speech advocates like to believe that is a truism, but the evidence keeps showing us that that isn&#x27;t true. There is nothing inevitable about the truth, and lies have many advantages that can often prevent the truth from winning.<p>So what do we do? I am much more interested in talking about steps we can take to mitigate and prevent misinformation while preserving free speech.<p>Just because censorship isn&#x27;t a good option doesn&#x27;t mean we should just throw up our hands and allow misinformation to win the day. The truth needs allies, and allies with a strategy.')
