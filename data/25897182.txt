You can&#x27;t rely entirely on learning translations to learn a language, and in some ways it can really hold you back if you think of things as having a 1-1 mapping with English. Especially when dealing with languages without a common ancestor with English, like Japanese, where a lot of concepts just don&#x27;t line up.<p>For example, in Japanese there&#x27;s not a direct equivalent to the word &quot;to give&quot;. There are different words depending on the relationship between the people, and at a basic level, you always have to &quot;give upwards&quot; or &quot;give downwards&quot;, with different words for each.<p>I could see this kind of method of teaching being really useful for learning those kinds of concepts. I think learning the Japanese words directly, without getting hung up on what their English translations are, could avoid some pitfalls.<p>I&#x27;m less sure about how useful it is for the real basic basics. But it&#x27;s a cool concept none the less.')
