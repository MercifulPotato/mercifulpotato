Jack Ma&#x27;s share is not significant is known several years ago, because a. he was generous in given shares to people and that works better for BABA b. BABA hasn&#x27;t been profitable for long time and has taken several rounds of VC money. These were the days without now common A &#x2F; B class share structure. That was why BABA chose to use the innovative &quot;partnership&quot; structure to retain control (and also getting rid of Yahoo Japan&#x27;s controlling shares) when IPOing.<p>2. private ownership != currency reserves. <i>IF</i> CCP is running low on currency reserves (which they don&#x27;t at the moment, it was a few years back, since then they strengthened capital control), they can force the companies to pulling money back to the mainland, i.e. pumping up USD reserve and given out CNY to these companies. They don&#x27;t need ownership. In fact, this happened to Wanda and Hainai Airlines a few years ago, when they invested aggressively overseas, and has since then pulled back the capital (sold these oversea assets) to mainland.<p>The art of dictatorship is strange, and requires much better understanding than just &quot;evil takes over private ownership&quot;.')
