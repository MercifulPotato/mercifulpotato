The value being left on the table has grown year over year and that doesn&#x27;t seem likely to change anytime soon. We&#x27;re rapidly approaching a point where crime happens because you&#x27;re either too poor for the tech or you wanted it to happen, medicine is waking up to the potential of constant biometric collection&#x2F;analysis, and people are being showered in free and useful software because the the first time in history they&#x27;re valuable just for existing. To contrast this, digital privacy makes everything a bit harder while protecting people from parties that just want to seek them things they&#x27;ll enjoy and state actors who aren&#x27;t really compelled by much more than the honor system to respect instructions to change their ways. Eventually the mountain of potential is going to simply eclipse the perceived benefits.')
