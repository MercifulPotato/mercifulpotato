If you have to buy your t-shirts in bulk, that sounds to be like they wear out way too fast.<p>Instead of buying cheap cotton shirts in bulk, try buying a few good merino wool t-shirts from a responsible manufacturer, locally produced under much better labor conditions. It will also impact the environment less, partly because cotton production uses ridiculous amounts of water and partly because you&#x27;re not having products shipped to you from halfway around the globe.<p>A merino wool t-shirt will be more comfortable, last longer and be more resistant to dirt and odors, as well as regulate temperature much better. For normal day-to-day use, you can alternate between two shirts. Hang the shirt in the bathroom while you shower, then air it out in your bedroom for 24h. You&#x27;ll find that it doesn&#x27;t hold on to odors, because the wool isn&#x27;t absorbent like cotton. Give it a quick shake and wear it for another day, letting the other shirt air out.<p>Carry on-only travelers swear by merino wool because it&#x27;s generally lighter than cotton and because you can wear it for several days or even a week like this. If you&#x27;re not squeamish, you can even do this same routine with underwear, too.<p>People are so obsessed with quantity now, perhaps because it&#x27;s an easily measured property. Try going for quality instead :-)')
