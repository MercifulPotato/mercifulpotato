There are many compression artifacts that could be used similarly (e.g. does a 1 bit increase in average screen color is rarely going to be perceptible).<p>Regarding hi&#x2F;low pass, theoretically this should be fairly simple to defeat by spreading the information across multiple frames.<p>Note: I know next to nothing about watermarking, my comment is just a purely hypothetical attack on your trivial assumption. The trivial work around has trivial work around work around... ;) &lt;insert that scene from the big hit&gt;')
