So in that sense you trust the binaries you download, or the source code that you compile. The advantage of PoW consensus is that it&#x27;s much easier to tell the real chain from a fake one, as the latter will not have much more work performed on it.<p>Even with the genesis block fixed, control of the initial keys embedded in it allows you to generate arbitrary alternative blockchain histories that without PoW are difficult to distinguish from the &quot;real&quot; one.')
