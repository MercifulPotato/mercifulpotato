Not perfect (they can still log your DNS history), but it definitely prevents any interception or malicious code stealing passwords. DNS is a lot simpler than blocking extensions.<p>That being said, I do like Firefox&#x27;s built-in tracker protection. I&#x27;d like to see more efforts like Firefox&#x27;s canvas permission in the future, it definitely helps fight fingerprinting.<p>I guess Epiphany&#x27;s lack of extension support works to my advantage in some areas.')
