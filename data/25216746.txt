I usually run it as a local systemd user service.<p>My only issue is with MFA. To set it up you&#x27;ll need to dig through the stdout&#x2F;logs to get the initial &quot;add app&quot;&#x2F;Auth URL. After that the push notifications from the Microsoft Authenticator work as expected.<p>If you&#x27;re not using push based MFA I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll work, you might need to dig through the logs to grab the URL each time. If it was me I&#x27;d probably setup another script to sit watching the log, extract the MFA URL and send a notification with lib notify.<p>So yeah, a little janky to set up (yay for proprietary protocols) but you can then use whatever email client you like and manipulate it as you need.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;davmail.sourceforge.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;davmail.sourceforge.net&#x2F;</a>')
