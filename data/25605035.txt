Item(by='mwcampbell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609523417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599910, text='&gt; The kind reading of this comment is that 20 years after we started having this conversation, we  still have failed to educate developers on how to use a button. That is something that&#x27;s valid to  be sad about, it reflects nothing on the developer in question. It&#x27;s a failure of web education.<p>Thank you. I&#x27;m embarrassed at how melodramatic that part of my original comment was, but I&#x27;m glad someone gets it.')
