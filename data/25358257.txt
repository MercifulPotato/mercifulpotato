That&#x27;s why I stopped bothering with Linux. I love Linux and I&#x27;ve used it on many laptops. But not a single one offered me trouble free computing. I can&#x27;t blame Linux for that. It&#x27;s amazing what the open source community has achieved. I hate Windows and I can&#x27;t be productive on it. People who have used Apple&#x27;s ecosystem know what the phrase &quot;it just works&quot; means. I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend $899 (Australian dollars) on those headphones. But my wife recently bought a pair of Airpod pros and I&#x27;ve never had an experience like that with any other earphones! They just work. It feels like Apple just knows what we want! I still use a three year old iPhone 8 and it just works with latest OS updates. It hasn&#x27;t slowed down a bit. Why do I need to buy a POS Android phone with 12 gb of ram when I&#x27;m happy. Apple&#x27;s products actually have that zen feeling. It&#x27;s hard to describe. And the longevity of their products make them really good value for money.')
