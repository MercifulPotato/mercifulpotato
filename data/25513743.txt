In theory, if the entire organism is just a long RNA strand, there is no need for proteins or lipid bilayers. How such an organism emerged in the first place is already quite hard to know.<p>Actually lipid bilayers are extremely complicated as they have to filter what gets into the cell and what doesn&#x27;t, as well as what might leave it. Earlier systems might have done without them and instead attached everything onto long chain like structures... You know like a keychain. Both RNA and Proteins are long chains so maybe that&#x27;s how they evolved.')
