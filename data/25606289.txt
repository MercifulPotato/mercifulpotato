Am now enrolled in uni to finish my bach in CS, which is also where I work.<p>Have also began to learn about investing in 2020 and have had a lot of fun doing that. Highly recommend the Investing for Beginners podcast with Andrew Sather and Dave Ahern if you don&#x27;t know anything (like me).<p>Not afraid to say I&#x27;ve been contributing time to a nonprofit arts organization in my area, and have gotten on its board of directors. I run their web site and we&#x27;re doing a frontend overhaul&#x2F;server swap&#x2F;Cloudflare DNS setup this month. Admittedly a bit scared because I&#x27;ve done this on my own setups but not on a site that gets traffic. Onward to 2021!')
