No web, no embedded, no Linux, no Windows, no nothing. Only Mac OS software, iPhone apps, etc. I am exaggerating slightly, but you get the idea.<p>Or when you do, you use your Mac OS laptop as a terminal. Or at best, something to run VMs, and in both cases you don&#x27;t develop with Apple OS &#x2F; tools, it&#x27;s just hosting or giving you non-integrated access to completely different systems.<p>Apple things are a pretty much distinct and closed ecosystem, and one which is quite limited to (some) endpoints.')
