On margin would be reasonable, if the volatility of the stock becomes very high, the broker is taking a credit risk on its client it may not want (plus suitability consideration). It may also make sense to restrict access to certain stocks if they are deemed too complicated&#x2F;dangerous to retail investors. But I doubt the suitability would be a function of a market movement.<p>Or is the platform assuming that its clients are doing market manipulation by coordinating on reddit to push the price up, and wants no part to a crime being committed.<p>Just speculating, but can think of some reasonable reasons.')
