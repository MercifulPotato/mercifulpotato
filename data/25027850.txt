These companies then farm these people out at their actual value.<p>Many other comments echo it too. This is wrong.<p>The outsourcing companies use H-1Bs mostly as local liaisons for their remote teams. They all have businesses that annually generate _billions_ of dollars in revenue. That revenue is generated by the labor arbitrage between countries, not shaving off few dollars per hour in the wages of their H-1B employees.<p>The real wage abuse comes from the tail of the distribution - staffing companies, owned and operated by American citizens. Many of these citizens were immigrants originally. If you look at the cases DOJ has brought against H-1B abuses, you will notice that many of these people operate _multiple_ companies. Each of these companies get only few H-1Bs per year, but as an aggregate they get a significant portion of the H-1B quota annually.<p>If wage abuse is the concern, blaming outsourcers is barking up the wrong tree, IMO.')
