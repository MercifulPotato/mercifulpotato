I have been following the rust-avr fork for litterally years now, and it just got merged. It&#x27;s still highly unreliable though, and Harvard architecture related bugs can make you pull your hairs.<p>If the rust community is going to promote embedded rust, it would be good to invest some effort in a wider spectrum of architectures. The language itself should be mature enough to take a break. Expanding the architecture range would be very welcome by a lot of people.')
