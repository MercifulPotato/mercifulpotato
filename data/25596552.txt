If we use a null_resource that has the hashes of the source code files as a trigger, then in the `local-exec` provisioner of the null_resource, we can run the build. The build can also be run remotely (we use google cloud build) to be independent of the developer&#x27;s machine architecture and operating system, which is important for native dependencies. Terraform will not re-run the null resource provisioner so long as the source code does not change, there is no need for a reproducible build.')
