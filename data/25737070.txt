Item(by='sequoia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610399493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732040, text='Yes they are not one entity, and yet they all more or less <i>simultaneously</i> decided trump (and parler) “violate our TOS.” It’s precisely this sort of collusion, with the figleaf of “our TOS” (give me a break, these were acts of political expediency not previously unknown TOS violations that all suddenly came to light) that I find alarming. If he&#x2F;parler were kicked off one or two places it wouldn’t be as scary. It’s the blackout from social network to app stores all the way down to web infrastructure that I found shocking.<p>If it’s hard to get upset about trump&#x2F;parler getting banned, just sub in <i>your</i> favourite political or artistic group and gauge your reaction.')
