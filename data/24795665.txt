We&#x27;re talking about shifting funds to those and let police do what they have been trained for.<p>On that, as an aside... I will say that as black-belt in Aikido, I remain flabbergasted that police officers are not taught <i>simple</i> techniques to subdue or disable people&#x2F;threats without resorting to deadly force.<p>To your original post I will also say that owning a gun does not make you and your family impervious to crime! You cannot protect your family with a gun, it doesn&#x27;t give your family a bullet proof shield. On the contrary you will likely escalate a situation.')
