Antibody recognition is still possible with the found mutant:<p>&quot;To determine whether 501Y.V2 is still recognized by non-neutralizing antibodies, the binding of polyclonal sera (from Fig.2a) to a recombinant 501Y.V2 RBD+SBD1 protein and an RBD+SBD1 from the original lineage was assessed by ELISA (Fig.2b). These data revealed that binding of polyclonal plasma to 501Y.V2 RBD+SBD1 was only substantially affected in a minority of cases (14 of 44 with â‰¥five-fold reduction, 32%). Most of the convalescent plasma&#x2F;serum suffered less than four-fold reductions in total binding activity (as measured by area under the curve), suggesting a considerable non-neutralizing antibody component are still able to bind the 501Y.V2 spike antigen&quot;<p>Its also worth to note that only 44 plasma samples were used from individuals out of a population where the virus probably originated.')
