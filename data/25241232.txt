On a brand-new set with perfect tolerances, you might be able to use many of the front side of many of the teeth, but as SOON as the chain begins to stretch (wear) even fractionally, most of the stress goes to the &#x27;first&#x27; teeth in any given power stroke, and the same spot on the chain. I imagine if you&#x27;re putting, say, 1000w through 2 teeth and 2-4 chain endplates, wear is an order of magnitude higher than if you&#x27;re able to effectively transfer power through double the teeth and endplates.<p>Likely the &quot;pins rubbing&quot; you mention doesn&#x27;t really matter, because the wear from inserting and removing the chain as it cycles around has to be a miniscule fraction of the wear that occurs under load.')
