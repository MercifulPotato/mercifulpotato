In the movie they say that JSTOR didn’t prosecute though, and that it was some government entity that wanted to make an example out of Aaron. Sorry I don’t remember which one - I’d have to scan the subtitle file. I wrote this because I’m quite against the current Intellectual Property system (the US one, and the US-inspired global one: TRIPS).<p>My comment was intended more as a critique of the fact that the IP monopoly-granting system is part of American state yet it undermines democracy.
