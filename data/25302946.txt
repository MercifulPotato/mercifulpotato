If that&#x27;s the problem you&#x27;re getting, then it is indeed testing basic programming skills. But the general landscape has gone far beyond this. Nowadays this solution would probably not get you the job. Instead of sorting, you should create hashmaps storing counts of each character and checking equality of the hashmaps. And if you didn&#x27;t produce the hashmaps solution within 10 minutes, you would not be competitive with the hoardes of people drilling these problems and thus producing the hashmaps solution within 5 minutes. What most people here are complaining about are being expected to solve significantly harder problems within tight timeframes. If you are interested in what these ridiculous problems can be, go to Leetcode and browse the &quot;Hard&quot; problems.')
