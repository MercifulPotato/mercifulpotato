The goal is to weigh the need to save lives with the need to let society continue functioning.<p>I agree with you so far...<p>&gt; That is where the essential worker argument comes into play.<p>This is where you lose me. As I understand it, essential workers can continue working whether or not they&#x27;re vaccinated (yes, some will get seriously sick, but it won&#x27;t significantly impact the economy). Rather, we want to vaccinate them earlier than non-essential workers <i>because they&#x27;re more vulnerable</i> by the riskier nature of their work. However, they&#x27;re not more vulnerable than the elderly and yet the CDC recommends prioritizing them over the elderly because the elderly are disproportionately white while essential workers are disproportionately non-white. At least, this is how I understand the argument.')
