I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a tough thread, but something about this response rubs me the wrong way. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s really addressing the change (eg. why is it worth _existing_ customers to be paying an extra 0.5%? The fact that Stripe added features for new customers doesn&#x27;t really impact those of us who have been with you for 5-10 years). Additionally, I don&#x27;t recall getting an email about the price increase.<p>I genuinely don&#x27;t even know: am I going to be seeing this price increase? Would have liked getting an email about something like this, rather than finding out on HN, and now having to dig into things to figure out if I&#x27;m actually affected (which I presume I am).<p>To give you a comparison: if my bank or credit card company increased their rate, I&#x27;d expect to be (and am) notified of that.<p>My two cents :)')
