But maybe you need just a single function.<p>And maybe such a single function is currently already provided by the browser APIs.<p>Or maybe there are packages of individual functions of JQuery? But that would serve little purpose IF the functionality is provided by current browsers.<p>In any case I think the article serves a good purpose in explaining what are the most useful parts of JQuery and how you could implement them yourself with the more modern browsers if and when you need them.<p>My preference is to avoid dependencies if I can and prefer depending on my own code which uses standard APIs if possible.')
