There are apparently over 65&#x27;000 names on the sure-to-be-approved list, and parents can argue for their own. There were 86&#x27;000 births last year, and I&#x27;m pretty sure names follow a Zipfish law, so I bet there&#x27;s a long tail of approved names that weren&#x27;t even used. (top 200 names account for 21&#x27;000 boys and 16&#x27;000 girls)<p>Some freedoms I can think of off the top of my head that weren&#x27;t true of the states last century (that I find more important than naming):<p>- freedom to <i>effectively</i> vote for candidates from a multitude of political parties.<p>- freedom to roam.<p>- freedom to open retail bank accounts in any major currency.<p>- freedom to talk back to cops without (any, let alone mortal) reprisal.<p>- freedom (not in my commune, but in nearby jurisdictions) to pay taxes in cryptocurrency.<p>- freedom to distill my own schnapps, drink it out of an open container in the middle of a public road, in front of cops, while driving (the last is an exaggeration, but pedantically true).<p>And a freedom-from that&#x27;s important to me: on the few occasions I have to go to the big city, I know that the homeless-looking guy I see downtown <i>has</i> an apartment. He just looks like he&#x27;s been sleeping on the streets.')
