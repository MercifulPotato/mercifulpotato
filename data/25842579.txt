If you&#x27;re making arguments based on really really shaky data you should not be making them at all. Comparing OECD regions to Chinese administrative metro areas is really quite absurd. The variance in Montr√©al for example depending on what you call a city can be almost 2x.<p>For example, if you take the Tokyo Metro Area, you find a GDP per capita of 48k, with a PPP ratio of 0.98 we get 48k USD PPP.<p>Comparing it to the Beijing Metro Area you have a 39k USD PPP.<p>This took around 4 minutes to do for the two cities, so I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a quantity of rigor you should pay for, nor an unreasonable amount of scrutiny for an internet comment at all. I was just trying to get the commenter to realize the issue with using two completely different data series in a comparison.<p>You can also compare for example Jiangsu and South Kanto to find similar numbers.')
