We&#x27;ve been profitably shipping complete ML products for enterprise clients for many years now. Throughout these years, we&#x27;ve discovered patterns and inefficiencies that slowed us down, threatened the success of our projects, and overall made them more expensive than they ought to be.<p>It has collaborative notebooks, long-running notebook scheduling that survives network disruptions and closed tabs (you can view them while running without opening Jupyter), automatic experiment tracking for metrics, parameters, and models, and seamless deployment into a REST API. It also enables you to publish a notebook into a parametrized AppBook to allow domain experts to interact with it without being overwhelmed by the notebook interface, and to change parameters without mutating the notebook. Their runs are also tracked.<p>We&#x27;re focused on solving actual problems we have faced on paid projects, as opposed to the infinity of features one can build to solve imaginary problems.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>')
