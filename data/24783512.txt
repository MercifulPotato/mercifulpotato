Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=[24783531], score=None, time=1602722743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783457, text='&gt; I believe modern application of a law should matter more than what the writers of the law were potentially thinking at the time.<p>Section 230 has never been <i>applied</i> this way. Some people want to change it, but they haven&#x27;t yet. There is no legal precedent that those people have to stand behind.<p>You&#x27;re asking the courts to <i>change</i> the law based on executive preference. That&#x27;s dangerous for a wide variety of reasons (ex-post-facto-ness, separation of powers, etc.)<p>In case you didn&#x27;t understand the parent, section 230 was written to fix the issue that prodigy had. All section 230 does is protect people who moderate content from civil liability. That&#x27;s it. The law itself doesn&#x27;t distinguish platforms or publishers. It distinguishes first-party and third-party content (and gives you protection for third party content, even if you publish first party content and moderate the third party content). That&#x27;s all.<p>Nothing about platforms or publishers, and nothing about categorizing a company as one or the other. Only protection around certain kinds of content.')
