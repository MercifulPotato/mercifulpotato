Some noses are kinda triangular; some are broad and flat... I can&#x27;t think of a nose shape that even remotely looks like a phallus.  Freud had an obsession with phalluses, and saw them in everything.  Are eyelashes phallic?  Are necks phallic?  Is the upper lip phallic?  What about chins?  I think chins are at least as phallic as noses.  Freud was a dang weirdo.')
