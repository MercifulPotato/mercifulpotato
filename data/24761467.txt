Just add labor. Sort of like buying a lego kit that you know has all the pieces to build a Millenium Falcon out of.<p>Pre-fab: Important&#x2F;time-consuming elements are constructed off-site and transported in a (nearly) ready to assemble state to the site. Sort of like having the Lego factory assemble the 7 major parts of the Millenium Falcon, and sending those to you so you can just connect them to each other to have the final product.<p>As I understand it, the Sears homes were kit homes by those definitions, not prefab. E.g. you would receive a bunch of 2x4s in a railroad car, not a ready-built wall you could just raise into place. Kit homes can also be pre-fab homes, but I don&#x27;t think the terms are interchangeable and not all kit homes are pre-fab.')
