Mainly because when I buy a TV it generally lasts for 10 years or so. My current Sony TV (around 10 years old) came with some &quot;apps&quot;, none of which now work. Which I&#x27;m fine with. But what happens when that&#x27;s the main OS for the TV? I&#x27;d much rather buy a new chromecast or firetv every few years to get the latest experience.')
