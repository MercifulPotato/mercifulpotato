It&#x27;s because they can get away with their abusive business practices that a fairer competitor can&#x27;t exist.<p>I don&#x27;t think buying stuff from someone who sells to the public is abusive. I don&#x27;t think scraping is abusive. I do think workers&#x27; rights are important, but the restaurant industry (<i>especially</i> the mon-and-pop end of it) hardly has a great reputation on that front, so I don&#x27;t think ordering directly rather than DoorDash sends a message there.<p>&gt; IME, delivery-wise, most restaurants are pretty interchangeable, and people make the decision on price.<p>Well, if that&#x27;s true then why care which of those interchangeable restaurants succeed and which fail?<p>&gt; So &quot;stick to your USP and outsource everything else&quot; means that you should outsource cooking to a ghost kitchen and just focus on maintaining a brand. Which is something we start to see happening.<p>&gt; I fear the end game is still going to be DoorDash &amp; friends just contracting or operating their own ghost kitchens, and creating hundreds of fake &quot;brands&quot; that are all sourced from the same kitchens.<p>Am I supposed to think there&#x27;s something bad about &quot;ghost kitchens&quot;? If it means better, cheaper food, then surely it&#x27;s a good thing.<p>If everything&#x27;s being sourced from the same kitchens then that&#x27;s a monoculture that&#x27;s easy to compete with by offering something better. If those centrally sourced kitchens end up being so high quality that no-one can compete, well, mission accomplished.')
