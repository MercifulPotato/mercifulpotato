Engineers are expensive and businesses choose what is most productive for them to what customers respond to.  Also performance work is not fun and more work than new features.  Performance bugs are harder to detect and quantify than normal crash bugs and such because they are statistical ranges, not binary on off states.<p>Performance is taken into account when it matters for the product, you&#x27;ll notice this in games where they do a lot of perf improvement work.<p>Also swift &amp; rust are slow due to their design as a language.  They provide very strong guarantees and make a lot of thing static.  It&#x27;s very similar to the reasons why C++ is slow to compile.<p>Also notion is like 10 engineers last time I checked, and they&#x27;ve decided to go towards speed of dev &amp; features more than nicer, but slower to develop tools.')
