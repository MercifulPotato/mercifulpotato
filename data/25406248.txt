The book industry by itself is somewhat in a state of limbo.<p>Goodreads is basically the only major social network for bookworms, yet the majority of its users hate it (including me), but are forced to use it to their chagrin.<p>You would think that would make the market ripe for a disruptor to arrive and topple the incumbent leader, yet each year nothing happens.<p>I personally have also thought of making a new rival product, but when you do the math on the market potential and the financial benefits, I just don&#x27;t see a viable way.<p>People who read books, even if they read them every day, won&#x27;t use your social network each day since books by themselves are the type of content which is consumed the longest (compared to a movie, tv show, song, or video game).<p>So you have a social network where users come back on a whim, even if you read like a maniac and try to read one book per week (I tried it one year, it was crazy, you are basically spending all your free time reading), even then users wouldn&#x27;t use your app each day, but perhaps once or twice a week, and who knows how much time would the average session last?<p>To make things worse, you could maybe even get away with users using your app once a week if you have a big enough market (user base), but the number of book readers is not that great (especially compared to other media consumption)... The median American reads 4 books a year [1], or simply put, one book in three months.<p>So you have a social network where users don&#x27;t need to use it often and there aren&#x27;t a lot of users, that already spells trouble, but there is another major issue.<p>You could even succeed with those issues if you had a highly commoditized product to advertise, let&#x27;s say a social network for yacht lovers, even if you have a small number of users and they do not use it much, you can still manage to succeed with it, since if you advertise yachts to potential yacht owners, you have a very valuable marketing channel which is worth quite an amount to the right people.<p>You can see where I am going with this, just compare a 5% commission on a yacht, vs a 5% commission on a book...\nUnfortunately books are not so highly valued (in monetary terms) nor sought after.<p>To sum up, you have a social network where users don&#x27;t spend a lot of time, you don&#x27;t have a lot of users and it is centered around a low profit product... \nOf course Goodreads has no competition, no sane person would touch that market with a ten foot pole.<p>Yet, to quote George Bernard Shaw, &quot;all progress depends on the unreasonable man&quot;. If someone manages to solve this problem and find a profitable way to survive, I would not be surprised to see Goodreads fall.<p>I even thought of contacting Scribd to work with them, since I think they might have the best shot currently to position themselves as market leaders. They have an excellent product (Netflix for books) and already have a well sized user base. Would be interesting to see them expand and also became a social network for book lovers.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bustle.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-many-books-did-the-average-american-read-in-the-last-year-this-new-study-may-surprise-you-8837851" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bustle.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-many-books-did-the-average-amer...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;536961-the-reasonable-man-adapts-himself-to-the-world-the-unreasonable" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;536961-the-reasonable-man-a...</a>')
