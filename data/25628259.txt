Lost tens of pounds after they drained his belly of fluids - we&#x27;ll have to see what happens next.<p>So yes, some are lucky, others - not so much. Either way, why risk it? It&#x27;s like with smokers, you&#x27;ll find a bunch of 80-90 year olds that have smoked daily since they were 12, but lots of others didn&#x27;t make it.<p>As for OP, I have no idea what his drinking pattern is. But the only think that concerns me is the frequency of his drinks, especially if he&#x27;s somewhat young. This is a pattern that can become hard to break out of, and can get worse with age.')
