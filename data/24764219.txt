We&#x27;ve working hard to reduce the complexity and will continue to do so. For example:<p>- ConstraintsStreams (instead of DRL) to declare incremental constraints easily in plain Java (or another JVM language). No need to learn the Drools Rule Language any more.<p>- Autoconfiguration (no need for solverConfig.xml unless you want to power tweak) thanks to our Quarkus extension or Spring Boot starter.<p>- SolverManager that manages Solver threads for you. Great to avoid HTTP REST timeouts or to solve multiple problems.<p>Coming soon:<p>- Code completion (XSD) when power tweaking the solverConfig.xml<p>- Simplified VRP model')
