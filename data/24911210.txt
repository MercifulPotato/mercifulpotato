For example... when a new altitude is assigned by ATC, say FL300, the pilot flying will spin it in the selector window and keep his hand or finger there until the second pilot agrees with and confirms the selection by reading FL300 out of the selector window.<p>I know there are meat bags in these giant tubes so that changes attitudes towards safety etc. However, it seems to me that when organizations start putting the power to halt nearly the entire business in the hands of one person, there should be some slightly different attitudes. A breaking change in a million servers could easily cost hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions in lost revenue or employee productivity.<p>I&#x27;m just an outsider though. Perhaps this level of attention is practiced at some shops. It&#x27;s just interesting to me how in some fields we settle on pretty uniform standard practices whereas others are seen as non-human-life threatening so it&#x27;s just shoot first, ask questions later.')
