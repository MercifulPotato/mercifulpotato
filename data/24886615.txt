We were dealing solely with Pound Sterling (100 pence make a pound).  As part of the API requirements, they were asked to solely deal with pence in integers.  They ignored the requirements and used pounds in floats.<p>This caused rounding errors here and there.  We spotted the problem as soon as we heard about the rounding errors, and asked them to correct it.  Later on, our customer asked us why the items that cost £1.85 were being charged correctly, but the items that cost £1.90 were being charged at 19p.<p>Turns out that rather than doing anything sensible, they took the float, converted it to a string, stripped out the period, then converted the string to an integer.  So £1.85 became &quot;1.85&quot;, then &quot;185&quot;, then 185p, but £1.90 became &quot;1.9&quot;, then &quot;19&quot;, then 19p.<p>They managed to put this into production before we had a chance to see it.  Yes, it was a dysfunctional project.  But there’s lots of them out there.  If you leave a footgun like this lying around, there’s no end of companies that will not only shoot themselves in the foot but happily reload while you are scrambling to stop them.')
