Because freedom is not to be able to get away for the lack of evidence, freedom is not to put  innocent people in that kind of situation in the first place.<p>Police state doesn&#x27;t come from the ability to track citizens, it comes from the lack of transparency and government&#x27;s misuse of the information. Now, reality is that having more data collecting increases the chances of misuse, but I think we&#x27;re attacking the problem from the wrong side. Rather than killing the option to track emails, there should be much more control and transparency on when and how that data can be collected and used.')
