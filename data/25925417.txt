LTL is usually B2B, either for smaller shipments. Hence, less than a full truck volume vise. And it is a royal pain, also for businesses. You are mixing cargo with other clients, you are depending on a third party schedule and routing. There are multiple touch points increasing the risk of damage. Usually, there are multiple carriers involved.<p>And funny enough, there is close to zero synergy with an existing parcel network or an existing full truck load business. Besides being able to use the same trucks. And since most trucks are owned by third parties anyway, well even those synergies are small.<p>That being said, the LTL business is huge. It just seems that UPS is streamlining its own operation.')
