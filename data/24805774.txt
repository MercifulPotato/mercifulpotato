At best it&#x27;s a guideline (Frequencies or any other pluralised -cy word seems to break it)<p>Before we learnt 1000 different spellings. Now we learn a rule, but it&#x27;s quite complex, and then we learn 200 exceptions to this rule.<p>But for what?<p>From now on, it&#x27;s always &quot;ie&quot;. Done. Wouldn&#x27;t that be simpler? We could eliminate the I all together. There is no &quot;I&quot; sound in neighbour or weigh. They should be neybor and way (or if you really need to distinguish all the other Way words, &quot;wey&quot;).<p>Then instead of 1000 hours of frustration, little kids can all spell correctly on day one and get on and do 1000 hours of maths or reading or art or something.')
