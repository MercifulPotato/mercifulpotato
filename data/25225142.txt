Hardware wise they&#x27;re really great.  I don&#x27;t mind having to connect them to WiFi.  However, the app to control them is, bar none, the biggest piece of shit app I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can barely control my lights.<p>The scheduling is pretty handy though.  I have half a dozen outside and they turn on &#x2F; off with dusk &#x2F; dawn.  In addition to that I have them set to go to bright white and 30-50% at night (just enough to keep security cameras in color mode).')
