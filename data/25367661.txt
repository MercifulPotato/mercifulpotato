There are always many small errors and fraud in any large election. I don&#x27;t think anyone would dispute this. And it is tolerable because the error is unlikely to be statistically significant.<p>The question is whether there is large scale, organised electoral fraud. Of that there&#x27;s precisely zero evidence.<p>So when the “mainstream” media says “there is no fraud”, they&#x27;re talking about organised fraud, not small counting errors and individual voter misconduct.')
