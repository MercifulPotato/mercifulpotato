Before that, I&#x27;ve tried for 4-5 years to encourage more people adopting CLJ&#x2F;CLJS and to provide tools for graphics, data viz, digital fabrication etc. to make the language more appealing&#x2F;useful for these folks. In hindsight it seems I gave up a year too early... Still, I find the TS monorepo workflow much more suitable for myself (and for the project), since large scale refactoring without types often has been a complete nightmare in Clojure (also using Literate Programming&#x2F;org-mode made it even harder in these case). Plus, trying to write performant cross-environment code (for realtime graphics) in CLJC has been a quite painful&#x2F;hairy experience. Still, as I said before, I do have very fond memories of the 6-7 years spent with the language &amp; community. It&#x27;s been partially commercial suicide (at the time), but an huge and important learning experience and I&#x27;m happy that (in the end) quite a few people found (and still do find) those tools useful...')
