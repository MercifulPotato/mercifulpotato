A job is supposed to be a voluntary, mutually advantageous relationship between two parties. So interviews <i>ought</i> to be kind of like dating, where you&#x27;re trying to be as nice as possible and make a good impression. You don&#x27;t give tests to a date, you just talk to them, get to know them.<p>Employers too often assume that interviews are a one-way street, where the candidate wants the job no matter what and will do anything to get it. On the contrary, the candidate can walk away at any time, and the employer needs to woo the candidate just as much as the candidate needs to woo the employer.')
