The problem isn&#x27;t that Google owns all of the services we use. It&#x27;s that <i>someone</i> owns them and even if you switch to a handful of independent services (which is a worse UX), someone else is snooping on you. Google&#x27;s value proposition is that if you&#x27;re inside the Google family of services, each service is made better due to having a unified analytics and user profiling. This is a double-edged sword:<p><pre><code>  1. A single service has full visibility into your habits\n  2. The upper bound for the efficacy of each service is higher.\n</code></pre>\nIs this worth it to you? That&#x27;s the question you should be asking yourself.')
