Item(by='stouset', descendants=None, kids=[25984124], score=None, time=1612138280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982906, text='&gt; Melvin Capital has a very real chance of going insolvent<p>I just don’t know how many more times I’m going to have to say that Melvin is going to lose everything.<p>Melvin and WSB are not the only two players in the market.<p>&gt; Also you&#x27;re completely missing the point. Do you not even understand most of these people aren&#x27;t trying to make money? If you don&#x27;t understand that, then you don&#x27;t even have a basis to start the conversation.<p>That’s the meme. We’ll see how the people with tens of thousands YOLO’d feel when things turn south.<p>And if that’s the point, that makes this whole thing all the more depressing. They’re sticking it to the hedge funds by… blowing a bunch of money taking out one while dozens of others profit off of them?<p>Good luck with that.')
