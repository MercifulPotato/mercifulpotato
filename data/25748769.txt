I imagine if they dropped the pretense of a union and it was just a non-profit group, they would have a hard time getting that big of a donation from each member.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just being too cynical, but I can&#x27;t help think this group is playing into the current trendiness of progressive issues, and some number of well-off Googlers are joining because ~$2000 a year is insignificant to them and they support the cause of unions in general even though they don&#x27;t personally need any of the protections a typical union offers. Not to say this is necessarily a bad thing, non-profits need to market themselves somehow and if they accomplish positive change in Google&#x27;s policies this way then great.')
