I certainly don&#x27;t need a navigation system to get to work, home, my favorite bar, the homes of friends or family, the local supermarket or other stores I frequent, etc. I only need navigation a handful of times a year, and even then, I usually wish I&#x27;d reviewed and memorized the directions ahead of time rather than relied on blindly following step-by-step directions.<p>I don&#x27;t need or want voice control of the basic car systems. Give me traditional knobs and sliders. The tactile feedback is better and less distracting than any visual feedback. Voice commands have gotten pretty good, but I still find I have to repeat myself often enough to be frustrated. And why should I have to turn the radio down in order to adjust the air conditioning?<p>Touchscreen displays in cars are unnecessary and distracting. You should never be looking at one. You shouldn&#x27;t need a mount for your phone because you shouldn&#x27;t be looking at your phone. You shouldn&#x27;t need a touchscreen because you should be using knobs and sliders and other controls that are easy to find without looking and provide tactile feedback.<p>There&#x27;s no need to view, listen to, or reply to messages while you&#x27;re driving. It&#x27;s dangerous, even hands-free. You shouldn&#x27;t even be having voice conversations while driving. Sure, we all do it from time to time, but it should be rare and under exceptional circumstances. It&#x27;s dangerous and unnecessary. Pay attention to the damn road.')
