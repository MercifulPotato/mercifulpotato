They can simply have a contract with you. You pay them x in exchange for them going y in your kitchen.<p>Of course they can have opinions or refuse to do things in certain ways. But they can&#x27;t force you to have a pink wall color, or other things. At most, perhaps if the see something dangerous or illegal in your kitchen, they may have a duty to do something about it.<p>Likewise, an employee can refuse to do things by simply quitting the job.<p>Harassment: again, quit your job, apart from that, general laws about harassment should apply, independent from you being an employee or not.<p>&quot;fiduciary duty&quot; - where does that come from? Why does somebody suddenly have a duty to take care of you? I am self employed. Why do you get people to have the duty to take care of you, but I don&#x27;t? Who should have the duty to take care of me?<p>Suppose you pay me to renovate your kitchen.<p>Now what is your duty towards me? Is it now your duty to see that I earn a living wage and have job security forever? All just because you simply wanted a new wall color in your kitchen?')
