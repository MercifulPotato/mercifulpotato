See tennis elbow, etc.<p>The other issue is that you end up writing 4-6hrs a day in school 5days a week, wheras the gym is something like, maybe 20 minutes per muscle group? depending.  And that doesn&#x27;t tend to be more than 3-4x a week.<p>I used to weightlift with a much lighter ex.  The one thing I noticed was that even tho I could lift substantially more, our recovery rate was basically the same.  So I&#x27;d end up with a lot more nagging injuries over time if I didn&#x27;t properly take care of myself.')
