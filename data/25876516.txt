The fact that Angular uses an HTML file extension is a delusion (they really should have picked a different extension, it&#x27;s such an ugly lie) that the templates will ever be more portable than they currently are. Sure, you generally have better raw copy&#x2F;paste behavior of real HTML into Angular&#x27;s templates than JSX, but if you think the mess that is the average Angular template will ever be portable to &quot;native browser functionality&quot;, I may have a bridge to sell you.')
