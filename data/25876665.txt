Whose intent?<p>Regardless, that&#x27;s not how modern elections work. The strongest predictor of vote, by a wide margin, is partisan affiliation. Candidates (on both sides!) who are known for exceptional constituent services are regularly voted out for faceless party hacks. When people do switch their votes, it&#x27;s a consistent shift up and down the ballot. The days when representatives carefully pursued their local constituents&#x27; interest are long gone: consider how Californian Republican representatives voted to hike their own property owning constituents&#x27; taxes in 2017.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to have local elections, because politics isn&#x27;t local now.')
