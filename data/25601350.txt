If they are the same people, they can also be counted upon to be wrong on any issue of substance. So, anytime there is a decision to be made, look to them, and choose the opposite.<p>It is <i>hard</i> to be right all the time. Logically, it should be exactly, equally hard to be wrong all the time, but somehow more people achieve it.<p>In any big group of people known to each other, it is always easy to tell who the Oracles of Wrong are. (If you don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s probably you.) I have had some decades to think about this, and identify other qualities of these individuals, besides their preference for wrongness. They are typically upper-class people. They prefer alternatives that are personally easy for them, requiring less change in habits or thinking. They have never experienced any substantial personal discomfort as a consequence of a wrong choice.<p>In cases of uncertainty, look to an Oracle of Wrong for anti-leadership.')
