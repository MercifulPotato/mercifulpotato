Compared to the state Skyrim launched in(backwards flying dragons anyone?) it&#x27;s a peach.<p>However. The PS4 base performance is absolutely dire. Like, in my opinion that&#x27;s just not playable, running in sub 20fps.<p>However #2 - this is not without precedent. Remember when Doom started coming out on some platforms that it has absolutely no business being on? I think on the SNES it ran at like 15fps, with massively cut down music and effects - and I doubt people were returning it for refunds en masse. I do imagine standards have changed since then though.')
