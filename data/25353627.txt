Probably just talking to myself at this point...<p>Imagine Spotify only has 2 users. Both pay their £10 a month.<p>One listens to 2 hours a day of their fav band on their commute.<p>The other listens to Taylor Swift on repeat 18 hours a day.<p>Current system, Taylor swift gets £18 and the other band gets £2.<p>Use centric version I’m suggesting, both get £10, just as they would if it had been a CD they were listening to.<p>This seems more fair to me.')
