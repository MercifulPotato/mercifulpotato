BASIC was so much more immediate and straightforward to learn on.<p>A &quot;text editor and command line&quot; workflow requires a notion of files which just wasn&#x27;t a thing in those early machines (except as part of custom disk-mamagement commands). What they had was a sort of <i>line</i> editor as part of the UI itself - if you typed a line number at the prompt, that line would be replaced in memory. Of course this worked really well with early BASIC where control flow is expressed entirely via those line numbers. Some primitive visual editing was also allowed - you could LIST some lines of code, then change a line on the screen and press the enter key - the ROM would then read the complete line of code from the screen and update it in the actual listing.  It could get confusing at times, but mostly it worked quite well.')
