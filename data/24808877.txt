JetBrains YouTrack has an on-site version with similar features to Jira, and the latest version comes with a wiki feature called Knowledge Base. [1]<p>There&#x27;s also an automatic import process from Jira [2].<p>YouTrack has a cloud version now. Unfortunately they used the introduction of this to raise the prices for their self-hosted version. However they do allow migration both to <i>and from</i> the cloud version, and they plan to introduce a self-hosted version of their newest Space product, so it seems JetBrains is more DIY friendly than Atlassian.<p>JB seem like a better company anyway. It&#x27;s hard to forget Atlassian&#x27;s decision to stop rewarding employees based on merit, a system they claimed was created by &quot;white men&quot; [3]. The new system rewards employees largely for following the &quot;company values&quot;. Under the company values page [4], they claim one of their values is &quot;Donâ€™t #@!% the customer&quot;.
