So, if I live til 100 (unlikely, considering family history I’ll drop dead at around 75 at best) the money I have will need to last me 65 years. That’s about 1.5% withdrawal rate. $4M gives me $60k a year inflation adjusted, which is what I am comfortable with.<p>Another part is being surrounded by very successful Silicon Valley people: a lot of my friends have net worths around the $10M, so there is a bit of FOMO as well.<p>Also, I really don’t have a lot of productive personal projects, nor desire to spend my free time programming, I don’t like programming. I envision my retirement volunteering, reading tons of books, enjoying time with my partner and family, and eating street food in SE Asia.')
