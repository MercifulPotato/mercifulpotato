If you are unable to figure it out by yourself a good therapist might be able to help you channel it towards something healthier or just bring balance to how you use reddit.<p>EDIT: The idea behind this being that perhaps the addiction is a symptom of some other problem and trying to get to the root of the matter might help make it easier to find a way around it.')
