It was not to create new restrictions on how they must or must not otherwise regulate &amp; shape speech on their platform.<p>This implication that platforms have to allow anyone to say whatever they want unless it&#x27;s a certain pre-set class of illegal speech, lest they become some other service class with additional liabilities for speech, seems facetiously misguided &amp; contrary to all evidence there is for how Section 230 was proposed, discussed, and how it describes itself.')
