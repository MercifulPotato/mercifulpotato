Adding UX friction to the primary use case would hinder adoption among non security-enthusiasts.  With protection for the casual user eliminated, the truly sensitive communications of those motivated for privacy would stick out like a sore thumb, revealing many more bits of meta data than just &quot;this number had signal once.&quot;<p>Elite users who care about being &quot;outted&quot; simply for signal participation can take steps to mitigate.  The rest of us need automatic contact discovery for Signal to not be useless.')
