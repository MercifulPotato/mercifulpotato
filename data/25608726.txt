Just use the provided wallet software, use a password to encrypt your wallet, and back up the seed phrase, or backup the actual wallet file.<p>It is literally already solved.<p>EDIT:<p>Proposal:<p>buy 6 different 8gb flash drives for $40 or less, backup the encrypted wallet on each of them, with a printed piece of paper with the wallet.
