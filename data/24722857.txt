Yes, there would be a much larger problem, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you should make it easier for them to have more power.<p>Let&#x27;s take right now in the US for instance.  I don&#x27;t trust the US government, but I&#x27;m not so scared that I&#x27;m regularly fearing for my life.  I guess it&#x27;s possible I could wake up in Guantanamo tomorrow but that seems unlikely.  That said, I am not interested in giving them any more power over me, and in fact interested in them having less.<p>So as much as I would love for a real &quot;fix&quot; to the US government, which you describe as replacing it, that seems slightly extreme and unlikely at the moment.  So the most realistic course of action is fighting them on their unnecessary grabs for power and surveillance over the populace while I still feel safe to do so.<p>Just because there are bigger problems doesn&#x27;t mean you should ignore the smaller problems, especially when those are much easier to address.')
