One also needs hard work and, as Ramanujan illustrates, access to institutions that can publish+legitimize the work.<p>I also find it fun to consider that the population is 7x larger today than it was in 1800, and there&#x27;s generally much better access to education across the board. Around 1900 you&#x27;ve got a bunch of absolute giants in mathematics: Hilbert and Ramanujan, for starters, but also Riemann and Lobachevsky (whose noneuclidean geometry work was basically Einstein minus the physics). So, suppose O(5) world-changing geniuses. On raw population alone, one would expect about 35 people of similar caliber to be active today. But also mathematics as a profession, access to phd programs, etc, is many times larger per capita than it would have been in 1900. So I would personally guess that there&#x27;s likely to be a couple hundred people currently active in math of a similar caliber.')
