The accelerator only controls the motors, the brake pedal only controls the brakes. Theyâ€™ve broken that somewhat now with one-pedal driving mode. The only way they could make regen feel consistent with a cold or full battery would be to blend in friction braking to make up the difference, which is just not something Tesla is into doing.<p>My BMW i3 did this really well, FWIW.')
