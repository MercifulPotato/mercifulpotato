But we&#x27;re talking 6000x worse ingest performance for a database whose whole raison d&#x27;etre is based on ingesting high volumes of data - otherwise just use an RDBMS.<p>That&#x27;s like making a car with square wheels. The only logical thing for management to do to a team who delivered that is disband them - because something is horribly wrong.<p>Now to be completely fair they do get good ingest performance if you open thousands of connections to send the data over. So they can probably fix it. I still wouldn&#x27;t touch it with a stick though, that&#x27;s not the only issue they have at present.')
