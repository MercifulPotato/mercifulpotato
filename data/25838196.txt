You get what you pay for.<p>My baofeng 5 died two hours into a 12 mile backpackign trip across catalina island.  It couldn&#x27;t do a quarter mile line of sight with an airport 2m amateur tower and when turning on the flashlight feature in my tent it died entirely and would not power back on.  I was entirely reliant on it for ranger station as well as general comms and phone patch&#x2F;weather.  Packing  this plastic trash couldnt have been more dangerous.<p>Programming is also a byzantine nightmare.')
