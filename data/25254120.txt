The keys, as I&#x27;ve learned them, is to a) get to a place where you can invest up front in reducing your cost of living in the medium-long term, b) run like hell from the hedonic treadmill of trying to keep up with your peers&#x27; poor financial decisions, c) look carefully at what parts of your &quot;decent lifestyle&quot; make you truly happier, which parts are performative, and for which parts you can replace spending with effort without a loss of quality (for example, you can learn to cook very nice food, at a much higher quality than you will get at a restaurant for much less money; there&#x27;s also no better feeling than feeding your friends).<p>Keep in mind that the lifestyle changes you make now pay off more than double, by helping you save faster, by having those savings accumulate interest&#x2F;earn you money, and by reducing the amount of money you need to sustain retirement indefinitely.<p>Finally, make compounding growth your friend, not your enemy.  Kill debt ASAP, and start socking away as much of your money as you can in a growth-bearing account.  If you can reliably save 50% of your income in an account that beats inflation by 4%, you can support your lifestyle indefinitely on growth after 17 years.')
