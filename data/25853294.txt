It&#x27;s almost impossible for a junior engineer to get a visa to the United States. One of our candidates had a job offer at Amazon in the USA but couldn&#x27;t get the visa. So he ended up at a startup in Germany instead.<p>So far our participants have ended up primarily in Germany and Poland, and we&#x27;re seeing possibilities in Sweden, France, and the UK too. We&#x27;re still figuring out what the Canadian visa situation is for junior engineers but it seems possible (probably best for them to apply for residency first and then get a job).<p>If you have any more insight on this do let us know!')
