What if you could visualise and choose which filters to apply to your view of Matrix?<p>The closest to actual deplatforming is:<p>&gt; Admins running servers in particular jurisdictions then have the option to enforce whatever rules they need on their servers<p>But honestly, in a federated system I always assumed the server owners could do that. As long as it&#x27;s not mandated from on high by the Matrix team, anyone can host whatever they want by setting up their own server.')
