Nearly all full-time jobs are instructor or ad junct. This has been true for years.<p>In CS and a few other fields (some applied math, biz, econ, finance), tenure is non-optional because universities can&#x27;t pay.<p>Every single decent candidate in CS can make $300K minimum in industry, but even the absolute best universities cannot afford more than $150K at the asst. prof rank (maybe 200 at the very best but also highest CoL places and even then only for the tippy-top candidates).<p>NB: that&#x27;s at the very, very best universities. The budget for a tenure line is closer to $65K or so at the vast majority of the country&#x27;s ~1,400 colleges.<p>If you&#x27;re competing with a FAANG offer and your budget is $65K, tenure is your only chip to play. And even then you&#x27;ll be super lucky to get a halfway decent candidate.')
