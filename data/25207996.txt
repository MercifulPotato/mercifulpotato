I have done this in beginner classes, but it rapidly gets boring.<p>While I understand how it makes it harder to read for non-experts, when you are writing maths, and maths papers, as a job you don&#x27;t want to double the size of everything and scatter *s around for no reason.<p>The best parallel I can think of (this isn&#x27;t good, sorry)  would be like attaching the type of every variable to every place you use it -- this would technically make it easier to follow a snippet of code, but create lots of visual noise.')
