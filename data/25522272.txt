If the cookie already exists I can go to any API url in the browser and it just works. Putting the secret in localstorage or only in app memory makes that not possible.<p>On the API side I prefer to support both cookie and Authorization header so you get the benefits in browser but don&#x27;t overcomplicate the CLI side of things by requiring cookie state.')
