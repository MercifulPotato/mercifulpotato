That list isn&#x27;t getting smaller, so which 50% of the rules would you cut?<p>In a few years, which 2&#x2F;3 of the rules would you cut?<p>How is this a win for consumers? How have they addressed those major concerns?<p>Edit: That was stock, I just added a few lists and passed 100,000 network filter rules. Please explain to me slowly, as if I were a child, how a static limit of 30,000 rules is a bigger number than 100,000, and why my computer with 128GB of RAM memory can&#x27;t possibly support more than 30,000 rules?')
