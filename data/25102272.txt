That prase includes the word &quot;news&quot;. without saying anything about what &quot;news&quot; is. Traditionally that&#x27;s factual, correct information about new developments in some geographic area or other part of the world.<p>The Trump that spews 50 lies per day isn&#x27;t going to open an company that&#x27;s restricted to or even focused on factually correct stories, so I think it&#x27;s wrong to call that a news outlet, even if Trump himself does so.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;president-trump-has-made-more-than-20000-false-or-misleading-claims&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;president...</a> for example.<p>If you want to argue that opening a fifty-lies-per-day streaming site is a good idea and fine for the world, by all means do so.
