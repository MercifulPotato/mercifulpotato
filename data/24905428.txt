A personal finance company at that? How did they arrive at doing this analysis?<p>I even tried opening the linked analysis from two different IP addresses, but all I get is this message: [1]<p>&gt; Oops!

Compared with the other 49 states and the District of Columbia, California ranked 47th in reading test scores, 46th in math test scores and dead last in student-teacher ratios.<p>I&#x27;m very curious about those metrics. Because the three that are mentioned only give a superficial glance of what&#x27;s going on. Correlation is not causation, for one. Are drop out rates or low SAT&#x2F;ACT scores directly related to the quality of education? Or the poor social economic situation of the households in which children grow up?<p>Without follow up, I&#x27;d be very careful about drawing conclusions.<p>&gt; “More resources do not always correlate with better academic performance, as our findings demonstrate,”<p>Of course not. Then there&#x27;s also the larger debate whether academic performance alone should be the main goal of public schools? Isn&#x27;t the purpose of providing an education, ensuring that the next generation grows up into stable, independent and healthy adults?<p>For instance, she push towards standardized testing in which private publishers such as Pearson have come to play a crucial role is something that does deserve a discussion in it&#x27;s own right as well, no?
