With piracy, many users would rather pirate the expensive #1 game than to run the lower cost #1938 game.  With such a closed system, users will choose cheaper applications and it will help #1938 to rise to #45.This is very good for indie developers.<p>Another benefit is for the consumers. When developers overprice their software, and users can pirate - they might.  Then the developer blames lack of sales on piracy.  However, when piracy is impossible, the developer can&#x27;t blame piracy and must seek the true cause of poor sales, be it a high price or lack of quality.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of coverage already on the negatives with a closed store.')
