Although nothing was really stopping them then. They had a good system of picking companies one by one, being threatening and making them sign &quot;licensing deals&quot; without ever needing to go to court or publicly say which patents were being infringed. (Probably all FAT stuff. Google eventually had the good sense to stop using FAT on Android, but it was slow going because if you haven&#x27;t noticed Google manoeuvres about as well as a freight train). With the amount they&#x27;ve changed under Nadella, I&#x27;m not sure present day Microsoft even <i>could</i> do that.<p>But for present-day examples we&#x27;re going to need to search elsewhere.')
