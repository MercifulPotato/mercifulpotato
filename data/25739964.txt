Some people don&#x27;t like that.  They think we worship the devil (we don&#x27;t) and that we control the world (were that wishing made it so but, no, we don&#x27;t).<p>It&#x27;s not out of the realm of possibility that enough people have that view and decide that I and&#x2F;or my company need to be shamed, shunned, and shut down. What do I do then? I&#x27;ve done nothing illegal, immoral, or unethical but a group of people have decided I need to lose everything simply because I joined a fraternity.<p>That view in particular has already happened once, by the way.  It could easily happen again.<p>I say all that to say this: I think OP&#x27;s question is what happens when it takes less than criminal activity to get kicked off of vendors such as AWS?')
