I will only buy electric cars from this point on after having the Model 3. How quick it is and I also happen to love the touchscreen and UI. Also no oil changes is fantastic.  I’ve only rotated tires.  My Audi maintenance costs just kept rising and rising.<p>It’s odd people compare the Model 3 to a wide range of cars when it seems more apt to compare it to ICE cars like Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series. I think it’s superior to those cars, I don’t miss the amount of buttons they all have (buttons I personally never use). And I feel like all car interiors have started to get very cheap.')
