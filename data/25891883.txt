This is the feeling you get when you hold your breath.  You have somewhere between four and ten minutes of oxygen supply in your blood, but it becomes unpleasant within the first minute because CO2 is building up instead of being exhaled.<p>People with COPD always have an abundance of CO2 in the bloodstream because their alveoli don&#x27;t exchange gases correctly.  They likely wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.<p>Just saying.  Your argument is sound and generally true, but it&#x27;s true not for everyone.')
