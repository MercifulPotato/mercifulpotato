That said, I do think the article brings up some good points about domain modeling.  After becoming somewhat proficient in Scala I&#x27;ve found these same features (ADTs) mentioned in the article helpful for the important part of these boring CRUD apps: modeling data at the various application boundaries (API, domain layer, database layer, etc).  I now find using weaker type systems and&#x2F;or imperative code to be either more error prone or more verbose (due to validation + extra tests).<p>Of course there are other parts of Scala, Haskell and similar that require more mental gymnastics than I&#x27;d like, such as composing asynchronous operations; flatMap and monad transformers may be &quot;elegant&quot; once you really understand them but damn is async&#x2F;await easier to just write and move on with your life.')
