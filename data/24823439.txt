I haven&#x27;t done anything with it, but have finally begun dinking with microcontrollers.<p>I would expect a sandblast to be worse to get in your eye than a flash of light. So, you would still need good large-body sensors. You would need to lead the target, another complication, and it would be hard to know how close you had got. The ones that miss would keep going and come down somewhere, although not fast. The range would be very limited because of how fast the grains would slow down -- drag goes by the area, but kinetic energy by the mass, hence volume, so smaller projectiles lose it very fast.')
