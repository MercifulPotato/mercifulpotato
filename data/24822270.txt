And I know a few others who do.<p>I mean, my preferred choice is to use my native language. Esperanto comes second. English third. But of course, the choice of language is usually determined by the intended audience.<p>The reason Esperanto comes second despite being used less than English is that it feels &quot;more natural&quot;. This is probably hard to explain and hard to believe if you don&#x27;t have a personal experience, but it is so. The high regularity has a psychological impact. I usually don&#x27;t notice irregularities in my native language, because I am used to them so much. But in a foreign language, any irregularity is a mental reminder than I am not speaking my native language. Esperanto has more regularity, therefore fewer reminders of being foreign.')
