Even when you have strong employee representation, in which case that influence is via the employee representatives on the board, <i>not</i> via employees just doing whatever the hell they want.<p>Once again, if you want to agitate against the company, you are free to do this.  Just don&#x27;t expect the company to employe you.<p>&gt; But the board also decides what working for the benefit of the company means.<p>Not without limits.  Boards are answerable to shareholders, and may be held liable if they act against the interests of shareholders.  But even then it is the <i>board</i> that decides this, <i>not</i> random employee X.  As an employee, you are in a chain of command (tends to also be in your contract, which you entered into voluntarily).  And once again, you are free to not abide by that contract, but don&#x27;t expect to be employed by that company.<p>Basically, what you are talking about are vastly hypothetical constructs that have little to do with how companies actually work.')
