Its not that we don&#x27;t have enough nitrogen to put on the fields, its that the soil is so degraded that when it rains it all runs off into ditches and eventually out to sea.<p>In the netherlands its even more pronounced. There are cow farmers that have bought land especially for dumping effluent on.<p>So its not a problem of enough, its a problem of keeping it in the right place.')
