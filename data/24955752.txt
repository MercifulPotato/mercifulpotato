They said &quot;nothing is cool about a tutorial on creation of threads&quot;, and that the cool thing is &quot;achieving concurrency without threads&#x2F;race conditions&#x2F;shared memory&quot; which ironically is only enabled by all the engineers who spend their time working on and maintaining those &quot;uncool&quot; things.<p>If they don&#x27;t need to use threads, then good for them.  But to dismiss threads and learning material about threads as &quot;uncool&quot; is just silly.  The thing that enables that misunderstanding is all the work that&#x27;s done on them in the first place.')
