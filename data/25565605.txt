Right now, to learn about an organism&#x27;s DNA, we&#x27;d have to first (1) sequence the DNA (actually read the raw DNA in) and (2) analyze the sequenced DNA. iGenomics is free and so the &quot;DNA tricorder&quot; software is free. However, the most affordable DNA sequencer as of now is the Oxford Nanopore MinION (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoporetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;minion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoporetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;minion</a>), which starts at about $1000. Oxford Nanopore is working on a more portable, and hopefully more affordable version, called the SmidgION (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoporetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;smidgion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoporetech.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;smidgion</a>) that they hope to have out within the next few years.<p>I&#x27;d estimate we are about 3 - 5 years away from hitting the point where ordinary people start to own DNA sequencers.<p>Worth noting, while DNA could be useful here, there&#x27;s likely more affordable ways to differentiate between plants today.')
