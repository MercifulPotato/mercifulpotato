Item(by='rendall', descendants=None, kids=[25850284], score=None, time=1611162035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848113, text='&gt; <i>I&#x27;m not here to read your entire comment history</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily expect that of anyone, except that you had already replied.<p>Perhaps we should define terms. When people use the term &quot;white supremacist symbol&quot; I hear something that is used by everyone including white supremacists to unambiguously signal white supremacy. A Nazi flag. A burning cross. Shaved head, bomber jacket, combat boots, and most importantly, white laces.<p>The content of these particular symbols stem self-consciously from their progenitors: putative Aryan heritage in the case of the swastika, the purity of Protestant Christian values for the burning cross, etc<p>A symbol that everyone uses - including white supremacists - to mean something else - &quot;OK&quot; - is not a white supremacist symbol by that definition.<p>Its history as a purported white supremacist symbol, a joke on a trolling board, doesn&#x27;t follow that of actual such symbols<p>The movement to turn it into a white supremacist symbol is now driven largely by serious, earnest, white leftists, curiously enough. I point to the people who are constantly pointing it out as evidence as my evidence. Why is this,  I wonder? It&#x27;s curious.<p>&gt; <i>his written manifesto was a) steeped in 4chan memes and winks to those in the know</i><p>Assuming that&#x27;s true, then it&#x27;s even more evidence to me that OK is not a &quot;white supremacist symbol&quot; his own white supremacy notwithstanding. He, your best evidence that it is, this fellow who used it, is well versed in its origin as a joke.')
