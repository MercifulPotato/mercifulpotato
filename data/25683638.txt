There is no &#x27;deserving&#x27; value for work, it is just about balancing demand and supply for work. The only realistic way to raise average wage is to saturate supply of work by providing enough demand.<p>It is possible to outsource work tho third countries for less money, why everybody does not do that and there are still work in developed countries? Because it has some costs  that may or may not be apparent. Therefore if you require to pay the same wage, you discourage anybody to give work to people in developing countries.')
