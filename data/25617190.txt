We are removed from community and it is scary so we find one on the internet and we go all in.</i>&quot;<p>That isn&#x27;t how I remember Brave New World; it was about amusing ourselves to death with trivia instead of dealing with &quot;important&quot; things, but the sense of community in it was pretty strong - people grew up with and lived with the same local group of people, worked together, played Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy together, orgied together, and took soma to keep them all content. The main complaint they all had was why Bernard couldn&#x27;t just be happy and join in the community.<p>Brave New World celebrated the twist-reveal where Bernard learns that exile to Iceland isn&#x27;t a gulag but is really joining a distant group of people who don&#x27;t like the society and want to live their own way like he does. I&#x27;m never sure if that should be taken at face value, or if it was a lie and the place was really a prison camp, but let&#x27;s assume it was an honest and accurate reveal - that would be the opposite of your complaint, Bernard was lost and scared at having no community, was pushed toward a remote one he might fit in, and the book is all about how great that is that he doesn&#x27;t have to waste his life doing just what the people around him are doing and that he can feel closer aligned with a group across the world than someone right next to him, and should take advantage of that.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>An escape from forever war all around us</i>&quot;<p>The forever war was 1984, and that&#x27;s not about Winston joining the Marines to find meaning in his life, it&#x27;s about using the two minutes&#x27; hate to reinforce tribe membership by uniting everyone against a hate figure&#x2F;group, and the strong (IngSoc) beating down the weak (objectors) until everyone is stamped into the same shape (boot on human face &#x2F; industrial machine moulding stamp), the reveal at the end of 1984 isn&#x27;t that Winston joined the Marines and escaped the forever war like Bernard escaped the trivia, it&#x27;s that Winston <i>came to love Big Brother</i> and agree with everything good that Big Brother is and was and always would be, it&#x27;s the equivalent of Bernard taking the soma and blending into the society and agreeing it was right all along, it&#x27;s one or other of your Maga hat and Antifa supporter becoming overwhelmingly dominant, the state enforcing it, and the other being subsumed by it and liking it until there isn&#x27;t anything else.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>internet&#x2F;phone addiction is not a problem its a solution. I guess war is inescapable.</i>&quot;<p>Hence the Yin-Yang forever circling each other. There&#x27;s no solution to whether white or black is better, or whether matter or energy is better, or whether hot is better than cold, both books posit an end - one that is either agreeable or disagreeable to the reader, but an end nonetheless - real life doesn&#x27;t have ends it has circles, loops, repeats, back and forths, changing fortunes, ups and downs, births and deaths.<p>Maga hat and Antifa supporter both love <i>their</i> America, and their America doesn&#x27;t include murdering thy neighbor. They might &quot;want to kill each other&quot; but each would like the other one realising how dumb they are and changing sides.')
