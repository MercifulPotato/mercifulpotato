I absolutely adored the language at first. Loved the syntax. loved the type definitions and domain modeling. I felt maybe, this is it, this is the language for me. Never felt that way about a language since the last time I wrote something in Crystal.<p>Then came the part where I needed to work with list of records and realized that something as basic as that which I take for granted in other languages, is a monstrously complicated concept in f#. I got introduced to the shady world of Lenses, tried my hand for a bit and decided to get out. Lenses are not for me.<p>I can&#x27;t believe that a language makes updating records so difficult. F# is my first functional language and while I expected some friction in doing such stuff in a functional language, I never expected so much work around something so trivial.\nBut is does helps me understand why people don&#x27;t use F# for things like gamedev.<p>Anyway TLDR; love the language. Wish that it will make concepts like Lens much easier to use in the language')
