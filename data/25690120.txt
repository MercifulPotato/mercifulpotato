But the dynamic motion of that pendulum is such a hard problem, and as you note, the three year olds solve it with unconscious ease.<p>Never as gracefully, and there of course the machines have a huge advantage. I spend most of my brain power keeping the tense muscles very tense and the loose muscles very loose, for each and every one of those tiny stabilizer muscles. The machines move straight and smooth in a way I never will. I haven&#x27;t mastered the simple art of standing there in first position, and probably never will.<p>(I am not, I would note, any kind of expert. I dance at the level of an 11 year old. Maybe a 10 year old. Which took me years to learn, and I&#x27;m very proud of it.)')
