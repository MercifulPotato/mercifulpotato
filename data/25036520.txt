Many people either don&#x27;t have a voicemail or don&#x27;t bother ever setting it up. When the carriers start charging you a lot of money to have a voicemail, plenty of people will forgo it, and instead say things like &quot;if it&#x27;s important enough they&#x27;ll call back&quot; or &quot;they&#x27;ll send me a text message&quot;.')
