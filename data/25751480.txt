They&#x27;ve blogged that 6.2 as LTS and announced that LTS branches won&#x27;t be public until they&#x27;re a year old.<p>Why would they make 6.2.0 a public FOSS release and then withhold 6.2.1 for a year? And even if they did, would you want to use a .0 release on your project?<p>No, it seems likely to me that 6.2 will effectively be closed source when it&#x27;s announced, and open source releases will follow after a year.')
