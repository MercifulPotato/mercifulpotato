This problem was something we came across while consulting, as some clients were getting too consumed by what their competition was doing.<p>For our own products, we keep tabs on what the competition is doing to stay up to date on the industry. However, this is tedious and very time consuming, so we built Accordably to automate it.<p>We think that it’s most important to focus on your own product. But taking a look at the competition every now and then can give you valuable information on the market in general and also on what works for your competitors and what doesn’t.<p>After setting up your competitors, Accordably will send you an email report every week, which just take a couple of minutes to go over. This is all the time that we wanted to give our competitors, so we made sure that the email reports cut right to the point.<p>For the full picture, we’ve also built a dashboard which allows us to sort posts by engagement&#x2F;time and to filter posts by source.')
