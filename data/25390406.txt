We have this rule because internet users are too quick to imagine they&#x27;re seeing these patterns when really they&#x27;re just reading them into what they&#x27;re looking at, much like a Rohrschach diagram.<p>It&#x27;s not that it never happens for real, of course.

Both are bad, and we need some sort of evidence or data or $objective-thing to look at in order to have a hope of distinguishing the one from the other. We put a ton of effort into protecting HN from manipulation and have many years of experience with this. I can&#x27;t say we&#x27;re not being pwned but we certainly catch many attempts to game the system here.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of past explanation here if anyone wants more: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=astroturf%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix=true&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=astroturf%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDat...</a>')
