The reason we have this rule is that internet users are much too quick to imagine that they&#x27;re seeing these things when really they&#x27;re just reading it into what they&#x27;re looking it, much like a Rohrschach diagram.<p>It&#x27;s not that it never happens for real, of course. It&#x27;s that both things happen: real manipulation, and imaginary manipulation, and we need some sort of evidence or data or $objective-thing to look at in order to try to distinguish the one from the other. We put a <i>lot</i> of effort into protecting HN from manipulation and have many years of experience with this. I can&#x27;t say we&#x27;re not being pwned but we certainly catch many attempts to game the system here.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of past explanation here if anyone wants more: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=astroturf%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDate&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;storyText=false&amp;prefix=true&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=astroturf%20by:dang&amp;sort=byDat...</a>')
