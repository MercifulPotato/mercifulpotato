The government is engaging in &quot;market manipulation&quot; (though we may use other terminology) by providing funding, including cheap credit, to selected banking institutions and companies, arguably without regard to their &quot;fundamental values&quot;.[1]  The author suggests those who have profited the most from this action, and to extremes,  are banks and investors in so-called zombie companies, not the public.<p>The WSB investors are engaging in &quot;market manipulation&quot; as well, and obviously without regard to the &quot;fundamental value&quot; of GameStop .<p>Given that a chosen government selection of banks and investors have benefitted enormously from the government&#x27;s &quot;market manipulation&quot;, while arguably the general public has not, the author hints at the hypocrisy of bank and government officials criticising the WSB manipulation and those who profited from it.<p>The easiest way to understand the issue IMO is to determine the source of the money as it flows to banks and zombie companies.  Does the money come (a) from government (via taxes on citizens) where government decides who will be the recipient or does the money (b) come from private citizens where the private citizen (consumer) decides where she will spend her money.<p>1. Example companies would be ones that are not profitable but receive significant government support, and this support arguably fuels changes in market value (which may&#x2F;may not reflect &quot;fundamental value&quot;).  Tesla is one example.[a]  Moderna is another.[b]<p>a. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seekingalpha.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;4315467-forget-share-price-tesla-is-still-short" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seekingalpha.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;4315467-forget-share-price-...</a> (2020)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realmoney.thestreet.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;tesla-s-main-product-isn-t-cars-it-s-subsidies-14769263" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realmoney.thestreet.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;tesla-s-mai...</a> (2018)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investors.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;editorials&#x2F;if-tesla-is-worth-more-than-gm-why-are-taxpayers-still-subsidizing-it&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investors.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;editorials&#x2F;if-tesla-is-wo...</a> (2017)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;la-fi-hy-elon-musk-defends-subsidies-20150601-htmlstory.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;la-fi-hy-elon-musk-defends-...</a> (2015)<p>Tesla like other auto manufacturers has received billions in government funding.<p>b. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fintel.io&#x2F;doc&#x2F;sec-mrna-10q-moderna-2020-october-30-18565" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fintel.io&#x2F;doc&#x2F;sec-mrna-10q-moderna-2020-october-30-1...</a><p>Moderna&#x27;s COVID vaccine mRNA 1273, specifcally the underlying IP, is subject to Bayh-Dole.  Obviously they can, are and will be selling to the US government (who will always have rights to this vaccine), but going forward the odds are against them competing with other similar vaccines that have less encumbered IP.')
