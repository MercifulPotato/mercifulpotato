It&#x27;s really not necessarily true that drinking a nutrient rich slurry like Soylent is a good substitute for a conventional healthy diet. It literally is an unknown. There&#x27;s good prior reason to believe it is not significantly better. It probably isn&#x27;t a whole lot worse either, certainly better than many people&#x27;s diets.<p>Thus, unknown benefit or harm which probably isn&#x27;t huge either way. It&#x27;s like taking an untested drug that probably isn&#x27;t dangerous but probably doesn&#x27;t have a huge effect either. The precautionary principle is the usual rule with such things.<p>To really know, we&#x27;d need multi-decade longitudinal studies of large numbers of people. Soylent obviously doesn&#x27;t have that kind of evidence.')
