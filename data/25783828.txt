I called it Quest Maker[2].<p>The game repo isn&#x27;t public (haven&#x27;t figured out what I want to do with this...), but here&#x27;s the tool I made for converting the binary quest datafiles to JSON[3].<p>Particularly interesting to me was extracting the sound data from the datafile to recreate a MIDI file, and then using a WASM library to play it in on the web.<p>There is also a gnarly encoding to the datafile, so I had to compile the Zelda Classic datafile loading code and employ cython so the bytes aren&#x27;t just gibberish.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zeldaclassic.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zeldaclassic.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoten.cc&#x2F;quest-maker&#x2F;play&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoten.cc&#x2F;quest-maker&#x2F;play&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;connorjclark&#x2F;zquest-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;connorjclark&#x2F;zquest-data</a>')
