It&#x27;s said that Thomas Jefferson influenced James Madison heavily as well in having him come up with the bill of rights.<p>So already you can read up on those people and their phylosophies to get a better idea of the concepts behind freedom of speech.<p>Similarly, about 200 ideas were proposed by the various states to be included in it, and Madison selected 10 from those ideas. It can be interesting to see the ones that weren&#x27;t selected. And there were influenced from states bill of rights, the English bill of rights and the Magna Carta as well.<p>For Freedom of Speech I found:<p>&gt; He studied at Princeton where a great focus was placed on speech and debate. He also studied the Greeks, who are known for valuing freedom of speech, tooâ€”that was the premise of Socrates&#x27; and&#x2F;or Plato&#x27;s work.<p>This was his first draft for it:<p>&gt; The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed. The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable. The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good; nor from applying to the Legislature by petitions, or remonstrances, for redress of their grievances.<p>Various dictionaries say:<p>&gt; Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by the government<p>&gt; Free press means the right of individuals to express themselves through publication and dissemination of information, ideas and opinions without interference, constraint or prosecution by the government.<p>And there was a legislative case where Madison argued against the narrower interpretation from common law of what is considered speech. So at least we believe it includes a broader set of speech then that.<p>The main issue that&#x27;s unclear, and might have been unclear on purpose, is that the constitution says: &quot;the freedom of speech&quot; emphasise on &quot;the&quot;. The presence of the &quot;the&quot; article suggests it refers to the existing freedom of speech that existed at the time. And debates about how wide or narrow was that at that time still linger.')
