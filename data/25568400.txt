Murakami introduces all sorts of weird &#x2F; surrealistic &#x2F; magical elements into stories, but there&#x27;s rarely if ever any attempt to explain them. They&#x27;re just part of the fabric of the story.<p>Magic realism is kind of weird genre. Sort of &quot;in between&quot; in that &quot;magic shit happens, but in our ordinary world, not a world where magic shit happens&quot;. That is, magic happens, but not in a Harry Potter&#x27;ish or Tolkein&#x27;ish world where magic is explicitly part of the world.<p>All of that said, I love Murakami. Need to finish reading the rest of his novels one of these days.')
