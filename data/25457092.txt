If you&#x27;re the kind of person using a tiling WM, you will definitely find the deep customization that Qutebrowser exposes to be liberating. I like the experience <i>so much</i> that I&#x27;ll start selling it for the rest of this comment:<p>Do you use vim-like extensions, but hate how surface-level they become due to hard WebExtension limitations? Pining to recapture the days of Pentadactyl? Qutebrowser is built for vim-like navigation from the ground up:<p>* Hate getting stuck on about&#x2F;&#x2F;:* &#x2F; chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;* pages? Every single page in qutebrowser works with your keybindings!<p>* Hate PDFs for the same reason? Qutebrowser will read PDFs and keeps your keybindings there, too!<p>* Wish you could have a dotfile configuration for your browser? Qutebrowser (optionally) does dotfiles (and they&#x27;re Python!)<p>* Wish you had a <i>real</i> EX mode? Qutebrowser has one and it does not disappoint in terms of customization&#x2F;functionality. It&#x27;s actually the linchpin of the the entire UX, much like the Omnibar is for Chrome.<p>* Wish you had a keyboard-driven text selection mode? Qutebrowser has one!<p>* Hate file pickers forcing you to reach for the mouse? Qutebrowser implements its own keyboard-driven file picker (and it&#x27;s actually <i>really good</i>!)<p>Have you considered other browsers in the past, but passed them up due to a lack of extension support? Well... Qutebrowser can&#x27;t handle WebExtensions, but it <i>does</i> provide most features you would miss:<p>* Dark Mode? It exposes the same performant, engine-level dark mode that Chrome does<p>* Adblock? Qutebrowser supports hostlist-based adblocking (with auto-update) OR, if you want <i>real</i> Adblock, you can install jblock for qutebrowser, which is comparable functionality-wise to &quot;uBlock&quot;-type extensions (yes, including Youtube)<p>* Userscripts? Qutebrowser supports loading userscripts and is mostly compatible with the GreaseMonkey 3&#x2F;4 APIs. This covers what most &quot;minor&quot; extensions (e.g. HTTPS Everywhere &#x2F; Old Reddit redirectors &#x2F; UI tweaks) can do<p>* Custom CSS? Most &quot;userstyle&quot;-type websites package a &quot;Greasemonkey&quot; version that will work just fine with the previously remarked userscript functionality<p>* Password management? Qutebrowser comes with scripting support that will allow you to interface with your desktop-side password manager. Out of the box, it comes pre-packaged with scripts for connecting to GNU pass, bitwarden, keepass, and lastpass.')
