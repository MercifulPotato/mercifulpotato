Apparently they wanted to help build a massive superhighway from mexico to somewhere in the midwest.<p>It&#x27;s a great idea.<p>Walmart should be taking much more initiative in all of this as one of the only entities that can feasibly take on Amazon.<p>I wish the President would make a national strategy over this &#x27;Digital Pathways Act 2030&#x27; - i.e. make all major highways, railroads, and other &#x27;rights of way&#x27; completely autonomous and electric by 2030.<p>Even for human passenger cargo - long-haul buses may actually compete with trains on price and comfort if they were fully autonomous - especially for shorter routes.<p>One of the problems with &#x27;trains&#x27; in America is that the US is a little spread out, trains can&#x27;t just go downtown to downtown - but autonomous buses could.<p>So this could be like quasi-public transport initiative from at very least New England down to DC - that entire corridor.<p>What we need is someone to &#x27;re-brand&#x27; bus travel and make it social acceptable for middle&#x2F;upper class folks to ride instead of the agrarian&#x2F;lower-class greyhound. Nothing against greyhound but it&#x27;s just not the experience many people want.')
