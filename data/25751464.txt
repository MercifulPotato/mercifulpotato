Userspace instructions are translated just like they are in full system mode, but when a system call is encountered, the arguments are translated between the host and guest system.  So the guest architecture linux program &#x27;just works&#x27;.  There&#x27;s also hooks you can enable in binfmt-misc to make the loader invoke the qemu binary automagically.')
