Graphics cards, ram, sounds cards, USB devices, network devices, etc.<p>When you move from one component to another, it&#x27;s as simple as installing a driver and everything will just work.<p>I understand that a challenge with ARM SoCs is that chip makers need to create complete OS releases that contain all of the drivers for that SoC&#x2F;it&#x27;s embedded components.<p>This means that despite a device having the same GPU or NIC as another device, there isn&#x27;t an easy way to take the drivers for the known devices and putting them on another (similar) OS.<p>A few examples:<p>Despite running a linux kernel, an Android phone can&#x27;t have the hardware drivers extracted from its ROM and then dropped on another Linux based OS. e.g. you can&#x27;t run the ARM build of Ubuntu on a phone.<p>Despite running a linux OS and being an open platform, you can&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; run any distro on a Raspberry Pi.<p>Similarly, Microsoft doesn&#x27;t provide an ISO for ARM Windows because you need to have the drivers ready to go before you boot. This means the conventional installation method of Windows doesn&#x27;t make sense in the context of an ARM device.<p>Any reason we don&#x27;t have a more generalised and modular approach to Arm drivers?')
