Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606951878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278680, text='HN doesn&#x27;t &quot;hate humor.&quot; It just is picky about its humor.<p>HN hates lazy comments.<p>HN hates ugly comments and a lot of humor is both lazy and ugly.<p>HN intentionally and consciously seeks to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high. Humor tends to harm the signal-to-noise ratio, which further fuels HN pickiness about what kind of humor is acceptable here.<p>Humor on the internet is inherently challenging because it often relies on voice tone, body language and other cues to signal &quot;This is a joke.&quot; On the internet, memes substitute imagery in a way that helps provide visual cues and the formatting here doesn&#x27;t support communicating in that style, which makes humor even more challenging on HN.<p>If you are looking for light-hearted snark for some reason, HN is really not the place for that. There are plenty of places to find that and that&#x27;s just not the purpose of this site.')
