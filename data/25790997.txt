From elsewhere in the article:<p><i>The records are linked to police investigations that were terminated before charge (No Further Action or NFA cases) or to those where an individual had been acquitted at court.</i><p>Instead of complaining about &quot;huge dangers for public safety&quot;, why isn&#x27;t the Opposition asking why people who have been through potentially traumatic and potentially damaging experiences within our criminal justice system but who were never found to have done anything wrong in the eyes of the law still have deeply personal data like fingerprints and DNA on file <i>at all</i>?<p>It looks like Labour are completely on the wrong side of this one, and someone has put out a knee-jerk press release to try to score political points before thinking it through. I&#x27;m surprised, because Starmer (Labour&#x27;s leader) usually comes across as quite cautious and reasonable about legal matters. He was a human rights lawyer and then the DPP (the head of our public prosecution service) before moving into politics, and I would have expected a very different position here.')
