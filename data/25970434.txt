But I feel like it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;d want to use, would be happy to use, am incentivized to use. Where-as I would be hestitant to keep throwing $10 after prints, that I wasn&#x27;t super sure about. Buying my own printer lets me leave the scarcity model behind. It frees me from the act of deliberation. It gives me faster turn around, to experiment.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why people keep foisting what seems like such terrible &amp; limiting advice on me, to not invest in ownership, not invest in myself. It&#x27;s confusing. It&#x27;s not backed up with arguments. This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve had this exact same encounter on HN. I welcome some healthy questioning, but no one has given me any arguments, anything to go on.<p>I should probably start by ordering some prints. See how that goes. Sample the idea. But even throwing $60 at some prints- it feels like a lot of money, that could be better invested.')
