The tech, hacking, drugs, and weird AI were mostly the <i>setting</i> for the main themes of corporate power and how technology enabled new forms of control&#x2F;manipulation.<p>When an article compared William Gibson&#x27;s visions to Second Life, he rejected the notion explicitly[1]:<p><pre><code>    But as Gully Jimson says, in The Horse&#x27;s Mouth,\n    &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the vision I had.&quot;\n\n    Neither is Second Life.\n\n    Chia and her buds build their treehouses in\n    corporate ghost sites. That&#x27;s the difference.\n    Interstitial. Gotta be interstitial.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve only seen the first few hours of Cyberpunk 2077, but so far it has the potential for some of the social&#x2F;political themes. The &quot;Corpo&quot; prelude depicting a corporation abusing its power to &quot;repo&quot; parts of someone&#x27;s body was a good start, but so far the game hasn&#x27;t returned to that theme, instead focusing more on the tech&#x2F;combat.<p>Unfortunately, the trend over the last few decades in cyberpunk has steadily shifted towards aesthetics. The only true counterexample I know of (and <i>by far</i> the best cyberpunk movie ever made is <i>Sleep Dealer (2008)</i>. Its aesthetics suffered due to a very tiny budget, but it was shockingly prescient in its depiction of the &quot;gig economy&quot; and drone violence.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;williamgibsonblog.blogspot.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;03&#x2F;#8519138918500252617" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;williamgibsonblog.blogspot.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;03&#x2F;#8519138918500...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CZr8A_9VZBw&amp;disable_polymer=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CZr8A_9VZBw&amp;disable_polymer=...</a>')
