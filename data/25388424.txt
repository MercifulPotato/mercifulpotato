The pardon removed the conviction from his record, but the punishment had already taken place.<p>Similarly, McDougal had finished serving her sentences after conviction by the time she was pardoned.<p>Rich did get pardoned before standing trial, but that was because he fled the country in 1983 when he learned there would be charges.  So this is a case of a pardon preventing trial and punishment.')
