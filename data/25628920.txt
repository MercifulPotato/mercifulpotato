Essentially online advertising makes a marketing team’s life much easier even though it could be a net negative for the business revenue.<p>When I was doing some work in this space for Travelocity many years ago the biggest problem was cannibalism of data and traffic. Yes, the traffic coming in from ads was shitty and generally costs more than it returned, but even still cannibalism was the bigger problem. We would have been better off taking all the ads off the site and spending money in other offline venues. It was so apparent that ad spend was a drug addiction. I still don’t understand how this was a mystery to anybody in management considering the strength of the brand and the success of their television ads.<p>Eventually the business imploded and the partner&#x2F;affiliate segment became more valuable than the core business partially because it was absent online ad spend.')
