So if this years cars do not have air conditioning, but next years cars do, the prices can increase accordingly without showing up as inflation, because you are getting &quot;more car for more money&quot;. The problem appears at the point, when there are no cars without air conditioning anymore: You actually have to pay more to get a car, while your inflation statistics still say, prices have not risen.')
