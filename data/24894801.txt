Those &quot;abstractions&quot; are always leaky and everyone has to understand their implementation to be able to work with them or read code that uses them.<p>Other language limit what you can do with abstraction. You get libraries with less nice api&#x27;s but you have less digging to do to understand a piece of code that make use of them.')
