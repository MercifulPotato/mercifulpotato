I remember a study was done a long time ago (20 years ago) and smokers were a <i>net contributor</i> to the gov&#x27;t coffers.<p>They paid a lot in cigarette taxes (even when the taxes were lower).<p>Those that got lung cancer didn&#x27;t cost that much to treat because, well, there weren&#x27;t great treatments.
