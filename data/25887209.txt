This is a universal truth for all companies with more than about 50 employees I’ve worked for.<p>Who’s the time thief? There’s only one and it’s efficiency or lack thereof.<p>At best I’m good for 4 hours a day, probably in separate 1 hour long bursts with downtime between them. No mandated attendance, hours, management technique, motivational theory is going to improve that. Pay me for what I can do not when I can do it.')
