So the first request will take longer, then after that it&#x27;ll be fast.<p>Alternatively, on a per-page decision you could decide to use server side generation (page built at compile time) or server side rendering (page compiled when requested).<p>You have options that let you spread out the time, but ultimately it&#x27;s going to take time to build millions of pages.')
