Item(by='gorpomon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606476685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221812, text='&gt; When you tell my boss bad news before me, even with the best of intentions, I end up getting in a lot of trouble for not knowing before he did. Can you try to tell me first, going forward?<p>I understand that this is a contrived example for a book, but I wish they would have taken time to contrive a healthier example. As a manager, I can&#x27;t imagine ever admonishing someone for not knowing something before I did, and at minimum I would explore what&#x27;s going on.<p>While this might sound nit-picky, a book read by millions will in some small way create and enforce norms for managers, and do we really want to enforce that in this situation the feedback is for the low-level employee and not the senior manager?')
