They are not randomly distributed. Every roll&#x2F;batch has the same number of small and mid-prices, let say under 5k$ to 10k$. As for the big prices they take care that they are evenly distributed across the country and over the lifetime of the game.<p>A smaller scale trick is to social engineer the cashier to know which rolls have already released their prices, and buy from other rolls. Cashiers often tend to naturally do this with there best customers.')
