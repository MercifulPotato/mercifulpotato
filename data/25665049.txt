Item(by='dj_mc_merlin', descendants=None, kids=[25665546, 25665417, 25665427], score=None, time=1609979084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664576, text='&gt; So let me ask: on what basis did you arrive at your opinion?<p>I will answer this, although more than likely my comment will get killed soon:<p>I believe that the high-risk people (elderly, immuno-compromised, people with diseases that put them at risk) should go into voluntary quarantine if they wish, together with a government package to support them. Anyone who wishes to undergo lockdown can also do so, although with no package beyond what they would normally get. The rest can do as they please.<p>This will not stop the ICU beds from filling up obviously, which is why they should be triaged to high-risk patients, frontline staff, and people who underwent quarantine and lockdown. When capacity allows, other people too. The people who chose not to lockdown deal with it, or die.<p>This is probably unimplementable in the real world. That said, it would mean the lowest amount of economic stress (which kills silently) for the following years. On some level, it also appeals to the human need for cause: those people that died of corona and didn&#x27;t get treatment &quot;did it to themselves&quot;. The high-risk people do not get sacrificed.')
