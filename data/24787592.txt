Not to mention ICE detention camps.<p>&gt; Are they tracked through a social credit system where you can&#x27;t get a train out of your town if it&#x27;s bad?<p>Ever had to get a background check for a job? To rent a house?<p>The only reason this is so visible in China is because it&#x27;s foreign to us.
