They have to release stats that show what percentage of customers called in <i>with a custom firmware</i> and <i>how long it took the techs to solve their issue</i>.<p>I guaran-fucking-tee you someone smart enough to flash a custom firmware will likely have scoured the Internet for the answer first. Most of the time, they&#x27;ll find their answer somewhere on a forum &#x2F; blog post. I would actually be willing to bet money that technical support spends far less time with these people than it does with older customers who &quot;can&#x27;t be bothered with reading&quot; or younger customers who grew up in the &quot;it just works&quot; generation.<p>There seems to be a middle ground of people, I think we&#x27;re called the Analog-To-Digital generation, that had to actually put effort into learning technology, because so much shit had to be manually configured, that we gained a pretty solid understanding of tech and we don&#x27;t have the fear of it that I see in people even just five years older than me (I&#x27;m 40), and the lack of interest in digging around in the &quot;guts&quot; that I see in people far younger than me (25 and under).')
