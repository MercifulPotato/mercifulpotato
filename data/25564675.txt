All you gotta do is turn on a ZFS-system and hit the &quot;scrub&quot; command. That automatically checks all checksums: and error-corrects all data that fails a checksum.<p>If anything, ZFS makes that whole system you just described easier and more automatic. Its not really hard for me to push the &quot;scrub&quot; button on my Nas4Free box every few months.')
