And I find the experience on Windows much more productive than any Linux distribution.<p>Windows has a cohesive interface, and only one interface, so there is no issue of applications looking completely out of place. It&#x27;s far more stable than any Linux desktop. A GPU hang in Windows is usually a black screen for few seconds and a message &quot;Graphics driver had to be restarted&quot;, in Linux it takes down the entire OS with it and needs a reboot.<p>Apt-get breaks every few weeks and when it breaks you have to google obscure solutions to fix a hanging lock file or broken dependencies. And most of the solutions are of the kind &quot;well, it works in that other distro&quot;. Except when you switch to that distro something else doesn&#x27;t work because there are hundreds of distros, some of them with their own package managers.<p>No thanks, I&#x27;ll stay with Windows for now. Ironically I think Microsoft would have the best shot at making a workable Linux. Kind of like Google hid Linux underneath Android and ChromeOS, the same way Microsoft could make Lindows which hides every nasty Linux bits and exposes a consistent environment.')
