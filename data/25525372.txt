They do reporting: they call people, develop sources, and work with fact checkers. That doesn&#x27;t make them right all the time, or mean you should read them uncritically. But, of course, the bullshit meme is that you shouldn&#x27;t take them seriously at all. It&#x27;s premised on holding journalists to a standard we don&#x27;t hold doctors to, let alone software developers.')
