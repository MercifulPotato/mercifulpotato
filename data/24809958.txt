Since certainly residents of DC do vote for president, among other leaders.<p>Of course congressional representation for DC is a political issue. Framing this as an issue of democracy doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story. DC is a federal district and by design has no representation in Congress. This was a political decision.<p>Congressional action to grant DC statehood outright has no precedent and seemingly goes against the constitution. If residents of DC want the same congressional representation as states, then retrocession to return parts of DC to Maryland or Virginia is the main constitutionally viable option - this has been done before. Congress granting DC statehood outright would be a misuse of their power. This whole thing is rife with politics.')
