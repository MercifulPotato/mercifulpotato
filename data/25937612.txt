Yeah, I know, libertarian nerds (meant with all possible respect). But almost nobody else.<p>Anyone who wants a good physician.<p>&gt; Part of the point (not all of it, to be sure) of things like the AMA, the FDA and other governmental regulation is to make people&#x27;s lives simpler. Stop worrying about whether the doctor you&#x27;re going to see has even met a basic level of medical qualification, and focus on whether you like their personality and approach, for example.<p>If those things worked, this would be a point. Currently people can’t even afford to go to medical school, or afford to see a doctor, and when they get past the gatekeepers they are so desparate to get treatment that they can’t really even fathom rejecting a doctor because of a poor bedside manner.')
