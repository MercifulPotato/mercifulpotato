Item(by='drewg123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607362335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334371, text='I have a builder-grade gas stove, and my gf moved into a new place with a fancy new high-end Bosch induction cooktop.  I cook on both regularly.  The induction stove is far slower to heat up, and very finicky to use (will sometimes shut off).  Not to mention that my gf had to get mostly new pots and pans to use the induction, since most of her existing pots and pans were not magnetic.<p>Also, the gas stove will continue to work when the power is out.  All I have to do is light it with a match, but the induction cooktop will be out of commission as long as the power is out.  We regularly have electric outages, but I don&#x27;t remember ever having a gas outage.')
