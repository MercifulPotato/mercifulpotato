I call it a hack because the proper solution would be to have a line-shaped source that extends between the last and current mouse positions. Native might allow you to marginally pump up the FPS, but that wouldn&#x27;t save you from the little blobs.<p>(edit: just to be clear, I&#x27;m not the author but this issue is common enough)')
