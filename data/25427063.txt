Item(by='pb7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608007092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426981, text='I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple.<p>Prop 13 shields NIMBYs from negative externalities of their desire for their neighborhoods not to change. Housing is in short supply which inflates property values, but they don&#x27;t have to worry about that because they don&#x27;t want to sell and property taxes continue to remain low due to Prop 13. They can either pass down their property to their children (taxes remain unchanged) or they sell and cash out on their uber expensive property and move out of state sometime later in life. As I alluded in other comments, I suspect it is more often the former rather than the latter since it doesn&#x27;t make sense to sell.<p>The incentive to build is low because most existing property owners want to continue living somewhere in the Bay Area and if they move, their taxes reset. Building more units on the same property is a non-starter for that reason. Yes, zoning is also a factor, and goes hand-in-hand with the same agenda that Prop 13 came out of. It&#x27;s multiple cuts from the same cloth.')
