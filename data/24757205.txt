They didn&#x27;t argue against the usefulness of lockdowns in themselves. However, lockdowns have significant impact on poor people getting poorer.<p>WHO envoy Dr. David Nabarro:<p>&gt; &quot;We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we’d rather not do it.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never, ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Just look at what’s happened to the tourism industry in the Caribbean, for example, or in the Pacific because people aren’t taking their holidays&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Look what’s happened to smallholder farmers all over the world. Look what’s happening to poverty levels. It seems that we may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition.&quot;')
