Unscrupulous private companies with criminal managers that break the law?<p>A company taking a person’s passport is explicitly illegal in the UAE: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dubaihow.com&#x2F;holding-passport-employee-uae&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dubaihow.com&#x2F;holding-passport-employee-uae&#x2F;</a><p>It carries a criminal prison sentence and a fine.
