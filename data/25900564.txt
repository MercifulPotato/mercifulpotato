You say that this is an autopilot, you make them purchase self driving capability package, you say that the car comes with all the hardware necessary for self driving, you fans post videos online about cars driving themselves and in the small print you say that it&#x27;s not autopilot but Autopilot and the drivers must pay attention all the time and you put very weak safeguards to enforce that attention.<p>It&#x27;s simple plausible deniability for Tesla and the fanboys.
