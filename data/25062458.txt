Thank god I didn&#x27;t have to. :)<p>Question: The Collection&#x2F;Item data structure seems simple but also quite powerful at the same time. However, for lots of applications I imagine it would be nice to have some common abstractions available in the API instead of having to roll my own. I&#x27;m thinking of, e.g., data structures like queues, stacks, dictionaries, trees, and also conflict resolution strategies. Are there any plans to add those to the API?')
