(since before I joined the company anyway)<p>ArcGIS 10.2.1 comes with 2.7.5, [1] and is very, <i>very</i> old. It was released in Jan 2014 and hit EOL in 2019. [2]<p>All not-EOL versions of ArcGIS Server support python 3.x. But if you&#x27;re using ArcMap, upgrading to a later version will not move you to python 3.x: you&#x27;ll have to migrate to ArcGIS Pro for that. (note for the unaware: this is not a &quot;well just buy the more expensive thing&quot; post. ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro share the same license.) I recommend migrating to Pro for this and other reasons, but I understand that a lot of orgs don&#x27;t have that on their roadmap.<p>Out of curiosity, is there a technical reason why your org isn&#x27;t using a supported version, or is it an &quot;ain&#x27;t broke&quot; situation? I&#x27;d ask migrating to ArcMap to Pro, but if you&#x27;re on 10.2.1... yeah.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.esri.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;technical-article&#x2F;000013224" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.esri.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;technical-article&#x2F;000013224</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.esri.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Products&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;arcgis-desktop&#x2F;arcmap&#x2F;10-2-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.esri.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Products&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;arcgis-desktop&#x2F;...</a>')
