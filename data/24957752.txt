Every other week there was a case we hadnt covered (and fixed for the next week);\n- white ball swapped for orange ball\n- player swapped shirt, new number. (We tracked players by number on their back)\n- player swapped shirt to a number someone else had\n- player swapped shirt to no number\n- player shirt covered entirely in mud\n- player swaps shirt where number is white instead of black \n- white ball left on sideline (2 balls)\n- crowd releases 50 white balloons onto the pitch\n- ref swapped shirt colour \n- sideline advert has a filled in white O on it (moving around)<p>There were loads more, but that was off the top of my head. I dont think we ever mistake a head for a ball though! We worked out likely balls from movement (syncing cameras with bounces)')
