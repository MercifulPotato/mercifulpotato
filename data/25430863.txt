IIRC MikroTik had 1 or 2 0-days a few years back that let you get root. Sure enough my ISP decided to leave their http and WinBox (config tool) ports open to everyone downstream - easy target.<p>I contacted them and told them to upgrade the router and close the ports. Didn&#x27;t get a reply but the ports were closed after a while so I thought that was that.<p>Fast forward to a few weeks back - I was playing around with RoMON settings on my MikroTik router (it&#x27;s their proprietary protocol for debugging&#x2F;proxying&#x2F;chaining routers behind nat so if you mess up the config you can still access it). Lo and behold - over 150 MikroTik routers, all one hop way from each other, all with RoMON on for all ports. All over the city judging form the AP names. All outdated as well.<p>And to make matters worse - they hadn&#x27;t even upgraded the one router upstream from me that I complained about in the first place!')
