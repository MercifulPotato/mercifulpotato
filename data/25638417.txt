(We&#x27;re an HPC&#x2F;Supercomputing Cloud Platform) We are a Y Combinator startup with top investors: Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, &amp; a bunch of others. I think we&#x27;re now #39 on the Top YC list. We have about 200 employees scattered around the world, with about 35 software developers. The company still feels small and everyone is pretty tight. Work atmosphere is fun &amp; friendly.  We are growing very rapidly--all departments are hiring. It&#x27;s exciting, a lot of opportunity, interesting technical problems to solve, definitely a good time to join. Devs that come in now will have the opportunity to have a big impact on the future of our company, our code &amp; our culture.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for: Senior Backend Engineers, Full Stack, Data Engineers, &amp; Software Engineers')
