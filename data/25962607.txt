If you want, we&#x27;re willing to <i>loan</i> you an additional $1k.&quot; I think more people might refrain from margin trading if it was presented that way. But it would reduce trading volume, and therefore a major revenue source in the form of trading data they sell to market makers, so of course they don&#x27;t do that.<p>As it stand though, to my outsider&#x27;s eyes it makes their theoretical liabilities twice their collateral. Normally that&#x27;s probably fine, gains &amp; losses on large volumes of divers stockes will even out. But in unique circumstances (um, right now) the collapse of a single stock (or worse, a highly correlated asset class) puts them on the hook for an amount equal to their customers&#x27; losses. \nConsidering their retail clientele, it&#x27;s probably fair to assume that many of their customers can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) cover those loses by depositing more cash... hence the suicide a while back.')
