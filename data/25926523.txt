It fills the same role as Twitter, but people&#x27;s posts disappear after a few seconds, making it better than Twitter.<p>Also like Jodel it is anonymous[1], which is a good thing whenever possible as has become obvious lately.<p>[1]: wrt other users. Random nutjobs of all shapes cannot <i>easily</i> find you and nobody can verify if Jodel have really banned someone so they can to a larger degree do what they think is correct instead of what the mob demands. Threaten someone however and police will have your adress shortly, - Jodel is not an alternative to Signal or Matrix.')
