I tend to think of those ~18€&#x2F;month that I pay as a democracy fee – it&#x27;s certainly expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny err… cent.<p>I never watch&#x2F;listen to any German public broadcasting channel on television&#x2F;radio and am still forced to pay nonetheless -- because I could theoretically use them. That&#x27;s outrageous, to be frank. Honestly, having every household pay the fee while pretending it is not a tax is nothing but a vile gaslighting campaign. I make a habit of paying it 3 months late in order to create as much additional work and cost for them as possible, so far without any legal ramifications.')
