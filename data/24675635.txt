Both from the performance and price and of course, because of the iOS compatibility.<p>Apple&#x27;s pricing strategy over the past few years has been to reduce the entry-level costs of their devices thus increasing their marketshare, ecosystem lock-in and services revenue. It&#x27;s the strategy they&#x27;ve employed with the entry level iPad, iPhone SE and Apple Watch SE, and I fully expect them to bring to same strategy to the Mac, now that they no longer have to pay Intel&#x27;s profit margins.<p>We&#x27;ll very likely see a MacBook in the $700 price range in the upcoming months. That would put the price of Apple&#x27;s entry-level MacBook right around the that of an average notebook computer in the United States, while providing far better performance than their competitors in that price range (see A14 benchmarks). This would naturally provide Apple with a big marketshare boost in the consumer notebook space.<p>Ultimately nobody but Apple knows exactly what their pricing strategy will be with Apple Silicon based notebooks. However, if I were competing with Apple in this space, I&#x27;d be tremendously concerned.')
