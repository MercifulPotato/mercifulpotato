Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[25299582, 25302501, 25299829], score=None, time=1607062036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298748, text='&gt; I feel investing anything more than the bare minimum to get your assigned work done is worth less than just grinding leetcode and otherwise studying for interviews. Doing an actual good job, above and beyond, is not going to be worth much when you&#x27;re looking for your next job.<p>I feel precisely the opposite: if you work somewhere with people you like working with (and who like working with you) then you will start to get hired through your network, not through your mad leetcode skillz.<p>That&#x27;s what networking really is, not &quot;networking sessions&quot; or various going through the motions you&#x27;ll hear described in a seminar.  It&#x27;s simple human connections from people saying &quot;Hey, I&#x27;d like to work with decafninja again&quot; or &quot;Oh, you need a frobnitz expert?  You know, I know someone called decafninja who might be able to help you.&quot;')
