You&#x27;re not payed for being a rockstar, you&#x27;re payed for the least amount of money you&#x27;re willing to work for. Indian rockstar coders may be as productive as American ones, the difference is their cost of living is lower, so they&#x27;re willing to do the same work for less money. Same reason your barista in SF makes more money than the same barista in Podunk Idaho despite serving just as much coffee.')
