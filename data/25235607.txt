I wire money out of China on a regular basis to my home account in Canada.  Have to give copies of tax forms and a copy of my contract to the bank, but that&#x27;s about it.  Other than that, it&#x27;s the same as wiring money from Canada to any other country.  There is a limit each year, but I&#x27;ve never been able to hit it.  And a bunch of my foreign colleagues have half of their salary automatically deposited in USD accounts in their home country.  Not me, but the point is that there are options.')
