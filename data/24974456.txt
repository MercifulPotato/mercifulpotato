I tried more expensive Moleskine notebooks a while ago and found a surprising problem with them. They were too beautiful to use. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to blemish them with my unfiltered flow-of-mind notes which would often turn out chaotic and stupid. I would only write things down selectively when I felt they were worthy and sufficiently structured. This would in turn inhibit most of my writing and significantly reduce the value of this habit. With a cheaper notebook the effect disappears. The less holy it is, the more useful it becomes.<p>On the other hand I highly recommend finding a really good pen to write with.')
