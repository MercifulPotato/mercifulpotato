Having the basis of comparison to know &#x27;what it felt like before&#x27; you might be inclined to think the world is in disarray.<p>Imagine if you remembered a time when many inner cities were not &#x27;no go zones&#x27; full of extreme crime and poverty - and that those were just &#x27;normal&#x27; neighbourhoods, imagine seeing that precipitous decline in real time.
