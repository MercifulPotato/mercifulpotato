Item(by='xur17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608047555, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410064, text='&gt; Bitcoin proponents make a big deal when some giant fund invests an experimental $100M in crypto tokens (a small fraction of a percent for the fund), but they don&#x27;t seem to care about $20B of fake money from Tether (a large percentage of the total money supposedly in Bitcoin).<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is true. I get the impression that Bitcoin &#x2F; crypto proponents see it as a problem (it&#x27;s regularly discussed amongst them), but really aren&#x27;t sure what they can do about it. A lot of people avoid holding it and say it&#x27;s risky &#x2F; a problem waiting to happen, but beyond that, I fail to see what they can do.')
