Item(by='alecbz', descendants=None, kids=[25427153], score=None, time=1607972699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419130, text='Re. strawman: maybe this is a good essay, but I was referencing Dumblydorr&#x27;s assertion that if someone else had written this essay it would be considered mediocre&#x2F;not make it to the top of HN, and your response that this is irrelevant, since the author _is_ in fact PG.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where the no-true Scottsman is?<p>&gt; I can’t really see what you are trying to accomplish by insisting there is something called a ‘good’ essay, whose hallmark is it’s persuasiveness in the absence of knowledge about the author.<p>Really? This seems entirely non-controversial to me. It&#x27;s more-or-less &quot;don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover&quot;. Maybe I was over-emphasizing _how_ important this is (&quot;hallmark&quot; is probably too strong), but all-else-equal, a text being able to rely on the arguments made within as opposed to who the author is seems positive. And I think there&#x27;s _obviously_ metrics by which you can judge an essay&#x27;s good-ness beyond its author.<p>[SSC][0] is a good example. I think he writes very interesting essays that captivate and convince people on their own. The only &quot;reputation&quot; he had when he started was that he was psychiatrist. Recently he&#x27;s gotten a bit more popular, but still, his reputation is just &quot;someone who writes good essays&quot;.<p>Are you suggesting it&#x27;s dangerous that SSC writes good, convincing essays, despite the fact that he&#x27;s not some well-known figure?<p>If you have no previous knowledge of a cult, getting convinced by their writing seems to be more about getting convinced by bad arguments than it is about attempting to consider arguments directly. And once you&#x27;re already in a cult, I think it&#x27;s a very common feature to have members rely <i>only</i> on the reputation of the cult leader without trying to think critically about the actual things they&#x27;re saying.<p>Like, let&#x27;s say someone gets indoctrinated into a cult. You could say &quot;Yeah, see, if they had just discounted the cult leader due to their reputation instead of trying to actually read what they had to say, they wouldn&#x27;t have gotten indoctrinated.&quot; I guess? But they could have also used more scrutiny in examining the arguments? And if the reader isn&#x27;t using scrutiny to examine the arguments, why do we think they&#x27;re going to make good decisions about whose reputation to trust?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;</a>')
