I&#x27;ve tried to find bug reports (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mozilla-mobile&#x2F;fenix&#x2F;issues&#x2F;9773" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mozilla-mobile&#x2F;fenix&#x2F;issues&#x2F;9773</a>) but they don&#x27;t give me a clear indication as to whether it&#x27;s being worked on or not. Unfortunately degrades my experience to the point of using other browsers. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the old Firefox is available via the Play store in the meantime either?<p>It&#x27;s probably inevitable when you release a completely new version of something, but the small, missing features immediately become obvious&#x2F;upsetting!')
