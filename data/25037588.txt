The &quot;free&quot; market is supposed to be open to competition.  Why is it &quot;unfair&quot; for public bodies to compete?  Public bodies are, after all, funded by tax payers. Who in this case would be the recipients of the service.  So we have individuals desiring of a service, funding said service through a public body.  Now, the public body is not set up to pay a dividend to shareholders - instead it implicitly returns all profit to its consumers (presumably through reduced costs&#x2F;better service&#x2F;whatever).<p>Why is that unfair?  It&#x27;s not preventing commercial entities from competing.  If their business model is such that they can&#x27;t do so - e.g. because of the need to pay away dividends - then that&#x27;s their problem.<p>Now: I know there&#x27;s a lot more to it than that, e.g. public bodies accused of being propped up unfairly.  And I know Govt in the US is treated very suspiciously by a large cohort of society.<p>But that notwithstanding, why is it &quot;unfair&quot; if a community-oriented entity decides to compete with a commercial organisation?')
