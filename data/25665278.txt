Lockdown has been implemented too late to make any significant difference to that.<p>This is a common claim and I have seen it made about various periods of lockdown in various countries. &quot;Look, rate of increase started to slow within a week of lockdown, but it should take two weeks to see the effect, so it can&#x27;t be that lockdown has made any difference.&quot; There is usually far too much noise in the figures to make such a claim about small differences in time scale. Also if you were expecting a sudden drop after two weeks then you were bound to be disappointed. The amount of time it takes for an infection to become a recorded case of Covid will be random according to some distribution (possibly with a mean of one or two weeks) so the transition will be smooth.')
