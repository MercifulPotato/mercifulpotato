Realm is really easy to start, but not far from Core Data in its API. Dflat focuses on writing correct code easy, thus, its API is fairly different from these two. Its API resembles from Apple&#x27;s PhotosKit (which I liked the interface a lot), but generalized it and makes sure you can have concurrent and synchronous read, managed write threads, strict-serializable multi-reader &#x2F; multi-writer. Also paid extra attention to edge cases such as schema upgrade upon disk full (hence, read-only schema upgrade).')
