The major issue is we couldn&#x27;t do it without some major costs (It wouldn&#x27;t be cheap or free).<p>What we&#x27;d have to change is the way society consumes energy.  Right now, we operate under the paradigm of &quot;I request energy, the grid ramps up and down to fill demand&quot;.<p>Instead, we could to switch over to &quot;I ask the grid if capacity is available and use energy when it is&quot;.<p>That would require the ability for the grid to say &quot;no&quot; and for industries to respond to &quot;nos&quot;.  Nothing terribly hard about that with current data connections.<p>Easiest way to set that up is with energy bidding.  When production is high and demand is low, price goes down.  When production is low and demand is high, price goes up.  Some applications could even chose to just ignore it and always take (However, everyone could not do that).<p>What would be the consequence of such a system?  That&#x27;d mean things like manufacturing would have to have some ramping capabilities.  Homes might have to tolerate temps shifting higher or lower than is comfortable.  Goods might need to be transported at a much slower pace (Trans oceanic shipping, in particular, would need to be completely changed).  And some industries would probably die all together with current tech (such as the airline and cruise industry).<p>The next question is what do we consider as using fossil fuels?  For example, I wouldn&#x27;t call burning wood a fossil fuel (even though it releases CO2 into the atmosphere) nor would I consider turning vegetable oil into plastic as using a fossil fuel.  Both could be done today to keep the same amount of products, but would significantly change the cost characteristics of such things.  Plastics would suddenly become a lot more expensive, for example.<p>Steel production might go down, but would not be eliminated.<p>Concrete would be one that you&#x27;d have to define what you mean by &quot;fossil fuel&quot; as it would release CO2 but isn&#x27;t technically a fossil fuel.  The process of making concrete can be done without burning oil.')
