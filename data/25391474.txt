Item(by='brennen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607722981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390531, text='&gt; In one of this paper&#x27;s experiments, for instance, a computer split a pot of money between itself and a human participant; this person was led to believe the computer was also a human participant. Sometimes the pot was split unevenly, and the human participant was given a chance to take vengeance by reducing the computer&#x27;s pot without enriching his own. Researchers discovered that participants classified as having higher TIV scores were &quot;strongly associated with behavioral revenge&quot; in this scenario.<p>In retrospect, dictator game allocation scenarios presented to a pile of undergraduates by way of a screen were probably nonsensical back when I was helping my social science grad student friends implement them as crappy Perl CGI in like 2003. I&#x27;m disinclined to expect much better from this one.')
