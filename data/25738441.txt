The Facebook&#x2F;Twitter option enables embedded posts from those platforms on other domains. These frames, however, do not transfer cookies and do not permit the third-party access to storage. You can alter this behavior in brave:&#x2F;&#x2F;settings&#x2F;socialBlocking.<p>Your second link suggests Brave replaces ads on websites; this is also wrong. Brave removes harmful third-party ads and trackers (as these harvest user data, and violate privacy). Brave offers an alternative model (Brave&#x27;s privacy-respecting opt-in model) instead, which reward users with 70% of the associated revenue, while leaving their data untouched.<p>Your third link is, I believe, asking about our in-situ tipping buttons. These are triggers for the Tipping panel within Brave, enabling you to tip BAT to users on Twitter, GitHub, and elsewhere. I&#x27;m not sure what concerns you about this; these can be turned off in brave:&#x2F;&#x2F;rewards, if you like.<p>The last link you provided is also quite misleading. Brave distributed BAT grants to users, enabling those users to earmark tokens for content creators. Our interface at the time identified &quot;verified&quot; creators as such, but didn&#x27;t make an equally explicit identification of unverified creators. This lead to some confusion. But as a result of Tom Scott&#x27;s feedback in 2018, we saw massive improvements made to our UI&#x2F;UX and tipping model over 48 hours or so. Today unverified creators are clearly identified as such, and tips are held for them on the user&#x27;s device, rather than in a settlement wallet.
