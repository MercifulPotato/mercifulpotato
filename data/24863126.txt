FWIW, for a lot of practical applications the raw sensor data would be non-sparse but it would be transformed&#x2F;filtered almost immediately into a more space-efficient representation. For example in the case you mentioned (unless you think the entire country is completely underdug by tunnels) most of the raw data can be deleted immediately with no loss of signal as there is no underground system underneath that particular spot of land.')
