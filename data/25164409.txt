Based on Arch (love the AUR), but easier to setup (more opinionated out of the box).<p>Honestly the dark theme of the Gnome variant is the most beautiful dark theme I have ever found for a Linux DE.  I know there are lots of ways to tweak the various DEs to get some cool looking dark themes, but my experience is that they can take a lot of manual configuring and tend to still fail on the edge cases.  The dark theme bundled with Manjaro Gnome looks amazing right out of the box!')
