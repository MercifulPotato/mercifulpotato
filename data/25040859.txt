You hear pundits and journalists claiming things for fact, but what are the sources, and what is the <i>actual evidence</i>. The only evidence is &quot;everybody knows&quot;, or the U.S. intelligence community being &quot;certain&quot; of his fate. They were &quot;certain&quot; of a lot of things. If something that has received as wide a coverage as that event has had, imagine all the things we&#x27;ll never hear about.<p>&gt;<i>If nation states (even democratic in some instances) are willing to kill those who share the truth, is this something we should accept?</i><p>It&#x27;s amusing that I&#x27;m writing these lines near a street named &quot;Richelieu&quot; in Algiers. We&#x27;ll have to go back to Cardinal de Richelieu for whom the &quot;raison d&#x27;Ã‰tat&quot;[0] was a cornerstone.<p>I&#x27;d recommend the book &quot;Diplomacy&quot; by Henry Kissinger.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_interest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_interest</a>')
