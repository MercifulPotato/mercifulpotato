Of course we&#x27;ll never be popular in intellectual forums like HN, but if one pays attention to comments on more &quot;super-mainstream&quot; (ie: non-HN, non-Reddit social media, like online newspaper comment sections or in YouTube comments from local TV stations), I sense distinct growth in average sentiments in our favour.  To what degree this can be attributed to studies like this and the subsequent forum meme wars is obviously purely speculative, but I suspect &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as bad publicity&quot; is applicable here.')
