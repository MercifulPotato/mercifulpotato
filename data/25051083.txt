Rather than legislate that certain abuses of health aren&#x27;t okay, let&#x27;s instead make it so people aren&#x27;t stuck working jobs if they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. Right now, the main reason workplaces can abuse employees so much is that employees can&#x27;t quit, or else they&#x27;d starve on the street.<p>I know where you&#x27;re going and I&#x27;m a fence sitter.<p>&gt;If we had a livable universal basic income, that would allow anyone to, at any time, decide if their job&#x27;s extra income + the meaning it gave them was worth the stress and other issues.<p>Here in Canada we have tried basic income systems and even have a current system for some of our people.

It single handedly increases poverty and crime like no other policy.<p>Have you ever heard of a negative income tax rate? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xtpgkX588nM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xtpgkX588nM</a><p>&gt;We already have good evidence that this wouldn&#x27;t result in no one working since, well, quite a few of the people born wealthy enough to never need to work do work anyway.<p>Only when you exclude systems that arent by name which is common for socialist&#x2F;communist&#x2F;collectivist&#x2F;postmodernist or whatever the new brand is that they go by today as the old name becomes tarnished.<p>There&#x27;s tremendous evidence that welfare system in general have never been successful. When we have a problem that which the welfare system is proposed as the fix. The problem gets worse as the welfare system is implemented. Then the fix is that the welfare system needs more money and as they get more money the problem becomes worse.<p>In fact many of these systems are not designed to help the poor even though by name they are supposed to be.')
