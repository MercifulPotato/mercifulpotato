Item(by='bmitc', descendants=None, kids=[25682739], score=None, time=1610093579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25682612, text='What am I confused about other than what I asked? There’s two books. The first is <i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</i>, which used Common Lisp, and the second is <i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</i>, which to my knowledge primarily uses or encourages Python. I was trying to place what time Norvig was referring to in the linked comment. He mentions his book, which I assumed to be the modern approach one. The first edition came out in 1995 and the second in 2003. Python came out first in 1991, and he joined Google in 2001. His comment makes it hard to know when he was referring to (and thus even what book), and what I don’t know is if the first edition of the modern approach book used Python or if that came later in the second edition (without going and finding copies of the editions myself).')
