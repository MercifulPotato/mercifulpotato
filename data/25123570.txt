Item(by='anentropic', descendants=None, kids=[25123925], score=None, time=1605620390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25122915, text='I&#x27;m trying Pulumi at the moment, it seems pretty nice so far - I love that it&#x27;s not &quot;yaml templates&quot; or some other DSL, but just regular code.<p>But it seems like it covers a bit of a different space to Ansible... Pulumi will boot up your infrastructure but you still need something like Ansible to install packages on the nodes afterwards.<p>My impression of Ansible in the past was that it&#x27;s more complicated than it was supposed to be.<p>I kind of hope Pulumi will extend in that direction over time, I would rather use one tool for everything and I don&#x27;t see why it couldn&#x27;t.  The docs for writing your own providers are a bit weak at the moment though.')
