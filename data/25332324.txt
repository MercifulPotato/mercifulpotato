But unfortunately not all clients get this right, and the ones least likely to do so are <i>also</i> the older ones that likely will cease working when Identrust&#x27;s DST Root CA X3 expires.<p>A smart modern client (e.g. most current web browsers) will just use anything else you send as a hint that can help it find a way to trust the leaf certificate. You can send irrelevant garbage and it won&#x27;t count against you, but because other dumber clients exist, you are recommended <i>not</i> to send anything that doesn&#x27;t form a logical chain of certificates back to a trusted root.<p>Old versions of OpenSSL for example provide a trust decision framework that assumes any chain you show it is the only valid chain, if that chain is nonsense or untrusted, it gives up and fails immediately, even if it would be obvious to a human shown the same certificates that there&#x27;s a simple and correct trust path.<p>This is harder than it might seem because it&#x27;s a graph problem and the Web PKI graph contains multiple cycles, a naive algorithm may spin uselessly forever or miss &quot;obvious&quot; answers.')
