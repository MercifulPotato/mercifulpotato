For a project I&#x27;m working on, the input build.ninja file is 142MB. Just generating that files takes a few minutes.<p>I think an improvement would be to be able to split it in sub-trees and have ninja produce a &quot;mark&quot; file that has a date that represent when the last time the sub-tree was touched and to not even read any sub-tree files, even the sub-ninja file if an entire sub-tree date is older than the mark file.')
