I’ve done mushrooms 3 times, LSD once, and I’ve never felt that way. I recently did 3.5g of mushrooms and yeah, there were fractals covering most of my vision, but overall I felt pretty normal. I was definitely more relaxed, emotionally open and introspective, but it wasn’t anything particularly special. Going outside for a walk with the leaves changing wasn’t a mystical experience and having the same police car pass by me twice within a few minutes wasn’t anything unusual. I feel less anxious and depressed in the aftermath, but everyone talks about the psychedelic experience being life-changing and ineffable. And there’s a part of me that wonders why I don’t get that :&#x2F;')
