Doing so is currently still costly in terms of research, electronics, and power, so it&#x27;s unlikely that the SL terminal can do it. It would also require there to be a second PHY chip somewhere in the terminal, which would also drive up cost.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not really necessary. Satcom already requires nanosecond-level timing accuracy, so I would think their terminal can probably steer its beams with at most ms lag.')
