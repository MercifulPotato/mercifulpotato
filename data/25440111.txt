You have to spend a little to gather enough data on what actually works for your audience.<p>It might take $1000 in failed ads before you &quot;get&quot; your audience, but you might quit after spending $100. But the $900 in supposedly &quot;wasted&quot; ad spend will help you understand enough that you can make 10x higher revenue.<p>If you approach software development as an iterative activity, you should approach marketing the same way too.
