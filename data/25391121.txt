I&#x27;m not exactly sure why, but finding <i>useful</i> examples has been a serious pain point for me. It seems like there&#x27;s a serious dearth of material between the &quot;here&#x27;s the absolute smallest thing you can do&quot; and &quot;now we&#x27;re going to built the F-35, but with ROS!&quot;. Like, I want to subscribe to and manipulate the value in a topic. Fine. But how about <i>two</i> topics in the same program? All of a sudden my code won&#x27;t compile and the tutorials aren&#x27;t helpful.<p>Especially with the release of ROS2 (which, frustratingly, seems to be rarely stand-alone, in that the learning process often references or links to ROS(1) code through things like rosbridge), it&#x27;s just been a frustrating experience. If someone were to release a paid textbook walk-through that actually explains it in a systematic, stand-alone, way with linked repositories, I&#x27;d buy it tomorrow.<p>Which, I suppose, is sort of exactly where this kit is aimed!')
