The work of Dr. David Burns have proven to be most helpful to me! I&#x27;d suggest checking out his website feelinggood.com or his new book &quot;Feeling Great&quot; - he also has a podcast. FWIW, Dr. Burns is not some kind of &quot;self-help charlatan&quot; He is a Stanford MD&#x2F;Psychiatrist with decades of experience treating depression.  Best wishes!')
