You want those computed at build time, and not at runtime. I can:<p>* Run the math on a whiteboard, compute +5 or +15, hardcode that, and have the world explode when the code changes<p>* Run the math in code, at runtime, and have the system be slow.<p>* Code up the math, have it run at build time, and have a clear documentation of what the constant is, why, how it&#x27;s computed, and have it change automatically if the code changes.<p>There were awesome things done in C++ templates back in the day, with some pretty magical performance. The preprocessor would unroll loops to the appropriate level for a given processor, align things to cache boundaries, and similar.<p>I think the reason this might have gone away is that with GHz CPUs, few people care as much about performance anymore. Most code is no longer CPU-bound, but programmer-bound, and lower cognitive complexity is more important than better performance.')
