A company can make a product with 100 people and sell it to amillion customers.<p>In other industries, engineers (software or not) just make products and products are built and sold with &quot;normal&quot; margins and limited growth opportuntites. A healthy company can make a 10% profit every year for a century. Scaling up means having more people because you need more sales, more manufacturing and so on.<p>In some more pure tech industries like SaaS, Games etc, the profit margins can be much higher. I&#x27;d be upset too if I was at a company that made $1M profit per employee and I didn&#x27;t have a cut. That doesn&#x27;t apply to most software jobs (at least not here) though.')
