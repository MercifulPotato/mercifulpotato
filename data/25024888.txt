Previous to this I have tried other split layouts, including the X-Bows which I think is just a disaster.<p>The Moonlander I really _want_ to get along with. It has an almost but not quite perfect setup for Emacs, for example, with natural places for Ctrl and Alt, and the software and configurability is excellent. I’ll likely give it a few more months but honestly if you haven’t got pain to deal with I don’t think these fancy layouts are useful, and even then I’m not sure my joints are any happier.')
