Not everything is an event stream, why can&#x27;t we use the right tool for the job?<p>I think the idea is to provide a single async abstraction so everything can be used with rxjs operators. I&#x27;ve taken advantage of this several times with something like &quot;combineLatest&quot; to return the result of a http call and an event stream.<p>You can also call &quot;toPromise&quot; in rxjs to turn an observable into a then-able promise.')
