Yeah, we have different core counts and presence of SMT or iGPU, but you can get there with basically a single die design, or a small family of them, and blowing some fuses after binning.<p>Mobile SoCs tended to be a lot more bespoke.  The same basic CPU block might need to e paired with different modems, and physical space and production costs probably don&#x27;t accommodate doing the &quot;low-end by fusing off bits of big higher-end chips&quot; model.<p>As I understand it, Intel wasn&#x27;t fond of that sort of product diversity-- the Atom they developed for mobile devices was much more a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.<p>I also suspect the concept of being an external single source was unappetizing for buyers. Samsung has the choice of buying Snapdragons or making their own Exynos parts; low end manufacturers can cross-shop MediaTek or Allwinner.  If you&#x27;re too reliant on a uniquely Intel design, what happens if they have a production kink and you have a million phones awaiting processors?')
