I&#x27;ve worked for a couple of companies who open source their software and they don&#x27;t open source because they believe it&#x27;s good for the world (they may or may not, but it isn&#x27;t the driving motivation), they open source because it&#x27;s a near requirement for building a profitable business. It&#x27;s easier for a no-name company to convince enterprise clients to use your software when the code is open source - it&#x27;s often a non-starter if your code is closed-source. It&#x27;s easier to get developers and keep them happy. It&#x27;s easier to get community contributions. It&#x27;s easier to get your name out there (you lose a LOT if you have a software product without a GitHub).<p>As long as open-source is a near requirement for getting traction, I don&#x27;t think there is much to worry about.')
