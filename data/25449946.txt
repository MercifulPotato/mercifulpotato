That&#x27;s the web engine - and that&#x27;s WebKit&#x2F;Blink, with Chromium usually being the foundation.<p>That wasn&#x27;t a big problem when the guys at Google were still pushing for better web standards, but that&#x27;s no longer the case. Gecko may have a big window to become a really modular engine that any browser can use on any platform, and it could advertise itself like the modular, corporate-free, privacy-aware, fully standard-compliant solution that can power the next generation of browsers out there - or at least be an alternative to the WebKit&#x2F;Blink&#x2F;Chromium monopoly. I know that a while ago Mozilla had considered exposing Gecko as a browser-agnostic engine, but at some point for some reason they dropped the plan - and that&#x27;s quite a shame.')
