I don&#x27;t know anything about Chinese organized crime outside of GTA: SA.<p>Can the surname Tong itself signify any sort of association? I&#x27;m wondering because the San Francisco musician Winston Tong (most famously of Tuxedomoon) used it to his advantage, even though he was definitely not a gangster:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;In early March ’79, Tuxedomoon played their first two dates in Los Angeles at Madam Wong’s, where they were supposed to share a bill with Noh Mercy! (Esmeralda Kent’s duo that had released a single, &quot;Caucasian Guilt&quot; on Tadlock’s label and with which Tuxedomoon shared a manager). Unfortunately Madam Wong didn’t appreciate the quite punk lyrics of &quot;Caucasian Guilt&quot; and refused to let the pair play. Peter Principle: &quot;She and her Chinese mafia henchmen were threatening to force us off the road on our way back to San Francisco and that they would be following us for years. The actual quote went: &quot;Years from now, after you have forgotten this event, you will look over your shoulder and you will see the Tong.&quot; To cut a long story short, Winston told them that he was Tong and negotiated for hours with Madam Wong in Chinese to get her to reinstate the gig. She would still have nothing to do with Noh Mercy! though, so we had to do two sets per night&quot;.&quot; (Excerpt from Isabelle Corbisier&#x27;s &quot;Music for Vagabonds - The Tuxedomoon Chronicles&quot;)</i><p>Tuxedomoon also had a song &quot;Joeboy the Electronic Ghost&quot; with lyrics lifted from gang graffiti painted somewhere in the city.')
