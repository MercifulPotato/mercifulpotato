No amount of regulation will fix that.<p>At the same time you do of course need to have a select group of people that are specialised to deal with this &#x27;for the many&#x27;, which is where you get government and regulation. But that&#x27;s just an parallel path to a solution, not something that will &#x27;repair&#x27; the lack of understanding from the users.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that it used to be better or something; when you needed to know how electronics work to be able to buy, install, operate and maintain a basic radio it wasn&#x27;t very widely usable. (but at least the users knew enough to &#x27;own&#x27; their stuff)')
