Most developers are poorly prepared to debug build&#x2F;perf issues. A lot of author issues could be reduced by using right tooling.<p><pre><code>  - eslint for style\n  - Webpack Externals&#x2F;Module federation for build times\n  - Dependabot&#x2F;renovate for automatic dependacies\n  - codemon for automated refactors\n  - WSL2 or vagrant VM + docker-compose for local dev\n</code></pre>\nYou need someone that like tinkering with this stuff instead of doing Jira points game. Give that person autonomy and your team would move faster.')
