They dragged the police officer into the mob and proceed to beat him up with lead pipes.<p>&gt; even so thatâ€™s not representative of the whole.<p>I get that a portion of the mob were simply playing the role of useful idiots, but you&#x27;re talking about a mob who brought bombs, weapons, zip ties, and a freaking gallows.<p>How on earth is anyone still claiming the riot was remotely peaceful?')
