Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=[25812791, 25811995], score=None, time=1610900065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810646, text='Actually, I mean that I&#x27;m dreading the choice between replacing everything and dealing with a hodgepodge of different cables.<p>Right now, all of the &quot;source&quot; devices (for lack of a better word) have USB-A &quot;out&quot; — laptop, desktop, charging bricks — and all the peripherals — phone, tablet, bluetooth speaker, xbox controller… — have USB-Micro &quot;in&quot;. Thus, the only type of usb cable that I need is A-&gt;Micro.<p>If&#x2F;when I replace my phone, I have my first USB-C peripheral, but the others haven&#x27;t disappeared, so now I need both my old A-&gt;Micro cables <i>and</i> A-&gt;C for my phone. Same for my laptop, on the source end — now I need C-&gt;C and C-&gt;Micro, too. It gets worse: it&#x27;s rare that I want to charge&#x2F;connect all my peripherals at once, but it&#x27;s common that I&#x27;ll want to charge any two. Plus, you always want a spare.<p>So now instead of ~3 cables, I&#x27;m going to end up with probably 7 or 8, and when I go to grab one out of the drawer I&#x27;ll need to check both ends of the cable to know I&#x27;m getting the right one… ugh. The only way to keep the combinations under control is to replace all source devices or all peripherals at once (or take the middle ground and buy a bunch of C-&gt;Micro dongles, pair one with each peripheral, and now they&#x27;re faux-C peripherals). None of these options are particularly appealing to me.<p>I&#x27;m being a little melodramatic. It&#x27;s not <i>really</i> that big of a deal. I&#x27;ll live through it and eventually I&#x27;ll make it out the other end and maybe I&#x27;ll be in a C-&gt;C golden era. I&#x27;m just not looking forward to the transition when USB cable story right now is pretty simple (even if I dislike Micro; Mini was a far nicer connector).')
