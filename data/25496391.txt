Schools get paid no matter what, and have no liability for actually providing an ultimately valuable service.<p>Here’s an alternate arrangement. The school and government together co-guarantee the debt. Students’ monthly payments start 1 year after graduation or after the first year of less than 50% enrollment, payments are strictly calculated based as a percentage of income, and after 10 years of payments the government guarantee is retired. Any remaining balance on the loan then becomes dischargeable in bankruptcy and the school is liable for any unpaid balance.<p>Or something along that lines.  The program should be structured in a way that the government is only guaranteeing debt that is in proportion to the earnings power actually achieved, and the school becomes liable for debt that is out of proportion with the actual earnings power achieved.<p>Of course it’s a law of averages. Certain students will fail due to no fault of the school but overall a private school should be responsible for providing measurable value in proportion to its tuition charges.')
