He&#x27;s unlike any previous president, he has aggressively pursued his radical agenda, has broken every norm that has gotten in his way, communicates in purposefully shocking ways. I could go on and on. His supporters are also shocked though in a good way. He&#x27;s the most polarizing president of our lifetimes by far. Anybody who thinks he is normal is just not paying attention.')
