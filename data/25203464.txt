Apart from transaction costs, risk management and market impact there are also a lot of small operational details which can make or break your execution. One example I vaguely recall was that the details of how a specific foreign exchange conducted its closing auction could make a substantial difference to a strategy that involved executing there alongside other trading venues.<p>The payoff for getting these operational details right or wrong is massively asymmetrical. If you get everything right, you&#x27;ll only do as well as your model lets you. But if you get anything wrong, you run a real chance of losing far more money than you could have hoped to make!<p>Even just validating your strategy on historical data (ie back-testing) is harder than it sounds. If you make a mistake that leaks information to the code you&#x27;re testing, you can end up with a much rosier return and risk profile than you really have. Another way to lose money when you go put your model into action.<p>If you get over these challenges and run your strategy successfully for a while, other market participants are going to start adjusting against it and you have to adjust in turn. You can&#x27;t just &quot;set and forget&quot;.<p>I should note that I am far from an expert on any of this, though! I just know enough to not trade with serious moneyâ€”my real savings are all in index funds I don&#x27;t touch, thank you very much :).')
