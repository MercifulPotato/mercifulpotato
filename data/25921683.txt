I just push my app (RoR) and done. I’ve actually moved it once to k8s for a few months and decided to move it back after I understood how easy heroku made the opa side of the business.<p>Note: it’s a side project, 50 business users, $5k annual revenue, 4h per month as target for the time spent on customer support, admin and maintenance. So it’s both easy to pay heroku and important for me to not spend too much time on Ops.')
