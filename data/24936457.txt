QEMU is JITting so decode is only done once.  What helps here is the absence of crazy semantics, like flag updates.  Some things are still expensive, such as indirect branches (jalr), virtual memory translation (load&#x2F;store), and handling RISC-V&#x27;s 31 registers without hitting memory for each of them (the host ISA, x64, has only 16 architectural registers).')
