A fine-tuned Yolov4 model is used to get the location of the ball. Then, I implemented SORT tracking algorithm to keep track of each individual ball and filter out the misdetection noise. Lastly, I have applied some image registration techniques to deal with slight camera shift on each clip.<p>I&#x27;m still trying to improve it! Feel free to follow this project, also check out the Todo list.')
