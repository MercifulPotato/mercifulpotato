Item(by='RcouF1uZ4gsC', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606790857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261341, text='&gt;  I&#x27;ve never personally had a painful experience returning anything to Amazon.<p>This is the number one reason I buy from Amazon. 90% of the time, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference for me whether my purchase arrives in 2 days or 4 days. What matters is that if I do not like it, it is super simple and convenient for me to return it. I don&#x27;t even have to put it in a box of print a label these days. I can just take the items to UPS or Kohl&#x27;s, show them my phone code, and give it to them.<p>No other online retailer comes close to this level of convenience for returns.')
