The idea of &quot;most users don&#x27;t need this&quot; is misguided because while most of the functionality won&#x27;t be necessary for most users, users don&#x27;t necessarily agree on which features they will need, every one of them requiring a different subset of the features.<p>Just take something like a sheet music composer (something like Sibelius, Finale or Dorico). There&#x27;s no way in hell you can just strip out a significant chunk of the features because doing that would totally break the product for many, many users (incidentally, the YouTube channel tantacrul has some interesting videos about UX design in this space - not affiliated). Word processors, IDEs, etc. share similar fates.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m often annoyed when some programs pretend that I don&#x27;t need some functionality and prefer to present their minimalist UI to me that doesn&#x27;t let me do advanced stuff. A lot of macOS software IMHO suffers from this problem which is maybe great if you just want a barebones e-mail reader, say, but then you get something like XCode which doesn&#x27;t even have proper refactoring support because &quot;look at how complicated IntelliJ is&quot;.')
