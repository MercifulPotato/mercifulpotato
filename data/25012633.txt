I didn&#x27;t get the feeling that the OP was frantically trying to catch up on C++ because their workplace demands it. Rather, they seem to be a person trying to gauge what languages they should pursue in addition or instead of C++, of their own volition.<p><i>&gt; Not everyone is self employed and working alone.</i><p>I&#x27;m not asserting otherwise.<p><i>&gt; So my advice to a young developer would be to learn all of C++ or steer clear of it altogether. Learning C++ well enough to not be dangerous is a major undertaking.</i><p>My advice would be: it depends on what you&#x27;re going to do with it. What kind of projects are you involved in? Are you programming for yourself or in a team? If you&#x27;re in a team, these decisions all get made for you. If you&#x27;re programming for yourself, it may not be a problem to &quot;be dangerous&quot; while you&#x27;re learning.<p>It&#x27;s also worth considering what &quot;learn all of C++&quot; means. In my post, I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that people should refuse knowledge of features. What I meant to say is, they should make informed decisions about the features they&#x27;ll use. All of which applies of course only, as you so clearly stated, to people who actually have control over their usage of the language.')
