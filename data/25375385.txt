What Uber did was write a monstrosity with too many engineers and too many features without considering that was beyond their ability to deliver reliably. The product decision making was also clearly deficient and didn&#x27;t help.<p>Rewriting is neither a panacea nor a problem if you completely understand what you started with and what you will wind up with and be brutally honest. Trying to combine a rewrite with major feature changes is extremely hard to pull off (I&#x27;ve done it a couple times with iOS apps, not fun, but ours came out well) and adding a new language at the same time is probably beyond any team&#x27;s ability. A rewrite for good reason can be done, but not with 100&#x27;s of engineers and major features changes, all done in a massive hurry; that&#x27;s a recipe for disaster.')
