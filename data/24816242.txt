I do it all the time in an organisation with 10,000 employees. I obviously agree with the parent poster in that you should only do such things with users that have only the right amount of access, but that’s what having many users and schemas are for. I don’t, however, see why you’d ever need to complicate your stack beyond a simple python&#x2F;powershell script, a correct SQL setup, an official sql driver and maybe a few stores procedures.<p>I build and maintain our entire employee database with a python script, from a weird non-standard XML”like” daily dump from our payment system, and a few web-services that hold employee data in other requires systems. Our IT then builds&#x2F;maintains our AD from a few powershell scripts, and finally we have a range of “micro services” that are really just independent scripts that send user data changes to the 500 systems that depend on our central record.<p>Sure, sure, we’re moving it to azure services for better monitoring, but basically it’s a few hundred lines of scripting that, combined with AD and ADDS, does more than a 1 million USD a year license IDM.')
