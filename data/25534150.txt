Item(by='Brian_K_White', descendants=None, kids=[25534171], score=None, time=1608869912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25533556, text='I sometimes do something essentially the same as your former friend because I think the person with the problem probably wants to be treated like a normal person to feel as normal as possible instead of as a charity pity case. And to take their mind off of their completely obvious problems of the moment. IE, &quot;I know my leg is cut off, we don&#x27;t need to go over it and over it ...&quot; I figure everyone in the world is smothering them with that so I will not do that.<p>However, I know that is a gamble and had I judged that wrong, and someone said &quot;Hello can it be about me today instead of about you? just today? My leg... is gone... I&#x27;m not over it.&quot; I would NOT be hanging up and never call again.<p>I might possibly if the way you said it didn&#x27;t clue me in why you were saying it. If I felt you really didn&#x27;t want to hear from me at a time like that, then I&#x27;d be gone. <i>gone</i>. I thought I would be there for someone when the chips were down and they apparently do not value that from me. What a dumbass I&#x27;ve been.<p>I started this comment with the intention to say essentially &quot;If you were worried at all that you did something wrong, don&#x27;t.&quot; because even if there had been that initial mis-reading of intentions, that doesn&#x27;t explain disappearing, so it&#x27;s squarely on them.<p>But right at the end there while actuallly writing this, I realized there is a responsibility for communication on everyone&#x27;s part. I realized there is a plausible sequence of events where I had good intentions and you had good intentions and I had reasonable reactions and you had reasonable reactions and still we both came away thinking the other person is not great.<p>So now I no longer know if I have a point. Well these worthless thoughts were free at least. :)')
