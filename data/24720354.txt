All it takes is one leaky seal or a small crack somewhere in the hundreds of miles of tube and the whole system stops working.<p>&gt; However,  a  low  pressure  (vs.  almost  no  pressure)  system  set  to a  level  wherestandard  commercial  pumps  could  easily  overcome  an  air  leak  and  the transport  pods  could  handle  variable  air  density  would  be  inherently  robust.<p>It does not use MagLev:<p>&gt; A viable technical solution is magnetic levitation; however the cost associated with material and construction is prohibitive.<p>There are still challenges, but because of the Hype any company doing anything related just calls their system &#x27;Hyperloop&#x27; as well.<p>&gt; It boggles the mind as to how investors are falling for this idea.\n&gt; But perhaps marketing and branding are where Musk&#x2F;Bronson&#x27;s talents lie when it comes to high-speed rail? Please tell me otherwise, as I would love to see better rail infrastructure in the US.<p>Musk has not asked a single investor for money for Hyperloop. He likely knows its currently not a great investment.<p>Bronson is a guy who jumps on anything related to Musk and makes a bad copy of it that gather lots of money and then doesn&#x27;t do much with it.')
