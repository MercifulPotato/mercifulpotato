Item(by='spacedcowboy', descendants=None, kids=[24747280], score=None, time=1602431316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743320, text='The author identifies 3 things - the chances of X happening, the consequences of X happening, and the long-term effects of X happening. Personally I don’t separate (2) and (3). If X involves you breaking your spine, then long term consequences are indicated, to my view...<p>But I’ve been saying for decades that “risk” is not the chances of something happening, which is how most people understand it. Risk is (the chance of something happening) x (the consequences of it happening).<p>Imagine a 2x4 beam, 24’ long, lying on the floor, and I tell you to walk along the top of it without touching the floor. If you do, I’ll give you a sherbet lemon.<p>Now imagine it’s a 2x4, 24’ long between two office buildings, the one you’re in is on fire and this is the only way out.<p>The chances of you falling off the beam are the same (within a margin of error, assuming a non-windy day, etc. etc), but the risk to your life is much much higher in the second case.<p>Risk encompasses consequence, and it always surprises me how few people understand that in meetings when I’m describing a new approach, or criticizing a new service conformation.')
