Also, we have some pending questions where we need your advice.<p>Recently, we released an asset store &#x2F; marketplace where creators and companies can list for sale their AR, MR, ML templates, models, source code and tutorials. Currently, this feature is in early beta, and now we present assets related to Spark AR and Lens Studio; more frameworks are coming soon...<p>Why did we release it?<p>We found out that some creators use PayPal, Gumroad and Etsy to sell and monetize their assets. However, creators from the CIS region, Georgia, Ukraine, Asia and some other countries are limited in payouts from these services. We partnered with one PG to organize direct payouts through SWIFT and SEPA.<p>Here some common questions where we need your feedback and advice:<p>1. What are your thoughts regarding our new asset store &#x2F; marketplace module? Can we compete with Gumroad, Etsy and other top platforms where currently creators sell their assets?<p>2. Do you have any ideas on how we can protect our creators&#x27; IP (intellectual properties)? Meaning, when some scammer buys assets on our website and then goes to another website and sells them there? This is currently the most common problem of creators who try to sell their templates, patches, etc.<p>3. The last question is about positioning. Currently, our community and marketplace about Augmented and Mixed Reality domains. But we also have lots of creators who specialize in Machine learning, Training models, Open CV, etc. Should we drop the message Augmented Reality or keep building a niche community?<p>Please let me know what you think. Thanks!<p>Best,\nDan')
