The weird swerve at the end is the payload.<p>The reason to do this is, if you&#x27;re knowingly maintaining a propaganda system that works towards some known purpose, and you want people to fall into it more readily. This doesn&#x27;t discount the validity of the initial concepts: local maxima are real, and our ability to thoroughly understand things is limited.<p>But we remain functional through pretending we can indeed understand things, and there&#x27;s usefulness in that. Generally, axioms are brought into question when specific details don&#x27;t line up with our theory.<p>In a vacuum, &#x27;abandon all theories!&#x27; is a fine position to have. In reality, &#x27;abandon all theories!&#x27; is a set-up for getting fed a pile of information that benefits somebody else, because you become a willingly useful idiot ready to be programmed by anyone.<p>Running into somebody like this, I find the initial &#x27;abandon all theories!&#x27; attitude to be refreshing. I even agree with some of it. If the NEXT THING he tells me is all about how Pepe&#x27;s face is on the Moon outlined in craters, I&#x27;ve learned to be extremely suspicious of what the guy is really selling. Because even if he is himself sincereâ€¦ there is somebody up the chain pursuing &#x27;Nigerian spam&#x27; techniques and finding out by this who&#x27;s credulous enough to be used for their own purposes.<p>And that&#x27;s what I get from the &#x27;going off the rails at the end&#x27;. The point of the article is to hook the truly credulous, and the writer may or may not be in on that.')
