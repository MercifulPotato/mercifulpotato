All the papers published about this have been unconvincing.<p>&gt; <i>They just don&#x27;t generate usable amounts of power.</i><p>All the papers I remember report an small excess of heat. The problem is that heat is very difficult to measure accurately (the different parts of the equipment have different temperatures, estimating the heat transported in convection is a mess, some chemical parts may react, ...)')
