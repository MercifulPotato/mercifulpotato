If they&#x27;re taken at their word, its among every PC laptop sold in the past year, period.<p>Frankly, given what we saw today, and the leaked A14x benchmarks a few days ago (which may be this M1 chip or a different, lower power chip for the upcoming iPad Pro, either way); there is almost no chance that the 16&quot; MBPs still being sold with Intel chips will be able to match the 13&quot;. They probably could have released a 16&quot; model today with the M1 and it would still be an upgrade. But, they&#x27;re probably holding back and waiting for a better graphics solution in an upcoming M1x-like chip.')
