Yet they all want for them and their goods to be able to use roads for free, roads that are built and maintained with taxes.<p>That&#x27;s actually ok: two incompatible goals just means you have to make a trade-off; welcome to engineering.<p>The problem is that none of them understand why they can&#x27;t have both. In their minds, there is no trade-off to make, because they want both, feel entitled to both, and having both should be possible.<p>No idea why they are not able to understand that both things are incompatible. If there is some option that allows both that I am missing, they didn&#x27;t manage to explain that.')
