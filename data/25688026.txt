With the advancements of battery technology by Tesla, would you say that Tesla&#x27;s battery business (which is mostly IP and research labs) is worth more than entire Panasonic&#x27;s business? I say that&#x27;s highly unlikely: building a good research lab and coming up with a good new battery design is worth a lot, but not tens of billions of dollars. Even if it was worth as much as entire Panasonic, it would still be &lt;5% of Tesla&#x27;s market cap. As such, I can&#x27;t see how Tesla&#x27;s battery business would explain its huge market cap.')
