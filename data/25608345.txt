I&#x27;m not fine with wandering around and seizing personal property that could conceivably be used to produce noise pollution.<p>Generally speaking, we should only allow the government to intervene in personal freedoms when there is a compelling interest, and we should expect that the interventions are tailored to be as minimal as possible. A compelling reason existing is no excuse to give the government <i>unlimited</i> powers, for fairly obvious reasons.<p>For corporations, this obviously means complying with a robust regulatory framework; if I own a company that sells wood burning stoves, then I have to comply with EPA regulations around how many grams per hour of soot it may emit when properly maintained. In exchange for having to keep up with the changing regulations, the government should provide reasonable timelines and clarity around what is expected.<p>As a private citizen, this means accepting some limitations on how we use our private property. As a citizen I can legally purchase a car, own a firearm, and consume alcohol, but if I decide to use all three at once I will probably lose my right to have all three, plus I&#x27;ll get locked in jail. Occasionally changing regulatory requirements will mean that certain pieces of equipment can&#x27;t be operated anymore; if you had a car that <i>had</i> to use leaded fuel (not a substitute), then it would effectively be illegal to operate it going forward. What is not fine is for the government to say &quot;your car needs leaded fuel, so we are going to seize it from you&quot;.<p>The government should not be in the business of seizing private property that <i>may</i> be used to violate the law, especially when it was purchased legally. We don&#x27;t do pre-crime in this country, owning something that <i>may</i> be used to violate the law is not a crime punishable by loss of private property. We also have constitutional protections against ex post facto laws; you cannot punish a citizen for what they purchased back when it was legal. If it&#x27;s necessary to put strict limits on pollution and fine users who exceed them, that is fine by me. I&#x27;d even be happy to pay a bit more in taxes to fund optional buybacks and incentives to help users buy newer and more efficient units. But proposing that the government go and seize private property that <i>may</i> be used to eventually break some new regulation is beyond the pale.')
