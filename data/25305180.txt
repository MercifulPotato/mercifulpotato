Item(by='RussianCow', descendants=None, kids=[25312419], score=None, time=1607103098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25299445, text='&gt; Adding a column is easy enough, but enforcing that it means something and every one of your prior calculations are now meaningless without taking it into account is difficult.<p>But again, I don&#x27;t see how this is any easier to solve in application code than it is at the DB level. I don&#x27;t know of any programming language or framework that allows you to encode rules such as &quot;this DB column <i>must</i> be used&quot;. And even if such a thing existed, it wouldn&#x27;t prevent you from making mistakes in using that column.<p>On the other hand, using stored procedures at least prevents errors in the other direction: referencing columns in a way that no longer makes sense (because the type was changed, it no longer exists, etc).')
