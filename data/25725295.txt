Likely not (there&#x27;s no verifiable evidence of it).<p>2) Managing keys is _really, really, really hard_. We have GPG, Age, Keybase, Keys.pub and a slew of other platforms and projects to help us do this and we still cannot get it right; a $15 eBook to teach you &quot;The proper and safe way to hold cryptocurrency&quot; is not going to solve that. Read up on the slew of free and audited information about cold storage and hardware wallets.<p>3) &quot;How to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&quot;. Financial advice like this is a bit of a red flag. Again, free audited information available.<p>4) &quot;How to stake your cryptocurrency for passive, residual income&quot;. This is again financial advice (you have to buy something to stake) and even if my yield of units of X goes up that doesn&#x27;t necessitate the price of that yield going up.<p>This is a quick-fast attempt to get some free money from an unverified source, on a platform to easily churn-out sales (not necessarily a bad thing but an indication of low effort) to people who will fall for it.')
