Item(by='coryfklein', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602691793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774536, text='I&#x27;ve been a homeowner for nearly a decade now and I have to say I sympathize with you, even if for slightly different reasons, mainly the &quot;hassle&quot; factor. I see most of these &quot;smart&quot; things as just one more thing that can break.<p>Sure it may take a bit longer for me to initially run some wire for speakers (or cost more on a new home build), but once it&#x27;s set up it is one-and-done. My stereo receivers are a little bulky, but they hide in a corner and the last forever and I don&#x27;t need to debug their internet connection when I change my Wi-Fi password.<p>In engineering we talk about building solutions that are as simple as possible, and no simpler. Light switches and door locks are the epitome of this; adding batteries and wireless communication yields a &quot;wow&quot; factor at first, but I cringe at the idea of the numerous ways these can all fail now! I have enough to deal with just keeping up with maintenance on the simple stuff. I&#x27;ll keep my nightly routine of manually turning off lights and locking doors, thank you.<p>Not to mention the fact that all of this is changing so fast. Are my HomeKit compatible devices even going to work with whatever phone&#x2F;speaker&#x2F;tv setup I have 10 years from now? Am I going to have to pull out all my light switches then? You know what&#x27;s compatible with the human finger I expect to see at the end of my hand in 10 years? A normal freaking light switch.<p>I expect that by the time my kids are grown up everything will have settled on a common standard and &quot;smart&quot; devices will be a boring commodity product made by boring brands like GE on my boring Home Depot shelf. At that point I&#x27;ll probably consider putting it in the wall. Right now I see 50 different one-off Chinese brands racing to the bottom competing with $100 top-of-the-line latest-and-greatest Apple techs and it&#x27;s all just not worth the effort.')
