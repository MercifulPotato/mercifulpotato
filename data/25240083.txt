Im not sure what the author is trying to accomplish here. Also I guess these kind of bugs, although not nice, they are mostly because MacOS suffered the biggest change since its history and supporting 2 completely different architectures is not an easy job. Of course we are at the mercy of Apple to fix them but this is part of the deal when you buy such a machine at this point.<p>Then all other points are just showing all the known the same issues that some commercial SW was not yet ported to a new architecture.')
