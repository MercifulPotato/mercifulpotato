I&#x27;ve been meaning to spend some time on that - bundling Python applications is tricky but it should be possible using BeeWare or PyInstaller.<p>The best way to install it at the moment is &quot;brew install datasette&quot; - but that only works if you&#x27;re on a Mac. I really need to get on top of the Windows installation process too.')
