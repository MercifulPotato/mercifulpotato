Just going from a dictionary definition:<p>&gt; censorship: the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.<p>Nothing here says it&#x27;s only censorship if done by the government. Legally in the USA there&#x27;s a stark distinction between government &amp; non-governmental censorship. Even then sometimes private entities fall under restrictions like in the case of the FCC &amp; public broadcast networks (see Janet Jackson nip slip, the inability to curse during certain TV&#x2F;radio programs at certain times, etc). Now whether all of this desirable or not is politically debatable &amp; one we should have. That being said under the current legal structure Twitter is probably in the clear.<p>I&#x27;m generally more curious how these kinds of actions by tech companies don&#x27;t violate section 230 though. In the early days of the WWW, that was the reason given for not moderating such speech - &quot;if we start moderating any speech then we&#x27;re not a safe harbor and we have to moderate all speech&quot;. Does this mean that these tech companies that are doing moderation expose themselves legally somehow? Or does it just mean that the previous arguments were done in bad faith? Or were there laws passed to refine section 230 in this regard?')
