If every page or section is a &quot;unique work of art&quot; then you may have poor UX&#x2F;design.<p>I can&#x27;t agree with this more. It is almost punishing in how it enforces consistency. You really have to try to move outside the consistent default it has set and if you find yourself having to do that, it should be setting off alarm bells.<p>I do think it has to be used with a component system though. It provides the context that people miss when you don&#x27;t have nominal class names anymore. It even encourages something close to styled components I find you have very small components that do one thing.')
