You only have to buy a computer every once in a while, though you&#x27;ll run into trouble the moment it gets too out of date or breaks. Poverty doesn&#x27;t allow you to replace such things.<p>Lots of hobbies require investment. I do art: more specifically, draw and paint, both of which require supplies. My mother sews, but that requires material and making a shirt is more expensive than buying it unless you get material, thread, and things for free. Spouse makes music: Some guitars eat strings and synths take space and electricity (not to mention the cost: Used synths are still expensive).')
