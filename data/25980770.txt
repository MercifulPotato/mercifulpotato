There is no equivalent of the Boston&#x2F;NYC&#x2F;DC megalopolis, Greater Los Angeles, or even the Bay Area in Sweden. Frankly, there isn&#x27;t an equivalent of most of central Europe.

To be doing better than the US is no comparison at all.<p>If you compare it to other Nordic countries (which are more comparable in terms of population density), it&#x27;s doing much worse: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;1113834&#x2F;cumulative-coronavirus-deaths-in-the-nordics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;1113834&#x2F;cumulative-coron...</a><p>Anyway, isn&#x27;t this all my point? Sweden gets an excuse because other countries aren&#x27;t doing well. Nobody is expecting <i>anyone</i> to do well. Why bother trying to save lives if nobody else is trying either? Why bother trying to do as well as Vietnam (which literally shares a land border with China!) if nobody is going to hold you to that standard?')
