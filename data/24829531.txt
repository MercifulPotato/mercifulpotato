This includes working from home with flexible hours.<p>I blog and I run a bunch of Reddits in part to try to spread the word about how to do this well and in part in hopes of developing an adequate income for myself. I have about six years of college. I can write. I know a bunch of useful stuff. But I can&#x27;t work a &quot;regular&quot; job and punch a clock and yadda.<p>I learned a lot about how the so-called &quot;immune system&quot; works and I take a diet- and lifestyle-based approach to dealing my condition as a superior approach to a primarily drugs- and surgeries-based approach.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-drug. I&#x27;m pro-health.<p>People routinely think that my focus on doing what is more effective means I&#x27;m some high-handed, judgy anti-drug person in the extreme and this is absolutely not true. It is the opposite of true.<p>I was thrilled to pieces to finally get good drugs when I finally got a proper diagnosis after a lifetime of being dismissed as some kind of hypochondriac. But eating right for my condition and living &quot;defensively&quot; to protect my health made drugs less and less necessary and my quality of life is just better this way than it was when I was on scads of drugs.')
