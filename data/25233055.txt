The problem with x86 is not complexity but variable instruction lengths. This makes it hard to determine instruction boundaries, complicating decoders and making more than 4-way decode hard. M1 has 8 decoders for comparison, and it would be easy to have 100 with ARM if there were a benefit to that many.')
