Even if it doesn&#x27;t effect you now all you need to do is look at historical examples from other nations going down the same path. There&#x27;s a reason the poem &quot;First they came\n...&quot; exists and it&#x27;s a direct counter point to the argument you&#x27;re making.<p>Otherwise I don&#x27;t know what you want here, historically the masses mostly don&#x27;t do anything until they start starving. Most large acts of rebellion were put together by a small band of agitators often high ranking members of the establishment who for whatever reason decide they&#x27;ve had enough then publicize and promote it and then often pay the common folk to fight. The US for instance was majority founded by a bunch of rich people who were tired of the type of taxes levied on them. The continental army for instance was paid to fight. My point being is any action is going to be taken by people who care about the abstract notions, the rank and file will be paid to care or provided some equal material value.')
