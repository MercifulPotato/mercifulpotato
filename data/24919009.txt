Additionally, the company was also reported to be under investigation for &quot;allegations of abusive market dominance and unlawful tender procedures, resulting in excessive visa application prices and hidden fees.<p>Fun problems included getting bank account information, a whole host of personal information, and &#x27;strong ties&#x27; to my home country. I&#x27;m a student, &#x2F;of course&#x2F; I&#x27;m poor! I&#x27;m a student, &#x2F;of course&#x2F; I&#x27;m unmarried! &#x2F;of course&#x2F; I can&#x27;t visit the application center thrice, I have classes and exams! I had to pay extra to get my visa application &quot;fast-tracked&quot; so it would arrive on time! To date, I can&#x27;t shake the belief that I&#x27;ve experienced &quot;kafkaesque&quot; in flesh and blood.<p>The silver lining was, as always, people. I had super super supportive advisors&#x2F;HR folks at companies and universities I went to work at who helped me every step of the way. It was insane how much paperwork there was, and how they dealt with all of the paperwork deftly.')
