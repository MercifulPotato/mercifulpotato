Your friends are usually willing to make some amount of effort to talk and hang out with you, depending on how close friends you are, but there are limits to that. Nobody wants to get together with someone who insists on doing everything their way every time. Most people don&#x27;t care to spend what social capital they have getting their friends to use a different messaging app. You&#x27;re only burning even more social capital if you try to lecture them about things they don&#x27;t care about, such as Facebook having their personal information.<p>Particularly, this social capital is at its minimum when you&#x27;re trying to develop new friendships. Good luck starting any when you refuse to use the app that everyone else in the area uses to communicate.')
