However, I have recently been watching F1 with my father-in-law who is a huge F1 fan due to his own car and racing experience.<p>At first, it is just cars trying to be faster than the other which can be quite boring for 305km. But, when my father-in-law starts talking about the different strategies and choices being made, it puts a lot more color to what is happening. For instance, which tires to use (they have different types), when to do pit stops, how hard to push during different segments of the race, when to overtake, etc. Also, throw in some driver&#x2F;team drama in the mix and you have some interesting meta game going on.<p>Similarly in basketball, it is just a bunch of people running up and down the court trying to get the ball in the hoop more than the other team. Kind of boring. However, the strategies, plays and player personalities&#x2F;drama that get you to the end result make it more interesting. When to full court press, when should a foul be made, when to rotate players, etc.<p>It gets much more interesting once the rules&#x2F;strategies are clear. In F1, I think it takes a little longer to get to that point because sometimes the action can be spread out over a longer period. It is interesting to see what choices are being made in different situations.')
