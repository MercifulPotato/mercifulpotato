I think these things do keep you motivated. I am not ready to use lisp! But I do like to have a side project going at work. Often I merely get to think about the side project an maybe do a tiny bit of research, but it&#x27;s motivating. It usually of the form &quot;what would disrupt our app&quot; or &quot;why don&#x27;t we just X&quot;. By side project I mean for work, not me competing!')
