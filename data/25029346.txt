Actually End-to-end encryption isn&#x27;t that different.<p>It so happens that there&#x27;s no point in taking out a warrant against the man-in-the-middle, because he has no access to begin with.<p>You&#x27;ll have to get a warrant against one of the ends.<p>What these proposals would end up doing is to force people to weaken protocols and start spying as a man-in-the-middle, just so that they can be targeted by a warrant.<p>This is just a little bit silly, I feel; and doesn&#x27;t really help anyone. I don&#x27;t think that authorities realize that that is what they&#x27;re asking for. Usually when it gets explained to them, sooner or later they relent. And then a few years later someone replaces them, and it happens all over again.')
