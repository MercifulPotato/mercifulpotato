The whole point is to take away your will to organize (or at least place it somewhere) and set a queue of tasks to work on in front of you. You can then spend your entire focus on the task in front of you, then when you&#x27;re done go to the next task.<p>From time to time (at the end of every week) you can re-organize your task lisk, but most of the time focus on one task at a time.')
