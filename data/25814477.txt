Item(by='danans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610914467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809870, text='&gt; may actually be an early hominid that had ape-like features, that lived in parallel with humans in different territory.<p>Perhaps, but it&#x27;s impossible to prove one way or another.  More plausibly, they observed that primates possess a type of intelligence of a kind similar to humans, and therefore were readily adaptable to that role in the story.<p>What we do know is that fantastical characters with human level sentience in the Ramayana exist primarily to engage the audience and to drive forward the epic&#x27;s central themes of good vs evil.  Fantastical creatures are a pattern of this sort of storytelling across the world.  Modern storytellers have used the same technique to great effect, like the various species of JRR Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth or George Lucas&#x27;s Galaxy Far Far Away.<p>In this way, there is a striking contrast between the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.  The Mahabharata, despite emerging from the same cultural milieu as the Ramayana, is a complex human sociological drama without clear lines of good and evil.  It makes  little use of fantastical species, as their presence would detract from the story&#x27;s fundamentally human themes.  The only non human characters of consequence are gods, but even they are far from perfect and instead exhibit the same flaws as the humans.')
