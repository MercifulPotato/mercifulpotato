Apple iPhone needs to be an open platform. Users can install apps from wherever and don&#x27;t have to go through Apple distribution. (But Apple can still provide this for convenience and discovery, and still charge a fee.)<p>2. Installing apps includes a strong permissions API. The filesystem, sensor access, GPS, etc. can be cordoned off and requires user intervention. Heuristics and isolation can prevent apps from sharing data for tracking&#x2F;identification.<p>The reality is that Apple outgrew their platform and it can&#x27;t continue to exist as a walled garden without being a monopoly. They can&#x27;t have their cake and eat it too. Otherwise Facebook has a case. Epic has a case. Etc.')
