As an admin, you&#x27;re unable to see any passwords in an employee&#x27;s &quot;Personal&quot; vault. This is by design, so that user-specific passwords aren&#x27;t visible to _anyone_ in the org except for that user.<p>However, this has a few downsides. All of those features I mentioned (alerts for re-used, leaked, weak, or old passwords) are visible to the owner of the private vault, but admins won&#x27;t be aware of those issues. It requires trust and security training to make sure that those issues are handled appropriately for private passwords.<p>Also, if someone has edit access for a vault, there&#x27;s no way to prevent them from moving credentials to their personal vault or exporting credentials. Most people won&#x27;t know how to do that and won&#x27;t bother... but it&#x27;s always a risk.')
