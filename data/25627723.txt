They are both techniques for managing data in distributed systems, and they both involve hashing identifiers, but that&#x27;s pretty much where the similarities stop.<p>Kademlia is a protocol for <i>locating</i> individual key-value pairs in a big, loosely-connected network of independent nodes. The assumption is that you have very little control over which nodes are interested in storing what data, or how they&#x27;re connected, or whether some of them are malicious. The idea is to make it so that if the information you&#x27;re looking for is somewhere in the network, you have a high probability of being able to track it down using a reasonably small number of hops -- but there are few hard guarantees.<p>CRUSH, on the other hand, is a system for <i>controlling</i> the placement of data objects. The idea is that rather than defining a way to ask other nodes for the location of the data you want, you simply consult a policy that deterministically maps the object&#x27;s name to its storage location. Since all of the nodes are part of the same cluster, they all agree to obey the policy. The policy format -- the &quot;CRUSH mapping&quot; -- is designed to be reasonably flexible (allowing things like placing specific numbers of replicas in different datacenters), fast to evaluate, and efficient in terms of how much data needs to be moved when the policy changes (e.g. when the cluster is expanded and new nodes are added to the list).')
