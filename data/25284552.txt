Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606962536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284147, text='&gt; &quot;The West wrecked the environment and everything else in the process of industrialization, so we [Chinese] are entitled to do it too,&quot; is a truly disturbing line and this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve actually heard before.<p>Because it&#x27;s not terrifying. China has lifted 800 million people out of poverty. What&#x27;s terrifying is nations like India and continents like Africa haven&#x27;t followed and developed. Instead there are nearly 1 billion indians and africans without electricity, plumbing, etc.<p>&gt; Aren&#x27;t people supposed to do better knowing how much people in the past screwed up?<p>Well, china didn&#x27;t invade australia, canada, US, etc and wipe out the people and steal their land and destroy other people&#x27;s environment to enrich themselves. So maybe they learned something. The hypocritical hubris is not going to do us any good. Over the long term, it&#x27;s gonna be our undoing.<p>Or maybe, there is no other option. In order to make an omelette you gotta break some eggs. And in order to develop, you have to suffer through some environmental degradation.<p>Not only are the chinese entitled to it, so are the indians, africans, middle easterners, etc. Are they all supposed to languish in poverty while they wait for some magic development process to appear.<p>While a privileged virtue signaler can comfortable whine about the environment, the millions of people living in poverty don&#x27;t have the luxury.')
