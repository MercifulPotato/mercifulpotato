Normal people like pretty things, and people like creating pretty things. Designers wanted to creat a pretty webapge, and I found said webpage pretty. Not to mention that the website loads pretty quickly, so all those complaints about performance are incredibly hollow. If someone is working with 2g internet they have bigger issues than trying to visit Github&#x27;s homepage.')
