The lobbying of the news industry it truly terrible and has made me question if I want to pay for any news media when the national news service is perfectly fine and accessible for free. I want to support independent journalism, but I don&#x27;t want to sponsor the moneymaking schemes they&#x27;re inserting into the law.')
