[edit: wait no, wrong link: it was THIS other huge thread from Dillon[3] that included low power musings, but still no explicit undervolting, just setting the thermal limit lower].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinlekiller&#x2F;amdctl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevinlekiller&#x2F;amdctl</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20795054" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20795054</a><p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;apollo.backplane.com&#x2F;DFlyMisc&#x2F;threadripper.txt" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;apollo.backplane.com&#x2F;DFlyMisc&#x2F;threadripper.txt</a>')
