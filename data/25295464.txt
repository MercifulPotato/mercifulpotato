I expect the economics of streaming favor freshness rather than milking a cash cow through a decline when it&#x27;s got little chance of bringing in fresh viewers.<p>it&#x27;s an interesting reversal of the trend. back in the &#x27;00s, it seemed like even the best tv shows had a pretty scrappy first season: obviously low budget, little chemistry in the talent. if a show managed to get enough viewers in the first season, it would get a larger budget and hit its stride in the second one. nowadays it seems to be the opposite; most shows seem to give it all they have in a strong first season, then start phoning it in for the next couple, then getting culled without remorse when the viewership drops. I&#x27;m curious whether there&#x27;s an economic reason for this, or if it&#x27;s all in my head.')
