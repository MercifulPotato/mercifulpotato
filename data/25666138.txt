Item(by='bzbarsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609983680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25665814, text='It&#x27;s a little weird, now that I looked into this more deeply, because while that&#x27;s what the referendum question said on the ballot, the law that put it there is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senado.pr.gov&#x2F;Legislations&#x2F;ps1467-20.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;senado.pr.gov&#x2F;Legislations&#x2F;ps1467-20.pdf</a> and defines the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answers to have the following meanings, respectively (page 31, lines 6-15, translation from Spanish mine):<p>- Yes: I demand that the Federal Government immediately recognize the equality of my rights and responsibilities as an American citizen with statehood in permanent union with all the states of the Union.<p>- No: I reject permanent union with statehood and demand that the Federal Government immediately recognize the sovereignty of Puerto Rico separate from the United States of America with a &quot;Treaty of Independence in Free Association&quot; or with &quot;Total Independence&quot;.<p>Notably, that excludes the status quo as an option.  The part right after that says:<p><pre><code>  In case the statehood &quot;No&quot; ends up as the majority choice, you must\n  immediately start a process of transition to recognize the sovereignty\n  of Puerto Rico separate from the United States of America with a\n  &quot;Treaty of Independence in Free Association&quot; or with &quot;Total\n  Independence&quot;, following the description in this law.\n</code></pre>\nWhat I don&#x27;t know is to what extent people actually attached those meanings to the choices and hence whether it affected the vote at all, but defining the &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; answers to that question to have those specific meanings is a bit underhanded and quite unfortunate.')
