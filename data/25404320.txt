A company whose sole purpose is questions and answers, but whose website doesn&#x27;t even have a print stylesheet.<p>The semantic web was much more than bots. It meant transformability and adaptiveness of information. Braille displays are just as important as print, web, screen and other targets.<p>Sadly modern day web browsers have such less support for it that they even dropped the media device targets from the CSS spec, which I think is morally wrong.<p>Did you know that screenreaders, palm PDAs and others all had support for it...and that publishing to a new platform was as easy as linking a new stylesheet? None of that HTML5 crap was necessary. No modernizr, no JS, no pixelperfect designs necessary. It just worked. XHTML 1.1 strict ran everywhere. And by everywhere, I mean even the mobile audiobook players that used the DAISY format. Fully automatically transformed, and voiced over content.<p>Imagine a web where you could train your personal assistant without any machine learning, and where information is automatically connected, researched, gathered and related.<p>That kind of internet is the necessary step for our species to reach a superintelligence level.<p>Without it, humans will stay as dumb as the internet is right now. Full of misinformation, deceit, and financial players &quot;shaping&quot; public opinion and manipulating the truth.')
