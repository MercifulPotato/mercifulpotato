It unfortunately never made click despite my love for any kind of terminal app and also competition in this space. Just emacs lisp would be <i>the</i> reason to switch from vimscript but again I just couldn&#x27;t get warm with emacs.<p>Also I think that the paradigm of modal editing is key to editing, not because I am used it, it just makes sense to have the myriad of functions of an editor easily reachable without too many modifiers. Coding isn&#x27;t about just writing code but a lot about thinking, editing, staring at code, thinking, editing, jumping, f, &#x2F;, yy&#x27;s, dd&#x27;s, ct, etc. I use modifiers heavily, way more than the typical ctrl&#x2F;alt, but again to have an extra dedicated mode is crucial, so I can&#x27;t imagine how any non-modal editor, eg emacs, can excel re UX like vim or nvim do. There must be reason that even the emacs community itself promotes spacemacs, which follows that paradigm, so much. But for some spacemacs is a layer too much adding unnecessary complexity. Besides, vim is also so popular because it&#x27;s fast, load time, editing, anything.<p>Whatever, put me into any text field without modal binds and I am pretty much handicapped but maybe I might just missed emacs&#x27; hidden qualities. Trying emacs feels going one step back (when coming from modal editing).<p>Edit: Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this shouldn&#x27;t qualify as offense but every time I read some random emacs praise on the net, I never know if I should give emacs another try or if it&#x27;s just a vocal minority who never experienced proper modal editing and I just should move on.')
