Just start a legitimate company, gain customers and then use that as a basis to gather what you need.   The employees wouldn&#x27;t know this they&#x27;d think they are working for a legitimate company. The bad actors who set it  up would just have access to whatever they needed to do what they needed to do. This would take years of work to pull off but could be done.')
