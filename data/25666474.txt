But there&#x27;s real commercial work trying to scale it up to bigger workloads too. I think these products are pretty early stage.<p>I think Google is reluctant to push for Android support for a RISC-V applications processor.  The nature of the different ISA extensions would mean that they would need to bet on the set of extensions that should be embraced (or a bunch of work to do some &#x27;fat&#x27; binaries - or maybe &#x27;obese&#x27; if there&#x27;s a lot of supported combos).<p>Regardless of Android&#x27;s fate, yes, you can buy a RISC-V board that will boot linux.  That&#x27;s a pretty good bellwether for &#x27;real applications&#x27;.  But the performance likely pales in comparison with modern ARM or x86_64 alternatives.<p>EDIT: see SiFive&#x27;s &quot;HiFive Unmatched&quot; [1] for an example - DDR4, gigabit ethernet, 8 lanes of PCIe g3.  It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if that&#x27;s one of the best performing generally available RISC-V systems.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdsupply.com&#x2F;sifive&#x2F;hifive-unmatched" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdsupply.com&#x2F;sifive&#x2F;hifive-unmatched</a>')
