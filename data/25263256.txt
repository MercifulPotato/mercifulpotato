And, of course, they&#x27;ve been in contact with Apple to work this out, as they mention at the end. What has clearly happened is Apple asked them what the EULA should look like, or suggested a EULA based on what MacStadium is doing, and they went along with it. There is no way they didn&#x27;t know that this would hurt everyone else&#x27;s business (actually, he mentions this in the article, so he is writing this with full knowledge of that fact).<p>Even if MacStadium was not involved in this at all, making a blog post about a change that hurts your competitors and gloating about how you are somehow better than them and deserve to exist is remarkably poor taste.')
