I&#x27;m certainly not convinced. As you point out, Singapore has already abused the system. If some abuse is technically possible, it&#x27;s probably already happening.<p>But there&#x27;s a lot of room outside of &quot;do nothing&quot; and &quot;omnipresent perfect surveillance&quot; to do good things with civic technology, including non-pandemic stuff. Why aren&#x27;t all public records online and searchable through a single engine? Or all forms editable and submittable? Or budgets and financial reports navigable or comparable? I&#x27;d love to be able to know how some random municipality is going to gouge me before I move there.<p>There&#x27;s loads of room for good solutions for these and tons of other pain points. But as far as I can tell, American government is scared of letting go so the private sector can develop these things. And it&#x27;s not imaginative or technically competent enough to want or develop this kind of stuff on its own. Or maybe it&#x27;s not organized or unified enough?')
