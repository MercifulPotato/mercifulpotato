(Ie when multiple steps &#x2F; detailed interaction is needed).  With phone calls, I specifically don’t like how I have to immediately stop what I’m working on and focus my attention upon answering the call, as opposed to a text message where almost nothing is lost if I wait 60 seconds before looking at it.<p>I’m still surprised that many find this offensive when I make this request of them; or when they disregard my request and I’m forced to ignore their calls until they text.<p>I have one client who would called me anywhere from 1 to 10+ times a day with small tasks I needed to do , which were much more efficiently communicated over text. (Things such as “check access point of unit 302 of the Westside building , user can’t connect”).  The phone calls would never be less than five minutes in length, each, and of mostly small talk and other irrelevant info to the original purpose of the call.  I strongly considered stopping work for this client, but for the fact that I so much enjoyed the work he brought me.  This work was all remote&#x2F;from behind my computer (not onsite work).')
