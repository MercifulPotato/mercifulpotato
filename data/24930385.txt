We should just operate on intuitive feelings of what is or isn&#x27;t acceptable all the time.&quot;<p>Why NOT formalize rules to some extent? Having a hidden set of implicit mores is far worse. In fact, you can easily read this post as a <i>pro-COC argument.</i><p>After all, the author is able to make a really strong case that he didn&#x27;t really infringe on any part of the COC, and that the COC was poorly constructed to begin with. With no COC, he&#x27;d have to just be saying &quot;I think Numfocus exercised bad judgement,&quot; which is a much harder argument to make since it&#x27;s so subjective.<p>We&#x27;re professionals. Rules shouldn&#x27;t be implicit in professional environments. Explicit rules are easier to use, and they make it easier to hold the authorities accountable for misusing them.')
