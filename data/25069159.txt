Some of the things that have happened are reducing allocations aggressively, which  _can_ a quick change by using newer language features where applicable, but a lot also have been things like vectorizing algorithms or adding additional optimizations either in the JIT or in other code that&#x27;s generated (regular expressions). Those are rarely trivial.<p>It&#x27;s more like there&#x27;s been a few hundred small individual improvements and those provide a lot of improvement in total.')
