The phrase that came more naturally to me was &quot;give me directions to X&quot;, but that only gets you to the screen with the route and you still have to manually press the &quot;start&quot; button with your finger. And then it would randomly pick other modes of transport unless I remember to say &quot;by car&quot;. Systems that are inherently unrecoverable like voice commands need actual documentation.')
