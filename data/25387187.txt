Absolutely.<p>If you remove moderation rules, there won&#x27;t be blocking. However we fall in the other extreme with fake news and obsceneties taking over. The loudest and most provocative win because that&#x27;s what makes the news. At least that&#x27;s the logic.<p>Is the root of the problem that no one elected Facebook to be moderators? And now that it is so big, it has become a problem because it has an overbearing affect on people?<p>So essentially the monopolistic argument is a justification for government to grab back control.<p>I can&#x27;t help to see this as a growing pain for global companies becoming bigger than countries. FB has 2.9 billion users. Only 10% are in the US. It has such\na reach beyond borders that countries are freaking out, afraid to lose sovereignty over their citizens.<p>Or am I reading too deep here?')
