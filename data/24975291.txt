As a result, producing an old growth forest is not the correct metric (if you are optimizing purely for climate).<p>A stable forest (from purely a climate perspective) is also not the right optimization. Ideally, you&#x27;d lock away the carbon outside of the biosphere, instead of letting it get recycled.')
