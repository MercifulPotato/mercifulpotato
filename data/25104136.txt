There is one main rule.<p>When building such systems one thing must be done always. It must work when there is no smart component to that system.<p>For example, if your smart home stops working or startes to glitch, it should still be possible to go to a switch and turn that light on.<p>This can be easily done when building a house or doing renovations. Retrofitting, however, very much depends on way your switches, lights and other related things are wired and installed.')
