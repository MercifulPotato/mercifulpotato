And to troubleshoot it you basically had to know about kubernetes already.<p>So it made a lot of sense to start at the official docs. And while I&#x27;m reading the docs, why not build the cluster at the same time. And while I&#x27;m building the cluster, why not write each step down in Ansible so I won&#x27;t have to repeat myself.<p>So end result is my own ansible setup that I&#x27;m happy with and I know inside and out.<p>It always bothered me to run other people&#x27;s ansible playbooks.
