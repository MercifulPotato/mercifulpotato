Everything you just described is. <i>only</i> good if your end goal is to be an immortal, indispensable fixture of the economy, and I&#x27;d even go so far as to say the practices you endorse as strategically sound are (or should be) explicitly considered examples of strategies which are anti-competitive, anti-consumer, and should entail strict liability with a punitive consequence for the company involved if they utilize those practices for the reasons you state as a cost for and any tragedy results from the opaque nature of their dealings with the public.  Nothing short of undesirable results and wasted effort is inflicted on the rest of society; which at the end of the day is mired in the quest to efficiently allocate resources, and further the State of the Art and the frontiers of human knowledge.<p>You&#x27;ll get the same exact things you counted as benefits for doing things badly simply by being proactive in communication with clients. and reaping the fruits of consumer and investor goodwill. You&#x27;ll discover new edge cases and directions for truly novel developments when your customer tries to use your thing and, darn it, I need something just like it but with X. Hardware can be far better characterized, and the ability of the public to identify &quot;the right tool for the right job&quot; greatly increased. With more goodwill comes greater leniency, more willingness to allocate capital for novel problems, and a much more accommodating environment when it comes to risk.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between being a long living parasite, and becoming a household name. A vampire may live forever, but eventually somebody is getting a Stake and some garlic. Start acting like you&#x27;ve got something to hide, and people will go out of their way to do away with you. Free everybody from being helpless to help themselves though? That gets songs, monuments, and a chapter in the history books about how awesome and pivotal you were.<p>Goddamnit, don&#x27;t you want to live forever?')
