It will fuel it when the ONLY voices they are now hearing are the most radical ones. Completely insane people like Lin Wood are now where these people will be getting their information.<p>I think the primary reason for banning these people is that no sane person wants to see unhinged tweets in their feed on a daily basis. And they don&#x27;t want these people commenting on their tweets either. Those that are banned should move on and learn from this experience.<p>&gt; I wish people would slow down, step back for a moment and try to choose the paths that will result in deescalation. Not further radicalization. It&#x27;s extremely frightening and depressing to watch this happen.<p>There are plenty of domestic terrorists that never used Twitter. The perceived grievance always runs much deeper than a medium of communication.')
