Do you have any handy links for that term?<p>Wiki &amp; the NHM re-define “space junk” as “space debris”. Google does this too but is just relying on these sources.<p>The wikipedia for space debris includes material that falls back to earth. It even lists some notable incidents. Wikipedia doesn’t appear to recognise the term “re-entry pollution”.<p>The FAA deals with debris here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecfr.gov&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;text-idx?SID=685669905c05d232fc85ebb36583d4d5&amp;node=47:1.0.1.1.6.2.233.9&amp;rgn=div8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecfr.gov&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;text-idx?SID=685669905c05d232fc...</a> - it treats orbital and re-entry debris under the same provisions and doesn’t seek to further distinguish them.<p>&gt;&gt; clearly does not understand the subject matter at all<p>What sentences in the article lead you to this conclusion?')
