A huge problem right now is the massive tech companies want an unreasonable view into your life.  They want your identity, phone number, photo id, location history, credit history, etc. before they&#x27;ll treat you like a real person.<p>If you think I&#x27;m joking, spin up a transient environment, connect to a VPN, and try to participate online without linking all of your accounts to a piece of real world identity information that, in turn, can be linked to all the other things I listed above.  You can&#x27;t even get an email address without a phone number.<p>Part of the issue there is the huge tech companies are abusing their market positions to assign bad reputation to the IP blocks owned by everyone else.  You can&#x27;t use a VPS for ANYTHING but incoming connections because the IPs are flagged all by Google et al.  How do you run an API server that needs to make any outbound connections if Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. all consider the IP block tainted?  I guess you just need to buy your IPs from Google, right?<p>That&#x27;s exactly the same tactic Google used with GMail.  The original spam filtering was super aggressive and shitty and the solution, according to Google, was to use GMail instead of other providers.  &quot;Get a big provider&quot; is a very poor answer to a question that has a technical solution IMO.<p>&gt; My mailserver is marked as spam by gmail<p>Have you tried GSuite (or whatever they&#x27;re calling it these days)? &#x2F;s')
