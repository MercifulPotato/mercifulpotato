It&#x27;s solving a different problem</i><p>This is actually the misconception that leads to confusion with (and ultimately, poorly written) CSS.<p>It comes from a misunderstanding of what creating a web page actually is.<p>As Alan Kay once remarked, “A change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points.”<p>This is no less true with CSS.<p>Most developers view CSS an annoying &#x27;styling&#x27; language, that&#x27;s &#x27;not really a programming language&#x27;. Which separates it in your mind from the engineering frame of view that tends to excite you as a developer.<p>This makes CSS tedious to use.<p>In truth, HTML and CSS are parts of a holistic language of layout construction. They work in unison, not as individual components. Very much an engineering toolset. Just that the problems to be solved are more visual in nature than you&#x27;re probably used to.<p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to &#x27;style&#x27; pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI&#x27;s) for your user.<p>You don&#x27;t &#x27;style&#x27; pages, you &#x27;construct&#x27; and &#x27;architect&#x27; them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect in changing your perception of what you&#x27;re doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.<p>I think that understanding this is one of the key differentiators between developers who are good with CSS and those that struggle.<p>Tools like TailwindCSS (that lead to a massive increase in both productivity with CSS as well layout maintanability) are based on this fundamental premise.<p>I expand on this more in a recent post called &quot;How To Get Better At CSS&quot;, which you can read here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planflow.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-get-better-at-css" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planflow.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-get-better-at-css</a><p>Sidenote: I&#x27;m also working on a book that aims to help you gain mastery over CSS, showing you how to truly understand it, by learning how to debug its most common issues as well as re-framing how you see it in the way I&#x27;ve described above.
