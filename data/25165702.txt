This is the result of the language having much tighter phonotactic constraints; literally there are fewer &quot;legal&quot; phonemes (and combinations of them) in Japanese than in most other languages. [1] This isn&#x27;t a criticism of the language of course - just an interesting tradeoff: A Japanese speaker has fewer sounds to learn, but must learn to speak them faster in order to convey their ideas.<p>As a result, Japanese speakers are some of the fastest speakers in terms of syllables&#x2F;second, out of necessity.<p>Therefore it&#x27;s no surprise that the typography is going to appear more &quot;densely packed&quot; on a Japanese website. With the exception of Kanji which is a pictographic (logographic? I&#x27;m not really a linguist) writing system consisting of many, many characters (and thus can be quite information-dense) - Japanese&#x27;s other writing systems are purely phonetic - each character representing a single syllable. Take a look at the front page of a Japanese newspaper and show it to an English speaker, they will think it&#x27;s &quot;crowded&quot;, but I bet if you translated it to English you&#x27;d see something that resembles a typical English paper.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phonotactics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phonotactics</a>')
