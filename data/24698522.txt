The higher the capacitance the lower the voltage.  A 1 farad capacitor could hold 1 coulomb of charge at 1 volt of potential difference.  A 0.1 farad capacitor could hold 0.1 coulomb of charge at 1 volt, or 1 coulomb of charge at 10 volts, or 0.01 coulombs of charge at 0.1 volts, or 100 coulombs of charge at 1000 volts.[0].  Because our capacitance is so low, you need a huge amount of voltage to force all of those electrons onto us.<p>[0] Assuming the capacitor didn&#x27;t fail -- in the case of actual capacitors, they only operate within certain parameters and tend to explode outside of them, in the case of people in an atmosphere, you&#x27;d probably see those discharges well before you managed to shove a full coulomb of charge onto one.')
