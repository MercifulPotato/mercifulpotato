Telling people (or demonstrating to them) they are being ridiculous is not his responsibility and is a tight rope to walk in his position.<p>Usually the way VFX works is that technology (R&amp;D) is very moved away from production. The artist job is getting the shot done regardless of technology and they have very short deadlines. They usually push the limits.<p>Digital artists are not very tech savvy in a lot of disciplines, it is not feasible to have a TD in the delivery deadlines of the shots for a show.<p>The person at Weta also told you how Weta actually worked in Kong which is <i>very</i> typical. You don&#x27;t know upfront what you need. And you dismissed it as something unnecessary, still, is how every big VFX studio works. Do you feel that you know better and&#x2F;or everyone is doing something wrong and hasn&#x27;t really thought about it? If that is the case you might have a business opportunity for a more efficient VFX studio!')
