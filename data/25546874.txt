Item(by='tgsovlerkhgsel', descendants=None, kids=[25547820], score=None, time=1609021104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25543861, text='&gt; potentially catastrophic consequences of the cabin pressure system failing at cruising altitude, I considered that everyone on the plane had been very lucky.<p>The cabin pressurization system failing at cruising altitude is one of the more common types of aircraft incidents. That&#x27;s why planes are equipped with systems to handle it. While a catastrophic outcome is not impossible, it is exceedingly unlikely.<p>As to the compensation issue, airlines should be required to pay out the compensation automatically, with 3x the compensation automatically due as a penalty if the customer has to make them pay through the courts. This would remove the incentive to make it hard for customers to claim the compensation.<p>Given that I by now unfortunately have a decent understanding of the compensation rules, if I have a claim that I&#x27;m confident about and the airline doesn&#x27;t pay immediately, I&#x27;ll take it straight to court. If in a jurisdiction where they have to pay the lawyer fees, I&#x27;ll have a regular lawyer handle it - no need to let an agency take 30% if you know you&#x27;ll win and a lawyer can make some money (driving up the costs of misbehavior for the airline).<p>For consumer lawsuits you can often sue the airline at <i>your</i> local court, which isn&#x27;t overloaded.')
