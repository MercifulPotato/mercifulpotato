I also found that the aim to be objective in everything and use metrics as truth and not just another input is pretty harmful over the long run in business and science. Things that are hard to measure are ignored most of the time.<p>The best example are apples. When you breed apples to be 3% larger each year but taste slightly worse, you can weigh them and see that they got slightly larger. As you cannot accurately measure taste you will notice that they basically taste the same. After years of breeding you have giant apples with bad taste.<p>The author&#x27;s proposition of using as many metrics as possible and talking to real people is a good solution to make better decisions.<p>I would add that for some decisions you should actually just focus on the few facts that truly matter. The classic example being a potential business partner with a bad reputation. If somebody is not trustworthy everything else probably doesn&#x27;t matter.')
