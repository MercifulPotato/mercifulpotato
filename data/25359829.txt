As we were the bigger country, we were usually seen as the &#x27;bad guys&#x27; though.<p>UK was in a lot of ways not a great fit for the EU sometimes but sometimes I do think it was good to have a larger player in the UK take a different position. I&#x27;m a big fan of the EU but they do seem to make mistakes, and completely ignore certain problems (like immigration).')
