But that&#x27;s about the only add-on I&#x27;ve ever needed.<p>It&#x27;s not a &quot;nice extension&quot;. It&#x27;s core functionality, which is a part of any basic introductory workflow.<p>And with mercurial instead of just being able to stash changes with a simple $ git stash , all of a sudden you need to bother with installations and setups and configs and checking if everything is it&#x27;s place.<p>Just. To. Stash. A. Change.<p>And if you find stashing nothing more than &quot;a nice extension&quot;, and nothing else pops into your mind, then you clearly have limited experience in using revision control systems.<p>&gt; And it takes less than 5 minutes to install.<p>Did you failed to notice that it forces you to waste time ensuring you&#x27;re bolting on all the stuff you need whenever you jump a seat or pop into an instance?<p>And did you failed to realize this problem is not experienced with pretty much any revision control system? Not just git, but pretty much all of them.')
