Twitter does not claim that the emails aren&#x27;t real. In short, the emails are real and everyone admits this... except the people who have fallen for social media giants&#x27; propaganda in this case.<p>Twitter claims that the justification is that the emails are &quot;hacked&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;leaked&quot; (they&#x27;re inconsistent), even though (1) this is patently false since they were found on a hard drive which became property of the repair shop; and (2) Twitter has no problem with, say, Trump&#x27;s tax returns and other &quot;hacked&quot;&#x2F;&quot;leaked&quot; materials.')
