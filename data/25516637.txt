You can set it up in various ways visually, even though the default look is usable out of the box.<p>Xfce&#x27;s window manager is the best of all I&#x27;ve tried. Maybe not as configurable as e.g. Sawmill, it has a lot of useful functions that are missing from Gnome-based offerings, and from macOS: window snapping, automatic window resizing to grab available space (in several ways), simple automatic tiling, easy putting a window above others, etc. They all can be configured to have arbitrary  shortcuts.<p>Xfce has fewer ambitions to integrate things and have their own everything. It allows you to just work with your apps without distraction.<p>Most importantly, Xfce is not trying to imitate macOS, but does its own thing, and stays consistent. It has very little magic in it.<p>Also, bugs are quite few and far between. They do not seem to rush to release new stuff.')
