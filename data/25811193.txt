And you can do robotic control systems to high-frequency trading systems with it with careful programming.<p>But I&#x27;ve seen a lot of Java code running in production suffering from latency jitters and needing continuous profiling and optimization by a small group of performance engineers while the majority of application engineers keep adding to GC load.<p>&gt; For this specific use-case, I don&#x27;t think there is really an alternative, except for specifically a hand-crafted system<p>Yes, but I think the handcrafted system doesn&#x27;t need to be very complex.
