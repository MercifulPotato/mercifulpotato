We rented a small farm cottage for a year and the power there was unreliable, the water supply ran out regularly, and the road flooded a couple of times a year. It really helped us develop core preparedness habits out of learned experience.<p>Even recently we had a power cut at our place and discovered storing our power-out gear in the garage wasn&#x27;t very useful with an electric main door and a blocked off side door. If it had been an extended outage I would have needed to break windows to get essential gear.<p>In my experience you&#x27;ll find more isolated communities take preparedness more seriously because they experience grid frailty regularly and so build backup options into their daily lives. The least prepared live in denser urban areas where issues are far less likely. Problem is that when they do occur, and on a long enough timescale it&#x27;s inevitable, general preparedness is low and so the shock and risk is greatly increased.')
