You&#x27;re taking the diffraction pattern, which is the fourier transform of the electron density.  Fourier transform results are complex-valued data.  Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t really have X-Ray lasers, so you can only get the intensities and not the phases of those diffraction spots.  Since mother science hates us, it of course the case that, in a fourier transform &quot;more information&quot; is contained in the phases than in the intensities.<p>So you &quot;make guesses at what the phases are&quot;, the best choice is to bootstrapping these phases measured with another technique (you can introduce crystal defects that do allow you to guess at what the phases are).<p>Less scrupulous is to use a computer generated model, like fitting another protein &quot;that you guess is related&quot;, then you model the electron density, take the phases of that.<p>In any case you take these &quot;phase&quot; guesses, and then apply it to your intensities, re-run the fourier transform, refine your electron densities, twiddle the location where you think the atoms, are, then repeat with your new model.  This process repeats until you converge on a structure that you&#x27;re happy with.<p>Now alarm bells should be screaming in your head right now:  Yes, it&#x27;s entirely possible to converge on a wrong structure, especially if you&#x27;re a young up-and-comer professor seeking tenure that has no ethical problems with &quot;suggesting&quot; their grad students to sleep in the lab and work 100 hour weeks and willing to do slipshod work to get you tenure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0022283607004275?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S002228360...</a>')
