(In the early days of the pandemic, I actually spent a good chunk of time trying to wrangle available PPE and get it into the hands of first responders. I had a big moral issue with the publishers who were profiteering by selling consumers things that they didn&#x27;t need at the expense of those who did.)<p>Didn&#x27;t consider a homepage link from the footer, but it&#x27;s a fair point.
