I&#x27;ve never seen them anywhere else.<p>I think the best way to make bikes safe from cars is to give them their own separate infrastructure. What I worry about is that the infrastructure will be taken from that available to pedestrians. Where I live (suburbs near Boston) there are already too many roads without sidewalks. I&#x27;ve already gotten into more arguments than I can count with cyclists who believe an explicitly multi-use path near where I live either should be or already is bike-only. Maybe if &quot;share the road&quot; cyclists were also more willing to &quot;share the path&quot; I&#x27;d consider them allies instead of hypocritical rivals.')
