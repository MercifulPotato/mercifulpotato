Item(by='_Microft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605867537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159058, text='Peter Beck, CEO and founder of Rocket Lab, actually posted &quot;Welcome back to Earth Electron!&quot; with an image of their Electron rocket swimming on the ocean but an editorialized title seemed more descriptive since it gives some context for the uninitiated.<p>Once they reliably can do that, they will attempt to catch the booster with a helicopter during descent, that is before it touches down in the ocean. I would assume that means they need to figure out how to secure the booster (venting fuel and oxygen?) already during descent.<p>You might want to check for more coverage and images:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RocketLab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RocketLab</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Peter_J_Beck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Peter_J_Beck</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;rocketlab&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;rocketlab&#x2F;</a>')
