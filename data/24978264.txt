They are stealing from their fellow citizens.<p>When big fraud scandals occur (Enron, Wirecard) the accountants and auditors are rightfully shamed by their industry. When we find out who paid $0 in corporate income tax the lawyers who made it happen and defended it seem to escape scrutiny. The legal industry will protect its own every time, no matter who they enable or defend.<p>“In every big transaction [...] there is a magic moment during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is due to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient’s blubbering thanks.” ― Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater')
