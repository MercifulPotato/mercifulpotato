I made it clear that obscene long functions are not something you want to have.  That doesn&#x27;t detract from the value of braces, since braces become an aid when remedying such a situation.  They don&#x27;t solve it, but they help you solve it.  So your objection seems to be that they don&#x27;t solve the sort of problem that you wouldn&#x27;t expect syntactical forms to solve.')
