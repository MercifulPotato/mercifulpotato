Some people (well I guess all people that leave reviews) like to be highlighted, so they only leave 5 or 1 star reviews. This was a pain when I was managing a Google app and part of the performance review was the average rating. This was a small app with few reviews so the jokers that liked the app but left 1 star review to be highlighted really made a negative difference.<p>Just to be clear, I was OK with users leaving 1 star if they didn&#x27;t like it or even better had some constructive feedback. But many were like &quot;great app&quot;: 1 star, or &quot;Hi single guy here, and ladies around?&quot;: 1 star.')
