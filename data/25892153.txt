The above series of movements can take around 30 seconds. That&#x27;s 400k minutes which results in 400k &#x2F; 40 hours == 10k weeks. At 50 weeks per year (only 2 weeks vacation each year) that still results in 200 years!!. Even if you do one CD every second this result in 200 years &#x2F; 30 ==~7 years.')
