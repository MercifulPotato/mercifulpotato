In the case of google&#x2F;FB, they are so high, that paying back users with &quot;free services&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore. Even the cost of running those free services has gone way down. At this point users shouldbe <i>getting paid</i> for having their data used. That way, a potential competitor could outright buy the users directly (instead of paying FB&#x2F;Google for advertising to acquire users). Unfortunately there&#x27;s no legal framework for that yet.<p>No other industry except perhaps finance has the potential to cheaply scale as IT. I wonder what antimonopoly actions have been in finance in the past (finance seems to have been a lot more regulated since forever)')
