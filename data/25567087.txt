The arms researchers or manufacturers? The army? The people who are mean to us and own resources we want (I mean they could just surrender)?<p>Everyone&#x27;s at fault, according of course to the degree to which they themselves are able to shape the object, in this case mostly culture and incentives, responsible for the decline.<p>&gt; Are the people building Facebook responsible for the social decline? Or is it the government, not applying proper regulation&#x2F;laws? Or is it the people using Facebook (nobody is forcing you)? Or are humans just like this and Facebook shows us their true color?<p>I repeat, everyone&#x27;s responsible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Diffusion_of_responsibility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Diffusion_of_responsibility</a>')
