I don&#x27;t see weird criticism about mining consuming energy. Doing stuff takes energy and while the sentiment against ML seems to be &quot;it&#x27;s snake oil&quot;, it is still very real research with actual real-world impacts.<p>Finally, we are in a transition phase where ML is done on GPUs which consume more energy than dedicated ASICs. We already have Google TPUs and Amazon Inferentia which can be used today. Power consumption will go down as dedicated hardware gets better and better.')
