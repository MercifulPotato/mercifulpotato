It could be simultaneously true that a Dvorak layout would be better for new typists to learn and use for a lifetime but for me to remain better off unchanged. If I made that choice, it would be because I was interested in the efficient expression of my ideas. (The irony of me typing this on a iPhone on-screen keyboard is painful to me.)')
