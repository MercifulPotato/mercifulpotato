I would be surprised if you would still hold the opinions you&#x27;ve expressed here, but then mileage can vary quite significantly in some cases.<p>&gt; Of course drugs feel good, that&#x27;s why people do them.<p>Technically, that is only one of the reasons.  Psychedelics seem to <i>usually</i> feel good, but from time to time you can get the exact opposite effect, sometimes in very large quantities.  Yet, anecdotes seem to suggest that even after extremely unpleasant trips, most people seem to consider the experience valuable and continue to use them.')
