For starters the salesman himself gets commission on selling the warranty, but he might not get anything on service and repair. Also warranties are cash in hand that you can amortise over the warranty period, so it&#x27;s effectively a steady revenue stream rather than bursty fits and starts. That enables more efficient financial planning.')
