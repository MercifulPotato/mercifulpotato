It&#x27;s just a SOCKS proxy, period. If you ever thought Tor could do that, you were just wrong.<p>There are various third party add-ons for various systems that do try to funnel &quot;ALL&quot; traffic through Tor in various ways. ORBot for Android tries to act like a VPN for the phone. Outboard hardware like the Pi-hole will try to put everything on a subnet through Tor. Tor-centric OSes like Whonix and TAILS put all of their traffic through Tor. You can hack something up to do it on vanilla Linux.<p>... but so far as I know, there has never been anything that tried to do it on MacOS. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know about some weird hack that&#x27;s available, but even if there is one, it&#x27;s not part of Tor proper.<p>It&#x27;s also not something anybody should ever have relied on anyway, because trying to &quot;act like a VPN&quot;, on a general-purpose OS that&#x27;s not cooperating, is prone to be leaky regardless of the OS. As long as programs running in an OS can find out the system&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; IP address, they can leak it, so if you&#x27;re serious about containing non-cooperative programs, you need to deprive them of that information.<p>The Tor Browser doesn&#x27;t do any that. It just sends the traffic from the browser app itself over Tor using SOCKS, and Apple has not broken that here.<p>What Apple is doing is obnoxious and unacceptable and yet another reason never, ever to use an Apple product for anything... but it has zero impact on Tor.')
