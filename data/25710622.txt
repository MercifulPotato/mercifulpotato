Would we all still be saying &quot;well it&#x27;s totally fine because AT&amp;T et al are private companies&quot;?<p>It seems obvious to me that sometimes companies become so large and have so much influence that they should not be allowed to just ban&#x2F;block whoever they want, even if they are private. I&#x27;m not sure if AWS in particular is at that point, but the App Store and Google Play Store certainly feel close.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is, but I don&#x27;t think this &quot;they&#x27;re private so they have no obligations to serve you&quot; is valid at the scale of the companies in question.')
