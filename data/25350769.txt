Acting in a way that is optimal for the project doesn&#x27;t require you to be narcissistic, thin-skinned, revengful, etc.<p>Empathy can be a hurdle in making the right decisions, for example firing a low performing employee. You could argue that someone who takes pleasure in the pain of others could be a better leader. Possibly. But first, I would still find them repulsive and second, I think you can be both decent and a good leader who makes the right decisions. Personally if I were in a leadership position I would try to &quot;hack&quot; my emotions and convince myself that e.g. firing someone who doesn&#x27;t do a good job is a good thing overall.')
