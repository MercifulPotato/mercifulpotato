I learned C from K&amp;R; I learned C++ from Stroustrup&#x27;s <i>The C++ Programming Language</i>; I learned Perl from the Camel book.  (I don&#x27;t remember how I learned Java.  It may have been online, or it may have been from a book.)<p>A mentor is useful, because after reading a book like K&amp;R, you know how to write syntactically-correct lines of C, lines that actually do what you think they do, but you don&#x27;t know how to <i>program</i> in C.  You can write lines of C, but you don&#x27;t know how to write pages of C without making a mess of it.  That&#x27;s where a mentor helps - that next level past syntax.')
