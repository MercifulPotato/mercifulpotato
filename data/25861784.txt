It&#x27;s a task in a schedule that has its dates hardcoded and thus will not move, which is really insanely wrongheaded.<p>It certainly can be abused, but at the level you have described it, it seems a straightforward way of modeling things outside of the scheduling control of the project.<p>(Now, if it&#x27;s allowed to have other tasks as dependencies, and doesn&#x27;t basically raise a giant red flag if the calculated time of those dependencies pushes past the begin or end of the Manual Task, depending on the kind of dependency, that&#x27;s a problem with the implementation, but at the level you have described it the <i>concept</i> isn&#x27;t misplaced.)<p>On one level, needing to use it is a management smell that control may not have been assigned over all things it should be to effectively manage a project, but that&#x27;s very much a reality.<p>&gt; Imagine Excel introduces a feature called Manual Math that allows you to override the rules of arithmetic.<p>You mean, if excel let you directly enter a value in a cell, even if headings suggest it&#x27;s a calculation? I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s has that feature from say one.')
