The bit about broadcasting to a large number of clients is harder to see the value of in a Rails application when so many approaches work simply enough already.<p>As for replacing rich frontend rendering libraries in more complex apps - it seems dicey. Part of the virtue of React is that it simplifies the visual presentation of the frontend based on a constellation of data. Things like highlighted elements, hover states, and dragging items.
