If you are in the business of renting out compute resources then you need to spell out what the terms are. It&#x27;s like renting out your car and then getting mad when someone drives it 2000 miles in one weekend. You need to spell out: &quot;Yep, it&#x27;s $50 a day, and you get 100 miles per day. Every mile after that is $1. If you want to drive the car further it&#x27;s $100 per day&quot; not &quot;It&#x27;s $50 per day unless we don&#x27;t like what you are doing then we&#x27;ll revoke the car arbitrarily&quot;<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not that we morally objected, it&#x27;s that it wasn&#x27;t the business we wanted to provide, and it was against the TOS<p>Ok and what was the clause in the ToS they violated?
