That’s not a surprise. The extraordinary claim that I challenged was that this is being installed on Apple computers at the factories. So far as I can tel, there is no evidence for it.<p>This is like someone claiming it will rain next week and when asked how they know, they say they can prove it rained last week. That’s irrelevant. Yes I know they have firmware attacks. Where does the claim they are putting it on machines in the factory come from? How many times do I need to ask the same question?')
