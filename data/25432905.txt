It also is hard to reconcile the recent trend away from saturated fats with diets that we know are healthier than modern diets, e.g. French cooking that uses lots of butter, a saturated fat. Or Mediterranean cooking that uses lots of olive oil, which is one of the more saturated cooking oils (it also is fairly high in unsaturated fat). I think there is more going on here than the nutrition studies indicate.<p>I certainly agree about trans-fats. I would never suggest they&#x27;re healthy. I don&#x27;t think satiety is the full story about why fast food is unhealthy, nor just the lack of nutrients. It seems to be actively bad. And I&#x27;m obviously not focusing on only the fats used during cooking, but I was responding to a comment about palm oil, not about nutrition in general.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not convinced saturated fats are healthier, either, but I think the science here is very sketchy and generally of low quality.')
