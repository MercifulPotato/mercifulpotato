I&#x27;ve used it on gigantic servers, workstations, laptops, and embedded devices – it&#x27;s wonderful.<p>But my day-to-day development machine is a Mac, and has been for a long time. This was originally because I was both a graphic designer and a developer, and needed access to tools like Photoshop and InDesign while still having a UNIX development environment, and the Mac was great at both of these. This basically still applies – I have access to lots of really well-designed native applications that I use all the time, and a full UNIX development environment that I use every day.<p>I really haven&#x27;t encountered the issues you talk about in a serious way – the most frequent thing is forgetting that I don&#x27;t have the GNU version of some CLI tools and need to use different flags. Certainly no encounters with a &quot;weird security system&quot;. I have a working development environment, running on nice hardware, that gives me access to everything I want – it&#x27;s hard to find a reason to make a change to this.<p>I do sometimes come back to working with Linux in a desktop capacity – most recently Ubuntu on a NUC when I shipped my MacBook back for repair. It is broadly fine, but it&#x27;s still just a bit more irritating. Multiple monitor support was buggy, as was high-DPI support and Bluetooth. No doubt a different distribution and&#x2F;or some tweaking could resolve these issues and leave me with a development environment that was equivalent to what I already have – but I&#x27;d still be missing other tools that I like, not to mention all the niceties of the wider ecosystem.<p>Honestly it&#x27;s more likely to be the hardware that makes me change. I don&#x27;t have the same complaints as others do about recent product lines, but I&#x27;m definitely one of those people in Apple&#x27;s market gap in the &quot;high-end-non-workstation-non-integrated-desktop&quot; area. I&#x27;d fork quite a lot of money for something like a 16-core desktop machine, but probably not the £8k Apple wants for the Mac Pro. We&#x27;ll see what happens over the next few years though.')
