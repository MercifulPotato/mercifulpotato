If not, it&#x27;s not legal, as the consent is not freely given.<p>- Is the website setting tracking cookies, or tracking you in some other way, before you have made your choice about the consent? If it is, it&#x27;s not legal, as the consent must be opt-in not opt-out.<p>- Is it confusing? Then it&#x27;s probably not legal, as the consent must be informed.<p>- Is there a button to &quot;accept all&quot; with no clear list of what you&#x27;re accepting? Then it&#x27;s not legal, as the consent must be specific and unambiguous.<p>It&#x27;s not rocket science, anyone can read it up for example here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr-info.eu&#x2F;issues&#x2F;consent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr-info.eu&#x2F;issues&#x2F;consent&#x2F;</a>')
