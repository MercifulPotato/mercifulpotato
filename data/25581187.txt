From my brief looks into TLA+ it&#x27;d appear to match actor implementation models pretty well (messages to actors yield new states).<p>The fork-join model does allow you to completely avoid race conditions, because tasks are always created in a deterministic order, each can only work with the immutable input they get, and tasks join also in a deterministic order.<p>(I think when I say fork-join you&#x27;re thinking processes fork and join - I mean the abstract concept of fork-join. Map-reduce is an example of a fork-join model and is deterministic and race-free by construction with no proof system needed.)')
