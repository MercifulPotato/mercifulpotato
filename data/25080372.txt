Say Romania, where you had lots of small agriculture - when they joined the EU, big agra moves in and as part of the agricultural policies, small farms are converted to big ones, that follow the worst agricultural practise.  This is by design.  Where you had unique expressions, once the system is in place, what you have is well-ordered people and Starbucks.  It is based in fear.  It is not our natural state.<p>Hierarchies are not transparent.  If you are in a corporation, do you know what you boss is aiming for?  What his boss&#x27;s targets are?  None of them are accountable.  They would fire others in a sec if it was expedient for them.  The system itself, makes people act daily like conmen, thieves.  It turns people inside out - to take care of others is to fail financially - look at nursing.<p>Hopelessly naive is right.  I don&#x27;t care.  I only have to answer to myself, and my heart and intuition.  I don&#x27;t want to be a part of the ever-increasing dystopia we are creating for ourselves.  I judge for myself what is &#x27;good&#x27; and act accordingly.  I think that at the end of this experience we judge ourselves and our actions here.  Our time here might not be all we experience.  (Yes, I think the materialistic expression of our lives is a lie too.)  I hope I am able to say I took the time to understand myself, to find out what&#x27;s right, to have taken some actions in that direction.  And I don&#x27;t mean giving to so-called charitable organisations!')
