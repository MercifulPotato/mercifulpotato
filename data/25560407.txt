That doesn&#x27;t mean that SF&#x2F;SV isn&#x27;t forgoing a lot of money in order to keep its NIMBY policy.  Think about how much just the squares of land those single family homes and low rise buildings in SV are on would be worth if the SF was developed to NYC, Chicago or Boston levels.<p>I think the fundamental problem here is that the people of SV people do not believe in property rights (e.g. the right to develop property you own as you see fit) to such an extent that they are willing to put their money where their mouth is and codify it in the form of (restrictive zoning and other shenanigans that hinder development) even though this inhibits growth and limits their upside.<p>Edited for clarity')
