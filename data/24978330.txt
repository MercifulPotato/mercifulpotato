I think VoltDB, for example, uses the same application-level data partitioning approach, but with processes instead of threads. One advantage of the &quot;thread-per-core&quot; approach is that it allows fast communication between shards because the underlying threads share the same address space. In contrast, processes need to use a more heavy-weight approach of inter-process communication (IPC). Of course, process-based systems will have a reliability advantage, because processes cannot easily mess with each others state.')
