Jobs wont be just employees, you&#x27;re going to have security, shipping, power plant jobs, recycling servers, etc.<p>It also seems that they&#x27;ll get some energy from datacenter heat back plus greenhouse heat... so a nice opportunity to do research and create bleeding edge facilities.<p>It&#x27;s also credits, as in Microsoft first invests and then gets free electricity for a while...<p>Then there&#x27;s a nice national security benefit having datacenter in your country.<p>So overall a good deal...')
