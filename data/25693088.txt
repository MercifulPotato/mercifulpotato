I think too much censorship is bad, but there is some amount of censorship in every country in the world.<p>We do censor speech in the USA. IMO we could go a little further without being at all &quot;Orwellian&quot;.<p>Many countries with very high levels of freedom from government intervention and freedom to vote and express themselves (mostly in Europe) have much stricter views on what constitutes speech that should be censored around hate speech and overly nationalistic speech.<p>FWIW, while many of those countries take a stricter stance on hate speech, most of them also have a much _less_ strict stance than the USA on other forms of free expression, like nudity and swear words.')
