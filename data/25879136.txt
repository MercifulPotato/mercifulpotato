An affected example would be a query that counts &quot;distinct within some time window&quot;. It only has to keep that window&#x27;s `distinct on` values around as long as you can still feed events with timestamps in that window.\nIf you are no longer able to, the values of the `distinct on` become irrelevant for this operator, and only the count for that window needs to be retained.')
