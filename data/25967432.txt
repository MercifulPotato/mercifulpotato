It may not be who the extremely-online people that this board is mostly comprised of care about, but they are not most people.<p>&gt; <i>Further, they shouldn&#x27;t care about them because anyone who doesn&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on deserves to get whatever happens to them.</i><p>This is directly at odds with how markets are regulated, because there is a long history of this thinking leading to widespread scams and cons.')
