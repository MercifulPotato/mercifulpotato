China solar output accounts for maybe 2% of their total electricity production. They are ahead on electric vehicle sales.<p>But I find quite ironic that you would use China as an example, when the measures taken to curb pollution in Beijing include, among others: forcing the switch from gasoline powered motorcycles to electric&#x2F;gas ones, limit the number of citizens allowed to own or drive cars, and forbidding the use of coal powered broilers.<p>Because I thought you were worried about lack of democracy, and government surveillance.')
