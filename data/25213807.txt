Usually they care a lot about clothes, accessories, and are passionate about style and appearance.  One guy I know always enjoys going &quot;thrifting&quot; at secondhand stores, and is incredibly enthusiastic and helpful if you go with him.  So his success is related as much to work as it is to luck.<p>There&#x27;s a lot that goes into being attractive in the same way there&#x27;s a lot that goes into being &quot;smart&quot; (e.g. someone with a phd may be born smart but they worked incredibly hard to earn that phd).')
