For example it&#x27;s practically impossible for a supermarket to do very good fresh bread; &quot;fresh&quot; supermarket bread is normally delivered frozen part baked and there isn&#x27;t margin for much labour beyond schlepping things in and out of ovens, slicers and baggers. The bread you get at the start of a meal in a fine dining restaurant, baked from scratch in the kitchen? Never going to come close.<p>Most &quot;luxury&quot; products are a big marketing spend, combined with an emphasis on components and finish the customer can notice easily, ideally by sight. For things where consistency is more important than specificity, this works ok. For example, you almost always want the mass market engine, not the bespoke one tuned by the artisan mechanic. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as true for food.')
