Stress and a CoC seem to be the main reasons. And they want &quot;to focus more on stability&quot; instead of features. Personally I never had stability problems with radars (although I had problems loading some more complex&#x2F;large binaries). Smells to me like a fork for some reason or the other, but not technical.\nI will leave a comment that pancake made here because I couldn&#x27;t agree more<p>&gt; not going to feed the flame, we had some different views and personal conflicts. so i guess it&#x27;s better to avoid fighting each other and be constructive building whatever they want')
