The easiest way I can think of describing it is that it starts out feeling sort of like a painful headache on one side of your head, that rapidly becomes more painful and _never stops_. The attacks can last literally months (My attacks tend to be 2-months long, two or three times a year).<p>The nickname of &quot;suicide headache&quot; is absolutely earned. Your face contains some of the most painful nerves in your body. Light them all up like a christmas tree, and keep it lit for months. Drive an icepick into your eye and keep that pain there for months. There is no escape. The pain can and will drive you from sleep, and there is basically no pain medication that will do anything noticeable.<p>I would never wish this upon anyone. Friend or foe.<p>---<p>All that being said, pain is a deeply personal thing. If your migraines are putting you in the worst pain that you know, then that&#x27;s the very worst thing that you know. Coping with it means that you&#x27;re dealing, and deserve sympathy, and understanding.<p>I don&#x27;t get migraines, never have, so I don&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s like. You have my sympathy for it. I am sorry that you suffer is this way, and I wish that it wasn&#x27;t something that you consider part of your normal. I wish there was something I could do to ease your pain. Your living with it, is something to be proud of.')
