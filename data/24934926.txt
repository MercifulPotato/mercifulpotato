However it&#x27;s likely beyond our <i>practical</i> engineering capabilities.<p>Early spaceflight up through Apollo was done with an army of humans with slide rules and rivet guns. We did it because there was a political imperative to do so. A lot of new technology was developed as a result. But it ended up being unsustainable because it was too expensive.<p>I think the key to making O&#x27;Neill cylinders feasible will be large scale outer space resource mining and in-space manufacturing. Both will require advanced robotics and AI. We could throw a bunch of money into developing that ... or we could just wait for the technology to develop here on Earth and then apply it to space.<p>Likewise, as much as I&#x27;d like to see a Mars outpost in my lifetime, it would be a lot cheaper and safer if we didn&#x27;t rush it. Maybe by 2075 we&#x27;ll have cured cancer and radiation won&#x27;t be an issue, and we&#x27;ll have self-repairing life support systems and one of those automated medical pods from the Alien movies.')
