I once was a battle tank maintenance guy and we had to replace a cover placed in front of the armor. The replacement had holes in different positions, no problem, just drill a new hole, right? An hour and a few broken drills later we gave up. No doubt there are drills that work on that armor-steel, my point is, depending on the material just <i>any</i> drill may not be good enough. An hour of hard work barely caused a &lt;0.5mm &quot;deep&quot; scratch to appear! \nPS: We solved the problem by not solving it. Attaching three points instead of four was enough, de decided. That tank would never see a real battle but was only used for training anyway.')
