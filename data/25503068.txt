Item(by='phire', descendants=None, kids=[25503174], score=None, time=1608613498, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502058, text='&gt; Reddit, in its earlier days, was never dominated by the Voat contingent.<p>Reddit never had free speech as a key attracting point. People came to reddit not because it was free speech, but because there was good conversations and content there.<p>Reddit&#x27;s early &quot;free speech attitude&quot; came about mostly because they had a staff of 4 people who spend all their time trying to keep the site from crashing as it scaled. It was a stance of convenience which they kept as long as possible.<p>Vote explictly advertised it as a &quot;free speech alternative to reddit&quot;. Free speech was it&#x27;s number one advertising point. It&#x27;s really not surprising it instantly attracted the wrong type of users and drove away everyone else.')
