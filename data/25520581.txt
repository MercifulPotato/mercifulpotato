I think that&#x27;s a pretty bold and naive statement to make.<p>For example, research on quantum-mechanical light-matter interaction was considered not very practically relevant in the 80s and 90s. In the 2000s the results were picked up by the superconducting qubit research community and used to great effect to build a viable approach to quantum computing.<p>The outcome of research is inherently hard to predict, and telling people that their field of study is &quot;low yield&quot; because it&#x27;s not the hot topic of the day seems quite naive and arrogant to me.')
