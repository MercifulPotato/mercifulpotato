CentOS7 will be, until 30 June 2024, according to their current status page, but who&#x27;s going to trust them after what they pulled yesterday? Overnight, they changed CentOS8&#x27;s End-of-life from 31 May 2029 to 31 Dec 2021. Surely you understand that that made a few people a bit upset.<p>The only thing actively maintained in the future will be CentOS Stream, which is not CentOS classic as people understoond and used it. CentOS classic were RHEL-release clones without Redhat branding and support. CentOS Stream is RHEL-next Beta.')
