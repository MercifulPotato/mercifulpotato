In my current life situation, lack of alarm clock (in the shape of an infant) and free running sleep are simply not possible.<p>However, this article does highlight the importance and naturalness of a mid-day nap. When reading this I started practising mid-day naps at my desk, but I never really learned to do it until other things got in the way and I started forgetting about it. Maybe I should try again.<p>At the very least, I encourage anyone to stand up for the right to take a mid-day nap, even if you don&#x27;t personally use that right.<p>If you feel like you could use a nap, napping is probably the responsible thing to do.
