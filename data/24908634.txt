It&#x27;s the problem of expressing complex logic and calculations to meet your ends.  If you can&#x27;t express those ideas on a computer then you&#x27;re not going to get anywhere making software.<p>The problem is that kind of thinking is hard, and requires the use of something more complex than the no-code tools available now or in the foreseeable future.  The nifty part about programming is the concepts are transferable to other areas.  No-code tools generally don&#x27;t offer that - you learn how to do Minecraft or Excel, but then when you&#x27;re out of that tool your skills don&#x27;t apply.  <i>I see this with young people frequently now.</i>  For example, a bunch of Excel VBA functions that do essentially the same thing but with a number in their name to determine some functionality.  When asked why they don&#x27;t they just pass the number as a parameter to a single function the answer is that&#x27;s too difficult and what they have works fine.  This is from a recent graduate in engineering.<p>Making software without coding doesn&#x27;t really do anything but let you assemble pre-made parts.  That&#x27;s fine for some relatively simple thing, but will never give you the power of coding.')
