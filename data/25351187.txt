When the roadmap of an open-source project is tightly controlled by a sponsor, that can make third-party contributions hard or impossible. I know OSRM much better than MBGL so I&#x27;ll cite an example from that - the distance matrix issue. This is massive for many users, plays right to OSRM&#x27;s strengths, but Mapbox wouldn&#x27;t accept patches to provide it for _years_. IIRC it only got in when Mapbox&#x27;s attention shifted to Valhalla.<p>I&#x27;m not blaming the Mapbox devs at all for that; it wasn&#x27;t important for Mapbox&#x27;s business, and any extra code inevitably brings a maintenance burden. But it partly explains why third-party contributors are reluctant to contribute when the roadmap&#x27;s out of their control.<p>Back on MBGL, there was&#x2F;is a community, but the community formed around MVT rather than MBGL specifically - again, possibly because MBGL is just so good. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mapbox&#x2F;awesome-vector-tiles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mapbox&#x2F;awesome-vector-tiles</a> sums up the enormous community energy in the space (I think that might be your document originally, apologies if not). It&#x27;s kind of a shame that MBGL being so far ahead of everything else has probably crimped development on alternative renderers.')
