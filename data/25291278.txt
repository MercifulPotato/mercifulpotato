I used to get into this cycle of playing video games or watching some show until like 6am and then I would go to sleep for 5-6 hours. I knew what I needed to do to get myself out of that cycle, as eventually it became unpleasant&#x2F;anti-social&#x2F;etc... but I just didn&#x27;t want to take the steps. As can be seen in some of the comments, there is often a chasm between giving advice and taking it.')
