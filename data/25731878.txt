Is that really too much to ask for?<p>The answer is yes - yes it is too much to ask for - you don&#x27;t get a free service without paying for it in some other way - mostly these days through the data mining&#x2F;advertising side of things. If there&#x27;s no way to turn a profit then why would someone pay for it to be setup?')
