Most of the time I spend with this kids is fun. Sure, there can be bad times that are stressful and&#x2F;or exhausting but it&#x27;s mostly been very rewarding.<p>My kids are asleep by 830 or 9pm, I&#x27;m not sure why this person feels they don&#x27;t have free time until 11pm, that seems like an exaggeration to me.<p>Even when they are awake, they rarely occupy both my wife and I full time, unless we&#x27;re choosing to spend quality time with them. Sometimes just one of us watches them while the other one had time to relax or catch up on work.<p>It&#x27;s not like my wife and I were globetrotting before kids anyway. Having kids is far more interesting than the same old, same old routine. I don&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m missing out on things I would have been doing before kids.')
