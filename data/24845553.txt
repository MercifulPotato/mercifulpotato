(Unless the file is read-only.) But it&#x27;s a lot faster to be able to redefine it interactively inside the DevTools console and I wish there was a &quot;dev&quot; setting that allowed this. Also, you said &quot;<i>you</i> declared it&quot; but usually it wasn&#x27;t <i>me</i> who declared it constant. Rather, some other programmer thought `width=800` or `numColumns=80` should be declared constant. &quot;Variables aren&#x27;t; constants won&#x27;t be.&quot; No coder is an island: one programmer&#x27;s bad `const` can&#x27;t make life harder for other coders. Related: One reason I use Chromium browsers instead of Firefox is because in Firefox DevTools console once you declare `class A {}` you can&#x27;t interactively change it to, say, add a constructor like `class A { constructor (foo) { this.foo = foo } }` During learning and experimentation this is lousy; you can&#x27;t interactively iterate at the console prompt like a proper dynamic language. You must instead put your code in an external file and set up a &quot;save file and re-run everything&quot; system just like static languages like C++ require.')
