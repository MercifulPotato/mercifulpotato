A9 was around 10-15% faster per clock <i>and</i> were often multicore meaning a 1.5GHz chip was faster in all metrics over the 1.6GHz Atom.<p>A few articles came out June&#x2F;July of this year with Analysts saying that Intel had spent over 10 Billion dollars trying to break into the mobile market with no success. ARM&#x27;s current R&amp;D budget (according to Nvidia a month or so ago) is 0.5B. If they spent that much every year since 2000, they would barely match Intel, but their entire market cap in stayed under 4B all the way until 2009. Remember, that R&amp;D includes their high-end ARM cores, but also GPU, midrange designs, various microcontroller designs, a realtime OS, ARM tooling, NPUs, various kernel support, etc<p>If that much money can&#x27;t fix up x86 to keep up with a budget a fraction of the size, I take that as proof that the ISA really does matter.')
