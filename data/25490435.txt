Why would developers in Europe make the same money as developers in China&#x2F;US&#x2F;Argentina? Different places, different salaries.<p>Personally I envy the high salaries in the US (for devs) but I wouldn&#x27;t move to the US because in Europe I got 30 days of vacation plus public holidays (which makes around 45 days off per year... paid) working full-time (35 hours&#x2F;week)... and anyway, if one wants to make serious money as a developer, the only way is to bootstrap your own SaSS; working for others (in Europe or in US) only gets you so far.')
