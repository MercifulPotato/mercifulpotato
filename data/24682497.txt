Things we don&#x27;t have good evidence for, at best, can be said to be &quot;an intriguing idea&quot;.  They are fun to ponder, and help us consider what possibilities could lead to better descriptions of the cosmos, but they don&#x27;t lead to any actual understanding of what is real<p>So the best thing for a lot of these questions is to get good at going &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and instead trying to understand what we do know.  We have a bunch of problems to solve about the universe (dark matter &#x2F; quantum gravity) that may change the nature how we might even ask this kind of question.  So I mainly focus on what&#x27;s the most we can know with reasonable certainty at the moment.')
