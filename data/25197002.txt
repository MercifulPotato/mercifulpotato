There are also many &quot;surgical&quot; decisions that have to be taken - sometimes even during surgery as not everything can always be planned in advance (e.g. tumor size is bigger -&gt; more resection is need and thus reconstruction also changes).\nDecisions like &quot;do we correct the areola asymmetry now that we see there is one after reconstruction&quot; are quite common during surgery - and so far, decisions are mostly based on surgeon preferences unfortunately.\nIf we can get a better understand on what parameters matter more for aesthetical perception, decision taking is improved in many different ways - not the patient-related part of it.\nI hope that explanation helps! Thank you so much for the great support!')
