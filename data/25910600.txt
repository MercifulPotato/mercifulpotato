But the Australian definition also includes the likes of insecure accommodation and inappropriate accommodation: couch surfers, people living in accommodation with inadequate living conditions, people sleeping in their cars,  in socially provisioned homeless accommodation and emergency&#x2F;crisis accommodation (domestic violence,  youth, men and aged issues were the traditional breakdown of most services in my day).<p>To compare between the two nations from official sources you have to bring them back onto a somewhat comparable basis.')
