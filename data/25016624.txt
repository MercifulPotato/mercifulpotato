Item(by='sxp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604770600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015759, text='&gt; In 2013, the National Council of Examiners of Engineers and Surveyors (NCEES), which all 50 states use for licensure examination, began offering testing for software engineers. The exams were produced in collaboration with the IEEE, who maintains a Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK).<p>What would such a test look like? The NCEES sample questions appear to be paywalled. The SWEBOK link 404s, but I found a pdf with some info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeecs-media.computer.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;education&#x2F;swebok&#x2F;swebok-v3.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeecs-media.computer.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;education&#x2F;swebok&#x2F;swe...</a><p>Given how vast the field of software engineering is, would the test be similar to FAANG interviews where you need to solve some algorithmic leetcode puzzle? Or would it require knowledge of a specific programming language and all its pitfalls?')
