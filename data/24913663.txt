Nevertheless, in order not to disappoint the tribe and to be on the safe side, he told them that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that they should collect firewood and be prepared.<p>However, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, “Is the coming winter going to be cold?”<p>“It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold&quot; they responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be better prepared. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again, “Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?”<p>“Yes”, replied the man at National Weather Service this time, even more certain,“it&#x27;s going to be a very, very cold winter.”<p>So the Chief went back to his people once again and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could lay their hands on.<p>Two weeks later, worried about the mountains of wood and the hard work the tribe was putting in collecting it, the chief called the National Weather Service just to be absolutely sure.&quot;Are you definitely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?”<p>“Absolutely”, the weatherman said, “It&#x27;s looking more and more like it&#x27;s going to be one of the coldest winters on record.”<p>“But how can you be so certain?” the chief asked. &quot;Well, for a start&quot; the weatherman replied, “the Indians are collecting a shedload of firewood.”')
