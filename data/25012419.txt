But that&#x27;s hard and most people just don&#x27;t like it.<p>That said, it can be a &#x27;true problem&#x27; in the sense that managers are too in the weeds - and a &#x27;true problem&#x27; in the pragmatic social aspect in that if people &#x27;really don&#x27;t like it&#x27; then it&#x27;s just not going to work out even if technically it could be warranted.<p>There are so many managers I&#x27;ve seen who are really high EI, who would never dare micromanaging, because they instinctively see their job as a popularity contest. They really don&#x27;t actually care about the product or outcomes, they are not built that way, they have been managing their lives through the spectrum of likability, and instinctively feel that when &#x27;everyone is happy&#x27; they are doing a &#x27;good job&#x27; irrespective of outcomes. In many organizations this is actually normative.<p>And of course, there are just a lot of bad managers out there as well, micromanaging where they should not, with no sense of making better outcomes even as they believe they do.<p>Self awareness is really hard.')
