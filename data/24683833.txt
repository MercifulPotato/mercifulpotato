That&#x27;s a situation that just shouldn&#x27;t be.  In my opinion, a felony should almost universally be something either egregiously reckless or done with nefarious intent, and it should be something that people can universally agree is an obvious problem.  (And by that, I mean an ACTUAL problem, not a side-target of the thing that&#x27;s really of interest.)')
