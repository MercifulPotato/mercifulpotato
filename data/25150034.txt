I got people who thought I was some sort of employee of Purism just because I was willing to answer questions and did so nicely, and then people got upset because I didn&#x27;t post things they wanted (and spread the exact sort of non-sense you are spreading now).<p>Publishing any sort of video takes a non-trivial amount of time, especially when one has never even attempted to try doing so before. The owner of that device isn&#x27;t being paid to put that up there. I really don&#x27;t blame the owner one bit for not wanting to do that, especially when I see attitudes like this. I also don&#x27;t blame others for NOT wanting to do forums posts like that, when there are attitudes like this.')
