What I&#x27;m seeing around me is that &quot;news reporting&quot; is more often than not speculation about tomorrow&#x27;s events, rather than reporting about today&#x27;s events. Maybe it&#x27;s for the same reason, reporters feel that today&#x27;s events have already been covered to death because of the hype news cycle, so they turn to speculation rather than confirmation and contextualization?')
