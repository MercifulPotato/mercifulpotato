It leaves me feeling extremely empty and worthless. Get some hobbies. There are plenty of things to learn during lockdowns that you don&#x27;t need to be glued to a phone for:<p><pre><code>  1. Walking and exploring\n  2. Working out\n  3. Cooking\n  4. Build something\n  5. Go meet other people\n</code></pre>\nSure, browse Facebook in the morning but I can&#x27;t imagine having to be glued to it for hours every day anymore. If I find myself in that position, I try to do the above things. There&#x27;s just too much to do and too much learn to be glued to social media.')
