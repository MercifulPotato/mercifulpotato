I&#x27;m also not tracking <i>everything</i>, for example, showering.  So I have a fair bit of missing time every day, which I&#x27;m aiming to get down to 2 hours or less a day.<p>I&#x27;ve already found myself using time more &quot;productively&quot; - preferring to do things which are tracked (like reading) over things which are not (like mindlessly browsing the internet).<p>There are a few key metrics I&#x27;m keeping an eye on:<p>- Average daily sleep deficit: `avg(8 - sleep hours)`<p>- Average daily work deficit: `avg(8 - work hours)` for work days<p>- Average daily missing time: `avg(24 - all hours)`<p>- Days since last day off work, not counting weekends<p>- Percentage of leisure hours: `avg(leisure hours &#x2F; (all hours - sleep hours))`<p>I&#x27;m also watching how I spend my work days, for example, what proportion of my time is spent doing active work, or in meetings, or doing admin work.<p>I&#x27;ll likely expand the things I&#x27;m specifically monitoring as I get more data.')
