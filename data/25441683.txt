The government should not invest unprofitably just to maintain current levels.<p>And no, GDP will not drop. Current productive capital will generate the same value of goods&#x2F;service, and prices will drop to clearing level until everything produced is consumed. It&#x27;s better for the population to enjoy higher consumption levels, or to create stockpiles for the future, than have their labor and capital output diverted to projects that will provide them with less resources than they put in.')
