You might make that mirror available publicly, or you might use it privately. Shutting down all the public instances would likely be a game of whack-a-mole. Similarly, its not dependent on AWS, or a gmail address.<p>While a single website might be vulnerable to DDOS, the vision is many independent instances which will allow for great redundancy.')
