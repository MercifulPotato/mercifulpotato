(unemployed) As the robotics field is still very young and experimental stage, I always envisioned that robotics work &amp; development would include at least some research component (read paper for application &amp; implementation) and that Start-ups that need a technical edge would be the places open to this.<p>After working at two Startups, the latter one at hiring stage explicitly stating reading&#x2F;implementing state-of-the-art methods as job description (Which I didn&#x27;t end up doing), I&#x27;ve come to the impression that most of the time, this is not the case.<p>So I&#x27;ve been looking for institute&#x2F;places that are more research focused, but almost all of them seems to put a PhD at &quot;Minimum requirement&quot; for application. Is there anyone out there that do more research related work, but ended up doing that without a PhD in the bag? If so, how?')
