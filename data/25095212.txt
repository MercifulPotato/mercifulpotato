They were created to engage in capital-requiring efforts (notably expeditions, but also large scale resource extraction and industrial projects) that would not happen without the personal liability release.<p>They would not happen because the potential for liability related to the endeavor was clear to all (i.e. people would likely die, and vast amounts of money might be lost).<p>But societies (and notably royal families) <i>wanted</i> those things to happen, and so they create corporate charters to encourage them to do so.<p>We could make do without corporate charters, but then we&#x27;d also likely be making do without most of things they enabled, because essentially nobody would have had the guts to bet their own personal liability on what were clearly risky and dangerous endeavors.')
