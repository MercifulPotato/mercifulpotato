I&#x27;ve had this on my Qashqai. The fuel-saving system that automatically turns off the engine when you&#x27;re stopped and out-of-gear can be confusing. This behaviour often happens when parking but it seems you still need to press the stop-start button to &quot;completely&quot; turn it off in order to lock the car.<p>This is the first car I&#x27;ve owned with &quot;modern&quot; driver aids and it is true that they are somewhat temperamental. For example, the auto full-beam headlights get very confused in fog (which can be dangerous!), whilst I often get a warning noise when approaching sharp bends at a perfectly safe speed.')
