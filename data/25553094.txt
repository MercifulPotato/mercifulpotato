Normally I&#x27;d dismiss claims like that as puffery, but here it&#x27;s concrete: no other big studios have invested in a VR game at that scale. And, veering into less quantitative observations, I haven&#x27;t seen any VR game—and not many &quot;normal&quot; games either—with the level of attention to detail that Alyx got.<p>I&#x27;ve listened to some of the design commentaries for the game, and I was really impressed at how much time, effort and user testing Valve was willing to put in to every detail. VR is a new medium, and it&#x27;s impressive to see an organization learn how to take advantage of it so thoroughly. It takes a special culture to make space for people to try things and indulge in perfectionism—takes a lot of money too, of course, but other AAA studios have just as much but don&#x27;t hew to the same standard.<p>I know Valve&#x27;s approach is controversial and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not <i>perfect</i>, but it&#x27;s clearly doing something right that very few other companies are. I&#x27;ve seen small <i>teams</i> work in ways like that, but never at scale. One of these days I&#x27;d love to work at a company trying something like that. (Probably not in video game development though :P.)')
