I am asking because the linear algebra course at &quot;my&quot; university was a course for CS <i>and</i> math students and it was (sadly) not computational at all. If I remember correctly (it&#x27;s quite some years ago), we started with rings and fields, then vector spaces, and matrices kind of naturally followed from that.')
