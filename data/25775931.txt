Elliot Roger is an example of someone who wants to murder someone.  And he murdered lots of people.  If everyone there who showed up wanted to murder people then it would have turned out a lot different.  All that other stuff is scary sure but the whole group having the goal to murder people? trying to murder people?  Nonsense!')
