Started getting compliments on how I dress all the time. I never cared about this very much, and that made me unaware that other people did care.<p>Any advice for someone that doesn’t care about this? I’m currently in this boat - I dress “fine” in the sense that it’s functional but is otherwise pretty plain and boring. Every time I try to improve on this I give up after being overwhelmed by the paradox of choice.')
