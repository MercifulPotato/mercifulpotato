There was a [relatively weak] moderation system which could be used to restrict posting and there were bots which would retroactively cancel messages so you might not see so much junk if a group used such a bot and ruthlessly nuked spam.<p>Regarding ISPs, in many cases it worked like your last case: start storing anything that at least one client has asked for recently. This was a notorious source of disk space consumption if you ran a low-capacity server and then had someone fire up a client, request the world, and then stop reading it but your system was still downloading everything.')
