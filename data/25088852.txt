A key part of human tendency is to be consistent with what we have already done. It&#x27;s a strong motivator to keep habits.<p>On intrusive thoughts, I think identifying them early and accepting them is important to re-directing them. It takes lot of patience and practice. Don&#x27;t give up on the first few tries. Just remember that eventually you will be consistent with your actions.<p><i>I am having a horrible day</i> -&gt; <i>what&#x27;s the least I could do to make this day better?</i> and then do it.<p>Please don&#x27;t aim for something you can&#x27;t do. It&#x27;s okay if you can get out of the bed. No need to go for run. Aim for the least and gradually increase otherwise you will not do anything due to fear.<p>Another skill that will help you immensely is ability to prioritize the right things. Writing down what you <i>really</i> should do in order and sticking it to somewhere visible helps.<p>In the end, no clear solution exist. For some, medication might be the best option and for others, it&#x27;s lot of training to control the factors leading to intrusive thoughts and eventually depressive episode.')
