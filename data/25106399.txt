Or perhaps you just decided that this path is not for you — nothing wrong with that!<p>Good luck either way!<p>As far as friends go:<p>I Started my first business with two friends: one was really good at cold calls and asking for things (I.e. orders) — I struggled with that similarly to you.  The other was super comfortable asking friends to come work with us.  I had other things I contributed — and we all programmed.<p>For the three of us it turned out to be fun.  I am sure none of us could have done it alone.')
