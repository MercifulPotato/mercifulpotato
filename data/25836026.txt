I wonder why such a trove isn&#x27;t worthy of discussion?<p>I suspect because if people watched those videos, they&#x27;d come away with a very different perspective. Pretty much all you see is people standing around waving signs and chanting -- literally textbook non-violent protesting. Once you see them enter the Capital, you still don&#x27;t see waves of violence and destruction. There are a couple-dozen aggressive&#x2F;violent people at most (and those people should definitely be arrested and charged).<p>In contrast, I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of videos of other riots throughout the year where you get hundreds of videos of the violence (along with the videos of people getting chased down and beaten up for violating the &quot;no cameras rule&quot; because they don&#x27;t want to be filmed doing horrible things. Most of those didn&#x27;t have large groups just standing around waving signs and chanting -- almost  everyone was involved in the violence and destruction. There was an interesting article I read that the riots this year caused more property damage than any in US history <i>by property insurance claims</i>. That&#x27;s not including people hurt&#x2F;killed, all the property damages under 10-20k per building where it costs more to file than to pay out of pocket, vehicles totaled, government buildings ruined (that the people&#x27;s taxes have to pay to repair), etc.<p>As I said before, I have zero tolerance for the violent people at the Capital. I also have zero tolerance for those beating up and hospitalizing thousands (probably tens of thousands) throughout the summer. This is in stark contrast to most news organizations and even prominent politicians who stated that the massive violent protest was a necessary and acceptable idea while then decrying the couple dozen violent protestors at the Capital as the basest kind of evil when <i>all</i> of it was evil political violence and was <i>all</i> wrong.')
