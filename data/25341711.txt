I think perhaps you&#x27;re the one who should read a little more about the science.<p>In short, the history of pollution is - people invent something with 0 thought given to side effects (e.g. smoking). Side effects turn out to be very bad. Company maliciously hides all evidence, and tries to manipulate data&#x2F;researchers (usually fairly successfully). Only after decades and decades of fighting does the scientific consensus prove that yes, secondhand smoking, lead exhaust, air pollution, PFOAs, microplastics, hundreds of (now-revoked) pesticides, pthalates, etc was even worse than everybody thought, and the policies are adjusted after massive suffering.<p>That&#x27;s why your fairy-tale about legal tradeoffs crumbles under the gentlest scrutiny. Because these policies around air-pollution predate any meaningful research on the health effects of this pollution. Just off the top of my head, here&#x27;s an article from last year of PM2.5 as a potential cause of depression [1]. Nobody knows yet how many more indirect and damaging effects from various types of pollution are yet to be discovered (from PM2.5 or otherwise).<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6447209&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6447209&#x2F;</a>')
