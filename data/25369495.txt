I have not heard that explanation, and believe it does give a wider margin for possible rejection rates.<p>I will have to chew on that new point a bit longer — it feels plausible, and I’d like to find more publicly available data that indicates how much weight should be given to that explanation.<p>So, now I guess I’ll ask a true “follow up” (thanks for that too ha!)...<p>From my experience in local and state elections, I know of scenarios where 1-3 people are in charge of “getting out the vote” (read as: not election fraud, but people would look side eyed at it). It is not hard for me to see how those same 1-3 people get out 100 votes when not in a pandemic, because they have to get the actual person voter to the polls. However, in this pandemic mail in voting environment, those same 1-3 people can get 500-1,000 voters information to fill out a ballot request - then have those ballots sent to the small team HQ. once there, the “get out the votes” become certain for the sides you want and you can cover tracks with the ways one fills in the ballot. Also, the team can just copy the signature from the gathering ballot request step. There are approximately a team like this for every 50,000 voters, in off presidential races.<p>So long story (or background) short, if such a scenario did occur, do you feel that is representative of the people and a valid election?<p>Then please poke holes in my scenario above if you see something else I missed.')
