[...] This clothing layer (which is actually worn in combination with briefs) has the largest potential to substitute a heating system. [...] Because it fits tightly around the body, long underwear has an optimal &quot;pumping coefficient&quot;.<p>When I was a child, we used to go skiing and then hang around in our long underwear. It is warm and flexible, but it&#x27;s also tightly woven and form-fitting, which traps moisture inside. There&#x27;s more to comfort than weight: even in a cold room, sitting with your back against the couch can accumulate sticky sweat.<p>&gt;Synthetic thermal underwear should be washed regularly - a process that consumes energy. This is less an issue for indoor use than for outdoor sports, because couch potatoes don&#x27;t produce sweat.<p>Anyone who&#x27;s ever reworn a pair of sweatpants for a week inside knows intimately the rancid depths of this falsehood.')
