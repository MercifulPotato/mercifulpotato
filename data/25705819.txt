The US must make actions in the future to more accurately describe what a war is. In my mind virtually every “quasi-war” that the United States has waged since WWII has been waged unconstitutionally.<p>We’ve gone about for too long meddling in the affairs of others. Putting boots on their grounds and haven’t the slightest bit of gall to make it official and firmly support it. These acts of ill will (however good intentioned they may have been- and most have not *see War in Vietnam) have been nothing but racketeering and have violated our own Constitution.<p>I agree. We must clarify and make it more explicit. We must also create a nuclear armistice. We can’t continue to go on kicking the little countries and idealogies of the world and not expect the Big Ones to at some point decide to kick back.<p>“ Don&#x27;t you understand, what I&#x27;m trying to say?\nCan&#x27;t you see the fears that I&#x27;m feeling today?\nIf the button is pushed, there&#x27;s no running away\nThere&#x27;ll be no one to save with the world in a grave”<p>From Barry McGuire’s “Eve of Destruction”')
