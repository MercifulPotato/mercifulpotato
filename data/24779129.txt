I&#x27;m not sure that would actually work though. I assume they already try to do that in development where it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to experiment than in production.<p>I only half-jokingly say that I lose interest in most series after, at most, 5 seasons. And it can be a lot less than that. A series can coast through maybe a season or two in significant part on a fresh concept, original characters, a different style, etc. Sure, the writing needs to be good too but it&#x27;s not the only thing to engage the viewer. It gets harder after that and so does finding fresh stories.')
