The UI is snappy, but the hinting&#x2F;linting&#x2F;type-checking is sometimes shockingly slow.<p>The only reason I&#x27;ve used VS Code for more than an hour in the last few years is because its Svelte plugin was much better, but now JetBrains has a good Svelte plugin, and I&#x27;m back to JetBrains 100% of the time.
