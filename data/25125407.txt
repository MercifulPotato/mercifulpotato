The entire IO and memory-management areas should have been either thrown out of the standard library, or updated 20 years ago to keep up with low-level operating system features.<p><i>But</i> one of the best features of C is that you can mostly ignore the standard library and still enjoy &quot;C the language&quot;, e.g. nobody ever choose C for its standard library ;)<p>(also re UB etc...: use the mighty trio UBSAN, ASAN and TSAN!)')
