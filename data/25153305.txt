I&#x27;ve worked in startups for most of my career (15 years) and I find the GP&#x27;s comment more true. 2 companies I&#x27;ve worked for no longer exist (including my own startup), and 1 company I worked for turned into a unicorn -- I left that co 7 years ago and I&#x27;m fairly certain none of the code I wrote during my 6 years of work there is still operating anymore now.')
