There are plenty of more decent scientists out there who can fill his size shoes.<p>I believe that scientific discovery is inevitable ... even if someone like Isaac Newton had died in the plague and not have worked out calculus there were other contemporaries of his caliber like Leibnitz to keep the field moving forward.<p>Thus I don&#x27;t think that we need as a society to ignore the cruel behavior of child rapists, or their abettors, in the name of advancing science.')
