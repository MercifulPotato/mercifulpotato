You did.<p>I specifically said Portland, and yes, many of the people there involved were acting under the pretense of BLM but imo it was mostly just black bloc antifa being antifa. Portland antifa groups have a known and consistent history of this behavior, they&#x27;ve exploited BLM to amplify their attacks and they&#x27;ve used the support they received for doing so to embolden their actions.<p>They have literally stalked and murdered trump supporters in the street, they have shot people, and they have blinded and maimed anyone that gets in their way.')
