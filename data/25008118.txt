What jq calls a &quot;filter&quot; can also be called a template for the output format.<p>Like any template, a jq filter will have the same structure as the desired output, but may also include dynamically calculated (interpolated) data, which can be a selection from the input data.<p>So, at a high level, write your filter to look like your output, with hardcoded data. Then, replace the &quot;dynamic&quot; parts of the output data with selectors over the input.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about any of the other features (e.g. conditionals, variables) until you need them to write your &quot;selectors.&quot;<p>YMMV, but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s worked for me')
