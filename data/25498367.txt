As I said, Reddit is the perfect place for them because those who want to read them can go the AMA sub Reddit and read them and those who don&#x27;t can ignore them. Then everyone is happy.<p>TBH I don&#x27;t really understand why you would want them on HN. Surely it&#x27;s better for those who like them for them to be on a sub Reddit. That way, when you fancy reading an AMA you can just go to the sub Reddit and browse AMA&#x27;s to your hearts content.')
