It&#x27;s intended that you&#x27;ll arrive by car, probably via the highway -- which is relatively easy whether you live in Cary, in downtown Raleigh, or somewhere else.<p>In my twenties, I remember attending a swing dance workshop in Durham. It was very well attended; the instructors had recently moved from San Francisco and had been pioneers in the swing dance community there.<p>At the time I didn&#x27;t understand how one could be riding high in San Francisco and want to leave. But people who relocate to Raleigh&#x2F;Durham often say that they move for the nice weather, for the low cost of living, for the fact that it offers a lot of culture while being fairly laid back.')
