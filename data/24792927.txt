This could be structured in a nuanced manner so that we respect pseudo-anonymity while also maintaining the integrity that real identity brings.<p>- A wholesale education of the populace, instead of an education by fear, of the power of anonymity and services which further anonymity.<p>- A move away from the advertising and services-exploitation business model. Not that we can&#x27;t have service oriented businesses, but those businesses cannot be exploiting people to do labor and a bottom line price.<p>- A data ownership model which establishes a monetary value for different types of data. We already do data classification inside mega-corps, and we&#x27;re able to establish and correlate it&#x27;s sensitivity. Extrapolating this to value would not be stretch. Users consent which data they give up in exchange for services. The price for the service is adjusted based on what data they give up, and how they choose it will be used (Data for marketing may be more valuable than say data for behavior research, or even vice versa!)')
