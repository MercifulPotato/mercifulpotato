In reality convenient very slow charging is what you really want. Cars spend 90%+ of their time parked. Connecting them to a common outlet at those times is more than enough for charging to be something you stop thinking about. Going to a gas station becomes a strange inconvenience you used to have to do. In a few cases you then go on a road trip and use a fast charger. What we actually have to build out is all that slow and simple infrastructure in city parking and other convenient places. The grid is already everywhere.<p>Losing all that convenience, 2&#x2F;3 of your energy, and having to build out a completely new fueling infrastructure to use hydrogen fuel cells just makes no sense.')
