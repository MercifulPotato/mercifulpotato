You can’t spend stocks, they don’t produce cash flow (ignoring dividends), and their value is what other’s are buying and selling it for.<p>Just as I can offer to sell my share for $10,000 despite it trading at $100, I can do the same with Bitcoin. There’s a reason some people call Bitcoin an “investment.”<p>Now, before anyone thinks I’m advocating Bitcoin, I’m not. I’m just pointing out the similarities to the stock market.')
