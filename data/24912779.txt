It&#x27;s mana for the internet.<p>It&#x27;s also a great way to create a sense of perspective for how pro-social (or not) the frightful five are. You would never see Microsoft, or Apple, or Google etc bother to support open protocols or work to flush them out so that events, photos, tweeting, and all the major social activities are put on a foundation of open and interoperable protocols that anyone can use. They certainly could have moved in that direction if they wanted to, but they just haven&#x27;t wanted to. And while I appreciate for framasoft for what they&#x27;re doing at face value, on an entirely different level I appreciate the contrast between their projects and the projects of the F5.')
