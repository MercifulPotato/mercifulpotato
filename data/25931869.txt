Both depict an imagined communist utopia in which everyone is flawless, that butts up against or sometimes interferes with other flawed societies.<p>For the most part Banks never writes a novel about the mainstream of Culture society because he admits in his own forewords and interviews that he can&#x27;t imagine it (because humans may even be incapable of imagining true utopia) and what he can imagine wouldn&#x27;t be a useful premise for the drama of a novel.<p>The novels are almost all entirely about exploring the flaws and the outskirts, the outsider perspectives on the Culture, the people that aren&#x27;t happy inside the Culture and are looking for adventure or to leave or to fix something they found was broken about the Culture or at least a small part of it.<p>The difference between optimism and pessimism is that even in trying to find flaws, exploring the outskirts and the possible problems in intermediate spaces, Banks doesn&#x27;t set out to tear down or destroy the Culture (though some of his unsuccessful protagonists may have that as a goal), but wonders how it enriches the Culture and how they would learn from their flaws&#x2F;mistakes&#x2F;imperfections, how they would use the loners and outcasts (as weapons, as players of games, as excuses and chances to grow and be better) that they don&#x27;t always see eye to eye with, culturally speaking, but tolerate in their own strange ways.<p>A lot of the same applies to Star Trek, though often less intentionally self-aware as the Culture (but the Culture also has the benefit of learning from Trek and its flaws&#x2F;mistakes). A lot of Star Trek is still a drama about how does a utopia confront its frontiers, its edges, its loners&#x2F;rebels&#x2F;outcasts, and most importantly its own flaws, and how does it use those conflicts to grow. (Even TNG&#x2F;Voyager despite most of the problems being resolved by the end of a single episode, still have many great episodes about how the Federation isn&#x27;t perfect&#x2F;has room to grow.)')
