Item(by='kommissar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605241635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25073255, text='&gt; We use Glue extensively, but we have a rule of thumb not to use any of the &#x27;special sauce&#x27;. That means is using it purely for &#x27;Spark as a service&#x27;<p>This is spot on IMO. I use Glue internally (opinions are my own) and still believe that the best course of action is Glue should only run managed Spark. We provide an empty Scala &quot;script&quot; that does nothing, and load a compiled JAR file with the Scala code that actually runs our job as a library and have Glue exec into that.<p>We can version the ETL in git,  run local tests outside of the Glue data plane, prototype in the Spark shell, and much more.')
