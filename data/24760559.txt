I had these conversations before when I was in my twenties and almost owned nothing (no car, tiny apartment without a garden). Now that I&#x27;m married and more settled I moved my preference a little bit more towards the &quot;paying for things I don&#x27;t use that much&quot;. My wife and I share a car and I have an electric bike (during the week my wife takes the car to work, I work from home). We have a guest bedroom which also acts as my office (when guests are here I work from the kitchen table). We don&#x27;t have a yard but will definitely make this a priority in our next home.<p>So the question really becomes: &quot;What percentage of idle time are you OK to have&quot;. You will always have &gt;0% idle time on anything on you own.<p>And if it&#x27;s truly about cost effectiveness: What&#x27;s stopping you from renting out your car&#x2F;room and to an extend even your yard (saw an app today where you can rent private pools)?')
