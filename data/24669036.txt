If you are looking for a quality picture there&#x27;s really no substitute for LG OLED. They are smart TVs but the features are unobtrusive and work well.<p>If you want extremely good picture quality and also insist on &quot;dumb&quot; the best you can get is a second-hand Pioneer or Panasonic plasma display. I don&#x27;t think any of these ever had &quot;smart&quot; anything, and their image quality is top notch.')
