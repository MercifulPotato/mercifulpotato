I plugged it into our network and went to my computer expecting to need to spend the next half hour setting it up on Linux.<p>It was just... there. Printed immediately with no fuss, including duplex.<p>But honestly, I got the Brother printer because HP ink cartridges are filled with DRM and I have no reason to think they won&#x27;t obsolete a cartridge model in order to force people to buy new printers. In fact it seems naive to think they won&#x27;t, even if they try they will inevitably have to discontinue things.')
