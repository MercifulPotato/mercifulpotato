If he sticks to that door, there is nothing that will ever change that 1&#x2F;N odds that it was the winner.<p>Downthread someone enumerated the cases, but again, they discard the 1&#x2F;3 of the cases where Monty ruined it. What that does is throw out half of the cases where contestant picked the wrong door and had the wrong strategy. Whether Monty ruined the surprise by showing the winning door or Monty got lucky and exposed a goat, that original door always has a 1&#x2F;3 probability of being the right one.')
