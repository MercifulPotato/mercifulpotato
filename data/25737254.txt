A lot of those were bought by people who wouldn&#x27;t have bought any bike this year or any year without the pandemic. So they were definitely not going to upgrade next year or whatever.<p>Some of those people are probably on bikes that don&#x27;t fit that great due to availability and they&#x27;ll be looking for better sizing as they get more into it.<p>And of course the majority probably won&#x27;t get super into cycling but again they weren&#x27;t going to either way so it&#x27;s not really a &quot;lost&quot; sale.<p>Plus I mean it&#x27;s kind of a running joke among bike people that you don&#x27;t really upgrade like it&#x27;s a piece of technology. You keep the old ones and just accumulate more as you go.')
