UBISoft has this already and I&#x27;ve signed up for 14.99. Right now it is only supported over Luna (Amazon&#x27;s streaming game service) but Stadia support is coming soon. For large studios this model makes a lot of sense. I would use it for EA Sports as well. I don&#x27;t need to &quot;own&quot; the game, but I do want to own a relationship with the publisher that will let me play their game anywhere. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how major consoles react to this where licensing doesn&#x27;t really let publishers give their own direct user&#x27;s access to titles on the console. I can see game streaming being a big win for publishers and a big loss for consoles which are essentally middle men.')
