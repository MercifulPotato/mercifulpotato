Chrome Apps didn&#x27;t feel like a standalone product to me, but a side-feature of others.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the &quot;were aquired&quot; status is that relevant - they&#x27;ve either evolved a lot from them or the basis was not <i>that</i> outstanding. Youtube maybe, since it also brought a userbase.<p>Google <i>does</i> seem to have a culture that overemphasizes new over iterating on old, which leads to things like the hilarious failure of their messaging products where they launch one new per year instead of having weight and effort behind 1-2 outstanding ones. And that despite messengers being a network effect product. Combined with that likely is the relatively weird business model compared to many other companies: Many products don&#x27;t make money directly, but only through ads or through binding people into the Google system (which will then show them ads). That likely (outsider perspective) makes discarding and launching products easier.')
