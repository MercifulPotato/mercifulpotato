I have multiple windows, tab groups, and extensions like TabSorter, The Great Suspender, Alfred Tab Search, and others to manage my tabs as a queue of things I want to read &#x2F; get back to. I use Pocket as well, but that&#x27;s for my queue of things I&#x27;ve already read that I want to archive, not things I want to read in the future.<p>I process a high volume of tabs but I keep it super organized, just like my filesystem and email.')
