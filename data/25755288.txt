Its really not that difficult. At least not compared to something like haskell or even something like python at times (are dictionary comprehensions actually that easy from a syntax POV? What about how copying a dictionary isn&#x27;t an element by element copy, but a reference&#x2F;ptr copy?)<p>Even with undefined behavior (which a newbie won&#x27;t really have to care about at the beginning IMO) C is relatively simple from a flow and structural point of view. If you are saying you can do cooler things in python than C at the beginning, that&#x27;s probably true, but its unclear how many people drop CS because the language they are using doesn&#x27;t enable easily making cool things.')
