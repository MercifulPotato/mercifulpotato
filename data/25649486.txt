The practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess; falseness.\n&gt; 2. An act or instance of such falseness.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;Hypocracy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;Hypocracy</a><p>It&#x27;s clearly _not_ hypocrisy by any normal definition of the word.<p>I mean, first of all EVs isn&#x27;t just about cutting CO2-emissions. Norway is very concerned about local pollution, and EVs is pretty superior there.<p>And Norway does not believe that they&#x27;re the good guys when it comes to CO2 emissions, at all. There&#x27;s a continuous debate about what to do about the oil&#x2F;gas production though, and there&#x27;s some pretty strong arguments that cutting oil&#x2F;gas would do nothing or even be damaging to global CO2 emissions. Cutting production will easily be offset by other countries with worse emissions in their production chain. Cutting off gas to Germany will either push them back to coal or to Russian gas. And most of those other countries are not investing as much of their oil profits in renewables and EV tech. I&#x27;m not sure I agree with this line of though, but it&#x27;s valid because it depends on knowledge of alternative futures that we just don&#x27;t know.<p>I mean if you think it&#x27;s hypocrisy you&#x27;re free to do so, but it&#x27;s not very productive. What action <i>should</i> Norway take to reduce the worlds CO2 emissions more than they are? The Norwegian green party wants to cut all oil&#x2F;gas production by 2035. Is that enough, or should they have cut everything already?')
