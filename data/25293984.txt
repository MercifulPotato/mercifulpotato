I definitely notice the difference with 60fps video and 120Hz+ monitors.<p>Additionally, another thing I&#x27;ve noticed in the last decade is the very badly PWM-frequency-tuned LED headlights on some cars. Those engineers selected the wrong LED brightness and tuned it to terrible frequencies which leave flicker-trails when you look at or away from them.<p>Get those PWM frequencies above 500Hz please! Especially get above 200Hz with your LED frequencies at the very least.')
