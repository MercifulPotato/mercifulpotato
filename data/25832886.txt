Just because any of the four combinations here exist, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re equally likely.<p>The error in reasoning such vaccination-autism policy advocate makes is: they correctly observe the possibility of unknown unknowns in vaccination, but then they incorrectly assume that a) they&#x27;re likely, significant and impactful, and b) they have to do with body&#x27;s reaction to the vaccine.<p>(Hell, arguably the primary unknown unknown in vaccination was the degree to which anti-vaccination memes will spread and prevent populations from being effectively protected.)<p>Additionally, the focus on this is itself a sign of immaturity. The adult answer here to note that various kinds of knowns&#x2F;unknowns exist, and then talk about how we can make turn unknowns into knowns, how to estimate the importance and impact of the unknowns, and how to deal with them if they happen.<p>&gt; <i>UFO-abduction policy advocate: (...)Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</i><p>Actually, absence of evidence <i>is</i> evidence of absence. If your hypothesis predicts something should happen, and it does not happen, it does count as evidence against your hypothesis.')
