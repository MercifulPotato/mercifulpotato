I personally don&#x27;t have a preference, it depends on the application. I think it&#x27;s obvious what are the advantages of static typing so let me rant about what is for me the main disadvantage: as soon as you have an advanced type system people will try to get creative writing code in the most abstract possible way. It&#x27;s inevitable. It&#x27;s the typed equivalent of premature optimization. Why restrict ourselves to implement matrix multiplication for floats? Why not rational numbers? Why not over arbitrary fields? This specially true when people write libraries. And yes, you can encode a lot of things in the type system but maybe it&#x27;s not such a great metalanguage when taken outside of the well known uses. It&#x27;s similar of how people get crazy with macros or even worse template metaprogramming.<p>I don&#x27;t use go so I don&#x27;t have an opinion if they made the right choice but I sympathize. I suppose you have to be Ken Thompson to not give a crap and say I&#x27;m going to create a language without support for generic programming in 2009. The closest thing would be a tenured professor but they wouldn&#x27;t dare unless under a pseudonym.')
