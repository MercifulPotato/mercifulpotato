The latest of what the Media Creation Tool gave me, anyway. Others said Win10 Home does not work anymore.<p>Ironically, I installed Win10 coming from Manjaro, which even on a T480s (probably one of <i>the</i> laptops to have for Linux compatibility) broke after every other update, so like twice a day. On the other hand, Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu has been too far behind on software versions for me. Both had terrible compatibility with my Thunderbolt 3 dock. Hopefully in the future, we will meet again!<p>Until then, it is ridiculous how much more Win10 Just Works.')
