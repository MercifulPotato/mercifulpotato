Item(by='jeofken', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609797963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638671, text='&gt; Your translation means &quot;coronavirus did not result in an increase in deaths in 2020&quot;<p>That’s simply a lie - you are deliberately taking the “yet” out and replacing “showing” with “result”, which indicates total certainty, from my translation. I am not editing comments earlier in this thread FYI, you know I translated it correctly. “Ännu” means “yet” and “visar” means “showing&#x2F;shows”. I encourage non-Scandinavians to Deepl translate it; language barriers don’t exist in our age due to machine translation.')
