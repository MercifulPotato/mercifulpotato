Problem with paper is that it&#x27;s not searchable, as I discovered to my cost trying to find some specific reference details for a job I did last year and am repeating today. My problems are probably more due to ad hoc disorganisation - particularly, sometimes going off-piste and making critical notes on random sheets of paper, away from my main notebooks.<p>I&#x27;d love some kind of e-paper solution, in a notebook form, but I&#x27;ve no idea how it could gracefully and capably mimic the act of turning pages and having a chrono-spacial awareness of where the content in each of those pages lie.<p>In some far future we&#x27;ll have paper-thin writeable electronic displays and can literally make a notebook to rule them all, but it&#x27;ll be a while. And even then, likely very expensive.')
