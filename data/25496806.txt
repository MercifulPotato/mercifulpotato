There&#x27;s nobody moderate left to help normalize their beliefs, so they keep drifting further and further right based on what Tucker Carlson tells them.<p>I have a very hard time socializing that that half of my family any more because they bring up politics <i>constantly</i> and their beliefs on race, healthcare, etc. are frankly embarrassing to be associated with. And I say this as somebody who is overall very moderate and willing to engage with both left and right-leaning beliefs.<p>Facebook made half of my family unbearable to deal with. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a unique situation by any means. So I&#x27;d say that they&#x27;re an awful awful cancer on society that needs to die.')
