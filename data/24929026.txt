It is just software... I would assume it would take OS vendors waaaay less money to implement foolproof protection against such attacks than it takes the victims to pay for data restoration.<p>Sure, storage use would go up, but is this even a problem? I would assume most files are write-once, and there could be sensible exceptions made for the files that update frequently.')
