It just means at the end of the day, you won’t benefit from dwelling on it and practicing seeking solutions instead is purely beneficial.<p>Once I separated the idea from the strict context of responses to what people did to me but anything the world could throw at me, be it bad weather or getting a great sleep or being given a gift or tripping myself down stairs, I realized it’s quite easy to apply and think about. It made a lot more sense without the loaded emotional, interpersonal context overlaid.<p>I figured I’d externalize this in case it helps anyone else, not trying to over-explain simple concepts to people :)')
