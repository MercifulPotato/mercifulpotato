Short of rolling tanks down the streets of cities and towns everywhere you&#x27;re not going to be able to enforce much. Even then, with tanks on the streets you have a very very bad situation on your hands. People in the US don&#x27;t like having liberties taken away without due process and representation. And by &quot;don&#x27;t like&quot; i mean will fight to the death over it.<p>Edit: also the federal government can&#x27;t just &quot;demand&quot; things of the states. That whole republic thing gets in the way there.')
