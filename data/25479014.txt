We actually cut someone open, then don&#x27;t fix him, risking all the complications associated with anesthesia, infections and so on ? For drugs it&#x27;s pretty easy to just give a fake pill containing nothing at all, you don&#x27;t actually decrease then chance of survival.<p>And how does that work when the technique significantly changes, as in &quot;in that case, do we cut above or below the knee&quot;. Again in the case of pills&#x2F;injections, it&#x27;s pretty easy to give everyone the impression they got all the same treatment, while in the of surgery you are pretty limited in that fashion.')
