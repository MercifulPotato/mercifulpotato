It can be scaled even more if needed. If you want to worry about business and not tech, forget about shiny things like JAMStack, HeadLess CMS etc. Play with them for hobby on the side but for real business, go with something tested like WooCommerce if that is an option for you.<p>Shopify can work too if you want to give them more control. Cost wise, I wouldn&#x27;t say WP&#x2F;WooCommerce will be cheaper necessarily because you have to factor in costs of servers, maintenance and most important: technical resource&#x2F;support as&#x2F;when needed.<p>However, WP will give you the ability to customize as needed\nWooCommerce is very written with an excellent plugin system (some 3rd party plugins can be costly but totally worth it in my opinion). Most importantly, WP and WooCommerce is all yours and you are not vendor locked in as in with Shopify.<p>WooCommerce = More Power, flexibility but more responsibility.')
