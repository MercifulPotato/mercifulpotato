If you are unfamiliar with that unit of measurement, it’s pretty much what it sounds like. It’s the amount of water needed to cover one acre of land in one foot of water and is equal to 325,850 gallons. It is standard in agriculture to measure water output to crops in inches and feet because this makes the calculations for water usage much easier.  For additional context, almonds use about 4 acre-feet of water per year and over the last ten years have generally been able to gross from a low end of $5000 an acre to upwards of $15000 depending on yield and price. Considering costs remain essentially fixed regardless of gross in almonds, this water price would therefore range from ruinous to fairly inconsequential.')
