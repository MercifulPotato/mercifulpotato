Data and network portability is important policy that must be passed as a means to &quot;vote&quot; of disapproval of governance by a platform by being able to easily move yourself off of it.<p>It&#x27;s naive to think that like-minded people won&#x27;t find an online place to rally, and then eventually rally in person when they feel necessary or are incited ton do so - in this case the ongoing coup attempt is based on lies. It&#x27;s a futile effort to try to suppress them, they will just gather elsewhere and the deplatforming will be a justification in their mind that they&#x27;re being persecuted, as the digital&#x2F;speech will inevitably manifest into the physical where the confrontation can&#x27;t be avoided.<p>I do see the deplatforming akin to parents attempting to teach a child their behaviour isn&#x27;t acceptable, the problem is these children aren&#x27;t understanding that - and they&#x27;re adults now without anyone reasonable that they look up to or listen to as a good role model; they&#x27;ve listened to Trump et al who are pushing the false narrative of election fraud, so they will feel justified in violent actions.')
