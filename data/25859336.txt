Item(by='stonesweep', descendants=None, kids=[25859452], score=None, time=1611240447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25859095, text='&gt; <i>Drawbacks over signal:</i><p>I&#x27;d like to add &quot;network effect&quot; to this, as I can draw a parallel to another failed attempt which made the same general mistake (placing a hurdle in front of newcomers). Google Plus.<p>When Google Plus hit the streets, Google had this stupid &quot;invite only&quot; system and it just became this huge thing within 24 hours to &quot;buy invites&quot; and so forth, people at that exact moment were ready and willing to try the new thing and were excited... then were hit with &quot;yeah sorry, you can&#x27;t sign up right now&quot; and walked away never to return. They <i>heard</i> about it on Facebook, <i>tried</i> to go give it a try, then hit the hurdle and stayed on Facebook. It&#x27;s my personal belief this initial step is what Google got wrong, all warts about the service aside. The first 48 hours was make or break, and they lost the momentum and never recovered.<p>Threema was the same to me - I heard about it years ago and read very positive reviews, however to even try it out I needed to spend money <i>and</i> convince a bunch of friends to spend money just to get the client and see what it was about. It may have been great! However if I couldn&#x27;t have a friend to chat with, it was of $0 value to me to even buy the client.  IMHO, this is the hole Threema now has to dig themselves out of - walled gardens with an initial adoption hurdle trigger a psychological &quot;nah, maybe later&quot; reaction out of many people.')
