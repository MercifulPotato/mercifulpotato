Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=[25146123], score=None, time=1605757199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145732, text='This system seems to only have an &quot;Apple secure mode&quot; of sorts, &amp; a gradient of less secure modes.<p>In contrast, in the regular PC ecosystem, there&#x27;s what seems like a reasonably effective user-empowering situation, SO FAR, where computers have been coming with UEFI Secure Boot[1] for over half a decade. I don&#x27;t fully understand what is required to generate secure boot images &amp; possible foibles or potential confounding factors, but it&#x27;s seemed like the base requirements[2] include the system advertising it&#x27;s core &quot;platform key&quot; &amp; allowing users to create their own securing keys based off this, to upload those keys, &amp; there-by allow user-signed images to boot, securely. One of the best guides to this all is the NSA&#x27;s[3].<p>The contrast is that Apple seemingly let&#x27;s one disarm the boot security system, where-as Secure Boot, so far, has allowed users to put the security system to work as they please.<p>Worth mentioning Chromebooks. I&#x27;m even less familiar with the particulars of their boot system, but they most-often have a &quot;developer mode&quot;[4], which disarms the OS protection mechanisms allowing one to install whatever onto the system. Fun fact, on Chromebox systems, this either is or was often achieved by opening the case &amp; removing a specific screw. Once developer mode is enabled, the system will at boot-up show an image notifying the user that the system is insecure, &amp; will boot unsigned code &amp; allow modification to the drive.<p>And worth mentioning Android! You the user almost never have power over your system. Once your device is no longer maintained, throw it away, because there&#x27;s nothing you can do to it &amp; in an unmaintained state it is almost certainly insecure. Maybe some intrepid hackers will have found some exploit to bypass the protection mechanisms, and maybe, maybe, you bought one of the probably &lt;1% of devices that still has an unlocked bootloader, and in these exceptional cases you can probably get your own well maintained OS like LineageOS on your device, but for most people, you have no control &amp; can do nothing to your device that is not approved, and the security system is very much designed to keep you out of your own device.<p>&gt; However without the specifications for the security chip, GPU, SoC - running anything on it is practically meaningless<p>I&#x27;m having similar thoughts about Microsoft&#x27;s recent announcement, that they have partnered with Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm to get their custom Pluton security chip[5] embedded in seemingly most major cpus going forward. Where-as Google begot an &quot;open source root of trust&quot; system based around the open hardware RISC-V chip[6]- something that can be inspected, checked out, &amp; deployed in new designs gratis- Microsoft seems to be relying on a high degree of trust in their systems &amp; engineering &amp; how that will ultimately empower and&#x2F;or exclude the user. This new silicon we expect almost literally everywhere comes at a time when Microsoft is about to make a critical requirement of many of the Secure Boot technologies that have been building[7], with a January 1st deadline for Secure Boot support.<p>Also worth pointing out some of the secure-boot related &quot;whoopsies&quot; that have happened[8][9], recently, &amp; further back.<p>Overall, all this flurry of activity around securing that&#x27;s happened so quickly has made me prsonally a little nervous, a bit on edge. Thusfar UEFI Secure Boot has seemed to continue to give the user respect, power over their system, &amp; been quite ahead of the pack in doing so. But it&#x27;s intimidating how much we are taking on faith, hoping that we continue to retain access. The glossy media-blitz PR of Pluton was ultra-light on technical details; that was intimidating. I want to believe the PC platform continues to be a place for open innovation &amp; where users have the power to maintain their systems &amp; keep control over them, if they want to do so, and in all likelihood Secure Boot and whatever Pluton ends up being probably will continue to help us in that. But it always feels like the keys could be snatched away, that someone could make some decision, &amp; PCs could close off, like so vary many other platforms.<p>Notably also, to my understanding, UEFI Secure Boot does not require users to be able to remove the systems signing keys, so Microsoft &amp; the manufacturer will retain access to the boot layer of your system no matter what. (I&#x27;m not sure about this.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Secure_boot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unified_Extensible_Firmware_In...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows-hardware&#x2F;design&#x2F;device-experiences&#x2F;oem-secure-boot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows-hardware&#x2F;design&#x2F;dev...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Sep&#x2F;15&#x2F;2002497594&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;0&#x2F;CTR-UEFI-Secure-Boot-Customization-UOO168873-20.PDF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Sep&#x2F;15&#x2F;2002497594&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;0&#x2F;CTR...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromiumos&#x2F;docs&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;developer_mode.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromiumos&#x2F;docs&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;d...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;meet-the-microsoft-pluton-processor-the-security-chip-designed-for-the-future-of-windows-pcs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;meet-the-...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;google-opentitan-secure-chip&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;google-opentitan-secure-ch...</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redmondmag.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;windows-server-hardware-security-requirements.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redmondmag.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;11&#x2F;windows-server-ha...</a><p>[8] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3528302&#x2F;the-mess-behind-microsoft-s-yanked-uefi-patch-kb-4524244.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;3528302&#x2F;the-mess-behin...</a><p>[9] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;microsoft-secure-boot-key-debacle-causes-security-panic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;microsoft-secure-boot-key-deba...</a>')
