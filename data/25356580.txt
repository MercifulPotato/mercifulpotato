You keep captions on the same page as their respective pictures using the same method you keep <i>all</i> lines of a paragraph on the same page: Keep with Next in Paragraph options. If a caption (or picture) still flows onto the next page, that is because it simply won&#x27;t fit into the page without resizing the picture or changing the page margins.')
