Don&#x27;t know too many people who actively like humidity at high temps. Some may not mind it. But those who hate it, like myself, just can&#x27;t stand it.<p>I generally hate most warm climates because they tend to be humid. LA was very nice. The nicest climate I&#x27;ve experienced so far. Haven&#x27;t been to Northern California though (I imagine it&#x27;s roughly the same but cooler, so may like it more).<p>[0] seems like the problem there is it gets much cooler at night, more intraday variation.')
