Most of the time your APIs will reflect your database associations `{ users { posts { comments } } }` which should be indexed anyway. Custom queries on top of that, like a search filter, can be indexed&#x2F;optimized individually. Resources can be paginated quite easily and you can also enforce a maximum depth when requesting associations, so that you don&#x27;t end up with requests too large to deliver.<p>The main problem with GraphQL comes from the many different ways you can use it, which makes caching or eager loading difficult.')
