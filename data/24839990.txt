I remember a key moment when firefox was bleeding users was when google decided that H264 would be the standard after switching for a while and mozilla having to run after it trying to get implementations going and then still having a laggy af experience on youtube and the like because the implementation google went with was proprietary.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m still puzzled why Moz haven&#x27;t tried a paid-for Firefox option.<p>and what functionality would the paid version of firefox have?\nChances are it would cause an outrage and user-loss due to cries that functionality would be premium only tbh.\nIt would also probably make not much of a dent in the budget.')
