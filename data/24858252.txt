It&#x27;s actually remarkable to me that the Brazilian government continues to add these taxes that, last I checked, were highest in the world.<p>The original justification was that it would spur domestic manufacture of computers, consoles, laptops, etc.<p>Obviously that hasn&#x27;t happened. All it&#x27;s done is make anything involving computing ridiculously expensive.<p>I truly don&#x27;t understand why there isn&#x27;t democratic pressure to repeal the insane import duties on electronics. It&#x27;s like most people in Brazil have just accepted that&#x27;s how domestic prices are without really questioning it. I don&#x27;t get it.')
