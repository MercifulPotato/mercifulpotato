Personally I made about $200-220k average during my 10-year career and lived on 30-40k while saving the rest and investing mostly in equities (of course taxes take a big chunk). Now I spend $50k-ish but I pay for everything for me and my fiance. I plan on spending $75kish once we have a family of four eventually which is the maximum level I&#x27;d feel comfortable spending with my current wealth. It wouldn&#x27;t cover all our wants but definitely most of them and all our needs, hence there is still <i>some</i> additional utility from growing wealth but not enough to justify the stress and anxiety of a career IMO')
