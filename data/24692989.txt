Just having a child in the car is distracting and puts others at risk, but we accept that.  And once the child is there, and it becomes a struggle to meet the schedule, then what?  Give them up?<p>Obviously this line of thought has devolved pretty far from the original point as someone who can afford a car with driver drowsiness detection can probably afford to make different choices. It&#x27;s just the idea that no one should ever drive when they have even a slight risk of falling asleep seems quite unrealistic, at least in the US.<p>Personally, I can find myself a bit tired by the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve never felt at risk of falling asleep while driving, but I&#x27;m human, so can&#x27;t say with certainty that it will never happen.  Maybe a driver aid will lull some into driving when they know they shouldn&#x27;t, but I still think it will be a net win (just like seat belts).')
