The problem QUIC tries to solve is that many of TCP&#x27;s design decisions were made in a different environment that the one we live today (eg. being able to switch between from 2 internet sources like Wi-Fi and mobile data while retaining connections).\nPlus, it integrates TLS in it to reduce protocol overhead.<p>IIRC even UDP isn&#x27;t ideal, the reason for choosing it over making a brand new protocol was to avoid network devices like routers dropping packets that they wouldn&#x27;t recognize.<p>WebSockets is just an abstraction over a reliable protocol (TCP), therefore, WebSockets could theoretically work over QUIC too.')
