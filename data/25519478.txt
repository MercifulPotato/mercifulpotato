It&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s used: many sites use it to render content, especially above-the-fold content (like image galleries, such as on ecommerce sites). Since much jQuery-based code waits for the DOM to finish loading first (e.g. with `$(function() { ... })`) [0], that means all the HTML has to finish being parsed and loaded first, jQuery has to be loaded, and then FINALLY you have scripts all firing at once in a frenzy rendering even more content. It&#x27;s a big issue and the solution is to avoid rendering content with jQuery when pages load.<p>Oh and a lot of sites load jQuery synchronously in the &lt;head&gt; tag, usually pointing to some external CDN. That means the browser stops parsing the HTML mid-way through the page load, resolves the CDN&#x27;s domain to IP, does a TLS handshake and establishes a connection to the CDN, waits to download the script, parses, runs it, and then proceeds on to the rest of the HTML. All because the developer(s) didn&#x27;t know about the script `defer` attribute[1].<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.jquery.com&#x2F;ready&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.jquery.com&#x2F;ready&#x2F;</a><p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;javascript.info&#x2F;script-async-defer#defer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;javascript.info&#x2F;script-async-defer#defer</a>')
