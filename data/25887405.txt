That saves a ton of cost and legal overhead which is otherwise very tedious.<p>That said, the interesting question this raises is, what happens when disagreements happen over those smart contracts? It seems like inevitably lawsuits and regulations will arrive, potentially removing the upside of using smart contracts.<p>This leaves me asking a couple questions. One, is the culture around “no reversable transactions!” a kind of defense mechanism against introducing legal overhead which could harm the value prop of crypto. Two, should legal overhead arrive, could the smart contracts still provide some value compared to old solutions?')
