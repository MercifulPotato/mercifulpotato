That work was just labour? 3 Generations ago you worked on the farm, or in the factory, or keeping the shop for meagre wages. In 1960 only about 8% went to university. In 1900 it was probably only 1%.<p>Literally we live in a world where people can be or do anything they want. This is <i>the first time in history</i> this was even thinkable.<p>&#x27;Having no prospects for retirement&#x27; ?? <i>Retirement</i> is a modern concept. 1.5 Generations ago you worked, retired and very quickly died! You lived a few years maybe and that was that. And there wasn&#x27;t much in the way of support, expectations, or even things to do. Government workers expected &#x27;full comp&#x27; in retirement because they only lived a few years. The notion has changed dramatically and it&#x27;s why our finances are so out of order. You do realize that &#x27;social security&#x27; is a very modern concept, right?<p>People are living literally &#x27;3rd lives&#x27; now, decades into retirement, and generally much more fulfilling.<p>&#x27;Healthcare&#x27;? We are only 2 generations into socialized medicine! Again, the fact most Westerners have access to great healthcare, most of their lives, means they are living at vastly higher standards of living than in any era.<p>My grandparents were born <i>on farms</i>, with <i>no plumbing or running water, and not electricity</i>. Taxes were extremely low, and most people didn&#x27;t go to high school (my grandmother did). There was no social security&#x2F;insurance&#x2F;retirement. There was no socialized medicine whatsoever. We were barely into having antibiotics. People worked hard and died at 65 from the large variety of ailments which we can now treat, push off, work around etc..<p>And finally - home ownership - again - a very new concept, only a couple of generations in. &#x27;Retail Banking&#x27; is a very modern convention to the point wherein &#x27;owning your own home&#x27; is really a &#x27;1st generation&#x27; concept even in parts of the Latin world. &#x27;Home ownership&#x27; was largely driven by &#x27;new world&#x27; ideals (US&#x2F;Canada) where the land was not spoken for - which was a major political idea.<p>&#x27;Social Isolation&#x27;? Try living on a farm, where there are \n almost no cars, and it takes 1&#x2F;2 day by train to get to the nearest 10 000 person population centre. We are materially less isolated than ever before.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt the <i>notion</i> of feeling isolated, but it&#x27;s almost as though we need to chose our words better, because whatever we mean when we say &#x27;isolation&#x27; it&#x27;s literally not that, but I agree it&#x27;s a growing problem. I suggest it&#x27;s a growing problem of people not participating in their own cultures.<p>Unconditionally, life is materially better. Whether life is better overall, that&#x27;s a hard thing to say, but we are undeniably &#x27;rich&#x27; as a class of people (anyone reading this). We have the gift of massive surplus and bounty, it&#x27;s now a matter of being able to socially make do with that.')
