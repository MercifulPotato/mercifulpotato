That will really stop US imports rapidly (just as it did for the last reserve currency country UK).<p>Ultimately, the only reason US capital flows elsewhere is because other countries need it and will accept it. If the need for it is cut off, other countries will happily trade in their currencies and US capital stays inside.<p>What is impossible is being the reserve currency and yet not wanting to be integrated with the world. It will quickly get replaced by anything else, and there are countries competing to replace it now.')
