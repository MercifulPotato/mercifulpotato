I&#x27;d guess (it may be time to hit primary sources?) that when he says &quot;high RWA&quot; he doesn&#x27;t mean as low as 110, either.<p>There are footnotes on pp.36-46 discussing the design of the scale. They include why he believes Adorno&#x27;s design was flawed (it gave high scores to people who simply agreed with every statement), as well as:<p>(p.43) &gt; &quot;What is a “high RWA”? When I am writing a scientific report of my research I call the 25% of a sample who scored highest on the RWA scale “High RWAs” with a capital-H. Similarly I call the 25% who scored lowest “Low RWAs,” and my computer runs wondrous statistical tests comparing Highs with Lows. But in this book where I’m describing results, not documenting them, I’ll use “high RWAs” more loosely to simply mean the people in a study who score relatively highly on the RWA scale, and “low RWAs” will mean those who score relatively low on the test.&quot;')
