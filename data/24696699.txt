The keyword really couldn&#x27;t leave that room except via the Echo. After a short time to my surprise I started seeing this in my Amazon. I have no doubt that the Echo is (at least occasionally) listening and sending information without any indication that it does.<p>My friends tested their own stuff in their household with their own keywords in much the same way that I did. Google Home, Apple Homepod&#x2F;Siri, Facebook, Microsoft Cortana. The only 2 people who saw their keyword pop up again were myself with Amazon and one other with Facebook.<p>I can&#x27;t draw the conclusion that Google does <i>not</i> do this, maybe they just do it smarter. But I can certainly say I cannot under any circumstances give Amazon the benefit of the doubt.')
