They want to mix up naked margin accounts where your broker gives you a loan of money to trade with, with the types of margin accounts used by WSB peeps, where the margin is only to cover the 2 day settlement window or the time it takes a deposit to transfer, ie: <i>covered</i> margins.<p>My counter point: I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to parentalise retail investors with a holier than thou attitude that is driving half of the spite from these investors.<p>The soundbite is that they have to protect the poor whittle retail investor from scam stocks, but the effect is and will always be to lock off higher gain opportunities to institutional investors and away from poorer investors.<p>Don&#x27;t buy it.')
