But the majority of it I re-researched for making this page in the last week or so.<p>I&#x27;m keeping some of those older projects up despite their age and development status as I think they&#x27;re still useful tools, though I haven&#x27;t used everything on the page personally so I could be wrong.<p>There&#x27;s also a ton of projects and links I didn&#x27;t include because I thought the learning curve was too high to be of use to anyone but the people that wrote the code to begin with or because the art they make is just sorta ugly (The guide is opinionated after all)<p>Some of the other livecode projects and tools I found along the way wound up in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opinionatedguide.github.io#&#x2F;Music&#x2F;m8-musicsoft" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opinionatedguide.github.io#&#x2F;Music&#x2F;m8-musicsoft</a> but I haven&#x27;t really done anything but drop links into that page yet.')
