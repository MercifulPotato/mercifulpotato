Item(by='microtherion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607555699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25365824, text='The US has a very high standard for &quot;defamation&quot; against &quot;public figures&quot; and a very low barrier to be considered a &quot;public figure&quot;. By US standards, the diver was a &quot;public figure&quot;, and Musk&#x27;s insulting comment was not defamation, because it was hyperbolic (comparable to when Hustler Magazine published a fake ad about Jerry Falwell having sex with his mother in an outhouse).<p>Bottom line is that it&#x27;s very hard to win defamation cases in the US. The Tesla engineer might have a shot because she was not well known, and Tesla accused her of very specific acts (moonlighting, unapproved travel) and they <i>knew</i> those accusations to be false. On the other hand, these were not exactly crimes, so who knows.')
