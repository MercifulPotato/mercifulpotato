Why does GTK keep breaking backward compatibility?<p>I understand breaking backwards compatibility a first time, maybe out of a failure to plan ahead,  but not multiple times.<p>It would be easy enough to add new subroutines to add more functionality. Is there a reason to change or remove old subroutines of which Iâ€™m not aware? Otherwise this is just causing extra work for application developers for no good reason and in many cases killing old stable applications which are no longer developed.')
