Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=[24747420], score=None, time=1602436295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746743, text='&gt; A product about optimizing products, followed by a series of blog posts about making such product, making-of videos, and finally an ebook telling you everything about the launch of the product and how you can apply that to your products (hopefully real). Arenâ€™t we all tired of these marketing treadmills?<p>This actually reminds me a lot of the way pyramid&#x2F;MLM schemes worked back in the 90s (and probably still work now). I got briefly snared by one of these things as a kid, and the materials were certainly of high perceived quality (nicely bound, etc.), but it didn&#x27;t take long to figure out that the whole thing was about selling the thing you were being sold. Similarly a massive proportion of Amway&#x27;s revenue, and the revenue of successful Amway members comes from the sale of materials and seminars related to building your &quot;business&quot;. The household products themselves are very much a sideshow.<p>All these deeply meta, self-referential product optimization products have a similar - slightly grubby - feel to them. Old ideas repackaged as new. I mean, I suppose fair enough if you can make a living out of it and you&#x27;re not actually scamming anyone, but how many of these damn things does the world really need?')
