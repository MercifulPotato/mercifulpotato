I think there&#x27;s a huge domain of experiences that engineers bring with them.<p>However, I also see some wisdom here. I still don&#x27;t full agree with it, but I see some sense too. These are core skills for an undergraduate Computer Science degree. They represent the bulk of our abstract knowledge of how to compute well, how to think about &amp; break down problems. Without proficiency here, a coder risks creating potentially dangerously inefficient solutions, that, at Facebook&#x27;s scale, may well literally cost the company millions of dollars in server costs, or which could make the difference between a successful on-time positive-PR roll-out, &amp; a failed highly-negative public-relations roll-out.<p>That you can gain this knowledge in a couple of months is fairly remarkable in &amp; of itself. Most engineering domains have a much broader swarth of core knowledge. Computer science literally has algorithms.')
