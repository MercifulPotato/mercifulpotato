Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=[25660260], score=None, time=1609954632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658485, text='&gt;the insurance company&#x27;s own MDs are only there to provide legitimacy to the initial denial.<p>I have first hand knowledge that this is false.  Especially if the insurer is just acting as an administrator for a state Medicaid or federal Medicare or other payer, since there are big penalties for denying coverage just to save money.  The insurers even have MDs and PharmDs to audit their own MDs and PharmDs to see if they are appropriately approving or denying treatment.<p>A lot of the problem is probably coming from lack of proper EMR and supporting documentation justifying treatment, and subjectivity in justifying treatment because there are many gray areas.<p>This same approval denial situation happens under taxpayer funded healthcare also, since no one has unlimited resources.  But yes, the US implementation of it with myriad payers and rules certainly makes for an unpleasant experience and results in subpar healthcare.')
