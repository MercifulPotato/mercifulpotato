I never understood this at the time, and largely blame that on a popular ARM Assembly Language book I had that said that LDM&#x2F;STM were just convenience instructions, essentially syntactic sugar.  They most certainly were not.  With the right alignment and using enough registers you could get 2-3x the throughput of using single word load&#x2F;stores.  I honestly think if that book hadn&#x27;t gotten it so wrong there would have been a lot more decent games for the Archimedes machines.')
