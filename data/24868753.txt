Unless you are aguing for it being an established fact that the time evolution took to produce intelligent life rules out any form of reinforcement learning producing AI in any remotely reasonable period of time, then that original point of yours does not seem to be going anywhere.<p>In your work on theorem proving, am I right in guessing that there are no &#x27;ifs&#x27; or &#x27;buts&#x27; because the truth of premises is not an issue? In the &quot;evolution argument&quot;, the premises&#x2F;lemmas are not just that evolution took a long time, but also something along the lines of significant speedup not being possible.<p>You might notice that in another comment, I suggested that we might still be in the AI Cambrian. I&#x27;m not being inconsistent, as no-one knows for sure one way or the other.')
