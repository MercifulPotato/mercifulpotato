In that, they packed a full windowing interface (menus, overlapping windows, multiple fonts, text edit fields, buttons, radio &amp; check boxes, etc).  Also a 2D graphics engine (including bitblit with modes), a file manager, a resource manager, a printer drivers, network support, etc, etc.  All for the price of a higher end PC of the day.  Most of what we consider a &quot;real GUI&quot; was included in the Mac&#x27;s OS if a bit rudimentary.<p>To give you an idea how tight that is, 64KB (code in ROM) is just 12 paper pages (60 lines of 80 columns) of text.  Yes, some of the code had to be stored on a boot floppy disk, but still.  To say it was an amazing piece of software engineering is, IMO, an understatement.<p>When I saw my first Mac at the university store it was like seeing the future.
