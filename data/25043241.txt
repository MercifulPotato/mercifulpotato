I&#x27;m a 1L at an American law school that&#x27;s doing entirely unproctored exams. I didn&#x27;t come to the state with any connections, nor am I friends with any upperclassmen. I already know I&#x27;m going to get fucking annihilated by people who are cheating with their 2L&#x2F;3L buddies, because there&#x27;s literally zero risk of getting caught. \nIn light of how heavily your 1L grades affect your career prospects, it seems insane that they&#x27;re going to basically sort people by their performance on unproctored take-home exams with no integrity whatsoever.')
