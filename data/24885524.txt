Unfortunately he cannot teach us anything usable, because he had to follow the official curriculum. Which was about demand and supply theory and economics importance to the modern society. All theoretical stuff without any practical use. The other thing was that I was living in post-communist country, where people generally disregarded entrepreneurship. Everyone that has money was think of as a criminal or a person that takes bribes.<p>When I was attending university, my economy knowledge was very low.
