It depends upon your requirements for accuracy and responsiveness for alarms, threshold checks, etc.  I work with paper making machines that only give us a profile every 30 seconds--but that profile is a thousand floats, and we need to be constantly resampling it both spatially and temporally, and we&#x27;re doing that for tens or hundreds of profiles for a single system--and we&#x27;re supposed to handle hundreds of systems.<p>The more fundamental point that the GP is making is that the realm of industrial sensor data scales in ways that people haven&#x27;t really grasped yet.  It&#x27;s much less about brute storage than it is about the interplay between bandwidth, storage, and concurrent processing power.')
