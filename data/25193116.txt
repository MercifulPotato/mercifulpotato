Item(by='zamadatix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606173659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25192793, text='The thing I hate about recommendations on the homepage is clicking one 30 second funny video from a friend results in clicking &quot;not interested&quot; in 30 videos on the homepage to stop them from being recommended. Similarly, even if you use a different account, if you watch something you like and the algorithm decides it&#x27;s more related to some other topic you don&#x27;t like or thing you have no interest in it also floods the recommendations with this &quot;fresh&quot; topic you&#x27;re &quot;interested&quot; in simply because you liked a video it misclassified.<p>Much like the author I have no problems finding &quot;decent&quot; content from traditional wide audience channels like Tom Scott, Veritasium, Numberphile, Siggraph, etc it&#x27;s trying to find that 1 video out of the full homepage of recommendations that&#x27;s not mainstream but actually &quot;very good&quot; and in depth that ends up eating more time than watching the videos - followed by a refresh to apply all of the &quot;not interested&quot;s I added to try to steer away from certain content. Definitely going to try this repo when I get home.')
