ACH can take days before you can be sure things won&#x27;t be reversed, trades take two days to settle, there&#x27;s various anti-money-laundering policies everywhere that generally take the form of holding on to money for a bit to make shady things easier to track and detect.<p>So, anyway, for lots of reasons, things that users think should be instant, aren&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s really bad UX, especially for a platform that depends so much on emotional stuff: &quot;deposit $200 bucks and buy 3 shares of X, leaving you with a $30 cash deposit which RH can then earn interest on&quot; is probably how a large amount of RH&#x27;s balances come into being. That breaks if it&#x27;s going to be a 1-day gap between someone depositing their money and then buying the shares.<p>So everyone papers over holes like this with margin.')
