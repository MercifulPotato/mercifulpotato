In school we also had those silicon mask things to hide which keys were which in order to learn &quot;home row&quot; and all that.<p>These days though, I&#x27;ve memorized the positions of all of the keys, so while I _mostly_ use my index fingers to type, I also will switch to thumbs or other fingers on occasion depending on the keyboard. I rarely if ever look at the keyboard.<p>So it&#x27;s almost like I use a combination of touch typing with pecking. Works well enough for me and my WPM isn&#x27;t bad, either.')
