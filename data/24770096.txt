In fact in that specific example, they&#x27;re ahead of the curve, DOTS is really a rethinking of architecture that no middleware type game engine has tackled yet.<p>And look at HDRP, it&#x27;s landing right as Unreal also releases their first major graphical shake up in half a decade next year with Unreal 5.<p>Do you even know what &quot;the curve&quot; is for middleware game engines? It honestly sounds like you don&#x27;t<p>&gt; All I&#x27;m asking from Unity and its evangelists is honesty: you either have ready to use features or you don&#x27;t. Putting all the good stuff that you&#x27;re advertising behind a &quot;preview&quot; label and claiming it&#x27;s the customer&#x27;s responsibility when it doesn&#x27;t work well is not ok.<p>That&#x27;s how things work when you don&#x27;t care about your relationship with developers. I feel like some devs just don&#x27;t know what good software practices look like when I read stuff like this.<p>I mean abject <i>insanity</i> to find someone complaining a company is putting things out, make it <i>very</i> clear that they&#x27;re in progress, not even letting you use them without changing settings! and then <i>gasp</i> replying to developer feedback?!<p>Incorporating that feedback into their roadmap even though landing multi-year projects is already hard enough with just internal input?!<p>After all it&#x27;s not like Unity is dangling carrots here, even these preview packages are getting treated with the same rigor that normal ones do in relationship to bugfixing, and they are always cognizant of the fact that even preview packages have users if you actually look at their conversations in the forums<p>-<p>What you seem to be missing is Unity would still be a top engine if they never mentioned another preview package again. But it&#x27;d be a worse product.<p>Taking external input? Constantly cleaning up your work to put it over the fence? Having it end-user ready years before completion? That&#x27;s a lot of work.<p>Unity features would be less work for them if they didn&#x27;t do that.<p>But the features would have come out after spending a bunch of time in that state are better for everyone involved.<p>This all started with people whining about breaking changes, you think breaking changes would be better or worse if they weren&#x27;t happening incrementally with real users in preview?')
