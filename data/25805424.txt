We might at best have essentially a space station on Mars in 60 years, but a self sustaining colony that wouldn&#x27;t die off 2 years after something catastrophic happening to the Earth is far beyond our current engineering, much farther than any advance in the last 60 years.<p>Not to mention, for any plausible catastrophe happening to the Earth apart from a gamma ray burst, the Earth will still be much, much more habitable than Mars. So even if you are motivated by survival of the species, trying to build a colony on Mars before having a huge array of self-sustaining underground habitats on Earth is putting the cart way ahead of the horse. You&#x27;d even get the first-hand experience needed to actually have any hope of building something like this on Mars.')
