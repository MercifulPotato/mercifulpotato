I read it and thought, hey, this one would be good to share with a few project managers &amp; business unit managers. Any time people who are not programmers (especially ones we have to work with) start to better understand what we&#x27;re really doing, it is a good thing. Articles like this are superb for helping them understand that developers do have a disciplined and rigorous way of solving problems.<p>I do agree with you that these articles do leave a lot of detail and precision out. They tend to give the reader a superficial understanding of the subject... but a superficial understanding may be enough to help.')
