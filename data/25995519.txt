People want others to enjoy what they enjoy. It&#x27;s great to share recipes! I know that ordering American food in another country will not get me what I expect... and that&#x27;s totally fine. The adaptation might not appeal to my tastes, but that doesn&#x27;t make it bad. It doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not allowed to call it American food.')
