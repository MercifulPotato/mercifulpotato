That&#x27;s how I tend to look at projects like Gemini and Gopherspace necromancy. It&#x27;s something a little bit different, a little bit cool, not subject to Eternal September, and just technical enough to scare all the suits away because the suits already have the web.<p>If any of these projects have any amount of commercial success, then yes, we likely would see something like what happened with the commercialization of the web happen all over again. In the mean time, it&#x27;s a place to put stuff that a small niche of likeminded people might discover and read and maybe experience a little bit of that early magic of the early web themselves. You could just have a website and a blog, or you can have a gopherspace and a... uh, glog? Splog? I&#x27;ll leave that one for someone else to figure out. But more importantly, you can do so without someone trying to run remote code in a client on your machine in a standard language that for some reason, every client in the world thought it was a good idea to incorporate an interpreter for.')
