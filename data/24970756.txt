Its always handled through an operations team. The cloud definitely simplifies the operations team&#x27;s job, and you may be able to get something more specific faster than whatever gray box the IT Of Years Past has available, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting around the Cloud Boilerplate of worrying about IAM, CloudFormation&#x2F;IaC, repeatability, security, granting access, cleaning up...<p>I think this position is missing the bigger picture; it shouldn&#x27;t matter where you&#x27;ve got something deployed. That&#x27;s the Operations Team&#x27;s problem. Instead, we need to talk about, lets call them, Functional Primitives. For example: If you want a docker image deployed w&#x2F; x vCPU y memory z replicas etc, behind a URL. That&#x27;s a functional primitive. It shouldn&#x27;t matter whether its in ECS or in Kubernetes in the closet or wherever. That&#x27;s on the operations team, and its also on them to get that provisioned quickly for you.<p>In other words, you&#x27;re still thinking that its the operations team&#x27;s job to provide servers, so of course the quickest way to get a server is the Cloud. But that should not be their role; their role should be to provide capacity at a higher level of abstraction.')
