So basically the opinions, social standing, and claims of the entity requesting the warrant are irrelevant. Only the actual evidence should be considered by a judge when granting a &quot;right to wantonly kill&quot; because that&#x27;s exactly what a warrant is at the end of the day. It should be taken very seriously, and unfortunately, it&#x27;s not.')
