Maybe they lost their reputation in this pandemic but before that I remember them being pretty reputable.<p>And perhaps you missed it but I said:<p>&gt; they were also attacked by fact checkers who cited these experts on TV.<p>I never said experts themselves attacked anyone. I said fact checkers attacked people using these experts. The most famous one is of course Dr. Fauci. His famous video was used by news anchors, fact checkers and most people on social media. And most of the fact checking was going on platforms like Twitter and reddit. And searching for months old comments on those platforms is very difficult.<p>Update: It is impossible. Reddit search results won&#x27;t even sort by time. Most search results are cluttered by recent posts.')
