Further, it&#x27;s easy for a wealthy person to mask doing nothing with appearing busy yet effectively being a socialite.<p>&gt; There is a different situation when the successor generation multiplies the wealth, but that already takes some effort and good judgment.<p>It may take good judgement, but not much effort.  VTSAX and chill, as the kids say.<p>I grew up around the kids of very wealthy people, often multi-generational wealth.  Most decided to have jobs.  Some had very impressive careers, but when you realize that first opportunity was only because of a parental connection, suddenly it seems a bit hollow.  It&#x27;s not hard to appear wise and smart when you&#x27;re wealthy, and then you can simply not fuck up and the rest of the pyramid keeps chugging along.<p>Case in point, Trump.  He <i>is</i> a lazy fuck-up, but somehow managed to appear &quot;successful&quot; to a large portion of America.')
