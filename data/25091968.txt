I remember the user flows being a bit clunky, which certainly didn’t help.<p>With OpenID, basically everyone used a third party ID provider, and so you were just as dependent on that provider as with OAuth. Did you actually self host OpenID? If so, that’s a lot to ask of each person in the world. If you didn’t self host OpenID, I don’t think you had much “control of your online credentials or identity.”<p>If OAuth was never meant for signing in, then putting Auth in the name was a funny choice. You add the qualifier “websites who just want your mail or something”, but I’ve never seen a single mailing list sign up that used OAuth.')
