With that amount of production breaking bugs that haven&#x27;t been resolved for years, it might as well be unmaintained.<p>Redland has last been updated years ago. Sure there&#x27;s software that&#x27;s finished, but with the complexity of RDF, OWL and friends, my hypothesis would be &quot;it&#x27;s dead Jim&quot;.<p>I haven&#x27;t used dotNetRDF, but it looks okay at first glance.\nSo at least you can do semantic web on windows...<p>YES! THEY&#x27;VE BEEN TESTED FOR 20+ YEARS AND ARE STILL HALVE BAKED, BUG RIDDEN, REASEARCH PROJECTS. MY POINT EXACTLY.\nThese are all smart, dedicated people. The semantic web ecosystem is too complex to get right, no matter how many hours and $$$ you throw at it.<p>I have nothing to gain from talking about the shortcomings of RDF and it&#x27;s related standards, except maybe inspire people to come up with something better, and to save themselves some pain and suffering.<p>The pot calling the cattle black.
