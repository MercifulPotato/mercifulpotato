The original goal of IQ testing was to predict which students needed special care. It is still very useful (albeit expensive) metric for that.<p>I just mentioned wealth here just to demonstrate that just because something correlates and predicts something, it doesnâ€™t make it interesting. We know how wealth is inherited, and how people of wealth are privileged and generally more successful (at least if we measure success the same way as IQ proponents do). We know the mechanics of how wealth works and we know it is more societal then psychological. I took wealth as an example here just to weather the possibility the IQ is correlated and has this predictive power because of similar mechanics, i.e. not descriptive of psychology, but society.')
