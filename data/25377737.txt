That&#x27;s almost always the wrong action.<p>A better option would be to automatically reduce the budget by the amount it would cost to keep the storage forever. If doing that would reduce the budget to zero, do not allow increasing the amount of storage. That is: assume the storage will not be deleted, and budget according to that.')
