People sometimes want a change for change&#x27;s sake. If you think you&#x27;re happier using Ruby well that&#x27;s a good enough reason to seriously consider it. Outside of machine learning I can&#x27;t really see any objective advantage one has over the other. Both are super mature, expressive, dynamic languages. The rest is a matter of taste. Jobs wise I&#x27;m sure Python has an avdantage, but Ruby has some strong niches (web development, devops) that are always in high demand as well.')
