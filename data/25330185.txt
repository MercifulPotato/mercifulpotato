If you&#x27;re in the content creation business, you&#x27;re good to go [1].</i><p>I am definitely going to differ on that. My last job (until this summer) was in Hollywood for a content creation company (live broadcast + streaming) and I worked very heavily with the content creation guys and the digital production team (as a result of working on them for R&amp;D tax credit documentation purposes. That means I not only saw every expense, I also documented the <i>reasons</i> for all of those expenses based on discussions with the teams). We switched off Apple software 4 years ago. They began the transition off Apple hardware 2 years ago. Apple <i>was</i> great for content creation a long time ago, but these days content creators use *nix based systems if they need performance and Windows-based systems if they care about costs. If you suggest using Apple to the content creation guys these days, they&#x27;ll laugh your ass out of the room and tell you to go back to film school.')
