I guess in principle the translation could be read independently, ignoring the original (and that&#x27;s what it seems you&#x27;re saying you did), but just from the format of the Loeb books I&#x27;ve always thought of the translation as some sort of helper&#x2F;guide best consumed along with the source text.')
