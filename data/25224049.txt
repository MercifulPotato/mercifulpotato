There is no absolute sense of middle C or whatever. It is relative to the tuning of the drone<p>European music actually was largely relative too until keyboard instruments (organs and later pianos) became common and popular which forced standardizaton. In North Indian classical, you can see the popularity of the harmonium in recent years driving a similar effect.<p>Singers in popular western music often transpose scales freely. Many live performers tune half down or full down vs. their studio recordings and many singers transpose their songs down as they age.<p>&gt; I find the construction of these musical scales (correct me if I am wrong but there is no analog in western classical music of what a raga is) very interesting. Going up in the scale is different than going down and there are some key phrases that identify a raga.<p>Yes-ish. If you look at the scales in different &quot;modes&quot; of western music, you&#x27;ll find they do correspond to foundational ragas in Indian classical music (eg. Ionian = Shankarabaranam, Aeolian = Nata Bhairavi, Mixolydian = Harikamboji etc) . The core raga in Carnatic classical \n(maya-mayava-gowla) has the same notes as the double harmonic scale (think Misirlou from Pulp Fiction). The ragas with different notes going up and down or having fewer than 7 notes are considered derived or synthetic ragas and some artists still create new ragas.<p>However, as you correctly recognise ragas are not themselves scales. It&#x27;s more correct to think of ragas as frameworks to present and improvise on scales. There is a concept of &quot;pakad&quot; for example as it&#x27;s called in Hindustani classical which is a characteristic sequence of notes for a raga etc.  This is easiest to spot and understand this if you listen to recordings by top artists in Raga Jog - it comes in the avarohana (descending notes).<p>&gt; Then its all about interpretation.<p>&quot;Freedom within a framework&quot; is how I&#x27;d best describe it. A typical Hindustani &quot;Khayal&quot; (literally meaning &quot;thought&quot;) concert begins with a heavily improvised &quot;Aalap&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Jod&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Jhala&quot; section that presents the main raga followed by the main composition (&quot;bandish&quot;) in which also the artist improvises to a certain extent. After this main presentation, the artist typically presents other compositions in other ragas (with some improvisation) often ending with a &quot;bhajan&quot; (simple devotional song).<p>A Carnatic classical concert often starts with smaller compositions and has the main piece in the middle which also has &quot;Aalapanai&quot; and composition sections. Usually the &quot;aalap&quot; is shorter and more improvisation happens within compositions vs. Hindustani.<p>The closest analogies to this style of performance in Western music is Blues and Jazz.')
