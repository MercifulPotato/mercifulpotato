This means that for many (most?) proteins, the amino acid chain sequence is different from what you would predict from the DNA. These modifications are dependent on the state of the cell at the time of translation, and so cannot be predicted from the DNA alone. Even with a 100% accurate folding model, we cannot simply know the shapes of all the proteins inside the human body based on the genome.')
