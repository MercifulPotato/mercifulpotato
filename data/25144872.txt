Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605746940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144789, text='The novel of &quot;The Abyss&quot; gives you more character motivation for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio&#x27;s character Lindsey Brigman who designed the deep sea oil platform. You obviously won&#x27;t have time to do that in a movie, suppose you shoot twenty minutes of a plausible 10-year old Lindsey having formative experiences as a little girl, when you&#x27;re cutting you will leave every frame of that on the floor to keep more of the incredibly expensive underwater shoot, or the incredibly expensive CG, or the action. So it makes no sense to even shoot it.<p>So I liked that, because I feel the movie does leave her under-motivated as it stands.<p>But the film is pretty amazing, I just think it benefits from the book existing to explain Lindsey better.')
