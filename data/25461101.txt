That said, I don&#x27;t think we know this 100%.  Sure, we have mapped essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients enough to know what keeps an organism alive, but there may be other things gained by consuming, say, minimally processed cellular material.<p>Again, on the other hand, some foods require processing to extract necessary nutrients(i.e. nixtamalization of corn).')
