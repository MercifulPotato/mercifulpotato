I’ve been here now over a decade and have settled with work and family life.<p>Work life balance is great, there’s a beautiful outdoors to enjoy all year, and the people are warm and kind, if not difficult to start with.<p>All that said, there’s a lot of bullshit and hot air here in this thread:<p>- public healthcare is great until you have something difficult to work with or non acute. Enjoy the months longs waiting times to see a dentist.<p>- Yes, you can get by speaking English but your kid and partner might not. The tech industry employs foreigners here but there are countless people I know and hear of who end up here outside of the tech or sciences industry and cannot get work due to the language. Furthermore, don’t expect the same opportunities provided to Finnish speakers as you won’t get half the jobs at least. I work for an IT consultancy and only about 10-20% of client roles are available to me within the company.<p>- Winter here is shit nowadays. It used to be cold and snowy. Now it’s just like slushy and miserable<p>- Not all your services will be available in English. I have English banking for example but their department is slow and difficult to work with. Same with phoning utility services etc.<p>- Yes the language is hard but the main problem is finding time to learn it. Trust me, you don’t want to spend your free time doing it or you’ll just work and study and not enjoy the lifestyle here.<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love this place but look through the marketing and try and get some real experiences before you uproot your whole life.
