I was working on a blockchain startup, and found it difficult to meet like-minded people. To solve this, I started hosting offline meetups for startup founders.<p>Since last year, we moved everything online and I’ve made it my goal to connect as many entrepreneurs as possible. The reason: I find that there’s so much value in accountability and sharing experiences. To this end, I’ve created a member database (WordPress + some custom development), memberships (through Stripe), and Slack community.<p>We currently provide a variety of tools&#x2F;services such as mentors, startup deals, weekly Q&amp;As with experts, feedback sessions, mastermind groups, and more. The community consists of about 45 people from the Netherlands, UK, Romania, Czech Republic, etc.<p>Let me know what you think - I appreciate any questions or feedback!')
