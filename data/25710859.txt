I was really talking about trust.<p>And much of that trust is that the dollar is that the price is the same from day to day for the most part.  Sure there&#x27;s inflation, but if I own $1M I don&#x27;t expect it to be worth 10% of that tomorrow.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s also no guarantee the dollar will remain the reserve currency, as China, Russia and others...<p>So, would you really really trust Russia and China with their currency?  Where the hell is Jack Ma?  Huh?')
