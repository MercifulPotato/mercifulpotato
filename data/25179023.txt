The thesis &quot;mammals are unique&quot; could just as easily be antithesized by the chosen evidence.<p>This taxonomical difficulty has always fascinated me. I give biologists the benefit of the doubt that they have solid evidence for their categorization but in the back of my mind I&#x27;ve always been curious about this. Why would these unique features exist in other lineages? Perhaps the space of diversity in behaviors is smallish to the point that random overlap occurs? Maybe it&#x27;s purely definitional and the actual behaviors are distinct between say mammals and birds?<p>Or maybe my problem is that I failed my 7th grade taxonomy exam catastrophically and have never quite gotten over that :)')
