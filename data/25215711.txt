A horrid mess of an Eclipse-plugin that drew boxes with arrows between them, where &quot;standard plugins&quot; etc. could be plugged in to transform data and move it from here to there. The problem Mule solved (in our case) was comical, the complexity of the solution was also comical, or tragic; or maybe it was both.')
