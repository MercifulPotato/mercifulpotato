That&#x27;s also how I saw how many scoops he&#x27;s been given by them (because if they were actual leaks I&#x27;m <i>sure</i> he would have been cut off by now, knowing Apple&#x27;s secrecy). But I don&#x27;t remember him being this lyrical about Apple as he is here.<p>However I used to be an Apple fan and Mac used to be my daily driver (even though I&#x27;ve always been an &quot;every OS at the same time&quot; guy). But my enthusiasm has reduced a lot lately due to the higher lock-in, and &#x27;iPadification&#x27; of the Mac. Especially due to stronger ties with Apple services: As an &quot;every OS&quot; guy this doesn&#x27;t work for me obviously. Basically it is getting decidedly harder to use Apple stuff well if you don&#x27;t want to do things exactly &quot;the Apple way&quot;. The Mac didn&#x27;t use to be like that. It was more like a general unixy OS that wasn&#x27;t so opinionated.<p>So, as my opinion has changed it is possible his admiration for Apple is irking me more than before :) Sorry if I offended by calling him a shill. But he adopts Apple&#x27;s flowery language filled with superlatives as if their products are some kind of magic inconceivable to their competitors. That rubs me the wrong way as I do consider the world outside Apple which is not bad at all.')
