Apex clearing, which clears for virtually every other new age trading platform (and back in the day RH) also halted these stocks.<p>I&#x27;m not sure of the biz aspect of this, but given the criticism RH historically got for pay-for-flow schemes (even while they were using Apex) I would assume it was RH which got the market-flow kickbacks - not Apex. So it&#x27;s safe to assume that&#x27;s how it still works today.\nYet, Apex also halted orders for these tickers. This goes to show you the very real risk these types of retail clearing companies are facing in this market. So, I&#x27;m not absolving RH just saying they <i>might</i> have some <i>real</i> reason to have paused.<p>All this also shows you &quot;there is nowhere to hide&quot;. There will always be somewhere somecompany which will put its perceived viability or PR before &quot;sacrificing&quot; for their loyal customers. Especially, given the fact that most of these platforms just one company for clearing anyhow.')
