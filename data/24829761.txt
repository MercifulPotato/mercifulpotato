I thought we were only allowed to discuss the merits of a specific story.<p>We were talking about the New York Post and the documents from Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop.  I don&#x27;t know what unverified information you are referring to here or how that would be relevant to this discussion.  What is clear is that many &quot;real journalists&quot; were not satisfied enough with the evidence to publish it.  That even includes organizations like Fox News that have a bias that would seem to align with publishing the story.')
