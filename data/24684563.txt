It works well on Dreamhost.<p>The Python support is not good!  In theory you just write a WSGI app, and it will work under a FastCGI wrapper.<p>But I had to revive the old &quot;flup&quot; wrapper, since Dreamhost has Python 2.  I downloaded an older tarball and build it myself.<p>Use case: I parse thousands of shell scripts on every release and upload the results as a &quot;.wwz&quot; file, which is just a zip file served by a FastCGI script.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;release&#x2F;0.8.1&#x2F;test&#x2F;wild.wwz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;release&#x2F;0.8.1&#x2F;test&#x2F;wild.wwz&#x2F;</a><p>So whenever there&#x27;s a URL with .wwz in it, you&#x27;re hitting a FastCGI script!<p>This technique makes backing up a website a lot easier, as you can sync a single 50 MB zip file, rather than 10,000 tiny files, which takes forever to stat() the file system metadata.<p>It&#x27;s more rsync-friendly, in other words.<p>I also use it for logs in my continuous build: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;travis-ci.oilshell.org&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;travis-ci.oilshell.org&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a><p>-----<p>Does anyone know of any other web hosts that support FastCGI well?  I like having my site portable and host independent.  I think FastCGI is a good open standard for dynamic content, and it works well on shared hosting (which has a lot of the benefits of the cloud, and not many of the downsides).')
