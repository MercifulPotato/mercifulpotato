Apparently, it seems, enough to put magnets in the case itself to better maintain that force.<p>Additionally, it looks like the goal is to let your phone be held vertically, while attached only to the magnet. This makes sense for car mounts, where you may want to mount your GPS via magnet and charge it simultaneously.')
