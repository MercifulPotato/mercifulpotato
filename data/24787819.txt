We needed to industrialize to get the point we are now where we can manufacture clean energy. Coal and oil got a humans here from their simplicity (burn it) so that we can now have clean alternatives like solar panels and wind turbines.<p>So no, cleaning up isn&#x27;t easier or we wouldn&#x27;t be fucked right now.

Thus starting fresh without polluting from the onset - something that was impossible on our own world.')
