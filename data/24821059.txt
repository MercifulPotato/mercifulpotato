Item(by='zrm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603054453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820382, text='&gt; It’s fairly common knowledge that people actually don’t like choice.<p>This is a misunderstanding of what people like.<p>What people like is good defaults, because choosing is work. When 90% of everything is crap, nobody even wants to see anything but the 10% that isn&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t even want to see anything other than the one option which is the best for them, if somebody can give them that without making them do the work.<p>The problem is that the best option is not the same for everybody. Even if it&#x27;s the same for 70% of people, that lets you make that option the default and make 70% of people happy, but the other 30% still need the option to do something else.<p>And sometimes there isn&#x27;t any one option that can satisfy any majority of people. Then there isn&#x27;t any better alternative than giving people a list of options to choose from.<p>But you could still put the list in a better order. Put the &quot;editor&#x27;s choice&quot; options near the top and the crummiest ones near the bottom. If someone is in Queens, show them the regional server for New York City on the first page and the regional server for Los Angeles on the hundredth page, and a link next to it that says &quot;show other regions&quot; and leads to a regional map. That sort of thing.')
