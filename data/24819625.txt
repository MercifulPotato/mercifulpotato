I have a ~3k LOC project that blows up to over 45k LOC after `cargo expand` due to a dozen or so macros and the compile time is really starting to hurt iteration speed. Sadly, macros are by far one of my favorite Rust features.<p>I ended up paying for Clion just to get better debugger integration and a quick action for cargo expanding a file in the UI so I can copy paste the macro results into my codebase. I&#x27;m hoping that will improve incremental compilation times until I buy a Threadripper workstation.')
