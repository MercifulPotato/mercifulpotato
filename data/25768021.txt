Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610572323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767783, text='&gt; It&#x27;s important to be able to deal with people, and that involves dealing with unhappy people, people who are stressed or at wits end, and so on. It goes both ways.<p>That&#x27;s a good rule on thumb, provided that the initiator is willing to reflect, take responsibility and repair any damage caused when the receiver indicates that their communication wasn&#x27;t received well. Or, if the initiator isn&#x27;t willing to do that, then being able to disconnect peacefully without judgement and further harming the receiver. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry for coming across that way&quot; is a pretty simple way to acknowledge the receiver&#x27;s experience without feeling like you need to change or that it was your fault. It&#x27;s amazing how much damage to relationships comes not from the initial blow, but rather the insistence that no blow was delivered.<p>Many times I&#x27;ve seen &quot;straight shooters&quot; be received poorly and result to calling their receiver sensitive, etc., rather than accepting that the &quot;straight talk&quot; doesn&#x27;t work for that person and that neither one of you has done anything wrong, it&#x27;s just that the two styles aren&#x27;t working for either of you. Or vice versa when an initiator tries really hard to &quot;soften the blow&quot; with slow, peaceful words when it ends up being more torture for the receiver than just spitting it out with whatever emotion comes with it.')
