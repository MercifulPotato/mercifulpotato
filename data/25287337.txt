The US has something approaching a free labor market. That sucks if you&#x27;re at the bottom. It&#x27;s awesome if you&#x27;re in demand and can get a 20% pay rise at any time by jumping employers (and yes, that 20% stacks reliably).<p>I admire Europe for achieving a good lower bound on the standard of living of a person in society. If it were my way, all labor laws would only apply to those making less than 100K a year.<p>The same laws which protect lower income earners by making hiring&#x2F;firing expensive, make the cost of hiring&#x2F;firing well paid employees astronomical. That puts a serious damper on the fluidity of labor markets.')
