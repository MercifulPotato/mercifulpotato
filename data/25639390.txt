Its just not very good. It doesn&#x27;t work well between different clients and servers. The protocol is a horribly overcomplicated mess of overlapping, partially supported extensions for basic functionality. And it doesn&#x27;t work at all with low power mobile delivery. (It was invented before the iphone.)<p>There might have been political reasons why google dropped XMPP, but it would also make sense as a purely technical decision.')
