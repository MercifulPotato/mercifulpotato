Add economies of sale for other parts of an electric car and competition as new electric cars keep coming out  in 2 years the difference will be less than 8k when the op plans to buy. My prediction is in less than 5 years electric car sticker prices will be cheaper than petrol cars with the bans on new ice cars coming in the few years after that new model ice cars might actually stop coming out as  car manufacturers would not want to spend money on what they wont be allowed to sell.')
