By the time my 32gb of RAM in my Macbook isn&#x27;t enough, the rest of the computer won&#x27;t be enough either, and I&#x27;ll buy a new one. I get that some people are ok with their 8 year old computers that run like garbage, despite their claims that &quot;it still runs perfectly&quot;.  But there is a huge segment of the market that are ok with upgrading their computer every 4 years, and don&#x27;t need their RAM to be upgradable.<p>I know this doesn&#x27;t really help with the M1 Macs at the moment, but they are obviously going to release higher RAM models in the near future.')
