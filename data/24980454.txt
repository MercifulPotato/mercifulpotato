It seems to be typical for feminist papers. They collect some data, then, in the summary, they claim &quot;the reason we see this data is because of ongoing discrimination&quot;. Many people seem unable to distinguish the different parts of such papers or &quot;studies&quot;.<p>There is one part to assert authority, &quot;see we are doing the science thing&quot;, and then they use that to push their agendas.<p>I think since the media has destroyed its authority completely, this is the next frontier of politics to watch out for. We had to learn not to trust journalists, now we have to learn not to trust scientists. (Everybody can claim to be a scientist).')
