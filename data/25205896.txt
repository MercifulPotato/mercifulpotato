The biggest problem with most progress bars is that they tie together multiple unrelated things that aren&#x27;t even measured in the same way to a single indicator.<p>If there are multiple independent tasks, give me multiple independent indicators of their state.  Multiple instances of the same class of task can of course be grouped, you don&#x27;t need to list every file copy independently, but a file copy and an external dependency installer shouldn&#x27;t be two stops on the same progress bar.')
