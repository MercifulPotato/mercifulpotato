It’s incomprehensible because it heavily uses geometric arguments that basically no one uses these days. It’s hard stuff and looks nothing like modern calculus. I think it was L’Hospital’s book that actually looks very similar to modern-day calculus.<p>Leibniz’ work, from what little I’ve seen is a bit more readable, mainly because he was concerned with the conceptual-ness of it all.<p>Feynman, for a challenge, decided to do things the old-school geometric way, and he reported it was “damn hard”.')
