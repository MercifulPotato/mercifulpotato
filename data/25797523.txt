Apple is fighting this patent infringement lawsuit, and at the same time, seeking to invalidate the patents in a separate case in front of the US PTO:<p>&gt; <i>Apple contends that it is entitled to a new trial because the Court excluded evidence from parallel PTO proceedings. Docket No. 775 at 39. Apple suggests that the fact that the PTO has issued final written decisions finding each claim unpatentable over the prior art is relevant to damages.</i><p>&gt; <i>The Court is not persuaded that exclusion of the PTO proceedings warrants a new trial. VirnetX’s appeals of those proceedings are ongoing, and none of the asserted claims has been cancelled. It is particularly unclear what probative value the PTO proceedings have in light of the fact that invalidity is not an issue in this case.</i><p>&gt; <i>To the extent Apple argues the decisions are relevant to damages, the relevance of the decisions is minimal because a number of the “decisions” cited in Apple’s offer of proof2 on PTO proceedings were issued afterthe parties’ alleged hypothetical negotiation date of September 2013. Compare Docket No. 721 at 18 (“If infringement is found, the date of the hypothetical negotiation would be September 2013, when the redesigned versions of VPN on Demand and FaceTime were released.”), with Docket No. 692 (Apple’s offer of proof).</i><p>&gt; <i>Apple suggests that the evidence would have been relevant to the utility and advantages of the patented property over old modes or devices. Id. But, contrary to its assertions, Apple was not precluded from introducing evidence that the claimed invention “has no utility or advantages over old modes or devices.” Id. The Court only prohibited the use of the PTO proceedings, and Apple was free to present whatever evidence relating to Georgia-Pacific factors 9 and 10 it so chose.</i><p>&gt; <i>Apple is not entitled to a new trial on this basis.</i><p>Page 36 here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patentlyo.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;Apple500MLoss.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patentlyo.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;Apple500MLoss.pdf</a>')
