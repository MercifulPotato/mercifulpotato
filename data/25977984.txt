For an individual capitalist it makes sense to drive labour costs towards zero. But if everyone does it, then their markets shrink <i>unless there are external factors</i> (e.g. UBI or similar) that counters the market-wide effects of their reduction in labor costs.<p>This is also why UBI is a &quot;liberal&quot; (in the classical, not US sense) policy, and not something the socialist left is very interested in - from a socialist point of view UBI is bread and circus to keep capitalism from imploding.')
