These are relics from the past that are, unfortunately, very hard to fix without a &quot;Python 3000 moment&quot;, and all the problems that brings. Although PHP 8 does fix a bit of it (various comparisons and operators are a bit better now) there&#x27;s still a lot of it remaining, especially in the standard library IMHO.')
