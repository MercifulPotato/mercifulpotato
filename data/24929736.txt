The problem is the inability of society to support an excess of people who expect to be in the elite.<p>If the US really is producing 25,000 more lawyers per year than it can employ, that&#x27;s a real problem. Multiply that across many other disciplines and that could easily be hundreds of thousands of people with credentials they cannot use. We see this in the UK as well where there is a growing cadre of graduates every year going into jobs that don&#x27;t need a degree. This leads to growing numbers of people that expected to be in the elite, but aren&#x27;t.<p>The source of unrest is resentment among people that don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re getting their fair share, and have the organisational and communications skills to do something about it. Investors that don&#x27;t work for wages don&#x27;t strike me as a likely group to develop growing levels of resentment.')
