If you have multiple repos, then you still have that &quot;atomic commit&quot; where you update the version of the client library and adjust the code to handle the new semantics.  It then breaks when you deploy it to production because the server code isn&#x27;t deployed yet (or vice versa).<p>Basically, if you make RPCs, breaking up your repositories or combining your repositories doesn&#x27;t eliminate this problem.  It&#x27;s a separate problem that you have to tackle.  The reason it doesn&#x27;t come up as often as it should is because a lot of code is liberal in what it accepts, and most changes are strictly additive (i.e. it&#x27;s &quot;add more information to the response&quot;, not &quot;remove information from the response&quot;, because we&#x27;re generally pushed in the direction of making our applications do more).  But it is something you have to attack head-on.  No tool will auto-fix the problems for you.')
