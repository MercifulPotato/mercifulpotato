If you still want those -- and if you want it to replace cloud services, you do -- you&#x27;ll need to configure the VPN, which is an enormous hassle on both client and server. Also, sometimes there&#x27;s an update and it just stops working until you pay attention to it. Ditto for network shares, but I think the problem there is in Android &#x2F; iOS network filesystem implementations. Managing permissions is a nightmare, even for simple setups, ditto storage, ditto the VM that theoretically runs nextcloud but in practice gets taken down by an update on a regular basis.<p>For my next NAS I&#x27;')
