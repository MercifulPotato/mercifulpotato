Once you have a contract between the parties it&#x27;s going to be resolved primarily as a contract dispute. It&#x27;s not going to be resolved the way someone posting something on the pirate bay will be resolved.<p>I&#x27;m not saying what you wrote is incorrect so much as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to make much of a practical difference whether you call it a royalty or not.')
