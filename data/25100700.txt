That&#x27;s probably the path that I would suggest - it would allow you to expand your skillset without taking big risks and you&#x27;ll have more options in the future. Use the career capital that you already have and explore your options instead of making a sharp turn in your career direction that might leave you disappointed.<p>This is real gold. If you have existing knowledge about some area than you can learn and apply those things, thus you&#x27;ll get the traction that you want earlier, and it would be more rewarding in the end.<p>If there is a chance, I won&#x27;t miss that opportunity. \nGood luck.')
