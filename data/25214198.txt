[0]<p>Tia Blanco is a surfer and also unlikely to have protein needs different from a normal person.<p>Meagan Duhamel is a good example and seems to be one of the few people who is known to have achieved professional goals while vegan.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re talking about the broader community of people who self-identify as athletes but I&#x27;ll restrict the discussion to professional athletes for the sake of clarity.<p>There are some confounders with professional athletes that make those examples less persuasive than they might be otherwise. Pros have access to more resources (such as medical&#x2F;endocrine assistance) and are able to structure their lifestyle around their training and competition. Additionally I&#x27;m unable to find anyone who went from an amateur to a professional while vegan in a competitive sport that requires one to build a physique. It is somewhat more believable that some people can maintain a professional-grade physique on a vegan diet.<p>&gt; No disrespect but I see this &quot;I&#x27;m an athlete, I need more protein&quot; thing all the time. It&#x27;s yet another meme that has spread that has the convenient side effect (or main effect) of shutting people off from considering the effects of their food choices.<p>I&#x27;m not really repeating a meme but arguing from my personal experience and my understanding of diet and physiology. The effect of relying on plant-based protein is that your protein sources are more difficult to digest.<p>&gt; I would wager that veganism might have a higher percentage in the athlete population than the general population. Pure speculation, though, and obviously I&#x27;m biased.<p>I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re conscious of your biases and while I would take that wager opposite you, I will also admit that is more a result of my biases. I&#x27;ll also mention that professional athletes tend to be outliers and if a genetic freak can build muscle on a vegan diet, it may be evidence that they are a genetic outlier their rare physiology is able to build muscle on any diet with protein but more sensitive to the byproducts of animal product consumption.<p>&gt; But I follow lots of vegan channel and they&#x27;re very proud and vocal about vegan athletes<p>Thats because they are passionate about veganism and want to counter the meme you referred to above. I would be more persuaded if people who were passionate about nutrition or athletics were vocal about veganism as a performance enhancer.<p>Thanks for the reply and much respect to you for making ethical decisions a central part of your lifestyle.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.si.com&#x2F;eats&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;kyrie-irving-celtics-plant-based-diet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.si.com&#x2F;eats&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;kyrie-irving-celtics-plan...</a>')
