Anything can handle that, even if it is C++ :)<p>But if I&#x27;m doing a change to the core headers, it typically means multi-minute wait even on the threadripper. And that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been doing for a couple of months now, working on basic architectural changes. The idea of doing such work on machine that took 50-100% longer to do a full build would be a serious problem.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything on the horizon (yet) that uses Apple silicon that helps that kind of development process.')
