Item(by='Retric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603492317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24874735, text='As the projected lifespan of a reactor is 50+ years and most of the current ones are quite old, that works out rather closely to 1% (17,000 &#x2F; 50 &#x2F; 3) of reactors with a significant issue.  Building even 1,000 of them would therefore likely see a handful of Fukushima scale 100+B$ disasters.<p>It might be worth it if there was no viable alternative, but thatâ€™s a harder sale.<p>PS: There have also been 2 significant nuclear sub accidents,  though with older designs.')
