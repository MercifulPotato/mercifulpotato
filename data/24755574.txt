If not, they are (1) not stealing jobs from locals, and (2) actually boosting local economy, infusing it with cash earned overseas.<p>Possibly hinting at this are also recent programs in some countries[1] that in a way encourage “digital nomadism”, offering terms that are actually more beneficial compared to tourist status (e.g., longer stay times).<p>[0] Of course, this argument most likely won’t fly if the immigration officer is out to get you. IANAL.<p>[1] Georgia comes to mind')
