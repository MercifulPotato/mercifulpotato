The amount is staggering.<p>You know this is a risk. If you went deep on something like Silverlight, you&#x27;d have just thrown away all that time. And then people will casually dismiss your 10 years away as not being relevant. And now you get to pick a new technology to maybe invest the next 10 years on, risking the same thing happening again. If a product dies, you go back to square one as a junior again on some new technology.<p>Picking a long-lasting technology is hard. You&#x27;re predicting the future.<p>I&#x27;m really tired of people who think they have this industry figured out like it&#x27;s easy to predict what will be around in 10 years so you can make safe choices about what to invest time into.')
