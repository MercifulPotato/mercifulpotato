Technologists and intellectuals are used to viewing speech as an form of information transfer. However, speech can also be <i>performative</i>[1]; saying &quot;not-guilty&quot; to a judge or &quot;I do&quot; during your wedding are not really about conveying information - by saying those statements you are <i>performing an action</i>.<p>Falsely shouting &quot;fire&quot; is a false statement, but the problem happens when that statement is also functioning as the <i>act</i> of reckless endangerment (or incitement to riot, or whatever). Nobody cares if someone e.g. writes an op-ed that falsely claims the theater is on fire. It&#x27;s the same misinformation, but the op-ed isn&#x27;t also functioning as a performative act.<p>Far too often in these discussions, the different form of speech are conflated. A lot of the &quot;balancing freedom vs safety&quot; problem is a false dilemma that becomes a lot easier to reason when speech-as-information is separated from speech-as-action[2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Performativity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Performativity</a><p>[2] Factoring out phatic language is also important ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scienceblogs.com&#x2F;clock&#x2F;2007&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;more-than-just-resistance-of-s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scienceblogs.com&#x2F;clock&#x2F;2007&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;more-than-just-res...</a> )')
