You broke them badly here.<p>There is no evidence that the people downvoting the comments you disagree with are communist agents. The evidence is entirely that the community is simply divided on divisive topics, like this one. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here, and it&#x27;s destructive to post these inflated accusations to the contraryâ€”it&#x27;s poison, in fact. That&#x27;s why the site guidelines ask you not to do it.')
