What are you when you&#x27;re not nice? Just &quot;there&quot;? No, you&#x27;re a prick.<p>When it comes to racism, if you&#x27;re not openly against it, you condone it, and you&#x27;re part of the problem.<p>Take Trump; in his position, he can take down the extreme right paramilitary organizations, the Proud Boys, the KKK, the conservative churches, etc. But he chooses not to, instead dogwhilstling his approval and support; statements like &quot;stand back and stand by&quot;, encouraging the crowds to storm the Capitol, etc etc etc. He knows he&#x27;d be booted out hard if he starts to hard-R his way through speeches, but dogwhistles have no consequences, and inaction has no direct consequences.')
