After 1-3 seconds, sometimes a widget pops up which pushes all the search results down. I have <i>countless</i> times gone to click a URL after 2 seconds of searching and had it suddenly move and end up on a different website.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly disconcerting. Because of the inconsistency, I&#x27;ve become hesitant and scared to click anything for the first ten seconds of loading the page. I&#x27;m being habituated by negative stimulus. Nothing has ever made me want to ditch Google search more strongly because it&#x27;s now literally giving me anxiety to view the search results.<p>Anyone who was in charge at Google and had good design sense is long gone, and an empty-headed cargo cult remains.<p>P.S. I organize my bookmarks bar by favicon color without labels. Gmail was fourth, after the EFF, Youtube, and SMBC. Now I will be kicking gmail to the end of the bar with the rest of the multi-colored icons which can&#x27;t be sorted and remain indistinguishable from each other. I may be a small data point but Google just effectively killed their premium placement in my bookmarks which will lead to checking my web mail less frequently.')
