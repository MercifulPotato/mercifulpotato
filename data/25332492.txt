There are many ways to ship code faster.<p>-Don&#x27;t test<p>-Don&#x27;t worry about sanitizing inputs<p>-Optimize for writing, not maintaining<p>-Take a tech-debt loan. Bolt your feature somewhere convenient it doesn&#x27;t belong.<p>-Put on blinders. Your n+1 query problem is Tomorrow&#x27;s problem<p>-Avoid refactors<p>-Choose the first architecture you think of, not the one that is simpler, more flexible or more useful<p>-DRY code means takes too long to write--you&#x27;d have to read <i>more</i> code to do it. That&#x27;s bottom performer thinking!<p>-Securing credentials is hard. Hardcode them!<p>Remember, if you want to be a top performer and have breathless articles written about you, ship many commits, fast! Also, this is a virtuous circle--if any of these are &quot;problems&quot; you&#x27;ll get to ship more commits!')
