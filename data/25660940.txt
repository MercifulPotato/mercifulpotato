It&#x27;s not an easy problem to solve either.<p>* Targeted ads - This really doesn&#x27;t bother me. Tracking user interests&#x2F;behavior and using it to serve ads they are way more likely to engage with, is creepy true, but also quite innovative and effective and the reason the company makes billions of dollars. It&#x27;s hard for me to get worked up about showing users more effective ads. There are some interesting nuances around whether this should be opt in or opt out and giving users control over how their data is used. Some of this will be determined by laws which seems better to me then having it fall on individual companies. FB does give users control btw.<p>* Too much&#x2F;not enough censorship - this topic is a complete shit show and no one agrees anyway on how much is or isn&#x27;t enough. FB&#x27;s stance is basically to remove hate speech and calls to violence and allowing anything else. I&#x27;m fine with that.<p>* buying out competitors like IG and What&#x27;s App - it&#x27;s normal for companies to do this and for the government to step in when it&#x27;s too much<p>* Other misc. shady things - there&#x27;s other things that come up from time to time. I agree that some of it is shady, but imo is standard for what you find in American capitalism: ruthless competition and cutting corners to get ahead as opposed to evil maliciousness towards users and subverting the law.<p>* Leetcode style interview questions - I have no problem with this whatsoever. The goal is not to ask difficult questions that trick candidates. It&#x27;s to ask medium difficulty questions and hire people who can quickly and effectively solve them. Not everyone who fails the interview is bad, but the people who pass should be decent.<p>* Users getting addicted to FB and IG&#x2F;it makes them unhappy - I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion about this topic. I don&#x27;t really use the products since they don&#x27;t appeal to me. They do appeal to (a growing) many and I think it&#x27;s a bit presumptuous to point to those people and say &quot;but really it makes you unhappy.&quot; I&#x27;m open to studies and scholarship that say otherwise.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I covered everything the OP had in mind, since they were not specific. Probably there are some other objectionable things I missed.')
