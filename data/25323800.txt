The heads of all the major hospitals in Houston got together and did a press conference to dispel the false press.<p>Hospitals also havent filled up in numerous places with virtually no Covid restrictions like Sweden.<p>The flat curvers are looking to be as wrong as the flat earthers.<p>I&#x27;d also like to see stats on hospitalization and age that you casually threw out there.<p>Only 500 people died of Covid under the age of 24 while over 200,000 have died above the age of 55.<p>It would stand to reason that hospitalization stats are wildly skewed towards the older generations.')
