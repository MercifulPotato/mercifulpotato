Item(by='Bluestrike2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612098959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978239, text='While I wouldn&#x27;t choose to use particleboard for a piece of furniture myself (that&#x27;s my inner woodworker rebelling at the thought), the bigger concern is how it&#x27;s used. For the LACK side tables, the legs are attached with a single double-ended dowel stud that sits the middle of the leg. I suppose you could add some glue during assembly, but you&#x27;re really just gluing exposed particleboard to a veneer, with very little--if any--added strength. It&#x27;s truly ridiculous example of joinery, even by cheap knock-down furniture standards. Amusingly, the server mounts will do more to help stabilize the legs they&#x27;re attached to.<p>You can also use threaded inserts epoxied when attaching the racks to the legs, which will have still have significant holding power in particleboard. Just make sure to use inserts with coarser threads (depending on where you buy them, they may be labeled as softwood inserts), which will have greater holding power in particleboard. Just remember to drill a very <i>slightly</i> oversized hole (both in terms of depth and diameter, so it&#x27;s just a hair wider than the exterior threads so the epoxy can fully surround the insert) for your inserts.<p>To make install easier, cut a piece of tape around the end of the insert to keep the epoxy from covering the internal threads.[0]  And if you have a file, file a groove vertically across the insert from the top to the bottom. The epoxy will get pushed up through those grooves, locking the insert down so it can&#x27;t twist. Scrape off the squeeze-out, let the epoxy set, and you&#x27;re good to go. There are also tapping inserts you can use without having to break out a file.[1]<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.woodmagazine.com&#x2F;materials-guide&#x2F;fasteners&#x2F;tips-on-using-threaded-inserts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.woodmagazine.com&#x2F;materials-guide&#x2F;fasteners&#x2F;tips-...</a><p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcmaster.com&#x2F;threaded-inserts&#x2F;tapping-inserts-for-softwood-7&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcmaster.com&#x2F;threaded-inserts&#x2F;tapping-inserts-fo...</a>')
