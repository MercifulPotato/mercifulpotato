Item(by='funcDropShadow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607348971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311183, text='&gt; &quot;Donâ€™t bother with man pages.&quot; Strongly disagree.<p>Me as well. Though I am not against well linked documentation on the web. But man pages provide several unique advantages.<p>- Because man pages are installed with the same package the software comes in, their version matches exactly to the version of the installed software.<p>- Man pages don&#x27;t require an internet connection or a running server. The internet connection can be a problem in certain kinds of enterprise networks, embedded system or during my commute in the train. The running server costs money who might not be willing to spend it as long as I would like to use the software.<p>- Linking from the executable to the web is tricky. Does the terminal support clickable links? Which browser should I start? Does it help the user in any way to start a browser on a far away machine that he connected to through ssh, mosh, telnet or morse code over avian carrier?<p>- It is very easy and safe to open a man page to an unknown command. You can be sure the command is not executed by accident. If I have to type `some-command --help` I am never sure if this is one of those commands that doesn&#x27;t accept --help and does something stupid instead.<p>Despite all these advantages of man pages or offline available documentation I also like good online documentation. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;</a> comes to my mind when thinking about excellent software documentation. Granted it is not a one-minute tutorial for the latest newbie. But for someone using that piece of software for years, its value cannot be overstated imho.')
