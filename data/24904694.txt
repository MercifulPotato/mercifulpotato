Not all women menstruate, and transmen may menstruate and certainly, by definition, do not identify as women, and that&#x27;s even before considering those of nonbinary gender identity.<p>“People who menstruate” (the term actually used) is different from “menstruators” (the latter is reductionist, the former identifies a trait of people without reducing them to that trait, merely identifying it as one of many traits they have that may or may not be central to their identity; the difference is approximately that between “breeders” and “people with children”.)<p>If you have to change the term used in order to get upset at it, maybe you are trying a little to hard to find an excuse to be upset.')
