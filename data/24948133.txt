Mine&#x27;s been on and off for almost 20 months now. After three urologists I found something that worked (and it&#x27;s like a miracle).<p>Something you touch on here implicitly is how much it changes little things in your life. For me it was long commutes, I can&#x27;t sit for extended periods of time.<p>What I would add is that doctors can be great for things they recognize and can treat. With something like chronic pain that can manifest due to numerous causes and doesn&#x27;t outright kill you, doctors can be very unhelpful. It took a really bad bout of pain to see a new urologist who diagnosed it as a damaged nerve and prescribed a device that works.<p>Not everyone is the same, but my experience led me to believe that if you suffer from chronic pain you just have to keep shuffling specialists until you find someone that&#x27;s read different research than the others that works.')
