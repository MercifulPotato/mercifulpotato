Linux users are technical and skint; they have no problem compiling something from scratch if it can save them a few dollars. GPL desktop software would probably fare better on Windows, ironically, where compiling and installing things correctly is nontrivial even for power-users. This is actually becoming even more the case, now that security is getting more and more important: having a known-safe installable build from a trusted party is extremely valuable.')
