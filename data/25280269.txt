But it&#x27;s still breaching professionalism. If the message instead was, &quot;Unions are corrupt and deprive people of individual agency&quot; would that be acceptable? Especially with the unique position Google is in as our gateway to information, it&#x27;s prudent to avoid employees that cannot refrain from making changes to production software to further personal politics.')
