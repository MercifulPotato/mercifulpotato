There is no state on the server &#x2F; in the database and nothing to close.<p>&gt; Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say hashids). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like `WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100`.')
