For example, both Republicans (82%) and Democrats (91%) trust scientists: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;science&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;02&#x2F;trust-and-mistrust-in-americans-views-of-scientific-experts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;science&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;02&#x2F;trust-and-mis...</a> (Even that question is politically loaded. “Science” is a spectrum, and as the reproducibility crisis shows, they’re often wrong. Conservatives by definition are more likely to be skeptical of people who say they have new insights into age-old problems, while liberals are by definition always looking for new approaches and don’t mind much when they don’t pan out. So this 10 point gap isn’t either bad or good, necessarily.)<p>Where you see gaps are in discrete issues that are highly politicized, such as climate change and COVID. In those areas, valid differences in policy approaches get muddled together with differences in facts.<p>Left-leaning journalist Matt Yglesias takes this on in the context of climate change in his new book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aei.org&#x2F;economics&#x2F;the-case-for-one-billion-americans-my-long-read-qa-with-matthew-yglesias&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aei.org&#x2F;economics&#x2F;the-case-for-one-billion-ameri...</a><p>He explains that according to experts, climate change will be “like really bad, but not that bad” such that the solution is to take steps to address it while continuing to grow the economy. He explains that the people who think we’re all going to die from climate change (folks on his own side) are probably wrong.<p>&gt; Taking those problems seriously means investing in solving them, not telling ourselves, “Well, we’re just going to whittle the population down, or somehow everybody’s going to go live in a shack in a hillside there.”<p>&gt; Still, it is a fundamental difference in worldview. Some people are very driven by a pastoralist notion that we can conserve our way to solving the problem. A billion Americans is not about that. It is about a bigger, richer, more dynamic society.<p>The facts around climate change are complicated and when it trickles down into the political sphere it tends to get cast in binary terms, because that’s the nature of public political debate. The reality is nuanced: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;05&#x2F;rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-wrong-th&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;05&#x2F;rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-i...</a><p>&gt; According the report: &quot;Under the no-policy baseline scenario, temperature rises by 3.66°C by 2100, resulting in a global gross domestic product (GDP) loss of 2.6%,&quot; as opposed to 0.3 percent under the 1.5°C scenario and 0.5 percent under the 2°C scenario. In the baseline 3.66°C projection, the estimate of future GDP losses ranged from a low of 0.5 percent to a high of 8.2 percent. In other words, if humanity does nothing whatsoever to abate greenhouse gas emissions, the worst-case scenario is that global GDP in 2100 would be 8.2 percent lower than it would otherwise be.<p>There is a legitimate argument that a Green New Deal type solutions that involve a WWII-style economic mobilization would be worse for the economy than just letting climate change happen, at least based on the current science. (Note the EU’s Green Deal has a price tag that’s one-sixth of the price tag for the Green New Deal as proposed.)<p>Of course by the time this filters into the public debate, it gets reduced to “climate change isn’t happening” versus “we have a 12 year expiration date.” And on both sides, the understanding of the actual science case be very shallow. \nI know college-educated people who say they won’t have kids because of climate change. This is either pretextual, or pretty misinformed about what scientists think will happen. A lot of people don’t really care about the facts, they just repeat what people on “their team” say.')
