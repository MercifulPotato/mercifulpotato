The vast majority of protection is provided by a fairly minimal set of precautions.<p>I think we see this borne out in the data. The places with the strictest lockdowns are doing better than the places with fewer restrictions. However, the numbers aren&#x27;t so night and day different as to suggest that those additional lockdowns have been worth the price.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve wondered is how many &quot;odd&quot; social customs in various cultures (no singing &#x2F; dancing, face coverings, etc.) could actually be explained by past epidemics. We&#x27;ve certainly adopted many of those restrictions in short order.')
