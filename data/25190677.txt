And I think Operational Research that were developed in America for WWII, became part of Japan&#x27;s post-War rebuild, started to come back into America in the form of just-in-time inventory. Cheaper and computerized logistics made just-in-time manufacturing and inventory a no-brainer.<p>To reflect on 2020 and where we are now:<p><pre><code>  - On-demand, elastic cloud computing continues this trend\n  - On-demand anything (AirBnB, Uber, Lyft, etc.) same thing\n  - We didn&#x27;t build in any resiliency in our global supply chain. COVID-19 showed us how badly that worked out for us\n  - America has lost the skilled manufacturing expertise in a number of industries. It is not so simple to restart manufacturing. It would still have to compete with the lower cost that comes from JIT manufacturing and the global supply chain. (Look at Tesla&#x27;s troubles at just bringing up a reliable production line, or that article about Apple&#x27;s principle manufacturing engineers going to China to fix things and teach people there, because there is always some production problem you have to fix onsite).\n  - Certain high-tech manufacturing are still much better within America.</code></pre>')
