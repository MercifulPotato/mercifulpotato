They try to create a fully functional fake of the original class.<p>In this case instead of storing the blobs via a REST interface or a database connection, it just keeps it in memory. So it should mostly behave like the real implementation, but is not suitable for production, as it doesn&#x27;t persist the data.<p>The only things that are missing there are real life latency or maybe exceptions because of connectivity issues.')
