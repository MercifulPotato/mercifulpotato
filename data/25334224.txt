This argument usually skips over the dependence <i>on</i> western societies for basic needs, and whether <i>anyone</i> should get to just &quot;opt out&quot; of society in general, while still benefitting from societal supports.<p>Both are true to a limited extent, but absolutely false if used as a broad defence of the homeless, or the basis of policy.<p>There has to be a link between the autonomy a person is allowed, and the responsibility they bear for wielding that autonomy - this applies everywhere else too, from trust within communities, to authority within institutions.<p>The homeless <i>are</i> often treated differently, but sometimes they are treated <i>more</i> leniently the the norm as well. If they where treated the same as everyone else, they&#x27;d <i>still</i> find it difficult to get a job, or loan; but they&#x27;d also end up in jail a lot more too.')
