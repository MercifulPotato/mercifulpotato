Almost every one of the videos posted to Ngo&#x27;s twitter are accompanied by his own commentary so I&#x27;m not sure how you could claim otherwise. And even if they weren&#x27;t, I know of at least one specific incident where his sharing of a carefully edited video with missing information created a completely false narrative. His &quot;reporting&quot; has been deeply intertwined with the violence in this city, directly collaborating with violent far right groups, helping to doxx political activists and leading to multiple instances of death threats.<p>I understand that you&#x27;re not in Oregon or even the US - and even though Ngo clearly speaks to your politics, he&#x27;s not an accurate source of information. There&#x27;s an abundance of information showing that to be the case.')
