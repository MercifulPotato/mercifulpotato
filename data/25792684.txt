I could believe them getting rid of the touchbar, but bringing back magsafe?  I&#x27;m sticking with my 2015 MacBook until it&#x27;s irreparable, and I do like the magsafe port, but is there really any point in going back after moving to USB-C?  I think I just like magsafe because it&#x27;s cool more than that it actually has some sort of superiority over USB-C.  I&#x27;ve tripped over the USB-C cable to my work laptop(2018 model) a handful of times and somehow the cable always manages to unplug without flinging the laptop across the room or damaging the USB components themselves.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like going back to magsafe would achieve anything.')
