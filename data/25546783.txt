There is a pattern of people committing suicide a few weeks after starting on an anti-depressant (including one of my cousins and a late friend of mine), so much that it is listed as a side effect. I don&#x27;t know if there is a double-blind study showing that the anti-depressant use is causal (and such a study is probably unethical), and depressed people are already more suicidal, so take my reasoning as a hypothesis and not a statement of fact.<p>But it also makes sense evolutionarily.  People who suffer depression may survive periods in their life when they would otherwise commit suicide, and people who don&#x27;t exit life early, meaning that depression is naturally selected.')
