Text-To-Blog to keep everybody updated', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='When my sister had her first baby they had to stay in the hospital for one month due to complications. We all wanted to know how they were doing. She would text my mom, who would text others, etc.<p>This happened again not so long ago with a dear friend&#x27;s baby. COVID made it even harder. She would text her husband and mom and we would get info from them.<p>I feel this happens all the time when somebody is in the hospital.<p>That&#x27;s why I built this<p><pre><code>   https:&#x2F;&#x2F;num.one&#x2F;\n</code></pre>\n(You should visit the site on your mobile for the best experience)<p>It allows you to create and update a &quot;blog&quot; via text messages. There is no signup. The first text you send creates your unique link. Following texts are updates. Images are supported as well.<p>This allows somebody to just text that number and then share the link, which can be shared again and again, and everybody can go there to get their updates.<p>After a certain amount of inactive days the system will offer to archive the blog and send you a zip file, before deleting it. I could add likes, hearts, replies, highlight new posts, etc, but figured I would start with an MVP first to see if there is interest.<p>What do you think?')
