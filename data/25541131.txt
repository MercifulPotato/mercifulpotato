They were effectively locking people in their homes.  If a Covid case was found in an apartment, the entire floor was locked down.  If you didn&#x27;t stay in your home, you were brought to a facility where you didn&#x27;t have a choice in the matter.<p>And they are controlling it now by effectively locking down the country to the rest of the world.  Even if you&#x27;re a Vietnamese citizen you can&#x27;t get back into the country without permission.  And the gov&#x27;t is denying permission in all but the most extreme circumstances.')
