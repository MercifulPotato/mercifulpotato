However, they are wrong about almost everything else; &#x27;Node in a browser&#x27;, as the author uses it, is just a string of half-understood terms thrown together. Ironically, the inaccessibility of programming is probably at least partly to blame for their confusion.<p>There is undoubtedly work to be done into making programming more accessible to newcomers - almost all tutorials on code start in the wrong place, assuming a lot of knowledge of the difficult bits but then labouring through the easy ones.<p>I don&#x27;t think the problem is tooling, but how we introduce and talk about those tools - you can quickly explain the command line in a way that takes the fear away and gives learners a framework for understanding it, but you have to give that explantion; too often it&#x27;s skipped over.')
