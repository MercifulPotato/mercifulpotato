Those people have to be paid.  For criminal work, that&#x27;s taxpayers footing the bill -- sometimes just for one side.  For civil, the government provides a judge and the rest has to be paid for privately.  It&#x27;s not awful, but it can be so inefficient that it can break down due to resource exhaustion, or worse, a vector for abuse.')
