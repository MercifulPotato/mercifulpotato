You&#x27;re the guy who notes that the new edition of the owner&#x27;s manual calls for 10W-30 and tries to convince me that if I don&#x27;t call a tow truck and swap out the oil before I next turn on the car I&#x27;m going to ruin it, despite 150,000 miles to the contrary.<p>You&#x27;re right that there is new information out there, but lived experience puts a pretty modest upper bound on how crucial it can be.<p>I&#x27;m not going to yearn for the good old days of ringworms, tapeworms, and god knows what else. I&#x27;ll wait until either someone figures out how to put the good parts in a vaccine or a replication scandal proves the whole thing to be BS in the first place. Yeah, there&#x27;s a tiny chance that in the meantime I&#x27;ll suffer an autoimmune disorder that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have -- but I won&#x27;t have parasites or the very real consequences that <i>they</i> bring to the table, and in my book, that&#x27;s not just a small net win, that&#x27;s a big net win.')
