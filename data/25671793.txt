It doesn&#x27;t matter how the person died, or whether it was intentional because the intent to commit the initial felony is enough.<p>The canonical example is everyone who took part in a bank robbery can be charged with murder if the bank guards kill one of the robbers. This even applies to the getaway driver, who may not have entered the bank.<p>The initial felony could be any of: the assault on the building, breaking &amp; entering, various domestic terror statutes we have for this sort of thing.<p>There were at least 4 deaths at the Capitol yesterday. All of the insurgents should be facing 4 murder charges, in addition to the other charges that we would expect.<p>Edit: possibly relevant statute: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.dccouncil.us&#x2F;dc&#x2F;council&#x2F;code&#x2F;sections&#x2F;22-2101.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.dccouncil.us&#x2F;dc&#x2F;council&#x2F;code&#x2F;sections&#x2F;22-2101.h...</a><p>This appears to indicate that everyone who illegally entered the Capitol yesterday can be indicted for first-degree murder, which carries a sentence of 30 to life in DC.')
