Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606337438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213074, text='&gt; I would argue that there are a lot of conspiracy theories out there at the moment that should be labeled as such.<p>You can attach whatever label you would like to something, it has no effect on whether it is objectively true (in shared, physical reality), it only affects <i>people&#x27;s perceptions</i> of its truth (virtual reality).  This applies both to conspiracy theories, as well as mainstream news theories.  There is surely a difference between which class of theories has larger epistemic variance between physical and virtual reality, but this variance exists on a per story basis, and should therefore be analyzed at that level.  No one has ever done such a comparative analysis (as far as I know, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), despite what mainstream news theorists would have the public believe.<p>&gt; A better example would be the tendency of the left to mark anyone they disagree with as “racist”. Same strategy. Mark your opponents as something that’s so bad that no further discussion can be allowed.<p>An excellent example indeed.')
