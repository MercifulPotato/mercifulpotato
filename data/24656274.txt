Haskell codebases were immediately so fun to dive into and learn from. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to hit the &quot;Source&quot; button on Hackage. The fact that all code could be reasoned about locally with just simple symbolic substitution was a breath of fresh air.<p>To a person with 0 experience at all, Haskell or Algol-descended languages are going to be equally alien. Your experience is because you had asymmetric familiarity.<p>So I&#x27;m not surprised by your experience. But it says more about you than Haskell.')
