Or you know, if Apple open sourced their security-critical software.<p>&gt; One of the most time-consuming tasks of this whole project was the painstaking process of reverse engineering the types and meanings of a huge number of the fields in these objects. Each IO80211AWDLPeer object is almost 6KB; that&#x27;s a lot of potential fields. Having structure layout information would probably have saved months.<p>&gt; Six years ago I had hoped Project Zero would be able to get legitimate access to data sources like this. Six years later and I am still spending months reversing structure layouts and naming variables.')
