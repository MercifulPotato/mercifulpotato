This paper is a product of the malarkey echo chamber. Just take one key phrase they try to scare you with: “G Suite for Healthcare Businesses&quot;, supposedly part of their big scary plan to dominate your life. First of all, not a Google product line, despite the capitalization and quotation marks. There is a marketing site that is meant to tell health businesses that Google Workspace is HIPAA-compliant, but that&#x27;s it. The only other places where the phrase “G Suite for Healthcare Businesses&quot; appears are thinly-sourced pseudo journalism and blog spam. So we know right there this position paper isn&#x27;t based on research, it&#x27;s based on reading blogs. It is echo chamber effluent.<p>The rest of it is just innuendo and second-order suppositions. There exists some company that once used Google Cloud APIs for their own health data, therefore this data -- somehow, through magic -- leaks out into &quot;Google AI&quot;, a kind of scary overmind into which one shovels data and out of which comes all manner of scary outcomes. Except it&#x27;s all bullshit, because there&#x27;s no mechanism by which third party data that happens to use GCP just osmotically migrates into AdSense. This paper is 7 pages of bullshit.')
