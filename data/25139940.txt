I have a Pixel 4 and my partner has a pixel 4a and we&#x27;re both super happy with it.<p>Google Search is just as good if not better than a few years ago, but Gmail is getting a little bloated with almost 800mb of RAM taken up per tab.<p>I think like with everything, they have phases where things are worse, but then they get better. Just like Microsoft had Vista before Windows 7, ME before XP, etc. Products have phases of exploration on how to be more useful, and then they solidify those useful features and deprecate the ones that aren&#x27;t great.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for contrast, the new Apple OS&#x27;s are also getting way worse (Catalina, Big Sur), but some of the releases (SL) were great. Hopefully we&#x27;re on the edge of them getting better again.')
