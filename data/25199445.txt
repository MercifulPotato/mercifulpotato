Science can&#x27;t solve all our problems but at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t mean we should discount science when trying to solve them.<p>When I ask people to listen to science, that doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;have science solve the problem entirely&quot; but &quot;all viable solution maxima are scientifically solvable, the tradeoff is ethical&quot;. If someone suggests a solution that is not scientifically solvable, then it ought to be disregarded or considered for what is it is; pure politics, something you have to think about morally and ethically.')
