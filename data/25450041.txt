One example that comes to mind is graph theory. I use it frequently to answer questions about the data I&#x27;m looking at.<p>Imagine an electrical distribution network where there are 3 phases (A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C) and an overhead line can contain any combination of those phases. These networks can be modeled as a graph with nodes connected by links. The links do not have a direction, but they do have a phase. If you want to know what the phasing is at any point in the network, the way to figure that out is to use graph algorithms.')
