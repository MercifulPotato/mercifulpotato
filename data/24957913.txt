Super informative and entertaining.<p>For #1, wasn&#x27;t speaking of the &#x27;universe as simulation&#x27; hypothesis specifically, I think an assertion either way is indefensible.  It was more about unpacking semantics, i.e., what is the most reductive form of a computation?  Does there need to even be an operator that seeks to know an answer?  Is computation something that only exists in human context, or can it simply be the unfolding consequences of the &#x27;seed&#x27; of the universe?  Just rumination on abstract inconsequential ideas :)<p>#2.  I&#x27;m familiar with some of the nomenclature is regards to &#x27;computing&#x27; complexity, and my question, in retrospect, seems a little silly.  Computation is computation.  I still only have a lay understanding -- as much as I need to know for perf and the differences between algorithms -- and I&#x27;ll have a look at that paper and hopefully understand the subject a little deeper.<p>Thanks again.')
