Data belongs in a database. Code belongs in a codebase. Configuration doesn&#x27;t. Ideally config should be reduced down to keys and values and stored anywhere where it&#x27;s easy to push to the environment where the code runs. I don&#x27;t understand the immense expansion and proliferation of the config layer. I never touch code anymore. All I handle is config and tooling around it. YAML engineering.<p>Better configuration doesn&#x27;t mean more ways to treat config like code, or data like config, or god forbid, code. It means treating config like config and code like code. Gitops just makes me sad. Truth should only flow in one direction. The first time I had to write a script to utilize the GitHub API to auto-update a code repo I died a little inside.')
