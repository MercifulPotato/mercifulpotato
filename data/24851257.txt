This is essentially tautological (otherwise things would change overnight) and so should not be news to anyone.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t justify excusing the instances when it does happen. The entire point of having a justice system is to discourage criminal behavior, and provide a sense of fairness so that feuds do not grow. When we see a violent criminal murder someone on camera but not even get charged because they happen to be wearing a uniform, it&#x27;s clear that system is in need of fixing. If you truly support law and order, then making sure that law is applied evenly should be your priority.')
