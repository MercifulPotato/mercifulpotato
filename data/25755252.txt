If Parler itself has done something illegal, then they should be punished.<p>However, if some private companies sabotage Parler based on the fact that Parler does not have the same censorship rules as themselves, then that is clearly wrong.<p>From what I have heard here, it might be good if Parler disappears, but I cannot accept that the end justifies the means.')
