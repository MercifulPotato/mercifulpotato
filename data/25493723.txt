The idea of &quot;let&#x27;s make a lot of money and let the tech drag behind while we&#x27;re expanding our user base&quot; is alien to the Swiss culture I know. Everything is done with eternity in mind. As the popular local saying goes: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, but we are prepared&quot; (called Mueller&#x27;s law).<p>We&#x27;re 3rd in the nobel prizes by country per capita race, and 2nd in the capita nominal GDP for countries. We do a lot of things very well, taking risks or bluffing is just not one of them.<p>In my mind, what makes Switzerland not the ideal &quot;secure software&quot; country is the scandals with the phony frontends for crypto companies that are CIA owned, but Swiss branded.')
