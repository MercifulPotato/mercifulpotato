But if we can&#x27;t even get people to use buttons instead of divs, if even that turns into some kind of controversy... I don&#x27;t know, maybe developers shouldn&#x27;t get to make that choice, maybe the web should force you to use buttons.<p>Most developers only get to make that choice as long as visibility over their work is shitty enough that any time spent on accessibility is lost in the noise.<p>The button stuff is one of the few things that could (and should) just be done by default, because it doesn&#x27;t take any extra effort like a lot of accessibility work. But then again, most devs are working in environments where whatever they would just make a plain old button gets loved to death by some design genius with nothing better to do that week and &quot;signed off on&quot; by 15 people before the dev even hears about it. Then they&#x27;re making a quick decision between throwing accessibility under the bus (and suffering absolutely zero consequences for it) or pissing off literally everyone that has anything to do with their next round of performance reviews.')
