How many people have to die before it can&#x27;t be brushed away with &quot;we&#x27;re sorry&quot;?<p>Out of all the actors who pushed for illegal wars and ignored war crimes, you&#x27;d have to be crazy to give the NYT the majority of the blame. If you trust their apology, they&#x27;ve been sloppy rather than malicious.<p>&gt; The emails have not been disproven.<p>Just because some parts are true doesn&#x27;t mean what right wing media makes of them aren&#x27;t conspiracies. I&#x27;m very certain this story will disappear after Tuesday and there won&#x27;t be any legal repercussions whatsoever.<p>&gt; You seem to have erroneously accused me of defending Fox News.<p>You equated them by calling them all bottom feeders when it&#x27;s painfully obvious that they operate on different value systems and level of integrity.')
