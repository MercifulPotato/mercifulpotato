The first thing I noticed of the old team was using a &quot;screen-ruler&quot; app&#x2F;extension to calculate pixels of the Photoshoped Mockups and translate them to HTML&#x2F;CSS. It was their must-have default weapon for the front-end engineers.<p>I fired&#x2F;relocated almost all of them except for few good ones, who were eager to move onwards.<p>I spent every week teaching the team, old and newly hired ones, to unlearn whatever they learnt so far. There is no pixel-mapping, no pixel-perfection. I got them to speed on vertical rhythm, modular scale, the cicada principle, et al.<p>My proudest accomplishments were the ability to get designers + developer + QA team configurations together in modular teams from the earlier designer, developer, QA departments.<p>I remember building an internal demo akin to the one in the article (Amazon.com with different view) where the sales, pre-sales, and anyone else can show it to clients to convince them that pixel perfection of what they see in the printed photoshop mockups do not make sense. So, instead of using terms such as &quot;Mobile, Desktop, Tablets&quot;, we started using mostly terms such as &quot;screens&quot; and they can be small, medium, large or huge display (TV). We even did away with almost the need for sparkling shiny Photoshop Mockup prints and graduated to wireframes, and style tiles for mockups.<p>These ideas were applied to some prominent clients such as Car2Go, JP Morgan, DMart, Aditya Birla, MyDeposits, ZestMoney, etc.')
