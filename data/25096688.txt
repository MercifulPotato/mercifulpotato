Gather those for a couple of days, and you have a good map of the user. More so if you have an ID of machine and the actual executable hash.<p>2) &quot;But we are the good guys&quot; is a non-defense. Good guys can turn bad, they can be coerced by the bad guys, and<p>3) since the requests fly out in plain text, there is an unknown number of questionably-aligned guys in between capable of sniff your data. You only need one bad enough guy to get into serious trouble if that&#x27;s what they want.<p>This is not alarmist. It&#x27;s just common sense. The same common sense that you use to avoid certain neighborhoods at certain times of night.')
