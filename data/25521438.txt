Clicking this brings up a list of all chats and people who have messaged your directly. Selecting a name blocks a user.<p>Maybe even easier is pressing and long holding the name of someone who has sent you a message. In the vertical dots menu is then an option to block the user.<p>I&#x27;m running v7.1.3 from F-Droid.<p>I do agree though that an option to block direct messages from those not in my Contacts, or at least some kind of review process to allow a specific message from someone not in Contacts, could be a nice addition.')
