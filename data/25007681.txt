If you are interested in using software that interoperates with C++ well, like the Unreal engine, then use C++. If you are interested in embedded programming for small systems, C++ is a reasonable choice.<p>If you just want to get stuff done, C++ can introduce additional complexity and get in the way. C++ is more difficult to learn and it is more difficult to reason about programs in C++ compared to languages like Go or Rust. C++ programs often suffer from memory errors, even if you have world-class programmers on your team, and debugging memory errors can be both challenging and time-consuming.')
