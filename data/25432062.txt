You have seen that infinitude of demands on American cable and network TV news. I specifically identify that medium as antithetical to the far left. American conservatives seem not to be able to differentiate e.g. Adam Schiff from Michael Parenti. No human capable of respiration is actually that stupid, so this tragic misunderstanding must be due to the ignorance that is carefully fostered by American news media firms.<p>The people who advocate censorship vote for all the same wars and inhuman abuses that you vote for. They&#x27;re closer to your position than to mine. If they have anything to their credit, it is that they are less explicitly racist.')
