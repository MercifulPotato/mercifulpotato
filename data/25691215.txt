Though I will argue that the assumption that the Capitol Police answers to the legislature is shaky, at best (in practice). If I had to guess who is more likely to refuse an unlawful order, I&#x27;d say a member of the military, rather than the police, based on my limited knowledge of their respective cultures. Combined with the idea of police officers who believe they are part of a semi-secret, ad-hoc, patriot&#x27;s army, things can go wrong indeed.<p>Let&#x27;s do a thought experiment: <i>let&#x27;s say</i> there are a few elements in the police who are active QAnon believers, sprinkled in at various levels. Let&#x27;s also assume some more force members are not believers, <i>per se</i>, but sympathize with the cause, and are willing to look aside since they may dislike some legislators who they see as enabling BLM, Antifa and other un-American actors (in their eyes) and believe that something &quot;weird&quot; happened with the elections and&#x2F;or the whole establishment is dirty.
