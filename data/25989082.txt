The war in Iraq has outlasted 3 US presidents, so clearly &quot;different leadership&quot; just doesn&#x27;t work in practice.<p>IMO the US should completely change the modus operandi. &quot;Invade &amp; install new regime &amp; call it democratic &amp; steal oil&quot; just isn&#x27;t a good proposition for the local population. Unless the US can improve the proposition (to match China&#x27;s &quot;we give you lots of money and improve your quality of life&quot;) foreign military interventions just won&#x27;t work.')
