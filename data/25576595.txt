Because it&#x27;s human nature - people don&#x27;t want to accept they are riding a meme, and lack objectivity.<p>...<p>&quot;This is made by popular media, movies. Most scientists live normal life, create families, try separate work from life, therefore research does not come from worldview. &quot;<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re maybe grasping what I am saying.<p>It&#x27;s <i>normative</i> for people, especially serious people, to be wrapped up in a &#x27;world view&#x27;.<p>Businessmen talk about &#x27;free markets&#x27; all day long, often completely ignoring real externalities.<p>Socialist politicians, clouded by their goodwill, are often dangerously unaware of basic economics, the realities of Supply and Demand.<p>Military Generals may sometimes see a possible &#x27;military solution to every geopolitical problem&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s even &#x27;more normal&#x27; for someone working on something arcane and abstract to be tied up in their passion and ambition.<p>Case and Point: String Theory.<p>It seems as though String Theory is probably mostly hogwash.<p>How many String Theorists would admit that? Or even the very real possibility of it?<p>And how many will take their &#x27;belief&#x27; to the grave?<p>It&#x27;s obviously not &#x27;entirely a waste&#x27; - but if Science wants to really maintain credibility, it needs a giant dose of self awareness there - and also with the &#x27;reproducibility&#x27; problem.<p>Edit: for some nice examples of cultish, self re-affirming behaviour [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;~woit&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;?p=9375" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.columbia.edu&#x2F;~woit&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;?p=9375</a>')
