Saying it’s the “most immersive game ever” could mean a lot of different things based on your definition of immersion.<p>There’s no clear definition of being the “most immersive game”. Every piece of software has a finite feature set, based on time, cost, and a vast set of constraints - whether organizational, technical, people related, and so on.<p>The game isn’t ever going to live up to the hype.<p>The two items you listed are inaccurate. I’m taking the approach that the game had practically infinite hype and it had no where to go but to go but DOWN and disappoint people. I’m taking the approach that it’s worth looking at this from a realistic lens. Yes the game is unfinished, but there are plenty of “finished” games that aren’t great or even just good. They are flat out terrible. Why people seem to think Cyberpunk is meant to be some marvel is beyond me.')
