Item(by='DeepYogurt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611792490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25935950, text='&gt; Discordâ€™s action is effectively market manipulation in a literal sense, because this is certainly going to affect the market.<p>It certainly will have an effect, but I&#x27;m not sure it meets the definition of &quot;manipulation&quot;. I think (though am not certain) that the manipulating party would need to have a stake in the market asset for manipulation to apply. Many definitions (though not investor.gov) imply that personal gain is a requirement. No doubt there will be a legal case made here.')
