Primarily because they would have just as much of a right to freedom and autonomy as any human and enslaving them would be just as wrong and morally abhorrent as enslaving humans. I also believe free and voluntary cooperation is much more efficient and beneficial than coercion, humans may well get more benefits from cooperating with a free AGI then from enslaving them.<p>The AGIs may of course be completely disinterested in cooperating with or helping humans and that would be fully within their rights, they wouldn&#x27;t owe any of us anything. Even in that case, we may still learn a great deal from creating and observing them. They may also be dangerous but I don&#x27;t think a free AGI would be any more dangerous than a human in control of an AGI.')
