When I&#x27;m actually using variables in expressions or as arguments to functions, as opposed to when I&#x27;m declaring them, the code is essentially the same in a typed language and in an untyped language.<p>Realizing when I&#x27;m writing that the expression I&#x27;m about to type is wrong because the types do not match still depends on my doing type checking in my head.<p>It seems to me that the case where typed wins is when my in-head type checker fails and I write something that is invalid. The typed language will catch that failure at compile time. The untyped won&#x27;t catch it until runtime (and maybe not even then).<p>For the typed language, an IDE might be able to catch a mistake immediately so I don&#x27;t have to wait until compilation to find it, and that immediate feedback might prevent me from writing dozens more lines with the same mistake, but even then I was using my in-head type checker to write that first mistake for the IDE to catch.')
