Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=[25082917], score=None, time=1605278443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082010, text='I don&#x27;t know why a raspberry pi is supposed to be a good device to learn programming other than the fact that it forces you to use Linux. Do kids really ssh into their raspberry pi from their phones? Or do they really buy an expensive screen, expensive cases and expensive peripherals adding up to $200?<p>I also doubt that raspberry pis are actually the type of device that schools are interested in. What they&#x27;d want is the TI-84 equivalent of a laptop. It should be easy to reset the laptop to factory conditions and it would only run a few specific preinstalled programs (one of which would be a barebones IDE, probably for Java). To me it feels like the raspberry pi fails at all of these. You have to mess with hardware and then mess with the software. A school provided Chromebook with student accounts managed by the school would be way more practical.<p>However, if you actually want people to learn programming organically, it&#x27;s much simpler to just get a Windows laptop and use that as the main device.')
