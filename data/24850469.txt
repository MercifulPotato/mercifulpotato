Outside the lab, animals including pet cats and dogs, tigers and lions at zoos, and farmed mink have also caught the virus â€” probably from people.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-01449-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-01449-8</a><p>So, coronaviruses can hang out in animals, which makes it really hard to eradicate because it will just keep showing up. With Polio, however, if you kill it in humans, it&#x27;s not hanging out in animals, and it&#x27;s just <i>goooone.</i><p>Plus, with Poliovirus, vaccine adoption was high because the thing <i>paralyzes children.</i> As a result, parents who were considering vaccination were sort of faced with a very straightforward question: &quot;Do you want your child to be in a wheelchair for the rest of their life like the neighbor&#x27;s kid, or do you want to give them a quick vaccine?.&quot; With COVID, we don&#x27;t have such a clear-cut causal relationship in terms of &quot;give your children this vaccine or XYZ really bad things will happen to your kid.&quot; If you don&#x27;t vaccinate them now, as a parent, you won&#x27;t have to explain to them 10-years down the road why you&#x27;re the reason they have to spend the rest of their life in a wheelchair. So, although it&#x27;s a bit premature to say anything, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that vaccine adoption will be a little lower.')
