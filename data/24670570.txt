Humans were just as smart 3000 years ago as they were today. The difference between today and back then is that people were much poorer and didnt receive an education. Their jobs were farming which didnt require things we consider essential like reading or writing which meant they stay unchallenged for their entire life. When you look at the rich elite or rich cities in the past then you see how small the difference between us and the people 3000 years ago is. They were just as smart but there were fewer of them. Nowadays everyone is educated and &quot;rich&quot;.<p>You can still find people who are just as &quot;unchallenged&quot; as a medieval peasant today. Look in rural places of countries like china.')
