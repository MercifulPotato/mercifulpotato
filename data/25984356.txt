Item(by='jude-', descendants=None, kids=[25985787], score=None, time=1612140903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25984251, text='&gt; There is no legitimate sense in which PoS _is_ an instance of &quot;rich have more power and get richer&quot; but PoW is not.<p>In PoW, miners must sell their tokens to buy capital-intensive mining equipment and power to stay competitive.  In PoS, stakers have no incentive to sell enough tokens to anyone who could turn around and stake them as a competitor, since that would cut into the seller&#x27;s future staking rewards.<p>&gt; The 1&#x2F;3 bound is for safety-under-asynchrony (a form of safety for which PoW&#x27;s security margin is zero). If you assume synchrony, then PoS protocols&#x27; safety approaches 50% much like PoW does.<p>First, consensus protocols can be trivially safe regardless of the network&#x27;s behavior -- you simply require a majority vote for any proposed agreement.  Second, any consensus protocol can only remain live as long as there are no more than f faults out of 3f+1 replicas.  This is again irrespective of the network model -- Leslie Lamport&#x27;s proofs do not make any assumptions about the network.')
