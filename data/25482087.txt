Because most people have only been able to buy units at double the normal price via scalpers, people have been buying way less games than normal. Which means that if this continues, developers just won&#x27;t make games for these consoles and people won&#x27;t buy them. The enormous failure of Cyberpunk is only further increasing this risk, by preventing people from spending money on actual finished games.')
