If so: because Twitter has a moderation strategy in place that clearly isn&#x27;t perfect but has proven to AWS that they&#x27;re taking it seriously.<p>If you actually meant why wasn&#x27;t @blcklivesmatter kicked off twitter I guess I&#x27;m not sure what relevance that has to Parler being kicked off AWS.  But my first guess would be: because they deleted the offending tweets and stopped making repeated posts calling for violence?<p>I don&#x27;t use twitter, do you have some examples of recent @blcklivesmatter tweets that are actively calling for violence against elected officials that haven&#x27;t been moderated or removed?')
