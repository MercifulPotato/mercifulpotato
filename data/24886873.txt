Taleb is not being specific that he&#x27;s talking about variance of performance in his claim. That is only one way to measure the relationship between two things (via covariance and then correlation). But it&#x27;s not the only way. In fact Taleb&#x27;s claim is actually underspecified here, so in lieu of rebutting it with a calculation of Pearson&#x27;s <i>r</i>, the author should try to critique it more holistically.<p>As it stands, an R^2 of 0.356 is not actually a refutation of Taleb&#x27;s &quot;5 - 13%&quot;. Taleb probably shouldn&#x27;t have quantified his point without some rigor behind it, but the author&#x27;s single counterexample doesn&#x27;t substantively respond to it.')
