You can distribute precompiled libraries, but I think given that one of Zigs prominent features is simple cross-compilation to all sorts of platforms, compiling from source is preferred.<p>The @import method is only for &quot;importing&quot; C headers with declarations and have them automatically converted to Zig interface declarations (so in most cases you don&#x27;t need manually maintained language bindings). For compiling the associated C soure files, Zig has a builtin C compiler.')
