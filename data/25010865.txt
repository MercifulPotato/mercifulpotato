(Check for example the video of the &quot;Chengdu Motor Show&quot; by FullyChargedShow on YT.)\nRelevant to the topic at hand, it seems that the &quot;More Googles&quot; are more likely to be arising in China, mostly outside my reality bubble.  Some helped by market segregation enforced by the current political situation.  That&#x27;s orthogonal to the overall topic, but not irrelevant.')
