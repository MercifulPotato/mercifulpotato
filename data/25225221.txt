It&#x27;s gone political and completely anti-progress. They systematically denigrate any kind of IoT. I&#x27;m not anti-IoT per se, I think most IoT is bad but on the other hand I recognize that it can be pretty useful in many cases and once the tech become more stable it will get better.<p>What this account is doing is like systematically making fun of all the early flying machines that failed in grotesque ways, until they started working. We shouldn&#x27;t systematically attack and ridicule any attempt to innovate.')
