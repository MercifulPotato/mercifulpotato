That&#x27;s not necessarily helpful.  You can&#x27;t be sure that by winnowing down the parameter space, you&#x27;re aren&#x27;t just making an equivalent statement saying like &quot;we are fitting these points to a nth order polynomial and the derivative must be allowed to exceed <i>this value</i> instead of being constrained&quot;. In other words, constraining the properties of DM, especially in the direction of lowering the upper bound on it&#x27;s granularity and lowering the upper bound on it&#x27;s interaction with normal matter, could <i>artificially increase</i> its independent explanatory power.')
