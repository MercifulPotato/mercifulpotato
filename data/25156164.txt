This is a big and easily attacked surface that only serves to obscure and discredit the real point of wearing masks.<p>Instead the messaging should focus solely on the fact that they protect others from the infection carried (likely without knowledge) <i>by the wearer</i>, and that people without symptoms can be contagious.<p>This point needs to be drilled into people&#x27;s heads until everyone gets it. People also need to be taught to wear masks properly. Wearing one with nose sticking out is darn near useless.')
