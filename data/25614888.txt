So, if you stop polluting you would quickly lose relevance, be forced to shut down plants, be forced to fire lots of decent people, and eventually go out of business.<p>Moreover, when the company was started, <i>no one anywhere</i> realized that polluting rivers was so bad for everyone. No one knew back then; no one thought of it as a problem.<p>Your choices are: (a) act in the best interest of society and get f#cked by competitors; or (b) remain a dominant force in the market, but as a side effect, f#ck everybody. All your options appear to be a mix of those two horrible choices.<p>What would <i>you</i> do?')
