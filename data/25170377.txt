Other than &#x27;this is the way it has always been and I refuse to change my mind&#x27;?<p>It is interesting how the immediate use-cases dictate our first opinions of the technology.<p>As I stated in one of the first comments of this thread: I am working on a self-hosted crypto payment gateway and I am providing a &quot;Stripe Checkout&quot; widget for those that want to set up a payment workflow inside their website.<p>I <i>could</i> do exactly what Stripe does and make one good-looking widget and just give the user the option to change some things like color scheme. But two things go against that: first, I am a <i>terrible</i> designer, so I am sure that anything that I come up with will not be as nice what Stripe does. Second, it is an open source project and I would rather have more people feeling encouraged to contribute their own different themes than trying to enforce &quot;my&quot; styling, which we already established will be bad.<p>What am going to do, then, if not ensure that I write the components without <i>any</i> predefined styling and perhaps offer an open source repository of &quot;themes&quot; - like CSS Zen Garden?<p>So, there you have it. My reason to argue for a &quot;pure&quot; HTML structure is not just out of some idealist out-of-touch mentality.<p>&gt; When someone comes up with a popular style-free standard, assuming that&#x27;s practically possible and good enough to become popular, I&#x27;d happily switch to that.<p>Honest question: would you pay for funding this? I think this haven&#x27;t come to be is because it&#x27;s much easier to sell a &quot;turn-key&quot; system than something that is flexible enough to get other developers to say &quot;I could&#x27;ve done that as well.&quot;')
