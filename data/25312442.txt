There is nobody out there with 60 trillion.<p>Regardless, the billionaire has to actually spend the money to get goods and services from the market. While his&#x2F;her needs will dwarf an individual, they are still just a drop in the bucket compared to the middle class. This is why all of the largest companies&#x2F;product markets&#x2F;etc all cater to the middle class.<p>The only way billionaires can actually get leverage on how society is run is through direct monetary influence of politicians, but thatâ€™s going to happen whether the average income is $60k or $200k.')
