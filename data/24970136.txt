Our product is a number-crunching tool that&#x27;s a bit like a spreadsheet and a bit like programming. Our vision is to be the de-facto way for anyone to work with numbers on a computer.<p>We&#x27;re very early stage, but well-funded by some great investors across the US and Europe, and ready to make our first hire.<p>---<p>Role: Full-stack Engineer<p>Our stack is React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;TypeScript on the frontend, and Node&#x2F;TypeScript on the backend. We&#x27;re looking for engineers who have experience with these technologies.<p>Our product primarily consists of a web UI on the frontend and a computation engine on the backend. The product needs a low floor and a high ceiling â€” it should be simple enough for anyone to get started with, but powerful enough for really complex use-cases. Performance is paramount on both the frontend and backend.<p>Our next big project is a rewrite of the computation engine to efficiently handle models with up to 1M nodes. The challenge is to show the user instant results (frontend) when possible and run complex operations (Monte-Carlo simulations, API calls) on the backend. We also want to improve our multi dimensional modeling capabilities which leads to various UI&#x2F;UX challenges.<p>Our roadmap contains more projects we&#x27;re planning to work on: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;00f79272b4ec4d6790ec98120788d850" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;00f79272b4ec4d6790ec98120788d850</a>.<p>---<p>We have a nice office in London (UK) but are also open to remote hires. If this sounds interesting then I&#x27;d love to chat! taimur (at) causal.app')
