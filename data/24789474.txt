Including every time you take your work laptop home and check your personal email on it.<p>But the IRS right now doesn’t enforce those small amounts. They only care when you use the corporate jet for personal travel.<p>But when you leave, if they let you keep the stuff, they either have to include the depreciated value as income on your last check or you have to pay them for it.<p>When I left my first job they let me keep my computer and phone and I paid them $60 for it, which was the legal depreciated value.')
