I&#x27;ve read somewhere that it takes about 10 exposures to learn a new word. I was seeing certain words once a year (I track how often I look up vocabulary), it would have taken me a decade to learn those words naturally, and those obscure words are likely to be the most important words in the sentence, which means that if you don&#x27;t know it, you miss the point of the sentence entirely. Anki exposure isn&#x27;t like real in-context exposure, so it might take more than 10 passes to learn the word, but it should take less than a decade.')
