Item(by='koheripbal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611616993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908724, text='I run a small company, and offer local business financial services.<p>A few years ago, I setup my Google My Business listing for my retail location.<p>Late last year I was trying to do a GSUITE account data export.  It requires you to setup 2FA and I couldn&#x27;t get it to work - so I asked our MSP to help since they help with other stuff.  They had better luck, but multiple switching of the 2FA options and recovery emails&#x2F;phone numbers caused an automatic suspension on the admin account.<p>I was able to quickly unlock the account with another admin account, but the suspension cascaded to Google My Business, which remains suspended because GSUITE support only support their core apps.<p>As you can imagine, my appeal went unresponded, and here we are, months later, with no business listing, and literally no ability to contact anyone that can help.<p>I wonder how many other businesses have stories like this.')
