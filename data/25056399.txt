Item(by='maxgashkov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605081536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25050560, text='&gt; Can pure DNS site filtering really work these days? I have to imagine more and more of the internet is behind cloudflare &#x2F; cloudfront &#x2F; etc, and you probably can&#x27;t block&#x2F;grant access to a single site without catching a bunch of unrelated ones as well.<p>You&#x27;re thinking about IP filtering. When site is behind Cloudflare&#x2F;Cloudfront&#x2F;... it _may_ share an IP with some other site, but it will most probably have a distinct DNS name that can be filtered upon during DNS resolution.<p>pi-hole&#x2F;nextdns do this quite successfully for adblocking on network layer.')
