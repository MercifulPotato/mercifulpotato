That&#x27;s why so many towns have only one hospital - it&#x27;s a government granted monopoly like cable companies in the 80s.<p>Differential pricing is also illegal. You fly cheap on Sunday at 3am, expensive on Monday at 9am. Healthcare providers are not allowed to charge less when it&#x27;s cheap to do so, for example allowing you to do an MRI cheaper at 3am.<p>Your employer picks a monopoly insurer for you to chose a plan from.<p>The list goes on and on. There&#x27;s no market here, it&#x27;s a set of monopolies. It should be legal to open a hospital. Differential pricing should be legal. Your employer should let you chose from at least two insurers.')
