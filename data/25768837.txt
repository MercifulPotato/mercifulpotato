I used it until I upgraded to a faster one, but the reason it&#x27;s still running is that it provides the longest 2.4GHz range which is perfect for a large house. I&#x27;ve tried Ubiquity, newer ASUS routers and the range is shorter and their devices prefers to connect to the WRT54G. And my parents don&#x27;t need super fast wifi, just a stable one.')
