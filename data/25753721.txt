It proves the positive quickly (search for &quot;foo&quot;, see &quot;here&#x27;s how to use foo&quot;), but never lets you prove the absence of documentation (search for &quot;foobar&quot;, nothing comes up, search for &quot;foo bar&quot;, nothing comes up, search for the previous codename &quot;barbaz&quot;, nothing comes up... did you forget something, or is there just no documentation&#x2F;discussion?  you&#x27;ll never know.  the result is that people stop reading documentation.)')
