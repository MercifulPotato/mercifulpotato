Sounds like the kind of space where the lab&#x2F;hackerspace could even foster a few inventions worth sharing.<p>Would we continue to work remotely in an effort to finance our homestead project and hackerspace?<p>Ive got some experience with, and manuals on permaculture food forests. I come with a modest, yet specialized seed collection for utility plants.<p>But the specifics of the chosen plants are intimately tied to the region where you&#x27;re planting, even specific qualities of the land you acquire.<p>Specifically, a stream running through is essential. If it is uphill of the rest of the property? That is <i>ideal.</i><p>Just in case, I feel the need to bring this up: Dont purchase any land for growing food without a thorough soil analysis focusing on toxic metals and chemicals.<p>The nutrients needed to grow food? We can build that up with a few different composting methods. Native Weeds? Are just volunteers to help rebuild healthier soil, even if we end up pulling them later.<p>A native variety of pine tree will be the centerpiece of what we plant, to feed the dirt from below (and prune it yearly to be 6ft tall, to feed the dirt from above with the mulch).<p>A desireable fungus will be selected. Oyster mushrooms are usually a safe choice, especially if the soil needs several years of cleaning.<p>Beyond that? We should select several varieties of food-bearing plants, and their plant-guild mates. The goal will be to mimic the layers of a jungle - even down to the vines and tubers. All of these can provide different food crops, depending on the USDA zone, soil, and what&#x27;s native.<p>Nut trees will be necessary for healthy growth, and distinct from fruit trees - usually even a different layer of the tree&#x27;s canopy. The initial pine trees will not be sufficient in this case, as their growth <i>will</i> be stunted to feed the topsoil. If there is a need for firewood? We should choose to include that as well.<p>If the property reaches a sufficient scale? There can even be distinct zones of different soil &#x2F; environment types.<p>Well short of this scale, it will be necessary to build a greenhouse. Shipping live plants never turns out perfectly, and acclimating generations of plants to this plot? Sometimes needs a gentle, controlled beginning, even for native plants.<p>If we want any form of livestock? That will take quite a bit of grazing land, and a near-equal portion to grow feed for during the winter.<p>Chickens come to mind as relatively beginner friendly, and useful for a light aerating of the soil. Besides... Those eggs tho.<p>Keeping local predators out requires more than a fence - line the fence on the outside with fragrant, possibly even poisonous plants as well. Wolf&#x27;s Bane (aka Monk&#x27;s hood) was used in the US civil war to protect then-standard, currently-shallow graves from carrion eaters. This is often sold as one of the most poisonous plants known. Any foodcrops grown in direct contact, even under the dirt, should be considered poisoned. Never handle without gloves, and the wash-water from the gloves is to be considered black-water.<p>Though, lets be honest, that sort of plant is the last resort. In most cases? A THOROUGHLY CONTAINED peppermint patch is overkill enough. Lavender usually fills this role well, especially when a patch reaches maturity.')
