No wonder it can fly a long way if it&#x27;s massive.<p>For energy density comparison, check the Wikipedia list of energy density of various things[1], starts with Antimatter highest, then nuclear fuels, Hydrogen[3] at the top of the chemical fuels with ~140 MegaJoules per Kilogram, then all the hydrocarbon fossil fuels hang around 45-55 MJ&#x2F;Kg, body fat comes in around 38, coal around 30, wood around 18, glucose around 15, Lithium-air battery at 9, household waste at 8, and the highlight of our modern electronics lifestyle Lithium-ion battery at 0.3-0.9, barely ahead of flywheel at 0.3-0.5.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_density#Tables_of_energy_content" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_density#Tables_of_energ...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armytimes.com&#x2F;resizer&#x2F;-965_SXAhPeD1LTlB-xZuQwJvJE=&#x2F;1200x0&#x2F;filters:quality(100)&#x2F;arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;BEXU22MH7JEKTPZMAEC3IJH57I.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.armytimes.com&#x2F;resizer&#x2F;-965_SXAhPeD1LTlB-xZuQwJvJ...</a><p>[3] the catch with Hydrogen is a kilogram of it is 11 cubic meters, and a lot of that energy advantage has to go into compressing or cooling it to make it usefully dense, and maintaining the infrastructure to store and transport that safely.')
