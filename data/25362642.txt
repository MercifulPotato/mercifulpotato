I cannot believe I continue to see this complete ignorance smugly repeated on HN. The vaccine has undergone three phases of testing including large scale release. It&#x27;s been &quot;baked&quot; since January, the only things fine tuned have been the exact dose of the mRNA. Given the effectiveness, it&#x27;s <i>highly</i> unlikely we&#x27;ll see a v1.1 anytime soon, if ever, but if we do it would likely have to go through similar levels of testing and would be just as &quot;pre-alpha&quot; as this.<p>&gt; On top of it you still have to wear the mask it doesn&#x27;t stop you spreading the virus.<p>Other comments have already dealt with why we&#x27;ll still need to use masks.<p>&gt;  it doesn&#x27;t stop you spreading the virus. It just reduces the severity for the people vaccinated.<p>We&#x27;re still waiting on final data on how much vaccinated people will decrease the spread, but <i>everything</i> we&#x27;ve seen so far indicates that eventual severity of illness correlates very closely with how likely you are to infect others. Even if this wasn&#x27;t true, reducing severity is <i>huge</i> since universal vaccination would then allow the virus to spread with reduced health effects savings hundreds of thousands of lives.')
