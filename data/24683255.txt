I watched many smart and talented people develop very well through these programs. However, the inter-competitiveness at such a young age could be pretty destructive, and was largely unacknowledged and unaddressed by parents and faculty. It led to a lot of stratification in the way kids perceived their peers, and themselves.<p>To give a related example, my elementary school was a designated Gifted and Talented school, colloquially referred to as GT. Kids across the county who tested well enough could opt to attend; however, the school also had students who attended as their default district elementary school. For every grade at 3rd grade and above, some of the classes were designated as GT, and some were designated as, well .... non-GT. How is a 3rd grader supposed to rationalize their class being categorized as non-GT? Are they, as the abbreviation states, neither gifted nor talented?<p>The school&#x27;s faculty would normally emphasize referring to non-GT classes as the &quot;Base&quot; classes, but I think the point remains in terms of what impact that has on a 3rd grader&#x27;s psychology.')
