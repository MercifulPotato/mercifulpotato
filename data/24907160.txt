The end of it enabled agriculture, more permanent settlements and civilization. Now we are more tied to the land, and we are far more than what we&#x27;ve been 15k years ago.<p>The argument that was made was that we can&#x27;t withstand 1.8celcius increase in temperatures as a species and we are about to go extinct. I showed that we warmed 6 celcius and benefitted.<p>&gt;Don&#x27;t look at the photo, look at the movie. You are in the middle of it. Even without our intervention, it will keep warming up because the added carbon to the system. And it is a fast movie. Take <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1732&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1732&#x2F;</a> as a reference (it is visual enough, and backed with strong enough science), it took a thousand years to change just a degree, we are doing twice of that amount in 50.<p>While I like Xkcd like the next guy. My link showed a 6 degree increase. The xkcd comic for some reason is only showing 4 celcius. So I&#x27;m questioning the veracity of the comic naturally.<p>I also see that they too have graphed the RCP8.5 as a 4 celcius increase on &#x27;the current path&#x27; which I addressed in my comments. The wiki page on RCP8.5 clearly indicates is that it&#x27;s NOT the current path and was never ever portrayed as the current path by the IPCC.<p>Furthermore, the actual path we are on given we have taken measures in the last 10+ years to reduce emissions is RCP4.5 which is 1.8 celcius. The optimistic scenario. Which is great, I am optimistic that the actions we are taking are good and working.<p>&gt;I correct myself, ice cores don&#x27;t get that far, they can be used to measure less than a million of years ago.<p>So you&#x27;re asserting all temperature record in the graphs are fabricated? Certainly makes the entire graph subject. Perhaps all of the temperature growth is fabricated?<p>&gt;The period you said that had like 12ÂºC over current temperature seem to be the Paleocene-Eocene termal maximum, google for it, it was caused by CO2 (tectonic activity in the oceans) and caused massive extinctions. And still, it was a process that lasted 10k years. We are doing that at a much faster pace.<p>You just said that we don&#x27;t really know beyond a million years ago. Googling this event as I have in the past, &quot;Discriminating between different possible causes of the PETM is difficult. Temperatures were rising globally at a steady pace, and a mechanism must be invoked to produce an instantaneous spike which may have been accentuated by positive feedbacks.&quot;<p>In other words we don&#x27;t really know. I think the more important problem is that climate change is very real, but humans were certainly not around for this one and yet it changed far greater than what is happening on Earth. It really pokes some major holes in the predictions of climate change. Especially if we are even the ones doing it.<p>&gt;That positive feedback loop may have smaller dimensions and impact (yet, at least) than what we keep doing. But will add something even if we stop adding. And it is not just adding, but what is in place already.<p>If I am understanding correctly, the positive feedback loop is set. The only possible solution to solve climate change is complete abolition of emissions. Why then does the IPCC not propose this? Why does our current path seem to be mapping to RCP4.5 and the issue not be as bad as it is?<p>&gt;Regarding the planes for 3 days, we are dealing with global yearly averages of temperatures. What happens over 3 days is weather, not climate.<p>Global temperature decreases is not weather. This is why the &quot;Green New Deal&quot; included complete ban on airplanes and large ships. Mind you, AOC was literally the only person to vote for it. It was unanimously killed by democrats and republicans.')
