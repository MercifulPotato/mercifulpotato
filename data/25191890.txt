There is a large pantry built next to the stairwell to the basement.  The side of the pantry has a hole cut in it so that you can move from the area beneath the stairwell into the pantry.  It&#x27;s a secret room if you are small enough to enter it.<p>Someone I knew growing up really had a secret room in their house.  Inside of a closet there was a wall that opened to a room that was really just the space between the walls of the room to access some ducting and the water heater.  The secret door was definitely not obvious.')
