Tesla might have some QA issues, but claiming its easy to grow 40-50% a year just because you have some QA issues is one of the single dumbest things I have ever heard.<p>And while they have some issue, the quality in terms of the actual core component of the cars is superior to what anybody else has. Not to mention things like software that absolutely suck ass on my cars.<p>Just look at all the recent issues other companies had with quality of these things. But of course those are not in the media even 1&#x2F;100 as much so people who only look for reasons to disparage Tesla find easy ammunition.')
