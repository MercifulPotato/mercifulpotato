Fedora has a concept of Critical Path packages (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fedoraproject.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Critical_path_package" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fedoraproject.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Critical_path_package</a>).  The concept is related to various activities, eg. a package is critical if is is needed when installing a graphical desktop.  But as far as I know packages are picked manually and therefore we probably miss packages or over&#x2F;underestimate criticality.')
