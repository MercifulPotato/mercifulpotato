Technically you could set UID + GID as build arguments but in practice I never ran into a scenario where this was needed because 99% of the time on a dev box your uid:gid will be 1000:1000 and in production chances are you are in control of provisioning your VPS so your deploy user will be 1000:1000 too. Also you probably won&#x27;t be using volumes, but if you did they will work out of the box with the above example.')
