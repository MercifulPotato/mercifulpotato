They have a finger print... it may not be unique or normal. But pressing their inked finger onto paper will leave a print. I assume the software is looking for common pieces of a fingerprint to work. Said software isn’t considering the edge case of a smooth or mostly smooth finger pad.<p>The fact that the government workers are letting buggy software determine eligibility for drivers licenses and passports is the real issue here. It’s really sad.<p>Just reading this makes me so frustrated. I can’t imagine how frustrating it would be to be them. I hope this article helps these men get the exposure they need to end this.')
