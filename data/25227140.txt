For example: they may recognize that taxi&#x27;s are yellow from American television and movies.  Not everyone is going to have that exposure.<p>* It assumes that there is nothing from their experience that contradicts the question.  For example: there is a business in my area that uses yellow cars with signage.  (They can do that because taxi&#x27;s in my area are not yellow.)<p>* It places a higher barrier to people who are not familiar with the cultural reference.  Sure the author figured it out, but it would take them more thought and time to figure it out than someone who is American.')
