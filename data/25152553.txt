I like Rust language because it gives a very good result &quot;on the first try&quot; - meaning, the compiler does a very good job making the program bulletproof. I don&#x27;t believe any company will give me a chance to write good, polished software. They just want whatever works. There is no refactoring, only maintenance.<p>The alternative is programming as a hobby rather than a profession. But I would need to find a comparably well paying and stimulating profession first.')
