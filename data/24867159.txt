Item(by='throw_m239339', descendants=None, kids=[24869711], score=None, time=1603441369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867104, text='&gt; Is there a way for me to have an IDE with a kind of &quot;compiler&quot; that would help me convert this to PHP 8 so I can migrate it on a more recent VM? Of course there&#x27;s 0 budget for this.<p>There is your problem. If it&#x27;s runs on PHP5 (&lt;?php phpinfo(); &#x2F;&#x2F; in a php page), it might run without hurdle on more recent versions of PHP... or not, but PHP8 isn&#x27;t a different language, they just added some stuff on top of PHP5. C extensions might break though, because yes, PHP relies heavily on them as the language is too slow to do anything meaningful like writing a database driver.')
