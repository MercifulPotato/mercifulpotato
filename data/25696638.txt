Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610164459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686391, text='From time to time, I stumble across some old message; typically an email, photo, chat or even a physical object, and I&#x27;m <i>profoundly</i> reminded of some part of my past I had completely forgotten about.<p>People I have lived with, adventures I&#x27;ve been on, jobs I&#x27;ve done, projects I&#x27;ve engaged with, academic papers I&#x27;m an author on, and especially special moments and times with loved ones.  Intimate conversations.  Photos with great stories behind them.<p>Bear in mind also that some special photos, long personal messages and even videos and voice recordings only exist in chat platforms these days.  Although I find it is mainly text that has the most profound triggering of memories.<p>I can&#x27;t make a long enough list of the kinds of things I don&#x27;t realise are in my memory until it&#x27;s jogged, and I can&#x27;t emphasise enough how <i>rich</i> the tapestry of past life parts seems to be.<p>I simply forget how rich my life has been.  How much I&#x27;ve done with other people (despite the fact I don&#x27;t spend much time with people).  How many places I&#x27;ve been, how many wonderful people I&#x27;ve been with.<p>When reminded, by accident, it&#x27;s an amazing feeling, like having a whole past self come to life for a few minutes.<p>I&#x27;m, like, &quot;wow, I&#x27;d completely forgotten&quot;, and enjoying the full VR-in-my-head experience while myriad connections are activated.<p>It&#x27;s an immensely touching and pleasurable thing to have things like that brought back, and it&#x27;s <i>completely different from ordinary remembering</i>.  It&#x27;s much more vivid, accompanied by wow feelings, and just does not happen with ordinary recall.<p>In an interesting comparison to day to day thinking, it tends to be very consistently <i>good feeling</i> too.  Most things day to day feel like a grind.  There are many awful past experiences.  But the kinds of memory activation I&#x27;m talking about tend to be associated with immensely positive, glad feelings - it&#x27;s as if those feelings need years to pass and change to happen to &quot;brew&quot; into something that is felt in a different way.<p>Dwelling in the past excessively is unhealthy.  But occasionally stumbling across something that awakens a completely forgotten and yet cherished long-lost memory-network is like getting to know myself, who I am now and who I was then, and be amazed at how much <i>larger</i> my life has been than I normally think of it day to day, no matter what I&#x27;m doing each day.<p>It only happens about twice a year I guess, if that.   When it does I&#x27;m also reminded how much larger must the set of other things be that are not being remembered, that would completely and vividly transform my view of my life, and feelings about my life, if they were to be activated.  I feel a sense of awe to recognise that my perception of myself in the present is, in some sense, tiny, blinkered and mundane compared to my actual real life, and not at all representative of the fullness of who I am, have been, and therefore will probably be in future.<p>I&#x27;m trying to say that, for me, some kinds of accidentally prompted memory-networks are incredibly valuable for obtaining perspective on life; my life, and life of people in general.<p>For me that helps me to connect better to people here and now, and I think it makes me a better person to others, in the now, to be reminded of such things.')
