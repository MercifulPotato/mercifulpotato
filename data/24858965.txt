I also integrated home automation to control the lights and audio distribution around the house using X-10. Back then, the phone were still analog and one of the X-10 light module would turns on when I get a call.  I had a Sony projector with a 105 in screen and 5.1 surround sound.  When the movie starts the lights would dim and the curtains would close.  Getting a cable card was expensive back then.  I had DirecTV so set up an IR relay with X-10 to control the channels.\nTorn out the walls to run all the wires and consolidated everything in a closet.  It was a sweet set up.  Good times.')
