Even if you do learn it all, people tend to lose knowledge they don&#x27;t use, so it may have an expiration date depending on how good your brain is. New technologies and advancements can also introduce more knowledge that becomes required to know for interviews. The pool of knowledge for interview questions might continue to grow until you&#x27;d have to study for a year or more to have a high chance of passing it.')
