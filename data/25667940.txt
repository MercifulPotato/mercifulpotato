I had a long running job that would mysterious crash after hitting an edge case after a couple of days processing. I was able set a breakpoint, fire the job off, come back in a couple of days to stopped process, and step through the busted function, patch it, then restart from one level up on the call stack, and then continue the job. If this was another language, I would have  spent much longer just figuring out what to log, and restarting the whole task while testing the job.<p>It was amazing.')
