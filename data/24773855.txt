They sandbox you into a selection of annoyingly rigid templates and a dumbed down UI and abstract the important stuff away.<p>Webflow is more of a “visual coding” platform. If you don’t know basic html&#x2F;css you’ll have a hard time using it. It spits out static sites on the front end with proper readable html&#x2F;css and SEO.<p>It’s a bit of a steep learning curve to get the hang of their UI but after a few hours, building things is insanely fast and you have control over everything.<p>I rebuilt my company’s entire site in it in about 4 hours and was blown away how easy it is to update things.<p>I’ve heard pretty much all YC companies are now using it to build their marketing sites because of this.')
