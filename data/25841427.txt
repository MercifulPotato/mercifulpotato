Would you consider yourself to be &quot;overthrowing&quot; the government by rooting out the fraud and putting in the person who you believe justly won?<p>I&#x27;m not saying they are correct about there being fraud. I don&#x27;t think they are. But the assumption is they the know the fraud is a lie and they are just deliberately lying to provide an excuse to illegitimately take over the government. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily the case. I think even Trump actually believes there was fraud to extent that he actually won.')
