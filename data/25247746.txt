High-vibe? Large and frequent temperature excursions? High mechanical loading (high-mass components or bulky ones with leverage?) What solder are you using?<p>I think there&#x27;s been a learning process since the adoption of Pb-free processes. Solder alloys have improved, package sizes have conveniently shrunk, you have underfill for BGA if necessary. Also when designing for high-vibe or large âˆ†temp, there&#x27;s lab testing (shaker table, env. chamber) work that gets done esp. for safety-related hardware<p>Like, yes, Pb-free has considerations, but so does any other component of a system. I find that I usually don&#x27;t have to give it much thought these days, and the fracture failures I&#x27;ve seen could have been mitigated by design changes rather than returning to Pb solder.')
