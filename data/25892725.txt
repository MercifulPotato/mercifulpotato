I grew up in what, at least at the time, would probably properly be called ex-urban and live somewhere similar today (on 5 acres next neighbors with a lot more land as well as conservation land but within a few miles of plenty of stores, etc.).<p>I&#x27;ve never had much interest in classical suburbia but I do like cities--at least to visit.<p>2 hours gets you way out of even most Northeastern US cities. I&#x27;m about 90 minutes to get into Boston at rush hour if I time it right and less in the evening. I&#x27;ve actually commuted into the city--I also have a pretty convenient commuter rail--for some days for about a year and a half. It wouldn&#x27;t have been sustainable long-term though.')
