Even then, most of us have a lifetime of baggage to let go of, as we&#x27;ve been taught to idealize superachievers and geniuses, and despise underachievers and mediocrity from an early age.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the start of one of my favorite <i>Hardcore History</i> episodes -- the first of the <i>Death Throes of the Republic</i> series[1]:<p><i>I want you to think back to the house you grew up in as a child.  I want you to picture a room in that house that didn&#x27;t exist.  I want you to pretend it did, and the whole time you were a young child, growing up in to your adolescence and until you leave home you&#x27;re aware of this room in the house.</i><p><i>The room has faces on the wall, dead people&#x27;s faces -- the faces of dead people who were related to you.  The faces are made of wax, and they were made immediately upon death of the individual whose face it was.</i><p><i>The wax was put on the face and, like a modern version of a wax museum, an accurate representation of your dead ancestor&#x27;s dead face was made and was put on your wall connected by a painted line to his ancestor, your even earlier ancestor whose wax face made after death is also on the wall, and that is connected by another line to his ancestor whose wax mask is there as well.</i><p><i>These may have been full color versions of these ancestors of yours and their names were there and from your very earliest childhood memory you&#x27;re aware of this room, and you are aware of who these people are and you are aware of what they did.  It&#x27;s sort of freaky, though, isn&#x27;t it?  Now you know how Julius Caesar felt growing up.</i><p><i>Now I remember being terrified by paintings -- completely innocuous paintings -- in my house when I was a child, and I know my children get freaked out at the slightest thing like that, but to Julius Caesar and people like him this &quot;ancestor room&quot; as it&#x27;s sometimes called, had a profound effect on firing their ambition.</i><p><i>The ancient historian Sallust said that the Romans described their children&#x27;s spirits as blazing like flames when they would look at the sight.  The ancient historian Polybius said, &quot;It would be hard to imagine a more impressive scene for a youth who aspires to win fame and practice virtue.&quot;</i><p><i>To these people who spent time amongst the Romans or who were Roman themselves, they thought this was a good way to create in your young people this desire for achievement which was the hallmark of Roman society during this time period...</i><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dancarlin.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;hardcore-history-death-throes-of-the-republic-series&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dancarlin.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;hardcore-history-death-thr...</a>')
