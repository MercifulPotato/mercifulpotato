How will the (cocaine) tourism and local &amp; international communities be effected when people start dying because of overdosing or potential violent behaviour under the effect of these harmful drugs? Will a potential decrease of violence in one area be surpassed by potentially increased violent behaviour due to cocaine + alcohol and other drug consumption? I am very skeptical about legalising such hard drugs, especially when people fail to mention any negative consequences...')
