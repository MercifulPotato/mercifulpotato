They do not imply that Jeremy is considered guilty -- they say that the issue is unresolved:<p>It&#x27;s very unclear to me if they meant to say Jeremy was not guilty when they talked to him at a certain point in time or if he is still not guilty.<p>&gt;Their language does not seem to put the onus on Jeremy:<p>What you quoted also says:<p>&gt;outlined in the appeals process of our enforcement guide.<p>Are appeals automatic in the enforcement guide or is an appeal already pending?<p>edit: And if he was never found guilty then why is this an appeals process. Doesn&#x27;t that usually mean an initial judgement was rendered and is being appealed?')
