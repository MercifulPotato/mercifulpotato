In the version of this essay published in Crises of the Republic, she writes:<p>&gt; It is, I think, a rather sad reflection on the present state of political science that our terminology does not distinguish among such key words as power, strength, force, authority, and, finally, violence – all of which refer to distinct, different phenomena and would hardly exist unless they did.<p>In other words, power is not reducible to some combination of &quot;force and deception&quot;.  In the edited version of this essay, she even defines each of these categories:<p>&gt; <i>Power</i> corresponds to the human ability not just to act but to act in concert. Power is never the property of an individual; it belongs to a group and remains in existence only so long as the group keeps together.<p>&gt; <i>Strength</i> unequivocally designates something in the singular ...<p>&gt; <i>Force</i>  ... should be reserved, in terminological language, for the &quot;forces of nature&quot; or the &quot;force of circumstances,&quot; that is, to indicate the energy released by physical or social movements.<p>&gt; <i>Authority</i> can be vested in persons – there is such a thing as personal authority, as for instance, in the relation between parent and child, between teacher and pupil – or it can be vested in offices, as, for instance, in the Roman senate or in the hierarchical offices of the Church. (A priest can grant valid absolution even though he is drunk.) Its hallmark is unquestioning recognition by those who are asked to obey; neither coercion nor persuasion is needed.<p>&gt; <i>Violence</i>, finally, as I have said, is distinguished by its instrumental character. Phenomenologically, it is close to strength, since the implements of violence, like all other tools, are designed and used for the purpose of multiplying natural strength...<p>Taken from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fsmitha.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;arendt.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fsmitha.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;arendt.html</a> because I don&#x27;t have a text version of this essay, but you can find it here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monoskop.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;7&#x2F;70&#x2F;Arendt_Hannah_Crises_of_the_Republic.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monoskop.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;7&#x2F;70&#x2F;Arendt_Hannah_Crises_of_the...</a> (154 of the pdf).<p>The point is that, for Arendt, power is not about coercion and it&#x27;s not about deception or force.  It&#x27;s about consensus, shared opinions and judgements, and the proof of this consensus, which is a group of people&#x27;s ability to act in concert.')
