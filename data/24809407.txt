It is almost like your &#x27;everything needs an ID&#x27; argument is complete bullshit because the very existence of these voters shows it to be false.<p>A voter ID may streamline the process, but it is not necessary to maximize <i>valid</i> voter participation because it has been conclusively shown that it inhibits <i>valid</i> voter participation while at the same time <i>invalid</i> voter participation is not a problem that exists and therefore is not something that needs to be solved.<p>The nicest thing I have to say about people making voter ID claims is that while they are clearly using a dog whistle at least they don&#x27;t say the quiet part out loud, or at least not until quite recently.')
