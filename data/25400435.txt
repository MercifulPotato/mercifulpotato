The level edit capability offered so much freedom.<p>You can find my first level, “chut” out on the internet. My other, better levels, are lost to me.<p>I reverse engineered something I saw in a demo level, where they took doors, triggered them to “open” both vertically and horizontally and set them at the half way point to create “corner” pieces.<p>No other maps had these pieces, and I was fascinated with the idea of using them to create terrain. I ended up making a “quilt” like structure of ramps and corner pieces to make a unique arena. I had not taken any upper level geometry yet so I was just doing it by trial and error. Fun times.<p>I also found you could import wav files and trigger them so I made a jukebox level, which was absolutely massive (uncompressed audio!).<p>I remember sharing these maps by trying to lure people to join my server, but transferring them could take some time because I was on 26.4 modem at the time.<p>Avara was probably my first “development” experience... amazing.')
