It was a very significant shift in chip design philosophy. Intel being ahead in fab tech didn&#x27;t hurt, but it&#x27;s far from their only strength.\nThere&#x27;s no reason to believe M1 will open any sort of gates for Arm on PC. It&#x27;s not like other Arm CPUs will be running Mac OS, or M1s will be running Windows. The whole pre-Intel period for Mac OS didn&#x27;t do anything to diminish x86 on the desktop.<p>Now, Chromebooks are something of an argument for ARM on the desktop, as they at least seem to provide identical behavior regardless of ISA, but they aren&#x27;t putting up the necessary numbers quite yet. x86 still owns PC gaming, and has a pretty solid hold on console gaming. I&#x27;m not going to be worried at all for Intel until that shifts too.')
