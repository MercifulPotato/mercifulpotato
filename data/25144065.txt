I also see tons upon tons of vanilla JS React components, all ready to go where you can drop in CSS class names and you&#x27;re done.<p>Someone not using React with Tailwind is left with basically having to implement everything on their own, or try to stitch together a bunch of libs that others have written with their own individual opinions and lack of standards. It&#x27;s a much different world. It&#x27;s a world where you can spend 10 hours trying to get a responsive drop down working instead of 10 seconds with Bootstrap.')
