The book is a sort of walkthrough of programming. It walks you through writing a number of programs iteratively, as in it starts with the most naive approaches and gradually improves upon them. That makes it a very involving process (because, like a good story, it starts in a common place and then takes you somewhere). It also introduces you to a lot of exciting things, especially if you&#x27;re not that experienced.
