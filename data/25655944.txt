While we were doing it together, he was engaged and enjoying it.  His ability to understand and learn was never a challenge.<p>The challenge was that actually programming was apparently not his interest.  He was more interested in story and puzzle design, and as he got older those interests expanded while programming just completely fell away.<p>Most people could program if they wanted, assuming they had an adequate teacher.  But if they do not have the desire and drive, then it&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>Edit - now I also recall that before the Python game effort, I got him started on Scratch, gave him a goal to make a simple Mario clone, and left him to it.  A day later, he had made good progress but quickly lost interest and no longer wanted to work on it or talk about it.')
