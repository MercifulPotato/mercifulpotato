Item(by='auganov', descendants=None, kids=[25868683, 25866947, 25866814], score=None, time=1611275084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865845, text='IMO the likeliest explanation is the lethality of novichok is way overblown or generally misunderstood. Skripals&#x27; poisoning had a very similar progression (the two targets survived after a coma [0], another inadvertently exposed person survived, one has died). Most anecdotes about Novichok&#x27;s incredible lethality are stories out of Russia where use of Novichok was merely alleged. It&#x27;s weird they&#x27;d botch 2 high profile assassination attempts like this if upping the dose a bit guarantees death.<p>[0] I&#x27;m not too familiar with the exact mechanism that induces the coma. But common sense would tell me extended comas after which the patient makes a full recovery are an unusual phenomenon medically. Navalny&#x27;s doctors seemed pretty unsure about his prospects too. Yet both Skripals and Navalny not only escaped death but had full recoveries from extended comas.')
