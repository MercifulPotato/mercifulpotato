Item(by='dkonofalski', descendants=None, kids=[24796154], score=None, time=1602805209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791677, text='I agree with your sentiment <i>for this particular case</i> but think it&#x27;s crazy that you&#x27;re saying Apple is condoning this when this exact same rule would have protected and prevented against situations where innocent people were on the receiving end of this information. Reddit screwed up big time, for example, when the mob went after the wrong person during the Boston bombing and people got hurt. What if the wrong person is identified? What if the identifying information is wrong? Yes, there&#x27;s a moral component to all of this but there&#x27;s also a precedent that you&#x27;re setting and I doubt Apple wants to be in the role of deciding whether this personal info is the &quot;right&quot; personal info to be out there.')
