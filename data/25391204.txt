In fact one time one commented to me that &quot;They don&#x27;t pay me enough to care about shoplifting&quot; after I &quot;accidentally&quot; forgot to scan something.<p>I don&#x27;t really feel any pity for Walmart though, they have a bad system and have taken into account that the amount of money lost through shoplifting is less than it would cost to employ more people.')
