Re-read your EULAs.<p>The hardware is fine, you can (still) go and install Linux or maybe the open-source Darwin on it. Then you&#x27;ll have the complete control,  and also the complete responsibility.<p>The idea of iOS, and increasingly macOS, is that it&#x27;s like a hosted service controlled by Apple, but on your local device.
