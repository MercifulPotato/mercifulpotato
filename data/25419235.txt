But high performance is not what you should expect from a mobile chip. You can hope for high performance (for a mobile chip).<p>I think this sentence automatically counts you out of the target for this marketing. Most people don&#x27;t even know what a &quot;mobile chip&quot; is, except maybe something you find in phone. They certainly won&#x27;t be looking at the M1 and thinking &quot;mobile chip&quot;.<p>You not being in target for the marketing also explains why you find the &quot;Performance vs. power&quot; graph confusing. Again most people don&#x27;t know what a &quot;Wintel&quot; even is, never mind 14nm++ (is a big number or a small number?). &quot;latest laptop PC chip?&quot; is perfect, exactly because most people have no idea what the latest laptop PC chip is. What they will know is how fast their current laptop &quot;feels&quot;, how new it is, and can then extrapolate how fast they think a &quot;latest chip&quot; should be. By extension, they can figure out what Apple is trying to tell them.<p>&gt; Duh. I don&#x27;t understand it, and I know someone who doesn&#x27;t focus on hardware won&#x27;t understand it either.<p>Well I know a few people who don&#x27;t focus on hardware. When talking to them about the new MacBooks they definitely had an idea of how fast a new computer might run, or at least they new it was faster than their current computer. That all you need to understand Apple&#x27;s graph.<p>&gt; There are other much less confusing charts showing relative performance of the M1 in laptop benchmarks that reflect realistic workloads<p>Again depends on your audience. Most people don&#x27;t really know what a benchmark is (or even workloads) never mind how to interpret them. As someone who in theory know about benchmarks etc, even I struggle to interpret the graphs and it always takes several minutes to get to grips with the data. Even at that point, the only conclusion I come away with is that thing A is 2x faster than thing B. Which is exactly what Apple&#x27;s graphs show, but without me needing to do mental gymnastics.<p>&gt; The ML slide he&#x27;s writing about undermines what he&#x27;s talking about in terms of clarity and &#x27;talking like a human.&#x27; It is just gibberish, equivalent to Star Trek nonsense about dilithium crystals transfobulating the warp core. All it means is &quot;has the same features that have been standard for a decade or more on every operating system except a little better, working on more cores than before.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t ML slide is targeted at the general population. Rather it&#x27;s for people who know a little bit about tech, have heard about this ML magic, maybe read a couple of articles, and the blurb helps them feel a bit smart because they can understand it, then explain it to their less techy friends.<p>&gt; This is not Apple&#x27;s best marketing work, but it is their best actual laptop product in a while: go figure.<p>The laptops are selling like hot cakes. Clearly the marketing works. There&#x27;s an almost infinite supply of examples showing that building something good just isn&#x27;t enough for it to sell. You actually need to market it properly. The evidence show that Apple have nailed it for the new Macs.')
