That gearbox is &quot;flight critical&quot;, meaning total failure of it means a crash. I&#x27;m very proud that the stab trim system has never caused an accident in the service history of the 757. (Of course, the design was an iteration on the highly successful 747 equivalent, not anything revolutionary.)')
