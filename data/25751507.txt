I think the narrow definition that &quot;only the government has the ability to censor speech&quot; isn&#x27;t useful, especially in an age where some businesses, platforms and corporations have so much power.<p>I was just correcting the perception that xkcd had a comic &quot;against&quot; free speech (and because &quot;he is a leftist&quot;). It&#x27;s not against free speech. The author clarifies what he thinks free speech is.<p>Some people apparently thought because I linked to a comic to correct someone&#x27;s claim about that comic, that said comic represents my opinion. Puzzling.')
