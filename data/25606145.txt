Here in America we have pretty tight regulations on wood burning stoves for the particulate they can emit. Starting in 2020 new stoves can only emit 2.0g&#x2F;hr of particulate, down from the 4.5g&#x2F;hr that was the rule from 2015. Most stoves I’ve seen come in at 1.54g&#x2F;hr, but I’ve seen a few down at 0.5g&#x2F;hr. It’s not uncommon to see stoves with catalytic converters in them to fully burn off any particulate.<p>Obviously this isn’t as clean as natural gas, which emits close to no particulate, but it’s a long way from a coal fireplace. I wonder if such regulations would help, or would they not be sufficient?')
