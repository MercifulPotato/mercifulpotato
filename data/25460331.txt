As the article points out, this is about chips coming out on older (8&quot; being &quot;older&quot; is funny) fab technologies.<p>There are three major prblems:<p>1) <i>Nobody holds inventory</i>.<p>This is the primary root of all problems.  Because everybody is on just-in-time inventory, nobody can absorb even the slightest shocks.  Maximally efficient is minimally robust.<p>2) Semiconductor industry consolidation<p>The semi companies have been on a competition buying spree over the last couple of years.  There&#x27;s no need worry about a competitor holding inventory and winning a contract from you if you&#x27;ve bought them all out.<p>3) The &quot;minimum volume&quot; of a chip run through a fab is <i>enormous</i>.<p>An 8 inch wafer is about 32,000 mm^2.  If your chip is 2mm per side (pretty big for &quot;popcorn&quot; type chips), a <i>single</i> 8 inch wafer produces 8,000 of them.  If it&#x27;s 1mm per side, you&#x27;ve got 32,000 of them.<p>You probably won&#x27;t produce less than 10 wafers at a time.<p>So, that means your inventory goes from dead 0 to roughly a <i>quarter million</i> in a single whack with an 18 week lead time (and I&#x27;m just counting wafer starts--I&#x27;m not even talking about testing and packaging resources getting choked).  And most projects never reach a quarter million in volume--and the ones that do generally blow <i>WAY</i> past it in a hurry.<p>Good luck managing <i>that</i> inventory flow.')
