Likewise the problem with &quot;absence of harm&quot; is making the error bounds small is extremely slow and costly so we avoid it. The scientific method (or any method to this point) never ends up &quot;proving&quot; anything, you always have to set what error bounds are acceptable.<p>Which leads to the real overall point I suppose - is there something better we could be using as &quot;just never make anything new&quot; isn&#x27;t free of problems either so it&#x27;s a question of &quot;what&#x27;s the best method&quot; not &quot;what method can guarantee something&quot; (none so far can).')
