I lived in a wonderful 1930s apartment block (good double glazing, shared building heating system etc) and a decent 1970s council-built house.<p>I also lived in a crappy 1960s council flat (single glazed aluminium framed windows) and an 1900-ish house-illegally-turned-into-flats (single glazed, wooden sash windows).')
