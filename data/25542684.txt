The thread started by blaming Canadians. Jason <i>Kenney</i> (not Kennedy, that&#x27;s some other bloke) made the border so weak there that Alberta is inundated with US-bred Covid hotspots. Of course it&#x27;s going in the other direction, too. There are hotspots trading germs by deciding they should visit each other, mingle, go home, repeat.<p>Canada isn&#x27;t taking so many cases to the US. Unless you look at Alberta. Kenney there has screwed that up in both directions by somehow not noticing the tourists going through either way. He&#x27;s turned it into a slow cooker of viral stew.<p>If I sound pissy about it, it&#x27;s because both sides of the border should be shutting that down and not allowing it, even through the loopholes they are <i>both</i> entertaining at this particular stretch. My sister&#x27;s best friend died of Covid that she caught in Banff 4 days ago. She lived and worked there, and complained about the number of Americans showing up. What a surprise.<p>It&#x27;s both ways. There are conservatives that enjoy Trump&#x27;s ideals - pretty much defining Alberta. They&#x27;re gonna kill us all eventually.<p>Ontario is stricter about it, and everyone (again on both sides of the border) bitch about it. The problem in Ontario is the sticker-monger wants to let you celebrate and <i>then</i> lock down so you die out of sight of the public.<p>We&#x27;ll never get ahead of this when everyone thinks they are somehow not the ones transporting this virus around, yet won&#x27;t stop travelling and &quot;breathing moistly.&quot;')
