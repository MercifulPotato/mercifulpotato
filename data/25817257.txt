Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25817760], score=None, time=1610933887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25816583, text='I have a few “policies” that I think are uncommon.<p>1. I never lend money because I have found the obligation upon the person receiving the money leads to negative consequences for me as a lender (whether friend or acquaintance). Instead I decide whether or not to gift the amount (or part of it), and I tell the person to “pay it back to someone else in need when they are well off in the future” or similar reason. Saying no is hard, but saying no is easier than dealing with the consequences of a friend that can’t easily pay money back (or even worse someone needs reminding which completely sucks, or they just don’t pay it backf).<p>2. I try to share costs approximately based upon ratios of disposable income, where possible. Some friends have $20 disposable after a week’s work, when I might have orders of magnitude more. Socially, this is a complicated manoeuvre, but it means I can pay for things we might like to do together, even though a friend might have radically different levels of income (or spare time). When that scheme won’t work for some tit-for-tat people, missing out on some things is the only option left (either we do something cheap, or they can’t be involved).<p>3. I don’ t get started with rounds of drinks - the social pressures are unfair on some and I dislike the obligation to drink to excess.<p>4. I sometimes offer drinks or dinner or whatever if someone can accept a freebie - I never do this when I would feel unwillingly obliged. I hardly ever buy someone a drink if they ask for it, as I don’t want to encourage that dynamic.')
