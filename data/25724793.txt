There&#x27;s no terrorists and no coup. Bunch of people occupying one building for a couple of hours is a lamest &quot;coup&quot; ever existed, and something that antifa and other protestors have done many times, including occupying Wisconsin Capitol for several days: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isthmus.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;cover-story&#x2F;capitol-occupation-walker-protest-house&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isthmus.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;cover-story&#x2F;capitol-occupation-walk...</a> That&#x27;s days, not hours. Nobody said anything about &quot;coup&quot;. And calling those people &quot;terrorist&quot; is a grave insult to the victims of actual terrorists. This idiotic overblown rhetoric is a propagandist trick, especially heinous after we&#x27;ve been told for months that nationwide riots that caused billions of damage and many dead and injured are &quot;mostly peaceful&quot;.<p>&gt; This is no different than when everyone was banning ISIS a few years ago.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between American citizens protesting and ISIS. There&#x27;s also a huge difference between the service that allows people some of whom support the same politician that some of the protestors to speak and ISIS. Declaring that any service that allows people who support the same politician as anybody who commits a crime to be the same as ISIS would make everybody in the US ISIS - e.g. James T. Hodgkinson supported Sanders, so any service that allows any Sanders supporter to speak now ISIS? Bullshit.')
