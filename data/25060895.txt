Your list excludes several that 538 thought would be close but weren&#x27;t: Ohio and Texas, and which ended up being close but 538 thought would be a blowout: Wisconsin. Putting those states in, you get Trafalgar erring in favor of Trump by 1.76 points, while 538 erred in favor of Biden by 4.37 points: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;2PACX-1vSulsnjJ96c2tiW6Zk_Bt4Ji2t1mht5V1vjX0hORgJhWiPpBmTC_8H_zWY275OXkwJF42Z_wIfxflUe&#x2F;pubhtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;2PACX-1vSulsnjJ96c2...</a><p>The final count will change these numbers a little bit, but I think Trafalgar will have gotten closer to the final result in these key states by 2.5 points on average.')
