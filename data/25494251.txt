The opposition is not with other self-hosted videoconferencing solutions, but with cloud-based systems that impose restrictive usage conditions.<p>How do we convince people to switch to self-hosted solutions?  I think that part of the solution lies in making them easier to deploy: ideally every high school, every community college should be able to have their own videoconferencing server, which can be used for lectures, for practicals, for student-teacher meetings (&quot;office hours&quot;), and hopefully for student socialisation (although in my experience students tend to prefer Discord, notwithstanding their outrageous usage conditions).<p>Gal√®ne is designed to be as easy and cheap to deploy as reasonable.  It also has a number of features that make it useful for practicals (sharing multiple windows simultaneously, automatic creation of subgroups), which we found very difficult to organise online during the first French lockdown.')
