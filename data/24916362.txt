This gets too much and the client slows down, so the features are centralised to a server again.<p>I can easily see a world where Chrome&#x2F;ium becomes too bloated to work well, and a &quot;new web&quot; of thin, light, browsers with drastically reduced features but increased speed appears. They&#x27;ll work with &quot;fat web&quot; servers but throw away half the features (so we&#x27;ll end up designing two versions of each website).<p>Eventually most of the functionality of the old &quot;fat web&quot; will migrate across - obeying the 90&#x2F;10 rule (the 10% of features that provide 90% of the value). With 90% of the value, plus increased speed, everyone will move to &quot;thin web&quot; browsers. Chrome&#x2F;ium will be left where ActiveX is now - some non-bleeding-edge organisations will use it because it has features that didn&#x27;t make it to the &quot;thin web&quot; and replacing it is a pain, but it&#x27;s obsolete and no-one really uses it.')
