Here is a dilemma - you have 10 million dollars. You need somewhere to park your money. Do you follow the Chinese businessman pattern and buy real estate in Toronto? That seems complicated - picking a property, being subject to the real estate market, etc. Often these houses sit empty, since you are on the topic of wasted resources.<p>Do you buy gold? Gold is as useless as Bitcoin, in terms of intrinsic value, your special snowflake &quot;industrial applications&quot; of coating McLaren F1 engines as a heatshield and superconductivity aside.<p>Buy stocks? How do you pick them? A financial advisor certainly won&#x27;t do it <i>properly</i> for you. And the fed is pumping out USD.<p>Of course USD is going to deflate.<p>So, Bitcoin suddenly doesn&#x27;t seem so useless.<p>&quot;is the huge energy waste&quot;<p>Gold takes a lot to store, secure, and transport. BTC replaces that with mining.<p>&quot;The second one is that it makes illegal activities easier, and at a larger scale. It&#x27;s quite common right now for companies to be coerced pay millions of dollars to anonymous criminals, all enabled with cryptocurrencies.&quot;<p>Every single transaction is on the chain.

But let&#x27;s be honest.<p>&quot;Unless equally sized positive effects would emerge&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a secure place to park cash that doesn&#x27;t deflate by nature.<p>edit: If you downvote, try to explain what you disagree with.')
