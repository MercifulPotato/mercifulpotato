Then tell me how my gap in understanding is reflected in my POINT rather then in my character.<p>Not only have I already done so, so too have a bunch of other accounts. Why don&#x27;t you re-read what they&#x27;ve all said and think about it some more? I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be able to find something more useful to add if you do that.<p>&gt; So what? Who cares if it&#x27;s me? How does this matter to you and what does this have to do with the topic?<p>Because if you do that, you will never fully mature as an adult human being. You&#x27;ll repel others away from you and then feel the pain of isolation and loneliness. You&#x27;ll watch others live rich lives you wish you had. I think that is a very unfortunate path. I hope you will avoid that pain for yourself before it&#x27;s too late and you can&#x27;t redo all the time you will inevitably kick yourself for wasting. Life goes by very quickly and you don&#x27;t get chances for do-overs.')
