Android will become illegal and then Oracle would ask Google to do what? Pay royalties? Pay Damages? Ask all the android programmers in the world to stop using Android ? Abandon android runtime? I think what is gonna happen realistically is capitalism will take over they will settle it among themselves and share user data as a bargain probably get some royalties. The worst that can happen is Google will abandon android runtime or transfer the development to Oracle. Either way nothing much is gonna happen. Android has already won now say from tomorrow Oracle develops and owns the android development toolchain, so what, from a programmers perspective nothing much.')
