It is like being able to add tons of instructions without consuming any extra ISA encoding space.<p>I don’t see why compressed instructions and macro fusions need to be part of the base instructions.<p>These are just micro-architecture optimizations available to you if you want higher performance.<p>For a cheap small microcontroller you don’t want it.')
