A little over a year ago, I was asked by my company to come up with a project that could help us out internally. If there is anything that can help a company be more valuable and resourceful that cost everything and nothing at all: it&#x27;s the ability to track time, particularly productivity and time and measure it. There is, of course, some good faith effort here that you and&#x2F;or the team you work with does try to track your time consistently or to the best of your abilities.<p>So I built a web app that tracks time and with it, I added the ability to add teams, so that you can track your time and your team members times and you can share time logs and even prevent your team from seeing your time logs if you prefer. It is free to use. I hope it helps someone or a company out. As with all my products, the data is encrypted behind the scenes, as I do take yours -- and my privacy -- very seriously. You may do with your data what you will including exporting it as a CSV file or deleting it.<p>Please report any bugs or suggest any new features you&#x27;d like to see.')
