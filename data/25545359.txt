If people were allowed to choose other libraries, then they might choose wrong. And since the government protects companies from the consequences of making bad choices, the government can&#x27;t let them make those choices.<p>The great failing of so many here is that they don&#x27;t recognize that uniformity and centralization are more important than innovation. If those innovations really are better, then you can vote to elect representatives to nominate regulators to eventually change the requirements. This is how things work in a civilized society.')
