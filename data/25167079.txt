Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25167122], score=None, time=1605921409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166983, text='Good libraries have more than one random number generator.<p>Yes, use your library if you are not competent to write your own or don&#x27;t want to, but use the <i>right</i> library function.<p>For example don&#x27;t use random.randint() in Python if you need a random integer for crypto. Use random.SystemRandom().randint(). The former uses Mersenne Twister and is predictable. The latter uses os.urandom() for its underlying random bytes, which uses an OS-specific random source (&#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom on Unix and Unix-like OSes) and should be sufficiently unpredictable for all cryptographic uses.<p>There is also the secrets library in Python 3.6 and later. It&#x27;s not better than random.SystemRandom, it&#x27;s just a different interface to the OS secure random number generator. If you want your code to work unmodified on Python before 3.6 it is fine to use random.SystemRandom (or if you like its interface more).')
