Let&#x27;s say you run a programming tutorials channel that&#x27;s too small to monetize and you don&#x27;t want Google layering ads over your content. Just crosspost something like a Tim Pool video and hope the YouTube AI categorizes your channel as too toxic for advertisers. Otherwise it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the standard changes when Google is the sole beneficiary. That money is too toxic for thee, not for me.')
