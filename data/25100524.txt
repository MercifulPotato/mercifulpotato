I got to about point 4 and had to stop.<p>Why, you might ask?<p>Because I am &quot;fortunate&quot; enough to live in a house where the previous owner bodged and kludged every single home improvement and DIY job he attempted. He did it in a different way to Mr Dobson (who at least employed a professional electrician) but, nonetheless, the point stands. In my place even the most basic jobs have been done in a way that is incorrect, sometimes unsafe, and usually adds significant time and expense in fixing or making modifications beyond what would reasonably be expected. I am gradually correcting all of this but it&#x27;s slow and frustrating work.<p>This article contains numerous sections that would be absolute red flags, at least to me, for buying this house if and when Mr Dobson chooses to sell it. Here are a couple of examples:<p>&gt; To this day I have a spreadsheet with around 500 lines (around 3 lines per circuit) which details all of the lighting circuits in the house, the circuit breaker they are connected to, the type of device that controls the circuit and its location. Unfortunately I wasn’t 100% successful in getting the control point of all the lighting circuits in one of these five locations and there are actually at least three units lost in the walls somewhere which respond to Z-Wave commands but don’t seem to control anything I can find!<p>&gt; I have now gotten to the stage where I dread some modules failing. The one that controls a water-feature in the garden is in a sealed box, the one that controls an out-door heater is in a small loft area that can only be accessed by a rickety ladder, the one for the guest-room extractor fan is in a crawl space, etc. This can’t be the right way to do things can it?<p>That last sentence nearly floored me: no, it clearly isn&#x27;t, so why <i>have</i> you done things this way?<p>This is an absolute horror show and I have little confidence that anyone who approaches home improvement with Mr Dobson&#x27;s mindset is going to do a better job of whatever the replacement ends up being. [EDIT: I have now read the conclusion which, at least in my view, bears out this statement pretty well.]<p>You can obviously do whatever you want with your own home but if you&#x27;re going to go nuts on the home automation front, especially if you tend towards early adoption and want to attempt something very ambitious, you might want to consider what effect that could have on your ability to sell your home again in future. Homebuyers are going to become a lot more savvy, and a lot more sceptical, about these kinds of systems and modifications as time goes on.')
