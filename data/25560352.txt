My son is a mathematician, a post doc right now.  While I would not say math is over funded, my understanding is that most of the money they spend (above and beyond salaries) is just travel related so they can talk together.  That is they don&#x27;t have expensive equipment like electron microscopes, server farms, etc.  On the other hand I think you can make a strong case that math education outreach to under represented groups in math, like some minorities and women in some countries maybe does not get the attention it deserves.')
