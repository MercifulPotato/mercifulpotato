That said, I remember when COVID first started hitting, and their reaction was initially &quot;meh&quot;, then like everyone else, it started to dawn on them how bad this was going to be. So still take their voices with a grain of salt.<p>In the latest TWIV, their comment was that the things you would do to prevent COVID are the same no matter if it is a new Strain or not. That&#x27;s true - but we also have to deal with a increasingly uncomfortable truth - in many places, the COVID incident and death rate are pretty much the same, despite dramatically different legal and social dictates around masking, etc.  Italy, France, USA, UK, Spain, Belgium, etc are all within 10% of the total death per million population, for example.<p>There is a weird cycle around COVID. Everyone reports on how awful it is somewhere, people draw a over-broad conclusion about the moral or scientific failures of the continent &#x2F; state &#x2F; country &#x2F; red state &#x2F; blue state, then that wave of covid waxes in one place, and wanes is another, and the cycle repeats again.<p>This pattern continues despite different travel restrictions, different masking policies (way less then my state in the USA, for example), etc.<p>SO I think the answer is not - we couldn&#x27;t change anything - but rather - what is really the science behind this - and do we truly understand what is going on?\nI get that Vincent is burned out and has a knee jerk reaction, if I had to deal with all the insanity around the Hydrochloroquine crap I would be too.')
