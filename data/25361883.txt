Item(by='tunesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25362876], score=None, time=1607538328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25361018, text='A &quot;missing&quot; axiom, in my experience, is not truly a missing axiom that otherwise has no impact on other axioms. A &quot;missing&quot; axiom is one that exposes a bad assumption in another axiom currently being relied upon.<p>For instance. Socrates is a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal.<p>But then you discover that a couple of eons have passed and Socrates is still alive. Clearly there must be a &quot;missing&quot; axiom. And after some investigation you realize that Socrates is a Venusian man, and Venusians are immortal.<p>&quot;Socrates is Venusian&quot; is a missing axiom, but really the problem is that &quot;All men are mortal&quot; is actually false, since it had implicit assumptions that &quot;All men are human&quot; (false) and &quot;All humans are mortal&quot; (true).')
