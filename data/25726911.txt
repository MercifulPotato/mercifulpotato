Product always goes to  tech for design and implementation advice. This is taken care of during sprint planning. I see product getting a lot of hate from engineering types recently. It just smacks of myopia. Engineers are being well paid because the company makes good money from the whole solution not just the technical implementation. What an engineer thinks is important may not be that important from the business perspective which is where product comes in. If product wants to do something that will cause technical problems that&#x27;s where engineering comes in. It&#x27;s a team effort. As an analogy no soccer team fields only goalkeepers or only strikers etc.')
