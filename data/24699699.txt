Pittsburgh is pretty far from the east coast, so it being in Pennsylvania doesn&#x27;t really make it a &#x27;coastal school&#x27; in my eyes, so I&#x27;ll continue to lump it in with its geographic neighbors, though perhaps &#x27;Rust belt&#x27; region is more accurate than Midwest for what I&#x27;m trying to b describe.<p>What ranking puts CMU at 1 in CS? Just curious because I usually see it behind a couple coastal schools.')
