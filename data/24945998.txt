Where can I inspect that contract?<p>What we have right now is Greenwald&#x27;s word, which given that A) I can&#x27;t think of a time he&#x27;s published an outright falsehood, and B) the letter from the editor didn&#x27;t deny any of the facts but instead just jumped to describing the process as Greenwald having a &quot;tantrum&quot;, I&#x27;m inclined to believe at face value.<p>&gt; Clearly, the terms that allow him to publish elsewhere if TI doesn&#x27;t want to publish his stuff that he claims exist seem at odds with the claim that there are terms that he is free to publish whatever he wants in TI without TI exercising editorial control.<p>Or it&#x27;s a clause that if they mutually agree that TI isn&#x27;t the best forum for an article Greenwald has written, he&#x27;s explicitly allowed to take it to another forum, in contrast to the normal staff writer contract provisions.')
