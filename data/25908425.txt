Be better prepared to jump back into a different task by knowing exactly where you left off, problem state, and what the next step is.<p>To expand on this (and point 3), there&#x27;s some non-obvious (to many) types of notes that can help you switch:<p>* Sql snippets to display&#x2F;manipulate the data.<p>* Log snippets with relevant stack traces.<p>* Debugger breakpoints and core dumps (if applicable), can be scripted on the command line or imported&#x2F;exported from the IDE. Don&#x27;t forget debuggers are scriptable too, most devs use a fraction of a debuggers power.<p>* Custom scripts, like something that can grep logs for the specific issue you&#x27;re working on, toggle config settings, setup data in a specific way, etc.<p>These can help you immediately jump back to the problem rather than jumping to the project and then working your way back to the problem. They don&#x27;t always help, but more often you&#x27;ll be able to switch in 5 minutes rather than 4 hours. They will also help with notes to QA and support along with documentation.')
