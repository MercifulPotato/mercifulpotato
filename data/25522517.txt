I want them to come in <i>above</i> my current salary — simply hitting my salary means their deal is basically the same as my current deal, plus a bunch of unknowns around the work, the environment, the company. If I&#x27;m going to switch companies, it should advantage me to do so. (And IME, if you give exactly the salary, they&#x27;ll come in as little above it as possible. I am naming what I <i>want</i>, not what I already have.)<p>(I also agree with many of the parents: you don&#x27;t really want to be the first mover — it isn&#x27;t advantageous — but recruiters are very rarely going to give you that, and will force your hand in naming a number first.)')
