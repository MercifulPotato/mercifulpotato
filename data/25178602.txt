Them banning me for doing that (possibly violating their Terms) is a separate argument.<p>In addition, NYU didn&#x27;t sign up to Facebook so they have no need to abide by their Terms. At least, they shouldn&#x27;t have to abide by them... not sure what the laws in the US say about it.<p>I&#x27;m not for government intervention for things like this but the courts (I believe) have already ruled that scraping data is legit.<p>Edit: added that I think they shouldn&#x27;t be able to have a say')
