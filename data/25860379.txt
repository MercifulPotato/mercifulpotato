Item(by='RodgerTheGreat', descendants=None, kids=[25860546, 25860603], score=None, time=1611245404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25859969, text='Rather presupposes that alien life is similar enough to humanity for culture and art to be more-or-less mutually intelligible.<p>Would extraterrestrials who communicate with pheremones, or touch, or don&#x27;t communicate at all (ala &quot;Blindsight&quot;) have any concept of music? If they can &quot;hear&quot;, does their sensory range overlap ours? Is it compatible with our notion of musical scales? Does whatever passes for a nervous system operate at a similar timescale to ours?<p>Food and clothing seem like more of a stretch- even within earth&#x27;s biosphere many substances humans can eat are poisonous to other animals, and vice versa. Vast differences in bodyplan would almost certainly make our clothing useless to an alien race, and the materials we use could easily be incompatible with their biology.<p>Even if aliens were substantially similar psychologically, minor changes in biology could result in completely different societies. What would our world look like with humans who reproduced asexually, or in triads? Where we produce our own food via photosynthesis or symbiosis? Where we didn&#x27;t sleep, or different populations hibernated in their own cycles?<p>Overall I&#x27;m inclined to believe that cultural exchange with an intelligent extraterrestrial species would be harder and less productive than cultural exchange with parrots.')
