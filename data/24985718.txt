If so how did it work out for You? I hope much better than me and my son.<p>But if You haven&#x27;t gone through the courts, maybe be a bit less ritcheous.<p><i></i>Edit<i></i><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;This is an astonishing display of lack of empathy for the unfairly estranged parent. Not having your child in your life is one of the worst forms of torture a person should not be forced to endure.&quot;<p>What is astonishing is I am that parent, maybe all the torture made me less empathetic to myself.<p>Also I was not arguing in favor of the courts unfairness. Infact, I am well aware of how hard the courts can cone down on anyone who doesn&#x27;t toe the line. So don&#x27;t be spinning my comnent, and keep your charity, thanks.')
