Item(by='diffeomorphism', descendants=None, kids=[24727409, 24727526], score=None, time=1602225041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723695, text='&gt; the cookbook itself becomes copyrightable.<p>But what is discussed here is not the cookbook but just the table of contents. The actual recipes are different.<p>Making another cookbook with chapter 1: salads, chapter 2: soups etc. is common practice. The question is how much detail you are allowed to copy in order to allow for interoperability.<p>For instance, a dinner might call for the Oracle potato salad of Section 1.3 and Oracle tomato soup of Section 2.2.\nIf your cookbook has your recipes (not Oracle&#x27;s) in the same Sections in your book, that is useful for your readers&#x2F;chefs, since they can easily switch their menus to your book.<p><i>Are you allowed to do that? That is the question.</i><p>&gt; arguing that APIs are non-copyrightable is essentially carving out an exception for a specific type of code.<p>Disagree. APIs are talking about code but not code by themselves alone. Just like &quot;The potato salad recipe is in Section 1.3&quot; talks about a recipe but is decidedly not a recipe by itself.<p>If the law currently thinks that should be copyrightable, then the law should be changed.')
