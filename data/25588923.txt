First it could be real, sure, and that&#x27;s called an analog computer (not to be confused with an analog circuit). That subject has been studied too, but hasn&#x27;t been terribly fruitful in terms of realizable improvements over classical. Second, complex because that&#x27;s how physics works (we think). Scott Aaronson wrote up an article about what the alternatives might be. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4021" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4021</a><p>To your second question, the quantum system can represent <i>all</i> N states simultaneously (until you observe it) because of entanglement. The classical system can only represent one at a time.')
