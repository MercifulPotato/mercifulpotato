People going to the exburbs to buy houses seem to choose large, traditional single family homes and you can only fit so many of those into the developed areas.  I don&#x27;t think exburbs like Pleasanton, Temecula, Santa Clarita, etc exist because people couldn&#x27;t find affordable housing in SF, SD or LA.  They exist because people can&#x27;t find affordable single-family homes with modern amenities for a reasonable price in those markets.<p>That said, there is still the problem of rural residents who never wanted to live in the city to begin with.  Nature lovers, independent types, and folks with jobs outside the city are still often living in unsafe conditions and providing them with affordable urban housing isn&#x27;t going to convince them to relocate.')
