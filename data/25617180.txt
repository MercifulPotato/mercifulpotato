Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609626488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616621, text='&gt; The average healthcare cost in the US is $7k&#x2F;year&#x2F;person for the working age population.... In a universal healthcare system the government can use progressive taxes to subsidize this cost for the less well off.<p>Except we don&#x27;t have a fully-private system. We have Medicaid, which covers the working-age poor, and also people with disabilities which is a very high-cost group. Then we have Medicare taking the high-cost elderly population. And then we have ACA potentially subsidizing much of the rest.<p>&gt; So if you make $24k&#x2F;year that comes out to 30% of your income.<p>In Maryland, a low-deductible Kaiser ACA Gold plan for a 36-year old making $24,000 per year costs $3,864&#x2F;year. But the government pays $2,533 of that, leaving you to pay $1,380 + out of pocket costs.<p>Out of pocket expenditures in the U.S. add up to about $1,100&#x2F;year on average: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthsystemtracker.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;access-affordability&#x2F;out-of-pocket-spending" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthsystemtracker.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;access-afforda...</a>. But note that other countries have out-of-pocket costs too. Even in France, where point-of-use costs are very low, it&#x27;s still $463&#x2F;year.<p>Your typical person making $24,000 per year is going to be young, and not rack up $1,380 in out of pocket costs each year. But adding that in, you&#x27;re looking at 10.3%.')
