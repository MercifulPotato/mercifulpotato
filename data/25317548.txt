So alcohol was banned, and these places became ‘dry’ communities.<p>Lacking alcohol, the people turned to inhaling petrol fumes, which created a large social problem.<p>Eventually, an ‘un-sniffable’ petrol was created to solve this problem. Then the people turned to paint and glue.<p>It’s recognized that the people in those communities have suffered a deep, inter-generational trauma, which is what drives people to seek ‘numbing’ relief from substances.<p>However, it’s the belief that reducing availability of substances will solve substance abuse that’s kept the fundamental problems these people have, from being addressed.')
