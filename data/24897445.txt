Item(by='uglycoyote', descendants=None, kids=[24903981], score=None, time=1603727252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24877034, text='He says that &quot;Pinboard has more than 350K commits and is 20GB in size when cloned fully.&quot; I&#x27;m not clear though, exactly what &quot;cloned fully&quot; means in context of the unoptimized&#x2F;optimized situation.<p>He says it went from 40 minutes to 30 seconds.  Does this mean they found a way to grab the whole 20GB repo in 30 seconds? seems pretty darn fast to grab 20GB, but maybe on fast internal networks?<p>Or maybe they meant that it was 20GB if you grabbed all of the many thousands of garbage branches, when Jenkins really only needed to test &quot;master&quot;, and finding a solution that allowed them to only grab what they needed made things faster.<p>I&#x27;m also curious about the incremental vs &quot;cloning fully&quot; aspect of it.  Does each run of Jenkins clone the repo from scratch or does it incrementally pull into a directory where it has been cloned before?   I could see how in a cloning-from-scratch situation the burden of cloning every branch that ever existed would be large, whereas incrementally I would think it wouldn&#x27;t matter that much.')
