What part of that statement do you agree with?<p>But I’ll go further and double down and say the entire post is nonsense. Why? Because the author’s skepticism doesn’t extend to the human factor. The position is not an accurate representation of the facts i.e why humans cause accidents and the known data around AVs today. If AV risk is so obvious as you claim (even though there is Ana enormous amount of data that shows that AVs are involved in the less accidents and lead to less deaths than cars operated by humans), how is the negligent human driver not obvious as a source of automobile fatalities? The notion that we are safe because we can read humans is obviously not true, just look at the data. Maybe you believe this number of fatalities is acceptable or the best we can do but I certainly don’t. There will be flaws in autonomous vehicles, no doubt. But will there be a net reduction in automobile related fatalities as a result? Like anyone else, I can’t predict the future. But to paint a rosy picture about how the ability to read other drivers is somehow safer relative to AVs is nonsense. It just is. The data doesn’t support this argument. And intuitively, the notion that in the future self driving cars will somehow lead to more deaths than human drivers seems preposterous.')
