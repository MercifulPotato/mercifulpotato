What part of that statement do you agree with?<p>But I’ll go further and double down and say the entire post is nonsense. Why? Because the author’s skepticism doesn’t extend to the human factor. The position is not an accurate representation of the facts i.e what causes accidents (humans) and the known data around AVs today. If AV risk is so obvious as you claim then why does the enormous amount of data show that AVs are involved in the less accidents and lead to less fatalities than cars operated by humans on a mile per mile basis? And how is the negligent human driver not obvious as a source of automobile fatalities? The notion that we are safe because we can read humans is not substantiated by anything. Maybe you believe this number of fatalities is acceptable or the best we can do but I certainly don’t. There will be flaws in autonomous vehicles, no doubt. But will there be a net reduction in automobile related fatalities as a result? Like anyone else, I can’t predict the future. But to paint a rosy picture about how our ability to read other drivers is somehow safer relative to AVs is nonsense. It just is. The data doesn’t support this argument. And separately, if we’re talking about will happen in the future, the notion that humans will ultimately prevail over AVs because for safety reasons seems preposterous. We can debate the “when” in terms of AVs but debating the “if” seems pretty out of touch with the way society has progressed with respect to our willingness to depend on technology.')
