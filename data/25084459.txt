Item(by='onassar', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1605287313, title='Show HN: Google Font preview images/thumbs', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi all -  \nWe&#x27;ve been maintaining a (huge) collection of Google Font preview images&#x2F;thumbs for a few years now.<p>It&#x27;s open sourced here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getstencil&#x2F;GoogleWebFonts-FontFamilyPreviewImages<p>The problem we ran into in our app, is that when someone wants to import a Google Font into our design tool, we wanted to show them an example of what that font looked like _before_ they imported it.<p>But we didn&#x27;t want to load hundreds (or thousands) of Google Fonts directly into our app (for performance reasons). So we built a script that renders Google Fonts as images that we can then embed.<p>Hope this is useful to anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation whereby they want to show what a Google Font looks like, but not actually load it into memory.<p>For reference, our app is called Stencil (getstencil.com).\nHope this is useful to someone else :)')
