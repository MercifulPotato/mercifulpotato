Then there&#x27;s the idea of militia&#x27;s. Both of these are also reasons for people to have the &quot;scary black rifles&quot; in their house, and a central idea to the 2A. So add these to the questions: &quot;Is it reasonable to believe the US may need a militia&quot;, &quot;Is it reasonable to force citizen to provide this militia&quot;, &quot;Will the US gov ever violate human rights such that the citizens of the US would have to defend themselves against this gov&quot;.<p>Then lets also consider that when you talk about self defense, and the possible loss of life, should we be forced to play the &quot;just enough&quot; game with defensive force? Who exactly likes gambling with their life?')
