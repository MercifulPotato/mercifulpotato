They both have their pros&#x2F;cons, but this article is a pretty lazy attempt to paint Signal as some anti-competitive &quot;authoritarianism&quot;.<p>The article has two main points:\n1) Signal is a centralised platform\n2) Signal has prohibited other projects from using Signal&#x27;s servers.<p>Addressing point (2) first since it is the most absurd:\nProjects like LibreSignal and Wire attempted to build projects (and in the latter case, a product) using Signal&#x27;s infrastructure. LibreSignal even was using Signal&#x27;s name in the product.<p>Simply put, Signal&#x27;s servers are Signal&#x27;s. It&#x27;s their right to prevent other groups from using its own infrastructure for their own products. It&#x27;s a matter of (a) legal liability (b) assuring users aren&#x27;t confusing improperly implemented clients as Signal&#x27;s own.<p>Fret not, the Signal server implementation is up on GitHub. Run your own server, assure that you&#x27;re not using someone else&#x27;s copyrighted name as your project name, and you&#x27;re all set! In fact, that&#x27;s precisely what Wire managed to do.<p>Addressing point(1), the reason I use Signal AND Matrix is because while I really dig Matrix, it is just many orders of magnitude easier for me to on-board non-technical friends and family on to Signal and Matrix, and that&#x27;s almost entirely due to it&#x27;s centralised nature.<p>What&#x27;s more, I frankly do trust Signal&#x27;s crypto (marginally) more than Matrix&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not possible to send unencrypted messages on Signal, I&#x27;ve rarely if ever been asked to verify codes, and I know that Signal doesn&#x27;t store metadata while Matrix does.<p>Matrix is wonderful, I use it all the time, but it&#x27;s not a panacea. Same goes for Signal, for which I can&#x27;t self-host, or run inter-app bridges or bots.<p>So all that to say, this article was pretty lazy and imho exceptionally unconvincing.')
