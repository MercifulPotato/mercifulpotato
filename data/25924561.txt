You can&#x27;t really find out what&#x27;s going on in the world from the mainstream media in any real resolution or detail, and &quot;other websites on the internet&quot; don&#x27;t generally have thousands and thousands of people livestreaming <i>actual live video of what&#x27;s happening</i>.<p>Perhaps this could be rectified by our society working to make bandwidth an order of magnitude or two cheaper, so that there can be lots more live video hosts.  As it stands, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with a few giant megacorps like Google or Twitch.')
