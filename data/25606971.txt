Just asking &quot;What did you do in your last job?&quot; and following from there works wonders.  No coding exercises, no whiteboards, it&#x27;s all about working a conversation with them.  I can confidently say that the recruiting process was faster --less interviews--, less stressful for the candidate, and finally the number of hire employees that flopped was not that much worse.<p>I did whiteboards for Architect positions, but once again, I just asked the candidates to draw architectures to have a friendly discussion.')
