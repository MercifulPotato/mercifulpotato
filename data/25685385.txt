Negotiate (if it&#x27;s not already granted) the permission to publish manuscripts and pre-prints. Submit them to ArXiV or Bio&#x2F;MedRxiv, or whatever repository.<p>This doesn&#x27;t tackle the issue of academics paying publishers to send emails to other academics who in turn work for free to review papers, but one battle at a time.')
