There is no cliff, just entering into a new regime, in the broadest technological sense of the term.<p>One odd moment:<p>“Thompson and his colleagues showed that they could get a computationally intensive calculation to run some 47 times faster just by switching from Python, a popular general-purpose programming language, to the more efficient C. That’s because C, while it requires more work from the programmer, greatly reduces the required number of operations, making a program run much faster. Further tailoring the code to take full advantage of a chip with 18 processing cores sped things up even more. In just 0.41 seconds, the researchers got a result that took seven hours with Python code.<p><i>That sounds like good news for continuing progress, but Thompson worries it also signals the decline of computers as a general purpose technology.</i>“<p>I think that last sentence suggests that many of the programming activities that have provided similar or greater gains that many HN readers have done over the decades <i>have signaled, perhaps even caused, the decline of computers as a general purpose technology</i>.  Shame on us.  Note this is in a MIT publication.  This is why tech writers need to review their copy with Subject Matter Experts.')
