Especially with process technology. Given what they&#x27;ve got to work with in the process department, they&#x27;ve been building neat good stuff. Xe just launched &amp; in a mobile form factor is quite competitive, no longer leaving AMD APUs to dominate. These same mobile parts have far higher integration than anything AMD can offer, with dual USB4&#x2F;TB4 ports good for 2 x 40Gbps. Intel has a range of neat things few others have. Intel has a pretty competent wifi that integrates nicely. Their new Tremot Atom cores are a great value, really nice light-weight cores, &amp; scale up to 24 cores on expensive but interesting cellular radio platforms. Xeon-D is a wonderful connectivity platform that there is not much competition for. Alas Intel cancelled OmniPath, which was a brilliant thing to integrate &amp; give away on server CPUs almost for free (~$100 on a &gt;&gt; $1000 chip). And alas the process tech really hampers big server cores, but intel has been getting more competitive.<p>At this point, Linux need competition. Nvidia thus-far has never played well, Linux4Tegra and CUDA are walled gardens &amp; driver support is otherwise awful, still no good way to run Wayland. AMD is doing great &amp; Linux support is very high. But we kind of need Intel to keep AMD from growing lethargic &amp; un-competitive, from exploiting their new market position as, well, better.')
