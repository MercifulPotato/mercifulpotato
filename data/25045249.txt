Only few applications and games actually benefit from the new APIs, but the new APIs require a lot more work and detailed knowledge of what&#x27;s going on under the hood (with the exception of Metal vs GL of course, Metal is a lot nicer to work with than GL; but if you compare D3D11 to Vulkan or D3D12, then D3D11 definitely is the more &quot;ergonomic&quot; API - at least for rendering traditional triangle geometry).')
