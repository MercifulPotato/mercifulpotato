Item(by='unexaminedlife', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1607120315, title='Ask HN: Is the future a future of large tech consultancies? or small ones?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I resigned recently from one of the largest tech consultancies on the planet. On day 1 I could tell I probably made a bad decision to work for them.  I kept delaying the inevitable hoping I was in some isolated environment that was not indicative of how this company does business, and that somewhere within the conglomerate I could find a good opportunity to further my career goals.  Fast forward 2 years later, unfortunately there was no real change and they turned out to be just as incompetent in every corner of the company that I had the opportunity to explore.<p>This technology company&#x27;s internal practices are borderline criminal IMO.  When given a choice they focus their efforts on changing a client&#x27;s PERCEPTION of them rather than trying to fix real internal &#x2F; systemic issues that prevent them from being a competent technology consultancy.  They&#x27;re so far from being what their clients think they are it&#x27;s crazy to see how many (probably desperate) clients confide in them for their partnership.<p>Knowing what I know now I don&#x27;t really think I could even label them a technology consultancy.  They&#x27;re a sales company who happen to do technology.<p>I&#x27;m thinking this SHOULD be a perfect business opportunity.  When you lay out the options, you could have (1) an enormous company who is clearly collapsing under its own weight, or you could have (2) a small nimble company who is going to be a far more productive company but far more expensive than if you were to just hire them as an employee.  IMO the decision couldn&#x27;t be clearer.  Though the small consultancy per-employee would likely be significantly more expensive they&#x27;re going to deliver a far better product in substantially fewer man hours.<p>My goal here is to try to understand what &quot;market forces&quot; or &quot;market perceptions&quot; are at play here that have allowed this sort of madness to even exist let alone be the de-facto standard when it comes to technology consulting companies in the Fortune 500 world?')
