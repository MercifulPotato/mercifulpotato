I&#x27;ve seen people complain about Apple on HN about this in all the other posts, but to be fair, this is actually a really good thing.<p>It protects users, and it works well 99.9% of the time (actually, I am not aware of a previous outage of this system). So, why bother? It&#x27;s been like this for a while, it is actually very useful to the vast majority of users, and Apple being Apple, even if they collected data, it wouldn&#x27;t be up for sale like it would on a Google machine.<p>All the people saying they need to look for alternatives now that they found out that Apple is sending information about applications to its servers will need to think about this post. It&#x27;s not like Apple is doing this to track users.')
