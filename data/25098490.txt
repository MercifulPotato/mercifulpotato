Eg: Hydroxy Chloroquine works, masks don&#x27;t and so on...<p>His followers then parroted and posted these comments on social media and were promptly defunded, suspended and even banned for breaking Eula terms. Because Covid is serious and far too important to risk endangering others lives with misinformation like that...fair enough.<p>The campaign rolls on only now a significant portion of Trump&#x27;s most vocal supporters are no longer able to voice their support and encourage people to vote for him due to being punished for spreading false info that Trump  told them regarding Covid, or is that the real reason? Maybe the plan was to silence the right&#x27;s voice all along but Covid presented itself at an oppertune time, the left leaning social media companies took full advantage and Trump and his followers walked right into the trap!<p>Could that be why right wing supporters might want to find a new forum to express themselves? Somewhere that they wont have their voices taken away right before an election that they feel passionate about?<p>Just a different thought from an outside observer with no skin in the game.')
