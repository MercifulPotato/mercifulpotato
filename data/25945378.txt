Maybe there&#x27;s less of an culture of thinking &quot;my way is the best&quot; that Americans have more than others[0], maybe the smaller cultural market (there are 350 million Americans, only 30 million Spaniards). Maybe could be Americans are more into Consumer Ethnocentrism and less likely to buy into foreign things than Europeans too (the number of American flags waving around in the states is shocking). I wouldn&#x27;t expect to see &quot;Designed in Finland&quot; if I bought a nokia phone. The US market has always been far harder for europeans - even Brits - to crack than the other way round.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infographic.tv&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;Map-Who-thinks-their-country-is-the-best-in-758x397.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infographic.tv&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;Map-Who-th...</a>')
