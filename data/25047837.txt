Some worse than others.  In that environment there is a very high degree of compliance with regulators because they have to be given explicit permission to operate.<p>For pure internet services or P2P applications it is quite a bit different.  You don&#x27;t actually need anyone&#x27;s permission to distribute software.  And you can move your servers around the world. You don&#x27;t depend on permission - just that nobody comes after you with warrants you cannot ignore.<p>So the advice is really to look at who you are dealing with and how dependent they are on regulators to operate.<p>Large internet companies tend to have entire divisions whose job it is to tell regulators to get lost or at the very least maintain a really high bar for interference.  Of course, this becomes difficult when the government is also a large customer.  So for instance you might want to be careful with vendors who make a lot of money in &#x2F; off of the defense and intelligence sectors.')
