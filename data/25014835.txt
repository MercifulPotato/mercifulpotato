Most of the links to the twitter account of the same name doen&#x27;t prove what they are claimed to prove.<p>Calling Bret &quot;a known idiot&quot; in the first sentence is 1. disgusting. 2. has no basis, he didn&#x27;t say anything stupid there. Maybe lineage conflict isn&#x27;t the best frame for looking at WWII, but one of the frames nonetheless and the rhetoric of Fatherland etc. indeed shows that.<p>The supposedly contradicting &quot;claims to victimhood&quot; there are actually not contradicting if you listen to the portal episode. The fact that the Weinsteins didn&#x27;t provide evidence doesn&#x27;t mean it is false or evidence doesn&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s just not for podcast episode. At the end of that episode Eric invided Carol to come and respond on that podcast. Also, regarding &quot;claims to victimhood&quot;, I haven&#x27;t really heard this story from him before that podcast when Eric ensisted that he tells it. So Bret is by no means claiming any victimhood.<p>Re: BLM and Kristallhacht, you didnt&#x27; include the link.')
