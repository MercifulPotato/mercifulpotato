Most people are totally perplexed by the disparity between their own reality and what is portrayed in the news.  For 3 years we had evidence-free but unrelenting Russia&#x2F;Trump hate.  This seemed insane, but it turns out that was just the warm up act to coronavirus!<p>The reality of what people see around them is sooooo far away from what is portrayed on the MSM.  It amazes me that anyone pays any notice to the MSM at.  But what it really shows, is that most individuals are not their own authority in their life.  They defer to what is the consensus opinion that is blasted at them 24&#x2F;7 from the MSM, rather than acting according to what they actually experience.<p>Imagine, somehow a person was frozen in time, and seeing how the majority live now - scared of living because someone said something on TV!<p>But that is the power of the media, and why it is such an effective control.  The majority disagree with what is portrayed, but feel pressured enough to keep quiet and therefore acquiesce to whatever is being shouted out.')
