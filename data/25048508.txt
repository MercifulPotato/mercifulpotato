Where else can I as one of the non-gods of HN, go to argue with millionaires and billionaires, discuss things with them and be treated the same as them in conversation just based on the things I say?<p>HN&#x27;s always seemed like a fairly equalizing place to me. As long as you can form a constructive, useful comment, your post will sit right next to people who make insane amounts of money, and be regarded equally based on its own merits.<p>There&#x27;s no way in hell many of the people I&#x27;ve talked to on here about a bunch of different things would ever have those conversations with me, or any conversation probably, in person.')
