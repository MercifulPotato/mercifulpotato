The photos in the post are representative and true of how the area actually is, and I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions (forewarning, I&#x27;m not an expert).<p>If I were to emphasize any one take-away - it&#x27;s the friendliness I experienced from the locals. Sounds cliched, but look at reality - I was taking photos in a place where I don&#x27;t particularly belong (it&#x27;s kind of my hobby since &quot;retiring&quot; from tech), and you may assume that a poverty-stricken, much maligned group of people would be wary of &quot;outsiders&quot;.<p>Indeed, the exact opposite was the case.<p>edit: with regards to racism, a story I was told in the same city is perhaps the best example of just how far Bulgaria (in this example) has to climb. I asked a local Bulgarian friend why I didn&#x27;t see Roma working at the local restaurants. He said that would be really bad for the business - to have a Gypsy waiter, or cashier, or in any &quot;public facing&quot; role. I voiced my assumption that perhaps they were working back-of-house, in the kitchen. He said they weren&#x27;t - if the public found out a Gypsy was working in the kitchen, most people would never dine at that restaurant.')
