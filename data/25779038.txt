Even individual outlets carry such a variety of voices that you cannot pin one on any given outlet.<p>The organizations that are lumped into the &quot;MSM&quot; branding opponents to a free press like to throw around are just large organizations.<p>Remember, &quot;the medium is the message&quot;: you cannot extricate one article from the entirety of content published by a given outlet any more than you can exalt one article as being the sum of any outlet on its own. For example, a muffin recipe[0] is as much the New York Times as an opinion commentary on the potential problematic nature of social media, yet you cannot say that the NYT is <i>only</i> one or the other.<p>Because an outlet published an article that one might contend is responsible for a situation (rather than commentary on a situation), and that content has commonalities with content from other outlets does not mean there is any other practical associationâ€”only thematic.<p>Secondly, calling it all &quot;fake news and propaganda&quot; really belies any rational discussion of the subject... it&#x27;s like saying all computers are killing machines because they&#x27;ve been used in war.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooking.nytimes.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;2868-jordan-marshs-blueberry-muffins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cooking.nytimes.com&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;2868-jordan-marshs-blueb...</a>')
