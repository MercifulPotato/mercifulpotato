Is supporting a family of 5 on a $25,000 income possible in the US? Let&#x27;s at least adjust for inflation since 1995, and Homer&#x27;s wages would amount to $42,000.<p>Since they all had their own bedrooms, they&#x27;d need a 4 bedroom home (assume Maggie still sleeps with Marge &amp; Homer). The author is in Michigan. Let&#x27;s choose Flint to simulate having a Nuke in the back yard. A 4 bedroom home in Flint (not in the &#x27;lead zone&#x27;, Marge would never allow it) is minimum $200,000. Payments on a mortgage at 3% are about $800&#x2F;mo.<p>Monthly Expenses:<p>$800 Mortgage<p>$300 property tax<p>$700 food for 5<p>$150 clothes (the kids are growing, need shoes annually, need diapers for Maggie...)<p>$300 Auto expenses (used car, maintenance, insurance, gas)<p>$2,250&#x2F;month so far. That covers the basics and leaves $16,000! But what about health insurance?<p>(gulp)<p>What are the odds that Homer&#x27;s $20&#x2F;hr. job includes fully paid health insurance for his family of 5? Let&#x27;s give a little benefit and say at least it covers Homer as the employee (a stretch, yes?). His employer would require him to pay for his 3 kids and wife. Grampa is on Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid + social security. So he&#x27;s on his own...<p>To calibrate for the rest of the family...<p>Hmm... Healthcare.gov says that marketplace plans are not available in Homer&#x27;s county.<p>And, according to eHealth.com, Homer doesn&#x27;t qualify for &#x27;savings&#x27;.<p>So, it&#x27;s off to Healthcare.gov, which requires an account, so I&#x27;ll stop there.<p>From recent personal experience, the most basic plans run $1,500&#x2F;month and have deductibles that would bankrupt Homer. Lower deductibles would put the premiums out of reach. I think he is out of cash at this point.')
