There&#x27;s always the risk that a contract is short lived, but that also exists within &quot;secure&quot; jobs. Obviously, there&#x27;s a range of difference between the two.<p>That&#x27;s often why contract work can pay better when it comes to hourly wages: there&#x27;s more risk. If it were me, I&#x27;d try to have about 50% more in contract work wages lined up than for at least 6-months before leaving a &quot;secure&quot; job.')
