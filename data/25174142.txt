Humans <i>are</i> animals.  If I have a family, I will care for my kin before strangers who don&#x27;t know any better or are too stupid to help themselves.  At a certain scale, helping hopeless people starts to harm society.<p>This is true regardless of your political persuasion.  Republicans point to never ending handouts and democrats point to &quot;deplorables&quot;.  Both are disgusting, however it&#x27;s ironic what those in the west consider &quot;suffering&quot; in one of the most wealthy nations on earth.  Laziness and self pity will kill a man faster than simply being disadvantaged.')
