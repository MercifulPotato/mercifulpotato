I&#x27;m a senior PM at a large e-comm company, I was EXTREMELY frustrated with the horrible performance of Jira Cloud, I submitted support tickets to no avail. It&#x27;s obviously an over-architected broken system.<p>I moved my team to clubhouse, even-though it created an element of fragmentation considering all other teams are using JIRA. I&#x27;m so happy though with clubhouse, I can actually get my work done without mindlessly waiting for every interaction.<p>Icing on the cake: I was considering moving the company over to Jira on a self hosted AWS instance, I&#x27;ve read that it can be a little faster. but.. they&#x27;re discontinuing the self hosted option. Nail in the coffin for me.<p>Good bloody riddance.')
