I don&#x27;t really find that too compelling, to be honest - what&#x27;s your NAT buying you if you don&#x27;t have many users to mix your traffic with?<p>I live alone and as far as I can see, all my NAT does for my privacy is a smidgen of plausible deniability (maybe a visitor on my guest wifi made that request), and that you can&#x27;t tell which of my devices I&#x27;m using when I access a particular service - which is a small privacy win, but not a meaningful one in my book.  Even for what I imagine is the common case of a family sharing one router, I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s usually not challenging to distinguish traffic between the relatively small number of potential users&#x2F;devices.<p>If you&#x27;re lucky(?) enough to be behind a NAT with enough hosts to be meaningful privacy-wise (dozens? hundreds?), and whoever&#x27;s running this NAT isn&#x27;t keeping logs about it (do they? honestly don&#x27;t know), then you might be seeing a  significant privacy upside. But it&#x27;s not built-in to the protocol, and just adding a NAT doesn&#x27;t buy you any privacy by itself.<p>I think the problem is that the privacy enhancing part of NAT is an emergent side-effect, not the main goal. Now it&#x27;s got me thinking there should be something like NAT but explicitly targeted to privacy, like guaranteeing that your traffic is mixed through an IP that minimum a hundred other people are using. Or something like that.')
