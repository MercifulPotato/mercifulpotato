Often times I feel Scrum was more invented as a way to centralize communication under the lofty goal of increasing its quality, and decreasing the quantity of communication (make all activities central to reduce decentralized meetings with loads of people). Which to me says the opposite of making communication cheap.<p>In practice, I feel the opposite tends to happen too. Not only does the quantity increase, but the quality of these centralized activities is questionable at best, and high quality decentralized activities slowly disappear due to the increased overhead. In tight knit teams, I find many of the centralized activities are unnecessary, since we deal with them as we go anyway. If we don&#x27;t, someone will end up blocked for a day if not multiple days. The only exceptions being large design choices and assuring everyone works towards the same goal. If you need to sync on that every day in your average CRUD webapp dev team, I highly question how tightly knit the team is.')
