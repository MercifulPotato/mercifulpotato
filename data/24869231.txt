If control transistors are faulty there is no guarantee about the processor behavior.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know about Intel cpu protections, but in modern secure hardware we include dedicated circuits for power&#x2F;clock glitch detection.\nThe glitch detection circuit is designed with a higher sensibility to power&#x2F;clock fault than the rest of the circuit, this way its avoids that clock&#x2F;power faults affect the integrity of the circuit output.')
