Don&#x27;t release something with an Apache License if you don&#x27;t want people copying it with compatible licenses. Also, patents of open source software (to limit uses that the license would otherwise allow) and API copyrights are pretty strongly frowned upon in the open source community. As a note, the Apache license you released Lightning under grants patent lawsuit protection to anyone using your code under the license so claiming patent infringement on another Apache licensed project seems amazingly skeevy.<p>If this is the philosophical stance that Grid and Lightning are taking then it&#x27;s definitely a project I&#x27;m going to advice people to stay well clear off. It&#x27;s the worst flavor of commercialized open source software and potentially a legal liability to touch in any way as you seem way too lawsuit trigger happy.')
