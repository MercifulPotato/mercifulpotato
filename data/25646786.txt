Item(by='twic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609862004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645268, text='&gt; Seems clear that this is for a thread requiring C connections simultaneously to get its work done.<p>Exactly. As that document says (my emphasis):<p>&gt; The prospect of &quot;pool-locking&quot; has been raised with respect to single actors <i>that acquire many connections</i>. This is largely an application-level issue. Yes, increasing the pool size can alleviate lockups in these scenarios, but we would urge you to examine first what can be done at the application level before enlarging the pool.<p>&gt; Where Tn is the maximum number of threads, and Cm is the maximum number of <i>simultaneous connections</i> held by a single thread.<p>To be honest, i think applications do this are broken (&quot;largely an application-level issue&quot;), so i&#x27;m not sure how important it is.')
