It’s specifically optimised for small core applications, with extensions allowing efficient support for only the additional functionality needed for a specific product. Complaining that RISC-V isn’t well suited to designs competing with Snapdragons and M1 is somewhat missing the point.<p>There has been some talk of a breaking fork of RISC-V better suited to large high performance designs. I think that makes a lot of sense and would allow RISC-V to stay good at what it was intended for.')
