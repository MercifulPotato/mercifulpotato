Haven&#x27;t decided which is truer.<p>Same thing to me. What do you &quot;risk&quot;, except not making money? It all boils down to money.<p>&gt; ultimately, they shouldn&#x27;t be decision makers. Taking risk is important<p>Agreed - as long as you can take said risk, because again it all boils down to money. These people help you do that by not spending as much while achieving the same (or better) outcomes.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a balance.<p>Totally! As for MBAs and the likes, I see them as XOs: I decide on the direction and give the orders. They implement them.<p>Their perspective is different from mine - which is surprisingly closer to the first line workers, who hold a lot of valuable insights (about optimization, client needs, etc) that may be lost due to the middle layer (of MBAs etc)<p>But the middle layer has its own role to play, to save money and keep operations smooth and reduce costs (risks) whenever possible.')
