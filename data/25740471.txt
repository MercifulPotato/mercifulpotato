Why can&#x27;t it fall back on something like a PRNG until &#x2F;dev&#x2F;(u)random gains enough entropy?<p>The original crash report generates an error for a file name already existing. A simple PRNG algorithm, perhaps seeded with a &quot;random&quot; RDRAND number, should fit that purpose easily, shouldn&#x27;t it?<p>A 32 bit random number, as used to generate the examples, isn&#x27;t good enough to guarantee uniqueness anyway. It seems like the original reporter&#x27;s specific CPU silicon or their loaded microcode does have a problem (because the boot fails on that particular chip so often) but the general dependency on RDRAND continues to confuse me.')
