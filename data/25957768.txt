It is world-renowned, and one of the top brands in the world; a synonym for &quot;Quality.&quot;<p>I won&#x27;t name it, because I don&#x27;t want them to have to deal with my random stuff (although I won&#x27;t say bad things about them). It&#x27;s easy to figure out, if you care enough to look at my profile.<p>Although I often had fierce disagreements with their management and engineering process, these folks had &quot;Quality&quot; in their DNA, and inculcated a basic mindset of quality in me.<p>To this day, I actually get physically uncomfortable, if I know of bugs in my work. My goal is to write 100% bug-free software. We all know that&#x27;s basically impossible, but it is possible to write software of such Quality, that the bug count approaches zero. In most cases, I don&#x27;t bother setting up bug tracking systems, because the reports are so few that it&#x27;s not worth the agita. GitHub Issues is fine for me. Most of the interactions that I have are about usability and UX. These tend to be more casual, and &quot;back-and-forth,&quot; than formal bug reports.<p>I have been sneered at for this attitude.<p>I find that annoying, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a fairly ambitious project, where my approach is very much appreciated. I would be unable to do it, if I applied the typical &quot;churn out crap to reach MVP&quot; that seems to be <i>de rigeur</i>, in the industry. The Quality of my work, means that I can develop a platform, alone, that usually requires a team.')
