I&#x27;ve noticed in many fields that the most successful people are slightly overconfident. On the face of it this seems implausible. Surely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate of one&#x27;s abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken? Because this error compensates for other sources of error in the opposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you against both other people&#x27;s skepticism and your own.<p>I disagree. Being overconfident compensates for the amount of <i>luck</i> you need to succeed. If 100 people are overconfident, and 5 of them succeed, it paid off for these 5 to be overconfident - because when you have that kind of luck, overconfidence is the appropriate level of confidence.<p>For an excellent demonstration of the importance of luck: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&amp;vl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&amp;vl=en</a>')
