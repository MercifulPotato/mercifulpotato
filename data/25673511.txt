And those taxes expire for the people, showing who Trump really worked for in this case.<p>&gt;no new wars,<p>Yet destabilizing many areas of the world, leaving it in the opinion of some countries in a much less peaceful place. Here&#x27;s Germany putting Trump as &quot;Greatest Threat to World Peace &quot; [1]. He&#x27;s destabilized NATO, he&#x27;s attacked the US and other intelligence forces to where the US is no longer trusted, likely causing other agencies to share less intel with us. Here&#x27;s how a lot of the first world thinks of Trump [2].<p>&gt;leaving each state making their own decisions for covid-19<p>And his lack of leadership is a central reason the US has 350K_ dead, while other first world countries only have a fraction of the death and economic downturn Trump caused.<p>Trump also fought states having the right to their own election rules, didn&#x27;t want states to deal with immigration on their own terms, didn&#x27;t want states to deal with protests on their own terms, has repeatedly claimed he has absolute authority over state decisions (including COVID related ones where he claimed he could dictate economic policy, which he didn&#x27;t have), and on and on....<p>Trump uses &quot;states rights&quot; to score political points only - pretend to respect them when he wants, and attack them when he wants.<p>When your evaulation uses a fallacy (cherry-picking) you end up ignoring the majority of the eivdence, your assessment ends up incorrect.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;donald-trump-angela-merkel-germans-putin-kim-1479235" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;donald-trump-angela-merkel-germans-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;us-image-plummets-internationally-as-most-say-country-has-handled-coronavirus-badly&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;us-image-plumm...</a>')
