In your examples, the types do not imply the invariants that you want.<p>Does this mean that the type system is faulty? No! It just means that you need to e.g. get a more expressive type system, document code properly, use smart constructors. There are many tools.<p>Nobody said you can trivially prove everything using type systems. So what are your examples showing?<p>I see your code, but I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re actually trying to do. One interpretation could be, that you want to prove that for the naturals (excluding 0), up to and including 2, there is an odd number. Can one prove this using type systems? Definitely. If you read Software Foundations, you will know how.')
