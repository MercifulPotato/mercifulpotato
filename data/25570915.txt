Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609257131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566979, text='&gt;VISA says they do 150M transactions per day. I’m not sure how many are US, but let’s say half. Avg BTC transaction is 250 bytes, so you’d need about 10GB a day (about 70MB) blocks to do what you propose.<p>Your calculations are off. It&#x27;s closer to 20GB per day: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=150%2C000%2C000+*+0.5+*+250+bytes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=150%2C000%2C000+*+0.5+...</a><p>&gt;A 3TB drive is $39 on Amazon right now. So maybe 13c a day in storage costs to run half of visa’s US transactions.<p>Redoing the calculations with the correct figures comes to 24.4 cents per day. That might not seem a lot, but that&#x27;s also $89&#x2F;year, which makes it a non-negligible expense for anyone wanting to run a full node. Not to mention, the data would have to be stored for eternity, so someone wanting to start a full node 5 years from now will need to invest almost $500 just to get started. That would put someone wanting to run a full bitcoin node into &#x2F;r&#x2F;datahoarder territory.')
