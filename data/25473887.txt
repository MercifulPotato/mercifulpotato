I dislike the startup scene too<p>You know what they say, behind every joke is some shred of truth; but I don&#x27;t <i>dislike</i> the startup scene per se, I do however detest what its morphed into these last 2 decades and how they conceal themselves as people wanting to &#x27;make the World a better place&#x27; or act as &#x27;disrupters&#x27; when in reality they are just playing the game that diverts funding away from actual solution based startups to the sexier sounding pointless and into their own pockets and they almost always have those qualities you listed with just the right connections to make it happen.<p>I didn&#x27;t want funding for my startup in fintech which is why I preferred being out of the Bay area after one summer in Sunnyvale, as it meant losing control of operations and we were in uncharted territory that would eventually lead to a watershed moment in legislation; but being forced to listen to a few investor&#x27;s meetings after listening to lobbyists and politicians hours earlier I quickly realized what a waste of talent and resources this system is. And how both systems have the same incentives misaligned and create the same end result: massive waste.')
