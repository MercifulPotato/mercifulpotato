Of the two, I generally prefer the OSS and off-the-shelf tooling at Square.<p>I wrapped a 2-year stint at Facebook recently and my experience was similar to yours.<p>Some tools were amazing and cool and I really appreciated how they evolved over time to manage huge amounts of resources. But most were subpar when compared to OSS tooling - outdated, deprecated functionality, very little documentation, very few people working on them. The common approach was to learn about &quot;the duct tape&quot; way to make something work, then pass it on to new engineers.<p>An example would be tool X for working with diffs (PRs). It&#x27;s the latest and greatest, except that it only covers 75% of its predecessor&#x27;s, tool Y&#x27;s, functionality, so you end up learning both. Tool Y has been &quot;deprecated&quot; for the past 3-4 years. Some of its features don&#x27;t work, but you&#x27;ll only know when you try and execute them.')
