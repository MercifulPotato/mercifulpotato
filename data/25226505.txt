Item(by='Cu3PO42', descendants=None, kids=[25227623], score=None, time=1606464726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25224463, text='A function with type A -&gt; B is essentially equivalent to an object of type B^A. I can give you some relatively intuition for the case that A is finite. Imagine B^|A|, this is a list of B elements with one for every element in A. You can therefore interpret it as the return value for every possible input. Therefore it uniquely defines a function A -&gt; B!<p>The type of pairs is just the cartesian product. Therefore (A×B)-&gt;C ~ C^(A×B) = (C^B)^A ~ A-&gt;B-&gt;C.<p>If you find this sort of thing, you might be interested in category theory :)')
