(This is not quite what xwayland, xweston, xwlnest do. They run the server X out of process and can&#x27;t manage wayland windows because they don&#x27;t know anything about the internal wayland state)<p>To that point, you would have to decide if it&#x27;s more worth it to fork xwayland and merge with an existing wayland compositor, or to fork xfree86 and add wayland.')
