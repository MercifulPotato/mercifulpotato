If you factor in broader aspects of performance (e.g. Face ID, fingerprint unlock speed) it’s clear that the _only_ thing most Android users care about is cost. I’m not saying this to diss them, I just think the Android manufacturers owe it to their users to actually produce competitive hardware and software.<p>P.S. if you factor in longevity, Apple products are usually cheaper, too.')
