And the thing is that is hard to make people aware about this issue, especially elder people. I have just helped an old lady with her own new laptop and I was completely shocked the number of steps that we had to go through to get her Windows 10 working for her brand new Acer laptop (asked for PIN number, fingerprint, Microsoft account and don&#x27;t know what else mumbo jumbo just to get it running). Proprietary software definitely is going in the wrong direction and people generally are ok with it. 15 or 20 years ago you got a CD and that was more than enough to get things running. Sometimes I think how lucky I&#x27;m to be able to put a FreeBSD&#x2F;OpenBSD&#x2F;Linux in my computers and do whatever the f* I want with it and get rid of all the nonsense and bs that multi-billion companies are putting in front of us to consume.')
