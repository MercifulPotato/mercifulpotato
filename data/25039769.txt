They managed to add 2GB ram, double default storage to 128gb, increase battery by 50% and still make the phone $200 cheaper. It&#x27;s the perfect BoM if it wasn&#x27;t for mmWave.<p>Paying $100 more for mmWave is ridiculous. That&#x27;s a 15% price increase for something that most people don&#x27;t need or care for. The fact that you can&#x27;t buy the non-mmWave version in the US is what makes this a really bad decision. The same is not true for the 4a 5G, which is $500 on the Google Store without mmWave, but has a special $600 Verizon-only version you can get with mmWave. So I have no idea why they didn&#x27;t do the same for the Pixel 5. Instead you are forced to buy the mmWave version even if you&#x27;re getting the device through Google Store and will never use mmWave.<p>Meanwhile here in Canada it&#x27;s $800 CAD ($600 USD), so I&#x27;m happy I got the phone for a great price. That being said, if you don&#x27;t care for 90hz display, wireless charging and waterproofing, 4a is definitely a fantastic deal at half the price.')
