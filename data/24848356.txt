Item(by='jawns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603291458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24841998, text='I think there are two takeaways from this experiment.  One is not at all noteworthy and one is somewhat interesting but has limited applications.<p>The uninteresting takeaway is that people note whether a photo is B&amp;W&#x2F;color and use that to help date the photo.  Well, no kidding.  We use a lot of contextual information to try to figure that out: not only B&amp;W&#x2F;color but also graininess, hair&#x2F;clothing styles, architectural clues, etc.  It should not be surprising that we do this.  In fact, it would be surprising if we didn&#x27;t do this.<p>The slightly more interesting takeaway is that we&#x27;re bad at it, likely because most people don&#x27;t have an accurate idea about when color photography became mainstream, and possibly also because some people fail to realize that sometimes B&amp;W is an artistic choice, rather than a technical limitation.<p>As for what applications that might have ... well, I&#x27;m not sure.  If it&#x27;s extremely important (for, say, financial or political reasons) to accurately date a photo, my guess is that you&#x27;ll bring an expert rather than a layman who knows to account for this.  So really the only time I see the effect coming into play is when you have an armchair historian who doesn&#x27;t know their own limitations.')
