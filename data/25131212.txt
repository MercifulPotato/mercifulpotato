This Challenge focuses on the development of data-driven models to predict COVID-19 infection rates and to prescribe Intervention Plans that regional governments, communities, and organizations can implement to contain the pandemic and reopen safely.  Because of the urgency of this topic, the competition happens on a fast timeline, so we encourage teams to get started quickly.
