The damage was done years ago and these groups have already largely jumped ship to their own self-hosted platforms.<p>Doing this now makes me think their leadership are all cowards, at best.  It reveals that leadership knew this step should have been done a long time ago, but failed to act due to fear.  Had they left it alone, at least we could have all bought into this BS notion that it was due to fairness and a belief in free speech.<p>I say, cowards, at best, because what would be worse, is that this is entirely motivated by finances.
