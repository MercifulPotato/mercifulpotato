It is going to happen.<p>Donald Trump&#x27;s administration openly considered declaring BLM a terrorist group. I don&#x27;t want someone like that deciding what does and doesn&#x27;t count as neutral speech. That is a thousand times more dangerous to me than Facebook making the same decision.<p>It is startlingly naive for people not to understand that terrorism laws and &#x27;neutral-speech&#x27; laws will be used against causes they agree with. Republicans in particular are kind of jumping the gun by encouraging the government to get involved with speech literally during a period where they no longer control the presidency, or the house, or the senate.')
