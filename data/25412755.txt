I can&#x27;t find any evidence easily that Dan did have such tool, but &quot;by the early 2000s&quot; it&#x27;s not at all unthinkable certainly. If you have a link that&#x27;d be great.<p>However the trouble is MD5 collision isn&#x27;t like that hilarious &quot;Send all zeroes&quot; Microsoft bug from a few weeks back where you just try it a few times then it works because someone was very stupid - the MD5 collision is pretty hard, the Merkle–Damgård construction actually works, your attack avenue is hammering on the compression function, everything else in MD5 (and any other Merkle–Damgård construction) works because of mathematics unless you can break that compression function - so having a program that when you run it spits out an MD5 collision with your preferred shape is great, it&#x27;s a cryptographic breakthrough - but maybe it&#x27;ll take 5000 years to run on a typical home PC. If you&#x27;re a government or a big crime boss then money turns that into 5 days or (if you&#x27;ve enough of it) 5 hours instead, but if you&#x27;re a bored teenager or small time crook not so much.<p>And like I said, Flame depends on a never before seen collision, so it isn&#x27;t like they just re-used work somebody else had done.')
