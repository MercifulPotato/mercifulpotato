I suppose Wodehousian or Jane Austen-style comedies of manners set on Shipboard probably weren&#x27;t really his forte.<p>It&#x27;s more than the Culture is a gimmick Banks use both as a light way to explore the limit of a somewhat ruleless utopia where mankind surrendered most of its power to an a benevolent deity and to write entertaining pieces of fiction.<p>He didn&#x27;t use the setting and published as Iain Banks rather than Iain M.
