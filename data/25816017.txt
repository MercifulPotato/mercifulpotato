The reason Bitcoin and Ethereum can send transactions of any size for the same fee is because ALL transactions are secured by the entire network, regardless of their size. So they just charge the cost of what a consensus process would take (proof of work, nakamoto consensus in this case) for the entire network to agree on the linear order of that transaction in the sequence. It’s a brute force inefficient approach. Like transporting $1 in the same armored vehicle with a convoy as $1,000,000')
