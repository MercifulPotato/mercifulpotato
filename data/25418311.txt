Foregoing the possibility of a library implementation, a possible design choice could be to eliminate the   guard    statement as it would eliminate the need for an additional reserved keyword and the requirement for programmers to\ncreate guarded blocks around deferred statements. If the   guard    statement is not used, the proposed changes to the behavior of the   break  statement would likely be eliminated as well (see Appendix K).')
