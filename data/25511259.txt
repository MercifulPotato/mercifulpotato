So you need a capture chip <i>with low latency</i> or else things are bad for &quot;life&quot; usage. This is often another 60-130€ for something decent if brought anew.<p>Plus they don&#x27;t have a monitor clip so you need buy an additional stand.<p>Sure you can buy used parts but then you also need to compare it with used part prices for webcams which normally (i.e. non Covid19) are also lower.<p>I mean a Sony a5100 with usable objective currently sells new for ~US$700 but you can probably get it <i>new</i> for that price with capture card and stand if you buy clever and we ignore Covid19 for fairness.<p>(And even used you are still far above 250€ for any recent decently usable mirror less camera with objective in  my experience.)')
