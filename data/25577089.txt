They are not. They have increased.<p>We don&#x27;t know why they have increased, we don&#x27;t even know if the current numbers are accurate.<p>It may very well be due to lockdown.<p>Suicide rates may well be higher than has currently been reported.<p>This report acknowledges that.<p>You however did not.  You pretty much trivialized the severity of the truth behind these horrible numbers.  \nI think you never read the report and just copied the twitter statement, and are now irritated because you got called on it.<p>For arguments sake<p>If I state that medical doctors have the highest suicide rates among all the professions (which is true).<p>Would you still trivialize the 2020 increase in suicide rates if I could show you that more oncologists took their own lives in 2020 than in 2019?<p>What if I could show you that the increase comes from unemployed, physically healthy men under the age of 35?<p>What if there is a steep increase in suicides among the elderly who have sheltered in place since march ?<p>Context is everything. This report acknowledges that proper context is still missing, and it&#x27;s preliminary to draw conclusions other than that it looks like the increase was to be expected.<p>Which in itself is (pardon my french) fucking abysmal and should not go ignored.')
