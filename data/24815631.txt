There&#x27;s an evenly-illuminated backlight to identify the suckers in the first place, which can act as a backstop for the high-power beam. It&#x27;s almost as contained as a desktop laser cutter, and a lot less power. (Or at least shorter shots, anyway.) It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re firing beams into the sky or across the street or something.')
