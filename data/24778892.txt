I generally dislike 7-10 episode seasons though, I feel they&#x27;re way to short.<p>And yeah, the biggest issue is that Netflix is giving shows only <i>one</i> season, and usually a cliffhanger. It also kills off a lot of shows before they have a chance to get good: Star Trek is notorious for getting good around season 3 of any given series. A lot of iconic television wouldn&#x27;t have ever existed if it was cut off because of the quality of their first season.')
