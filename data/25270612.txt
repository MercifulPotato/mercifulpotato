And because the fusion reactor will also be much more technologically intricate, it will necessarily be much more expensive.   Since the balance of plant will be similar (or favorably to fission also; no cryo plant or tritium recovery needed, for example), fission will be cheaper than fusion.   And fission is already losing economically.<p>(*) The fundamental reason is that the power from the fusion reactor must radiate through the wall of the reactor, while the power from fission is transferred into coolant flowing through the reactor.   As a result, the volumetric power density will be lower by roughly a factor of (diameter of fusion reactor) &#x2F; (spacing of fuel elements in fission reactor), for equal power&#x2F;area through the walls of the fusion reactor and fuel rods.   ITER, for example, has a power density 400 times worse than a commercial PWR primary reactor vessel.')
