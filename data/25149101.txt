A surgeon and his colleagues I used to work with brought up the point how they often had to approach litigation of insurance companies regarding claims to pay for services rendered. I mean, their time is expensive, I get it, but this whole idea of forcing everyone to litigate transactions essentially puts the onus on the one with lower capital resources to pursue legal recourse.<p>Corporate structures are aware of this and play the statistics as to if they&#x27;ll pursue the proper action or simply take the infraction to court. This creates a new barrier to entry for people at large wishing to be fairly compensated: resources to litigate.<p>To me, this shows just how misaligned modern corporate entities interests are with society and it&#x27;s only going to get worse. These are, IMHO, some of the greatest threats to our society because they are legal, have a long history of legal precedent and are threats that come from within our own society.')
