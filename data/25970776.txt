Additionally you can access WSL2&#x27;s files through the \\\\wsl$ share. For example, &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;c&#x2F;windows&#x2F;notepad.exe ~&#x2F;file launches notepad on my Windows desktop and opens ~&#x2F;file from WSL2. While the integration isn&#x27;t perfect, it is usable.<p>The reason I prefer it to MacOS is that it is actually a real Linux kernel with all the trimmings - such as apt, docker, eBPF etc. My recent experience on MacOS is that every update seems to break Brew, which, while better than MacPorts, doesn&#x27;t even work all that well to begin with. MacOS is a weird BSD with poorly documented closed source system components such as launchd. If that&#x27;s your thing, it&#x27;s fine - but I personally find the Mac&#x2F;BSD userspace unpleasant to work with and am tired of fighting against it every time Apple decide to break my attempts to make it more tolerable.<p>Versus a VM it&#x27;s less clear, but the integration is actually fairly good, each of your WSL2 &quot;distros&quot; start instantly, you can launch them to the current directory in Explorer or use them from Windows Terminal without SSHing. For the most part, it _feels_ like Ubuntu is just a part of Windows.<p>My workflow with WSL2 is that I keep most of my repos in the Windows desktop and use Windows versions of JetBrains&#x27; IDEs or VSCode for most of my work, but then I use WSL for docker&#x2F;kubernetes, running CLI-oriented things like vim, ffmpeg, imagemagick, shell scripts, python, terraform, etc.<p>Plus, I have a Ryzen 5950X with 128GB memory, which isn&#x27;t strictly a limitation of MacOS, but it certainly makes my life a lot better!')
