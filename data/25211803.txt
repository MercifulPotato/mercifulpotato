Another opportunity to plug my fusion reactor!<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.DDproFusion.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.DDproFusion.com</a><p>The design has a lot of similarities to NIF in some respects. I aim to create an ultra dense implosion of deuterium ions.<p>Thats where the similarity ends though. The key to viability in my eyes is to recover the energy of the ions that don&#x27;t fuse to create another implosion.<p>In my device, ions leaving the focus are curved by a weak, uniform, magnetic field. Each ion travels along it&#x27;s cyclotron trajectory to circle back to the focus at the right time for the next implosion.')
