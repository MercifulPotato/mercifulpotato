That is a good place to start. Additionally the UN has more in depth declarations (e.g. Convention on the Rights of the Child[2]; which my native country of Iceland came within 5 minutes of breaking a month ago but the children were safely hid from the authorities who were going to unjustly deport them).<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.un.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;universal-declaration-human-rights&#x2F;ind...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ohchr.org&#x2F;EN&#x2F;ProfessionalInterest&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;CRC.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ohchr.org&#x2F;EN&#x2F;ProfessionalInterest&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;CRC.aspx</a><p>---<p>PS. I truly encourage everyone to read the Declaration of Human Rights[1] in their native language. It is such a beautiful read and gives you a sense of shared humanity. It is not that long, and has over 500 translations. In my native language the translation is really clear and easy to follow.')
