Honest question. How to spend your hard-earned money when there is no society and market? Do you want your children to live in a peaceful, prospering world or a burning one (maybe with slightly more dollars in their account)?<p>I don&#x27;t get this sentiment. Everything is politics nowadays and choosing to &quot;ban&quot; it just means egocentrically accepting that we are heading for a worse future.<p>(And no, &quot;politics&quot; doesnt mean that the company will become an echo chamber and different opinions should be silenced - the opposite is the case. But BS needs to be called out as what it is...)')
