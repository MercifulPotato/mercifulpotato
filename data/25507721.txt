EU countries together outpace Russian military spending with large marging.  Russia has no capability to act outside it&#x27;s borders in high intensity warfare.  Even  limited involvement in Syria is wearing down their aircraft.<p>European defence has structural problem: scattering military resources all over the Europe. Spain, France and Belgium should keep most of their main battle tanks in Poland and send troops to train there. Russian amphibious attack  from the North Atlantic is not a threat.')
