I also chose no gap-close because of jinx&#x27;s passive and w. It generated:<p>kraken -&gt; boots -&gt; rfc -&gt; ie -&gt; last whisper -&gt; vamp scepter -&gt; dominik -&gt; bt<p>I&#x27;m surprised to see this even with high hp recovery - I asked for no armor pen, but it decided to build dominik&#x27;s anyways, and it doesn&#x27;t buy a vamp scepter until after 3.5 completed items. If I went this build, about 99% of my games would end before I got ie, everything after that matters a lot less, and so I&#x27;m surprised to see it push everything non-&quot;core&quot; (including the armor pen I didn&#x27;t want) into the end of the build.')
