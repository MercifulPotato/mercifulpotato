Use tutorials and examples only to help you get to this goal; take detour as required. I think this approach will be easier to stay motivated with, than doing tutorials start-finish.<p>ESP32 is a popular MCU that connects to WIFI, and has cheap dev boards: I recommend you find a tutorial for this MCU to start with. A downside, is that its official docs are lacking compared to other MCUs, like the STM32.<p>Once you have something working using a dev board, learn PCB design software; a nice free one is KiCad. JLCPCB is a cheap, fast service that will create your PCB, and solder the smaller components on to it. You will have to hand solder the bigger ones.<p>Programming languages suitable for this are C, C++, and Rust. Are you proficient in at least one of them?')
