Item(by='tchalla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610253694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710029, text='&gt; This sounds like a weird way to invest. According to this logic I should invest $.01 in BTC and then to borrow from a funny commenter in this thread, $.01 in Dodgecoin, $.01 in Ether, $.01 in baseball cards, $.01 in wine, $.01 in beanie babies, etc etc etc etc etc - that basically any investment that exists deserves my dollars.<p>Honestly, I found that comment disrespectful and making a mockery of a point - it&#x27;s all too common these days. If I were to take the opposite of the comment, we should NOT invest in anything and stay 100% in cash because each and every asset has risks and volatility.<p>&gt; I disagree. There&#x27;s plenty of stuff one &quot;could&quot; invest in and very few one &quot;should.&quot;<p>You know that I agree with you right? I never said you SHOULD invest in BTC. I was making the point that IF one wants to invest in the BTC, then one can do so by a minimal asset allocation. It fits within your &quot;expected value&quot; framework.<p>&gt; But the point of diversification is to secure uncorrelated positive returns. A negative return on the other hand is just a negative return. I totally agree with you that I could be wrong in my short case on BTC, my logic rests on it.<p>I agree. But, surely if you were willing to consider an Armageddon scenario for BTC; you could also consider a 100% upside scenario too. We did a thought experiment on the Armageddon scenario, I haven&#x27;t seen any calculations on the upside.<p>&gt; And just in defense of my case - I think about markets as someone who&#x27;s studied and worked in them for 18+ years. Doesn&#x27;t mean I am right and I have an open mind. So whenever I encounter someone who has the opposite view, I explain to them my case with the hopes that they can point me to what I am missing, but I always walk away with the impression they hadn&#x27;t thought about the issue deeply and with nuance. Again, I could totally be wrong, but as an investor if it seems like I did my homework and the others are driven by hype&#x2F;FOMO&#x2F;not understanding then I am gonna sit it out :)<p>I am grateful for you that you took the time to listen. I could not find a e-mail or contact on your profile. I&#x27;d be happy to take this offline and I want to understand what I am missing here.')
