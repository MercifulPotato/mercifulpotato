Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=[25210868], score=None, time=1606316236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209345, text='&gt; I can’t think of a single program off the top of my head that doesn’t use the Internet to some extent while running.<p>What OS are you using? Purely off the top of my head, Linux programs I don&#x27;t expect to be regularly connecting to the overall Internet in the background (at least unless I set an explicit opt-in setting or use a user-initiated action):<p>- Keepassxc<p>- Krita<p>- Blender<p>- Nearly all of my CLI tools<p>- digiKam<p>- VLC<p>- Audacity<p>- etc...<p>Programs I have that do check for updates or otherwise send activity to the Internet on boot:<p>- Firefox<p>- Calibre<p>- Emacs (Spacemacs)<p>- (Probably) something somewhere else that I&#x27;m forgetting?<p>Admittedly, I&#x27;m kind of cheating by using Linux instead of Windows&#x2F;Mac. Those are OSes that don&#x27;t have good update managers, so many apps manage updates themselves.<p>But even with those apps, there&#x27;s a difference between an app itself initiating an Internet connection opportunistically in the background, and an app initiating an Internet connection that actually interrupts the app from launching. Very few of my native apps (<i>side-eyes Emacs irritably</i>) will stop working or freeze on boot if their update server is down or responding slowly.<p>Remember that the reason people found out about this in the first place is that they went to start launching apps on their Macs and found out none of them would start. That&#x27;s the kind of behavior I would expect from a web browser if some global server was getting hammered (even if I would still be irritated to see it), but that I basically never expect for a native app.')
