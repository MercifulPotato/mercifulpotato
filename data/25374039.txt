Item(by='quadrifoliate', descendants=None, kids=[25380248], score=None, time=1607610787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373758, text='&gt; Mail-in voting really feels crazy from other countries. Just check why it was banned in France<p>This feel vaguely concern troll-y, but I&#x27;ll engage. I am sure that there are valid security concerns, and some possibilities for fraud with mail-in voting.<p>However the argument about &quot;Oh look it&#x27;s bad, there are so many possibilities for fraud&quot; would look a little more okay if the President wasn&#x27;t engaging in it [1] and his party wasn&#x27;t also quietly pushing for more of it in areas where it benefits them. Of course they find some flimsy excuse to justify this “well, ours is called an <i>absentee</i> ballot because you have to request it”.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways. If mail-in voting feels crazy, the 2016 election where like 25% of eligible voters voted by mail should also be considered invalid.<p>What is not okay is crying &quot;Fraud&quot; in nebulously defined ways for <i>only</i> the states you lost at <i>the moment</i> you start losing with the existing system. This is basic kindergarten stuff, so it&#x27;s kind of funny that it has to be explicitly explained in such a big national event.<p>------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;903886567&#x2F;trump-while-attacking-mail-voting-casts-mail-ballot-again" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;903886567&#x2F;trump-while-attacki...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;republicans-mail-in-voting-trump-398774" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;republicans-mail-in...</a>')
