You could do open loop stepper control with four big transistors, some logic, and a whopping heat sink. Closed loop meant learning how to tune the loop, and also involved the cost of the encoders.<p>If you&#x27;re using surplus parts, then getting enough documentation to make a servo system work can be touch and go. Steppers are pretty much brain dead simple.<p>Even with servos, the entire machine has to be pretty stout in order to ride through a bump that would cause a large stepping motor to miss a step. At that point, if it&#x27;s a homemade machine, something else will end up out of kilter too, such as your clamping or the workpiece itself.')
