Item(by='o_class_star', descendants=None, kids=[25328699, 25328571], score=None, time=1607304167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25325716, text='<i>The author went as far as to call him &quot;profoundly unserious public intellectual&quot;.</i><p>IQ-wise, Paul Graham is probably above 140— possibly well above 140— but that&#x27;s not the same thing as being intellectual. No one who follows him will say that he&#x27;s not intelligent.<p>Paul Graham is no Noam Chomsky. I think we can all agree on that. He&#x27;s not even in the same category as &quot;He Who Must Not Be Named&quot; (whom I should probably shut up about, lest I risk being banned or accused of being him).<p>PG has nerd credibility because he got rich in technology and may or may not have had something to do with the Morris Worm. He&#x27;s charismatic by nerd standards because he probably would break 165 on a GRE-V and because he&#x27;s learned enough about how rich people talk and think to bridge the otherwise impassible chasm between money people and makers. He made a shit-ton of money by coming of age in the year we all wish we had come of age in; he made that an even bigger shit-ton of money (YC) by monetizing the reputation he earned by writing half-decent essays and knowing the right people.<p>Paul Graham is like Jordan Peterson. In his native field of expertise, he knows a few things and he can present them very well. When it comes to politics, his opinions are poorly-thought-out, self-serving, and generally worthless.')
