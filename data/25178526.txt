These ends are all wonderful...eliminate poverty, curtail climate change, cheaper energy, etc.  But what&#x27;s missing is the idea of doing something for the sake of doing it.  It&#x27;s not totally clear what landing on the moon or maintaining a space station really accomplished in terms of material goals.  They&#x27;re glorious accomplishments because of their difficulty.<p>I think that attitude is what&#x27;s missing. Listening to JFK&#x27;s &quot;we will go to the moon&quot; speech is almost unbelievable today.  Politicians of either party absolutely cannot talk like that today.')
