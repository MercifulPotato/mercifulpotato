Their interview probably went like everyone else&#x27;s. But how can it be true that there was no special treatment beforehand, when it was a special &#x2F;apply2 endpoint?<p>Of course talented-but-disadvantaged people have a shot. None of this is to say that they don&#x27;t, and no one implied that special connections were a requirement. I know how hard YC works not to overlook those.<p>My position is that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it being a special exception. Instacart seemed to be, too. But that&#x27;s different than saying there was no exception.')
