Volatile ensures that access through the variable must behave strictly according to the rules of the C abstract machine, but <i>the definition of access is implementation defined</i>. A compiler author could define &quot;access&quot; to be &quot;reads from the variable&quot; or &quot;writes to the variable&quot;, or neither, and make the entire keyword useless. As long as they document that somewhere, it&#x27;s compliant with the standard. You think it means &quot;reads and writes&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to write a &quot;malicious compliance C compiler&quot; that complies with the standard but makes all the most perverse possible choices.')
