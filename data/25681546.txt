Neither is well fit for this. \nI&#x27;d like instead to have &quot;unknown&quot; value&#x2F;type which saves stack(or at least file&#x2F;line) at time of its creation, but otherwise behaves like null&#x2F;nothing. So that it can be easily ignored, but causes an exception when dereferencing is attempted. Having this additional creation-time stack information available in that exception should help debugging.')
