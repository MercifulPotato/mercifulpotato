Because as far as I know, Apple only allows NetworkExtension-based apps to be distributed via the App Store, according to their developer relations guy [6], so we&#x27;re locked in.  And even if they were to change that someday somehow, and we went to standalone distribution, we would then have to support two parallel distribution channels so as not to abandon former Mac App Store users, presumably, which means we&#x27;d still be limited by App Store restrictions.')
