It is part of our async communication. If someone hasn&#x27;t committed code for a few days I&#x27;d be concerned they were going down a bad path or getting stuck.<p>I may not even communicate with that team member outside of a PR for the whole week so that&#x27;s where most of our communication happens if I don&#x27;t see them in slack or zoom - which would be the case if our work hours don&#x27;t overlap.<p>But hey! As long as what yall are doing works for you then no worries. No team manages their code the same way - which I&#x27;d say is another plus for git.')
