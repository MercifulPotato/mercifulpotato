A lot of the code I write is in that price range and is written as I sit in front of the TV. The most interesting thing I&#x27;ve discovered is that hobbyists don&#x27;t mind paying for code, but they really don&#x27;t want to pay anything but the lowest possible prices for hardware even after it&#x27;s been explained why the dirt cheap Arduino peripherals are often crap and spending just a few dollars more for better designed stuff is worth it. AliExpress has firmly anchored the price of hardware at close to $0.<p>The only ones who take me up on my offer to write all the code and assemble the hardware are businesses. Hobbyists will struggle for weeks to save a few bucks.<p>My best customers are small or micro businesses who need a simple thing automated but the project size is below the threshold that engineering services firms want to deal with. Many of them are engineers themselves who just want to farm the task out and get it over with.<p>My original idea was that I saw a hole in the market that could be filled by code on the level of PLC programming, but on more flexible hardware. I&#x27;m still sure that the hole exists, but it&#x27;s not clear just how scalable my approach is.')
