It&#x27;s possible to assign source port&#x2F;address combos that route to different hosts.<p>For example, I can say that:<p>* 1.1.1.1:80 routes to 192.168.1.2:80,<p>* 8.8.8.0&#x2F;24:80 routes to 192.168.1.3:80, and<p>* everything else on port 80 routes to 192.168.1.4:8080<p>It&#x27;s possible to get even more convoluted, though not recommended.')
