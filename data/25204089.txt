They mean nothing to all of us reading this comment on Linux systems that give us less fuss than Windows (and I know because I game on it) and there&#x27;s nothing actionable. It&#x27;s just a &quot;nuh uh!!&quot; after someone suggests there might be a better tool for the job.<p>Also, I really can&#x27;t sympathize with this implication that not following the platform UI principles is somehow fundamentally &quot;breaking&quot; the user experience. It&#x27;s virtually impossible to find two mainstream, popular, &quot;good-UX&quot; Win10 or OS X apps that follow some mythic standard UI.')
