Algorithms similar to this are fairly common in the Clojure ecosystem. Memoization is part of the standard library too.<p>The claim (in the article) that no one cares about Differential Dataflow seems to be only true when talking about this specific library. The general concept surely translates to some combination of simple concepts like memoization, topological sorting, partial application, etc. so it&#x27;s obvious to me that many adhoc implementations would exist tailored to more specific needs in a different programming languages with different feature sets. Sometimes buying into a framework is a lot more work than rolling your own, especially if it means having to switch to a different programming language.')
