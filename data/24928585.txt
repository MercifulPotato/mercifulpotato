Bilinear will only interpolate among the 4 nearest source image pixels. It still ignores most of the source pixels.<p>This is in essence a special version of sampling artifacts, aliasing artifacts. Anyone writing image processing software should already know about aliasing, the Nyquist theorem etc. Or, well, perhaps not in the current hype, where everyone is a computer vision expert who took one Keras tutorial...<p>Resizing with nearest neighbor or bilinear (ie ignoring aliasing) also hurts ML accuracy, so they better fix it even regardless of this specific &quot;attack&quot;.')
