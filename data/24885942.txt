So here is my wish list for a non-intrusive phone<p>- e-ink\n- phone calls\n- SMS (I don&#x27;t send them, but I need them for 2FA)\n- contact book synced with Google\n- calendar synced with Google\n- clock with alarms, timer and stopwatch\n- weather\n- music, it would be nice to use Spotify because I&#x27;ve invested a lot of time creating playlists but local files would do\n- bluetooth to send music to speakers\n- flashlight\n- sound recording (for calls recording and voice notes)\n- Whatsapp, it&#x27;s my most used form of communication with family, friends and colleagues. But only text, no videos or images<p>Optional but nice:\n- tethering\n- QR codes store for things like tickets that I could send from another device<p>It would be enough for most of my day. I would have a second device for web browsing, maps and navigation, email, banking, QR reading, documents, gaming, etc., that I would only use when I really want to do those things.')
