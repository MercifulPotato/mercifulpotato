Item(by='vikramkr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602552461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761352, text='Apple trees aren&#x27;t inbred - the seeds will not grow into the same variety as the parent. Usually, store bought apples will have seeds that produce inferior fruit since crabapples are used as a pollinator (apples aren&#x27;t really all that self fertile) - so the seeds are hybrid crabapple seeds. You&#x27;ll still get a tree that produces fruit that makes a good jam, but not great eating apples. Its not true that you&#x27;re guaranteed to get an inferior quality fruit from planting a seed - otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t ever develop new varieties - but the conditions that made your supermarket apple happen will result in a eating apple&#x2F;crabapple hybrid more often than not. Because they don&#x27;t really self pollinate, you&#x27;re not going to be able to create a breed of apple that produces offspring generally identical to the parent plant, so the only way to keep a variety going is to clone it with grafting techniques.')
