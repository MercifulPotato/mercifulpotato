Now you&#x27;re claiming the articles aren&#x27;t enough.&quot;<p>Um yeah, because they are not? They don&#x27;t say anything about rising rents causing homelessness, they only mention the same correlation you also mentioned (rich city has many homeless), which doesn&#x27;t provide any causation. In fact most of them don&#x27;t provide any evidence at all. Some web site claiming &quot;x causes y&quot; is not actually evidence for anything.<p>&quot;In many cities they have in fact done this and it works pretty well. It&#x27;s significantly cheaper than the hospital visits and the extra burden on the police force.&quot;<p>Sure, but that was not what we are discussing. We are discussing the claim that rising wealth increases homelessness. That&#x27;s an entirely different question. In fact wealthy regions would probably be better able to provide free housing for homeless people than poor places.<p>If you have actual experience working with homeless people, give us some real information.')
