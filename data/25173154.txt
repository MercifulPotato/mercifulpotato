Porkbun is pretty small and I feel like there&#x27;s less room for underperforming support staff when you have less than 10 of them.<p>Porkbun has an extra &quot;domain password protection&quot; option where you can require and extra password retrieving an auth code for domain transfer.  I&#x27;m not sure how much use that is though.  Once someone is into the account to the point they can change NS, the real world impact is similar to having the domain transferred away (and recovered).')
