Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[24977597], score=None, time=1604390975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977206, text='&gt; My intuition is that if I personally came up with a cute &quot;gotcha&quot; like this where I wound up paying zero in taxes because of some loophole, I would go to prison. Why isn&#x27;t the same standard applied to rich companies?<p>I know of one &quot;gotcha&quot; that works in my country at least: work for low &#x2F; no wage but instead have loads of assets like stocks; dividend taxes are much lower than income taxes.<p>I could be wrong. I&#x27;m just reminded of people like the Google founders who humblebragged about only earning $1 &#x2F; year in salary. They still became multi-billionaires off of stocks.<p>In my country, assets are taxed by a percentage of a percentage (they tax estimated return on investment, which is ridiculous if you only have a savings account that nowadays has either no interest or even negative interest). I think there should be an additional tax on any money or assets moving out of said investment account.<p>Because that&#x27;s how rich people do it; they hardly pay any taxes because they have hardly any taxable income or assets. They put their house into a corporation or foundation, funnel any cash they need through various shell organizations and tax havens, etc.')
