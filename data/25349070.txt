In CL, you can in theory take code from ABCL, and then run it over SBCL, but the spec is actually a lie, and not all code will be portable, and most implementation have their own slight deviation and additions to the Spec. And in CL, each implementation is basically the same with a few differences, and thus very few reasons to use one or the other. Where as in Clojure, there&#x27;s good reasons to go from Clojure Java to ClojureScript to Clojure CLR, to Babashka, to Clojerl, to Ferret, etc. Each time you switch the target platform you get a Clojure that is well adapted to the new platform host. That has made it much more practical I&#x27;ve found in practice. It&#x27;s actually because there are enough host specific differences that in the end I find it more useful.')
