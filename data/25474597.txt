I bound a couple books for a bookbinding merit badge back in ancient times. One was a blank book, which I used for notes.<p>I used thread and sewed it together. It was an easy project. It&#x27;s like making a metal toolbox in high school metal shop. Sure, you can just go buy one, but it&#x27;s nice to have one made by hand.')
