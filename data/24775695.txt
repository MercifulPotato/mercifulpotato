At a first glance, this \n   area of knowledge might seem very complicated and even impenetrable for a lot of people. \n   Thankfully, with Rust, the tide has started to turn: the Rust community has demonstrated that \n   sometimes the perceived complexity is rooted in the lack of support, tools, and educational \n   content.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI have a question for the Rust community, especially those doing low level development now.\nAs someone who does embedded and systems programming in C for about twenty years (technically i&#x27;m not 40 yet ;-)), were the cited problems (lack of documentation, support and tools) really problems that kept from doing low level work? If not, what was it then?<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious, because when I started it was more things like hardware bugs (yes they do exist) or the general theory of things (like writing a performant scheduler or file system) that seemed hard to me.')
