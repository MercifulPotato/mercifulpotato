The P11 was not, but I don&#x27;t think I have anything to report as everything is taxed at source for my current employer (I&#x27;ll double check of course).<p>The pension (Assuming you refer to the private pension scheme) is not filled in and I already know I have to pay some tax on that as I overshoot my allowance.<p>I normally get it done a couple of weeks before the 31 and doesn&#x27;t take more than a couple of days even with triple checking everything, so I should be quite in time.<p>And yes, TBH filling in the tax return has never been a big problem. It would b e nice to automate a few more things (like computing exchange rates for dividends&#x2F;capital gains instead of having to look them up) but it is fairly straightforward.')
