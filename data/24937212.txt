Fascism is by definition a right-wing form of authoritarianism, because of how it uses class divides to build its political power.<p>The corresponding left-wing authoritarianism would be &quot;leftist populism&quot;, &quot;Stalinism&quot;, or some other term.<p>What you&#x27;re describing is called Horseshoe Theory, and it&#x27;s not well-supported by evidence.  Right-wing and left-wing populism have a few things in common (authoritarianism primarily), but have much larger differences than similarities.<p>I will point out that attacks on a free press ARE a clear sign of authoritarian regimes.  I would encourage you to take a look at the history of the German word &quot;LÃ¼genpresse&quot; (literally &quot;lying press&quot;).  Especially take note   if you see similar things being said about the modern media -- and which groups are saying it.')
