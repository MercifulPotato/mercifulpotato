Key authentication is disabled. I use borg backup so I don&#x27;t even have to give shell access to this particular account (there are hardened borg configs available online).<p>If you&#x27;re more paranoid about security, you can enable 2FA over SSH, or make sure the backup server itself creates a periodic offline backup of the backup repository, without the SSH account having permissions to that of course.<p>Honestly though as long as you&#x27;re not doing something stupid like mounting NFS to your vulnerable device to make backups, you should be mostly fine.')
