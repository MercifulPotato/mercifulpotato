I went through checking the Lighthouse score on a few of my pages a while back, and the ones that had videos were performing pretty badly.<p>It turned out that embedded YouTube videos were pulling down something like 1mb of JS, <i>just to show the thumbnail</i>, before the user even clicked Play.<p>I ended up making a static thumbnail with a hover-over &quot;play&quot; icon that would replace itself with the real embed when it was clicked. Got the Lighthouse score up and saved all those unnecessary downloads. But it was pretty amazing to me that while one arm of Google is pushing for web performance, another is building this YouTube player that auto-downloads a megabyte of JS just to show a thumbnail.')
