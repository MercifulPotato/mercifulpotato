The problem we were solving was that apparel firms have really long lead times: they design their lines for a season 9-12mo before the customer buys it. That means they can&#x27;t iterate on their designs; DecisionCandy would let them do so in a lightweight way, by showing their sketches&#x2F;previews of pieces to their customers, and doing a &quot;which do you like more&quot; survey to score the items.<p>The problem here is that it takes 9-12mo to find out whether the app does any good, and YC is a 3mo program! We were only just about to sign a pilot deal at the time, so the timing wouldn&#x27;t have made sense.<p>And indeed, that long of a feedback loop is realistically too slow for a VC startup. We closed up and I &quot;pivoted&quot; to something totally different a few months later.')
