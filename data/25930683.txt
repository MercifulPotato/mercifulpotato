Item(by='danans', descendants=None, kids=[25936299], score=None, time=1611767261, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926927, text='&gt;  a 100% tax rate wouldn’t pay for the social programs you’re asking for, because the ultra-wealthy just don’t have that much wealth relative to current government revenue levels.<p>I don&#x27;t think there are any real proposals to raise taxes only on the ultra wealthy.  The super wealthy and the very wealthy would also pay higher taxes (let&#x27;s say the top .5% of the income&#x2F;wealth distributions), like they did for most of the post WWII era.<p>If one is considering raising taxes to create a more equitable society, the upper middle class (say the 99%ile) should also see taxes reset to a marginally higher level, but that appears to be politically less feasible at the moment.')
