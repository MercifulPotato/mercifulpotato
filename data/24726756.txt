I want to be able to send a query to it with about the same minimum latency as an L1 hit.<p>Basically, I want it to implement what are essentially custom CPU instructions.<p>Rather than implementing your full algorithm on a big FPGA over a PCIe link, you should be able to implement just the few custom specialized instructions that regular CPU is missing, while still utilizing the regular CPU resources.')
