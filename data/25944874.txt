Senior engineers should IMMEDIATELY outperform junior engineers. Knowledge of the system is largely unnecessary. What senior engineers bring to the table are completely different skills than junior engineers. You can have 100 junior engineers and they will still not be able to figure out the things a good senior engineer will do for you.<p>Probably you are not utilizing them correctly or giving them the right problems to solve.')
