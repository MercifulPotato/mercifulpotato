Sufficiently slow traffic (or none at all) will render streets walkable. Prioritizing pedestrian use over vehicle use is what creates walkability.<p>In the US you tend to find this in places that were built before cars but with sufficiently high property values that rearranging the buildings to widen the streets doesn&#x27;t make sense. See parts of Boston for example. The places that are both old and wealthy tend to have streets that are pretty much local access only through size alone.')
