There is some magic price where I&#x27;ll start learning how to make masks but I doubt we&#x27;re going to see that reached in my lifetime.<p>&gt; If you add an extra dollar to the price, that&#x27;s enough to get a lot of expansion of manufacturing.<p>In 18-24 months, sure. We&#x27;re 12 months in so far though. If they need the money now it is a different story. The higher the price, the more immediate and desperate actions become justified to increase supply. That is one of the core parts of market economics. Let the price rise to some silly amount and people will move heaven and earth to increase supply.<p>To get extraordinary things done an extraordinary amount of money will be needed. That can come from extraordinary prices. Or it can not happen and shortages can persist longer than required.')
