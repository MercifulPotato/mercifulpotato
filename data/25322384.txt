If she would get money from, one of us would walk between her and her bag.<p>I still do all those things, i don&#x27;t think its hard to do, my wife though had to learn through me that you carry your bag back with both strips and not casual with one as it makes it much easier to just grab it.<p>I believe, while you can always be the target, the reason why so much stuff is stolen on holiday is simply because a lot of peple don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care.<p>I walk through a crowd of people, and i spot tons of people around me i would probably steal of before i would even consider that one dude having everything close on him.')
