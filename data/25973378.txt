This submission is a bit meta, but it talks about things that are recurring topics on HN too. The thing that interested me most was the generalized form of the titular term, &quot;conceptual landmines&quot;. It gave a name and provided a description of a discussion dynamic that I could never quite put into focus in my mind myself.<p>I&#x27;ve long understood that if you want to get a point across, you need to express it as clearly as possible, and avoid flamebait or words that you fully expect someone will take issue with. But, as the article highlights, there are words and phrases that can be mundane, inoffensive, and a perfect match for what you want to say, and yet saying them will predictably derail the conversation into rehashing tired tangents, so you need to talk <i>around</i> such word to have a productive conversation (and, conversely, avoid fixating on them).<p>Hindsight is 20&#x2F;20, so now that I have a clearer understanding of this dynamic, I can immediately think of several such conceptual landmines regularly stepped on by HNers (myself included) :). I&#x27;ll do my best to avoid them in the future.')
