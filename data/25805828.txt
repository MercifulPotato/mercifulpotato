United States policy has typically been more restrictive of addiction treatment than to much more dangerous medical practice.<p>For example, on day one of residency, I was allowed to prescribe unlimited quantities of intravenous opioids to people with no additional training. Those were DEA schedule 2 substances--the classification that is deemed most dangerous but which may have appropriate medical use. This classification includes fentanyl, oxycodone, hydromorphone, methamphetamine, and even intranasal cocaine.<p>But to provide a life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder with a schedule 3 substance like buprenorphine (which by definition would be considered less dangerous than fentanyl or hydromorphone[1]), I had to have an additional 8 hours of training and other reporting requirements that wouldn&#x27;t be required to run an opioid pill mill.<p>Buprenorphine isn&#x27;t perfect, and it isn&#x27;t for everyone. But the molecule itself is generally safer than alternatives like methadone[2]. It&#x27;s made a huge difference to so many of my patients. (That&#x27;s just anecdote: mortality studies suggest it reduces overdose deaths by 70% and all-cause mortality by 55% [3]. That&#x27;s much larger than almost any other treatment for a chronic disorder in medicine).<p>---<p>[1] The scheduling system is a little silly. Schedule 1 substances have no approved clinical use, and so things that are highly unlikely to kill people like marijuana are rated as higher risk. But schedules 2-5 are in a very rough rank-order of risk when misused.<p>[2] The way methadone is regulated may make it&#x27;s mortality benefit better than buprenorphine despite it being a riskier substance. Initial dosing is in-person 6-days per week for at least three month, and then incentives allow people to bring home more doses with continue success in recovery.<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28446428&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28446428&#x2F;</a>')
