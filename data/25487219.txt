No, I don&#x27;t want to &quot;Meet Now&quot;.<p>Every SAC update tries to trick me into enabling OneDrive &quot;backup&quot; (sync is NOT a backup) and I missed it once so all my stuff got uploaded to OneDrive.<p>BitLocker with a PIN and Windows Update don&#x27;t seem to know each other exist.  Updates auto-restart the computer and then it sits at the BitLocker screen or, in my case, reboots continuously every few minutes spinning the fans up to max on every reboot.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more, but those are the ones that annoy me daily.')
