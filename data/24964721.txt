He did a shitload of things wrong. I mentioned one thing he did right. Everything else in your post is added by you, due to your own preconceptions. I&#x27;m not here to write a journal article about the industrialization of the Soviet Union. You&#x27;re imposing that responsibility on me yourself, and that&#x27;s just not realistic for a forum like HN.<p>there&#x27;s a vast difference between a journal article and mentioning some historical facts and allowing the reader to infer meaning. Of course I had to read into your post, that&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t make any connection between the things you mentioned. its also not realistic to mention a satellite in the same breath as genocide without any connecting framework and expect people to read it in a positive way.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s what I call intellectually lazy, and why this thread is a great example of exactly what I was talking about in the initial comment.<p>its lazy to wave your hand at some historical events and let the reader infer what you mean. its trolling to take exception to their interpretation when you haven&#x27;t provided an interpretation that you prefer and I&#x27;m sorry I took the bait.<p>&gt; great example of exactly what I was talking about in the initial comment.<p>that&#x27;s confirmation bias and not applicable since I didn&#x27;t downvote you but I replied as though it was a serious comment. troll 1, chordalkeyboard 0.')
