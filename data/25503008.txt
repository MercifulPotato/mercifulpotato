The bullet cluster is a pair of colliding galaxies. We can measure the distribution of gravitational lensing in a region of space, and in doing so, indirectly measure the mass distribution. We can directly measure the light output of colliding gas clouds in the two galaxies. We can measure the distribution of stars within them.<p>Analysis of this data shows us that dark matter has momentum.<p>This tells us that if you want to reformulate dark matter in terms of a modification of variations of F = Gm1m2 &#x2F; r^2 you&#x27;ll need to do some <i>really</i> ... interesting things. On the other hand, we know neutrinos have mass, do not interact via the strong nuclear force, and do not interact via the electromagnetic force. We either have to assume really, <i>really</i> ugly math in order to give a fundamental force a momentum, or we can assume there are new particles that are sorta like neutrinos but different.<p>There are other problems that I don&#x27;t fully understand. Apparently MOND is very, very difficult to reconcile with the rest of known theory if the speed of gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Which the 2017 neutron star merger taught us that they do.')
