I was using mobile.twitter.com leading up to this change; this is no longer possible. AFAICT what has changed is that they are requiring an &quot;approved&quot; user-agent string.  Someone here on HN tried Googlebot and it worked.  I just tested it and it is still working.  There are other strings that work.  You definitely do not need javascript to read Twitter.')
