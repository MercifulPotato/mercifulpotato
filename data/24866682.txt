Adding middleman changes nothing, because whatever that middleman could do, so can Uber itself. The argument Uber makes is that the drivers the existing arrangement is beneficial to all involved parties, and if they are required to hire drivers as employees, they won’t be able to offer as many rides as they do today with current prices, so both users will lose out on rides they are no longer able to buy, but also the drivers who now provide these rides won’t be able to. Regardless of whether this argument is any good, it is clear that adding middlemen won’t help here.')
