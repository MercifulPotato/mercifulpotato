A little bit of venturing in various other things, trying random hobbies &#x2F; jobs &#x2F; etc. seeing what I like and what I don’t like. Going out, sometimes to random places and just talking with people about their life stories and passions. I would be lying if I didn’t admit I’d spend time playing games or other unproductive tasks as well.')
