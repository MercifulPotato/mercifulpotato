That they just used commodity parts to create the iPhone.  That the margins will be driven too small to maintain and they’ll never live up to their valuation.<p>Tesla has atleast a 3 year advantage, a very strong hold on battery production, extreme brand loyalty, and an iteration cycle that puts all other car companies to shame. They’ve caught an entire industry with their pants down.')
