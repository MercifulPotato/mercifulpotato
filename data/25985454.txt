In the case of communication&#x2F;messaging software, it should be possible to make alternative clients and servers that are compatible with each other to prevent completion of user domesticationâ€™s first two steps.<p>You are absolutely correct about network effects; a network effect only leads to vendor lock-in when it&#x27;s combined with a closed platform. Vendor lock-in then leaves users vulnerable to possible domestication.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about implementation diversity lately, and will likely write a follow-up addressing the possibility of an open platform becoming closed. Implementation diversity is one means to keeping open platforms from closing up.<p>Original inspiration for this idea came from another comment I responded to a few mins ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25985365" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25985365</a>')
