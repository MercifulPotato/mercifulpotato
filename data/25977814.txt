And yet (with the help and blessing of the US, then much interested in keeping Italy on the side of the West) it experienced twenty years of rapid economic growth. It had a good education system, and it had manufacturing capacity (FIAT, Olivetti, Montedison, Ansaldo, Zanussi...) and especially, it had tens of millions who wanted to buy their first car, their first washing machine, their first tv, their first telephone, or wanted to rebuild their houses with modern techniques. It needed workers for the factories and sourced them from the poorest parts of the country, triggering an internal migration and further growth in the economic capitals of the country. China seems to have been in the same phase for the past 30 years, and it&#x27;s so big it can keep up at the same pace for other 20 or 30.')
