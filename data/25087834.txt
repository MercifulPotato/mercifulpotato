We push way to much on the degree&#x2F;school thing in HR, long before we get to interview them. For most positions, I would rather have an enthusiastic learner with a BS, or even an associates, and have them learn how it is done from experienced staff. If they really like it, and want to pursue more college, fine. If they want to dive in and learn by doing, fine.<p>I am in my retirement position now, stepped back to staff engineer, because I don&#x27;t want to spend any more time stuck in meetings. The best principles, the best directors, all came up through the ranks. Yes, some of them returned to college for a few years before coming back, but the best ones just came in as enthusiastic green horns and dove straight it.<p>I have worked long enough now (36 years in this field, and this is my third &#x27;career&#x27;) to have seen people I mentored grow into director level positions, and that is perhaps the most rewarding thing there is.')
