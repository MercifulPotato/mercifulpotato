Of course most <i>users</i> hate to read PDF&#x27;s online, because they have to zoom and scroll around and so on. So the real question if you want the pain on the producer side or push it to the consumer side.<p>Producing layout which render reasonably well on completely different devices and screen dimensions is inherently non-trivial.')
