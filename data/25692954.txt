Why can&#x27;t I use apps regarding pornography, or about drug abuse. Why is the internet more and more neutered into a place for polite children?<p>I&#x27;ll tell you when I started to hate this trend. A few weeks ago I saw a rich company owner on Linkedin trashing the regulator, with conspiracy theories and personal insults. There were no downvotes (because Linkedin does not allow downer reactions) and all comments were neutral or supportive. It was clearly wrong and no one dared say the wrong thing on Linkedin, because everyone has jobs and are afraid to speak against the president of a very important company. For the first time it really felt like I was on a new internet, sure I could write some words, I could create a profile and follow different people, but I knew I couldn&#x27;t be myself, I couldn&#x27;t express any negative (read: against the currently approved trends) comments, I couldn&#x27;t read the wrong things. I was just mindlessly consuming, consuming the silly and harmless memes, consuming the neutured and feel good news, made to feel what I was supposed to be feeling about the world events. It&#x27;s all a big party in all social media as long as you dot inside the lines. Nothing was explicitly stopping me, but there was always the cloud that if I say the wrong thing I&#x27;ll get deplatformed, or worse, someone might badmouth me on Twitter and I lose my job. And there is no real alternative, we are social animals and desire some interaction and discussion.<p>I remember when I was a kid I was on the internet reading about philosophy and how to make bombs side by side. Do you know Al-Qaeda published a monthly magazine in English for years? Do you even imagine being able to read it now? Are you not even curious? How did this world became so scared of reading different points of view, when were we convinced that people can&#x27;t handle their curiosity and at the same time maintain democracies work because they are ruled by the people.')
