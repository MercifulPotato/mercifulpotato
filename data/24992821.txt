A smart UI could keep this branch checked out internally.<p>You know what, I&#x27;m going to flesh this out. If anybody has something insightful, please comment here. I&#x27;ll write the first rough UI in Python CLI app, but the real value I&#x27;m looking to create is in the file formats so that other UIs can be created.<p>I&#x27;ll do issues first, then PRs, but all input is welcome.<p>My gmail username is the same as my HN username if anybody would prefer to contact me in email.')
