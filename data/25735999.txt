Item(by='apple_innocent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610396543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727401, text='&quot;The owner of Times Square relies upon the big advertising signs for their income.&quot;<p>Times Square is just the first public place that I thought of.  Not every public place is used for advertising.  What if it was the National Mall in Washington, D.C.  The point is that, generally, necessary permits notwithstanding, people can enter always public places and communicate with the public.  That is why they are deemed public places not private ones.<p>I am not even sure what advertising has to do with this.  Maybe I missed something in the story. I was under the impression it was a YouTube &quot;channel&quot; getting banned not some customer&#x27;s ability to purchase ads from Google to be shown on YouTube.')
