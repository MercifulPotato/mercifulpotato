It can be restored by using diagnostic tools to change the car&#x27;s region.  Specifically, it&#x27;s &quot;early&quot; vs &quot;late&quot; departure intervention.<p>I have personally had experience with Hyundai&#x27;s systems.  Even cheap Elantras have a camera-based system with amazingly good lane centering and some form of auto braking, but they decided to make radar cruise only available for top trims.  I got an older 2015 Genesis Sedan with radar cruise (natural but imperfect, and no detection of cars cutting in front of you) and lane keep assist (not quite centering except for every fifth curve where it&#x27;s too aggressive).  The blind spot warning is good but a bit too sensitive.  Auto braking is radar based so it warns you appropriately but can&#x27;t detect pedestrians.  The car&#x27;s driving assistance feels like a beta, which makes sense given its age.  The NVH of the Genesis is stellar and the rest of the tech works well.<p>I also tried Honda&#x27;s radar cruise in a Clarity and it worked well.  When I test drove a TLX, the lane keep assist in the first generation TLX wasn&#x27;t quite centering.  Its braking alert worked fine and I appreciate that since it didn&#x27;t have the HUD, they put a small LED to project &quot;BRAKE&quot; on the windshield instead.')
