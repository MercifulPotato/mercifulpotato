Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610569180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25756980, text='I joined a company (my first full-time salaried job) a few days before their IPO. I got stock options (like, 500. I was 18. heh.) but they were awarded&#x2F;priced&#x2F;etc post-IPO and were never actually in the money after vesting, as I recall. So I remember some of the IPO excitement but I&#x27;m not sure it really qualifies as &quot;going through an IPO&quot; for the purposes of the &quot;full thrill ride package&quot;.<p>Incidentally, that company was also taken private during the dot-com crash, and I <i>did</i> make money from that, because the ESPP I was buying for &lt;$1 got converted to cash at something like 3.5x the valuation. It wasn&#x27;t much, but, again, I was young, so it seemed like a lot.')
