Either the patient has some prejudice they can&#x27;t get past, or the therapist is actually entirely clueless as to the patient&#x27;s lived existence. The only way around this would seem to be having more non-white and LGBT therapists.<p>But even with this problem, does it not still make sense to <i>reduce</i> the number of identity facets? The more variables there are, the harder it becomes to find a match, <i>especially</i> for those having a hard time as it is.')
