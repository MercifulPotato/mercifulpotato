From a purely business point of view, I think this would have been a huge win for both companies.<p>Despite the success of the Prius, Toyota made a decision to focus exclusively on fuel cell technology and wasted ten precious years. After Toyota lost that bet, Tesla&#x27;s superior EV technology could have helped Toyota catch up with the competition. Tesla had no experience with the formidable supply chain and production issues involved in building high-quality cars on a large scale. This is one of Toyota&#x27;s great strengths.<p>Unfortunately, there seemed to be bad blood between Toyota and Tesla management. I suspect this may have prevented consideration of such a partnership.')
