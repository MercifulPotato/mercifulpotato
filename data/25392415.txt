I&#x27;m talking about (some) restaurants arranging people with only 1-2 feet of separation between diners. Plus people standing in single file are going to circulate air differently to people sitting abreast of each other, as well as wearing rather than doffing masks. Also, sit down meals tend to last at least 20-30 minutes, and I have not spent that much time in line on the sidewalk for anything during COVID - perhaps once back in March when social distancing was first being figured out, but definitely not since.')
