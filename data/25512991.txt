I prefer Coke over Pepsi and don&#x27;t buy soda unless I&#x27;m at a fast food place yet I recognize at least a dozen brands. I don&#x27;t shop at Walmart when I don&#x27;t need (&lt; once a year) to and never been to a Sam&#x27;s club. I don&#x27;t own Cyberpunk or even a Windows machine. I haven&#x27;t been to a McDonald&#x27;s in the last 5 years except when presented with no alternative (~3 times?). I&#x27;ve never played CandyCrush yet you can&#x27;t open a Windows machine or a phone app without being bombarded with it (Angry Birds used to be like that too). You can&#x27;t open Reddit without political memes (many are actually ads). Every single one of these companies&#x2F;products has also advertised to me and I&#x27;m willing to bet you as well.<p>Either you&#x27;re able to afford a lavish lifestyle or I&#x27;d like to know how I could live in this blissful world that you found (and escape the advertised filled one I live in).')
