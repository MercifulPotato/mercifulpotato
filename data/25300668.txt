However, if the resource is provided with some delay, then site A assumes that site B hasn&#x27;t been visited.<p>The current solution is to download the same thing twice. It is wasteful and I offer downloading it only once, but if site A asks for a resource for site B, the resource should not be returned immediately, but after a few ms so that site A gets the wrong conclusion.<p>It should work if site A can observe only the result of the request but can&#x27;t check if a request happened or not.')
