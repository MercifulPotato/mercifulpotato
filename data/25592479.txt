They just rely on what other arm64 players did in the ecosystem before Apples rolled out M1; respectively lets developers figure out the remaining porting.<p>As much as I hate to say this, IBM does handle porting things to ppc64 right - you can find IBM contributed code and optimizations anywhere you look. For many packages, porting to arm64 was a matter of &quot;does it have ppc64 support? if so, it can be reused for arm64&quot; ...<p>Disclaimer - used to be a contractor porting stuff to arm64 for a couple of years.')
