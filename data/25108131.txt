The reason they don&#x27;t get hired is because it is always a gamble doing that. They either steal or avoid work whenever possible. Most criminal gangs are by gypsies and most stealing, prostitution or begging in Europe is done by gypsies that left our country or from Bulgaria. Sadly, the entire Europe thinks of Romanians as thief&#x27;s or beggars due to these people. Don&#x27;t believe me? Here&#x27;s a list with some videos them at (work):<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6a03ln9aSSk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6a03ln9aSSk</a>\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0bqZYCVOgZI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0bqZYCVOgZI</a>\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;jgv2DPUItTY?t=660" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;jgv2DPUItTY?t=660</a>\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GivpxPKzGm4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GivpxPKzGm4</a>\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;?v=1229612137060364" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;?v=1229612137060364</a>\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bji47dgDLe4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bji47dgDLe4</a>\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rhfuaGQhGr8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rhfuaGQhGr8</a>\n- ...hundreds more but you get the point<p>I know you can find videos about thief&#x27;s on almost any nation out there but, you have to live in one of these countries to be able to talk on the subject. Here&#x27;s a diva getting booed on the stage for trying to suggest we&#x27;re discriminating: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PymLiIBgQ9g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PymLiIBgQ9g</a><p>We are not racist towards them. Most of the educated and working gypsies have no problems in our country and I would never have issues hiring one - I&#x27;ve hired many designers or programmers but I never had one gypsy come for an interview.<p>I have some very good friends among them but, the vast majority, it is being raised without education or with the general idea that money should be made by whatever means necessary and the &quot;BEST&quot; examples in their communities are always the worst by any other standards other than their own.<p>As a conclusion, stop trying to point fingers at us for not doing what we can to integrate them because they DON&#x27;T want to be integrated. Period! They just don&#x27;t.<p>Our countries do not have to climb. We can&#x27;t drag them. When they left for France a few years ago you all captured them and sent them back with buses. Each Gypsy received 100 euro for going back to Romania - that&#x27;s how you climb?')
