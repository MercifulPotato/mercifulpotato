We know that the imaged samples 100% came from an asteroid, and a particular asteroid, whose characteristics we know from observation and other measurements. That&#x27;s in contrast to terrestrial samples, for which we have to make educated guesses as to the properties of the bodies they came from. The former will be useful to cross-check and callibrate the latter.')
