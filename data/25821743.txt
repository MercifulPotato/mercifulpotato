They are not acting rationally.  If you watched them have a conversation with thin air you would call them crazy and generally untrustworthy.  But the person who&#x27;s mind creates the narrative afterwards does not hallucinate, they act rationally at the time and only later use the story to cope with <i>post</i>-traumatic stress.  Note that these perceived people are generally helpful, as opposed to hallucinated people who are generally not.<p>People remember their guardian angel helping them climb out of a collapsed building.  You don&#x27;t see such people ignore firefighters to continue their conversation with the angel.  <i>That</i> would be crazy.')
