Now, there are people are inciting violence on &lt;radio&gt; in the US, and it&#x27;s still an open question whether &lt;radio&gt; should be held liable.<p>There are important differences, but the parallels between the Rwandan genocide and the growth of talk radio in the US in the 90&#x27;s have always struck me as interesting.<p>That being said, I think that the new public square argument is strong, and if we&#x27;re going to have internet monopolies, then they probably need to be regulated similarly to the utilities.<p>Alternatively, they can be broken up. I don&#x27;t think the current state is sustainable over the longer term.')
