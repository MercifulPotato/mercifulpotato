And, given that my roommate was doing the KL-10 microcode, I had some idea how you could trade microcode space for actual hardware execution units.  So, yes, my original idea was to use the LSI-11 (Western Digital) base chips with different &#x2F; more microcode.  Yes, it would have been slow.  But it would have been a pdp-10.  Years later, Gordon Bell told me that somebody had built a pdp-10 on a board.  I think it may have been an internal project (not the KS10), a hack like the &#x27;pdp-8 in a suitcase&#x27; that I saw in Maynard. I need to ask him.<p>I, too, have difficulty understanding the killing of the pdp-10 line; what often goes unnoticed is the very high level of capability in Marlboro (vs e.g. Maynard).  When I started as a co-op student, I wanted to work in Maynard with the pdp-11 folks, which I thought was the cat&#x27;s meow.  But wiser folks told me, &quot;Hey, you should consider yourself special, as they are putting you in the pdp-10 group!&quot;  And of course they were right.  So when DEC canceled the &#x27;20, they also -- effectively -- broke up the best &#x2F; brightest concentration of computer geeks in the whole company.  It&#x27;s difficult to appreciate the pride the pdp-10 group took in their machines - after all, they were <i>the</i> machines for AI research and were the first machines on the ARPAnet.  And, as anybody alive today knows, 32 bits isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> enough, but 36?  nee 72?  Ahhh...  ;-)<p>Ken was a very bright engineer.  He used his engineering skills to &#x27;engineer&#x27; DEC, I think.  I asked him if he thought DEC was competing with IBM, he said &quot;No, we serve different markets.&quot;  I wish I remembered more about that conversation that day.  DEC was only 18 years old at the time.')
