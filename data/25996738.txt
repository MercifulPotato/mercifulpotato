For example, I could borrow crypto to provide margin for my HFT market making strategies.<p>A very popular use is to do rate&#x2F;basis arb. So I borrow a crypto at say 10% interest and then use that to sell a future or swap that has a rate higher than 10%. So borrow at 10%, short a future with a annualized percent basis of 20%, and capture a risk free spread of 10%.<p>Very sophisticated and institutional players are doing a <i>lot</i> of these kind of basis arb plays nowadays. It&#x27;s pretty much free money. You need to be able to borrow though, as without leverage these rate arb strats don&#x27;t yield compelling enough returns.<p>If you&#x27;re a crypto trading firm and not making at least 100% annualized, you&#x27;re fucking up. It&#x27;s not usual for sophisticated players to be making a 1-2% return a <i>day</i> in crypto.<p>The wealth generation from crypto trading in the last two years is truly astonishing.<p>Also want to note is that most of these obscenely high return strategies are delta neutral: they are unaffected by the price of crypto going up or down. There are some funds out there who&#x27;s returns are derived from crypto exposure, but those are the shitty ones.')
