Here everyone uses SMS by default. Failing that, everyone uses FB Messenger. Discord is used for gaming. That&#x27;s about all the breadth you&#x27;ll get outside of work. I guess I know three people who use Hangouts sometimes. Marco Polo and Snapchat are moderately popular things, though a bit different. Still, I have never met a single person who has used Whatsapp, Signal, Matrix, or Telegram. I doubt more than a handful have ever heard of any of them.')
