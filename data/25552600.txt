You live in the city, but somehow don&#x27;t have power? Is it because of infrastructure reasons (eg. down power line), or administrative reasons (eg. failure to pay bill)? Also, smartphones have &quot;talk times&quot; of tens of hours[1]. I find it difficult to believe that you&#x27;re being put on hold for that long.
