The classic example is a mango - you can read about them, you can study their chemistry, you can ask questions of mango eaters, but until you taste a mango you can&#x27;t know what a mango tastes like.<p>For most of my single life I thought of diamond engagement rings as something I&#x27;d like to get away without, or at worst begrudgingly buy. I understood the economics and history of diamonds and reached a logical conclusion.<p>And then 2 year ago, I bought a high grade diamond to propose to my wife and I loved it. From the process of visiting diamond dealers, to seeing it sparkle, to seeing her reaction - it&#x27;s some of the best money I ever spent. I love seeing it on her hand now as she plays with our baby. I&#x27;ll probably get joy out of seeing it for the rest of our lives. That comes out to cents per day over the next 40+ years. Worth it.<p>To be clear, it was never &quot;the ring or the downpayment&quot; kind of choice. I&#x27;ve seen people be dumb here. Don&#x27;t do it. My point is that there&#x27;s something to these rings beyond the analysis, much like tasting a mango.<p>The ring also indicates that I am serious. Yes that&#x27;s &quot;signaling&quot; but with so many marriages failing because people are half-assed &#x2F; don&#x27;t have their shit together, it&#x27;s a valuable signal.<p>So let&#x27;s say DeBeers nailed product-market fit.<p>As for how special love&#x2F;marriage is: we are partners in an enterprise of life, we chose to face the future and make people together. We both made the choice and understood its weight - and chose each other. What could be more meaningful?')
