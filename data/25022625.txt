He closed the border with China when everyone was accusing him of xenophobia, he did it just in time to flatten the curve. He helped millions of people with  stimulus package, saved countless businesses and jobs via fed corporate bonds, I can go on and on. These are not opinions but facts.<p>You see it’s not about what or whom you believe but what you and them actually do.<p>The left accuse the president of being racist without any basis, by misinterpreting or intentionally misrepresenting his sayings. Building their whole campaign around massive &#x27;racism&#x27; conspiracy. Many people vote Trump just because they are tired of this bullshit.<p>That whole BLM summer of protests? Gone, no longer in fashion. Dems don’t really care about black lives, they cynically exploit race politics to grab power. It worked marvels for them in these elections.')
