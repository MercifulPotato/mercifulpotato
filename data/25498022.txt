It&#x27;s impressive how quickly those profit maximization ideas have caught on, driven by technology (I blame Excel more than anything), and throughout the entire system. The healthcare cash-cow benefits a LOT of people, workers, suppliers, and (especially) administrators at both hospitals and doctors offices. A poor healthcare system is a great way to create BS jobs, and have a <i>de facto</i> welfare system while not actually legislating for it.<p>It is remarkable how quickly and completely the noble ideals of the professions (medicine and law) have totally fallen to the profit motive. Now, you are a <i>fool</i> if you show self-restraint, because no one will notice, and your unscrupulous competitors will eat your lunch. It&#x27;s the kind of pervasive corruption that can only happen when literally everyone in the system, including the victims, have given up.')
