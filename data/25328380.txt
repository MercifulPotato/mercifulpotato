This would give NVidia unprecedented insight into the\ncompetition&#x27;s processors long before they hit the market. Will\nSamsung or Apple be happy about that? Will AMD be happy about that?\nGiven the tension between the US and China, it&#x27;s almost inconceivable\nthat the Chinese Arm customers will be happy about this. China is the world&#x27;s biggest processor market, with a government mandate to reduce dependency on foreign technology!<p>Hello RISC-V!')
