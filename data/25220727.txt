A race to see how far you can get on a single tank of gas.<p>Clarkson thought the challenge was dumb and picked a big comfy car with a massive engine. He might not win but at least heâ€™s gonna enjoy himself.<p>Ended up winning. The massively overpowered engine was chilling at highway speeds so much it barely used any gas.<p>Another fun comparison was when they took a Prius and a M5. When the M5 was chilling at a slightly fun speed, the Prius was struggling so hard that it had double the fuel consumption of the M5.<p>Cruising speed matters.')
