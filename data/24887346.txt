You will likely find that among the selected players height is not very correlated with performance, or even inversely correlated because your initial selection wiped the correlation out and potentially noise or other effects (like agility) which are correlated with being short begin to dominate the differences within that population.<p>This also holds for correlated traits-- e.g. if you select very tall players it may wipe out or reverse the correlation shoe-size has with performance.<p>As a result if you first select people for an intelligence requiring task specific capability and also select for IQ you&#x27;re likely selecting for noise, and potentially selecting for people who are just really good at taking tests and which weren&#x27;t actually as good at the task specific capability as a randomly selected person in your first selection would be.')
