We don’t know why.<p>the more developed the society is  the less valuable are  the testosterone benefits like the ability for heavy physical work in harsh conditions, etc. and the less tolerance the society has for the testosterone driven behavior - thus natural selection drives testosterone down. For example when you have a car accident, display of rage would put you in a losing position in US where you just need to exchange insurance info, and your higher muscle mass and hand-to-hand combat skills decide nothing, whereis for example in Russia the rage is a synergetic addition to the metal tire tool in you hand displayed as a credible threat.

We find a positive relationship between the fWHR of the governor and the level of repression in his region. &quot;')
