I changed monitors - bigger and putting it farther and also i became very careful about choosing monitor and choose ones with highest contrast and good white, made sure that the background beyond the monitor is something closer to real landscape (best thing i had at one job -  the north looking large window) and if it is just a monotone featureless wall i would  put something on it with well defined features so that it  would be easy to focus without strain when my eyes not looking into the monitor, made sure that i frequently take the eyes off the monitor and look beyond it, orient my table so that the horrendous office lights wouldn&#x27;t hit me directly in the eyes, at some other places i added the table lights so that monitor contrast be better (they had that especially bad bluish office lights), started to work standing, so that i&#x27;d move more and thus eyes would wonder a bit more instead of just being fixed on the monitor  - again all these were in different situations, different offices, etc. I.e. the point here is that i had to pay attention and take corrective measures as the offices around are mostly very bad for eyes. Took several years to stop having that headache (i&#x27;m pushing 50 now)')
