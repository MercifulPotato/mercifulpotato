Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611594434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905214, text='&gt; For a community (HN) so focused on technology and the future, I&#x27;m surprised to see support for antiquated technology such as paper ballots.<p>I&#x27;m not. No one understands as well as technologists how often “novel technology” represents a regression from the tried and true, and how much the cry of “new” is used to sell defective crap.<p>&gt; You can even buy a house from your phone now.<p>This is technically partially true in that a lot (not all) home purchase and finance paperwork can be done via electronically signed documents, and if you have a tolerance for extremely bad UI you can sign those on a phone. Typically, you’ll still need some wet signatures (notarized even) at the end of the process.<p>But that’s, even if it was completely accurate, a different problem domain than voting. (Both have concerns for assurance, but only one also has nonattribution as a critical goal.)')
