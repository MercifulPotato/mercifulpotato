Be very careful to understand it and work to understand on how to make your data backward&#x2F;forward compatible with systems reading that event stream.  Not knowing WHO&#x2F;WHAT is consuming events and what data&#x2F;schema they require basically pours cement over the entire design locking you into a frozen design or forcing you to constantly break things.<p>I assume&#x2F;wonder (haven&#x27;t worked in such a company) if this is why some larger companies end up with mono-repos because they have no other way to manage backwards data&#x2F;schema compatibility on ESB systems.')
