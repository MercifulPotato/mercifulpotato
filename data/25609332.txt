Combine all of that and you had the defacto setup for &quot;production music&quot;: a computer-based sequencer, a DX7 and some other MIDI synths and drum machines, a rack of effects units, a mixing board and a multitrack tape system. That&#x27;s how it happened that music in TV commercials, soundtracks, etc. abruptly went from session recordings to synth-only during the 80&#x27;s - you could bring it in under budget by leaving it all to a one-man band.<p>The DX7 just happened to be positioned to capitalize best on this trend, as well as being useful live gear, but the quick move towards sampled instruments afterwards indicates how interchangable the sounds themselves were.')
