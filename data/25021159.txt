I think what makes it is mostly:<p>* high bandwidth.<p>* over a high dynamic range.<p>* with a high sensitivity over directionality and pitch changes.<p>Our ears are exceptional things, and as social animals they are far more important to decoding extremely subtle cues in our surrounding voices and the voice of those talking to us than we probably are aware of.<p>The thing with audio is, that in the end you still have to move air. And you have to do so without having your vibrating thing breaking after a week. Mechanical reliability is hard while still maintaining these specs. Audio electronics is sensitive to inaccurate power layouts, trace layouts etc.')
