Commerce and industry embraced JIT sourcing and long supply chains while either being ignorant of, or worse, willfully ignoring the fact it falls apart if every link in the chain before you doesn&#x27;t execute reliably.<p>They may not have pictured a global pandemic when they did the numbers, but anyone with any length of hands on experience would have said &quot;we&#x27;ve had some (industry-specific) situation which caused a 3-month supply kink before, and it nearly broke us...&quot;<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d love to hear from businesses&#x2F;economic planners in places where inconsistent supply chains are the norm.
