Most new message boards don&#x27;t put any effort at all into moderation. It&#x27;s just a problem for later. But that usually means that you don&#x27;t even try until after the board has already become hostile. Hostility is met by more hostility and it becomes hard to stop the feedback loop.<p>By that point it has usually grown past the ability of human moderators, especially if all you have is volunteers. So even a so-so first pass AI to help them out might shortcut the process before that feedback loop begins.<p>Developers tend not to want to become community designers; it&#x27;s not their area of expertise. But we&#x27;ve been at this too long to start every message board at zero, just putting data in and out, without any thought to community standards and mores. It&#x27;s time to do something from the start rather than trying to cram it in after the fact. That doesn&#x27;t work with security and it doesn&#x27;t work with community building.')
