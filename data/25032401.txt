I&#x27;m not talking about one legislator, I&#x27;m talking about an entire nation.  At the end of the day, the one leverage you and I have over our policy-maker overlords, is the vote.<p>&gt; It won&#x27;t force bad faith actors to cooperate [..] as the GP said, won&#x27;t hold their politicians to account.<p>The only way you can hold this belief, is to also believe that voting behaviour doesn&#x27;t change over time, and that you don&#x27;t have a part to play in that.  What else could motivate you to speak with such passion if it were only futile?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s just wishful thinking and I&#x27;m hoping enough people are done with the feel good woowoo.<p>You miss every shot you don&#x27;t take.  A platitude, maybe, but also a falsifiable proposition, which is clearly true.<p>For instance, there&#x27;s nothing magical about taking your vote to any of the independents with much better policies.  Sure, their pitch for the white house is impossible, but they might make headway into the senate, and each % point that goes to an independent provides a signal to the established Red&#x2F;Blue teams that maybe they should adopt some of those policies.<p>Nothing magical about organising with like-minded people, creating and crowd-funding a lobby group.  Or even taking part of one that suits your interests.')
