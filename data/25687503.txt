I don&#x27;t know the nitty-gritty specifics of the protocol, but the essence is this:<p>You don&#x27;t want someone getting access to your account two years from now to be able to access every old message. Consider every message a separate object that gets encrypted. The keys are changed&#x2F;updated each time a new device is added to an account. That new device only knows the new key(s), and thus can only decrypt new messages.')
