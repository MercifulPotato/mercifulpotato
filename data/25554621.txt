Every project you give up on you keep trying again on something new.<p>I always suggest having three things to focus on, three projects, that could be for fun, hobby, family, or side project related. Something that allows you to take your mind off one thing, and focus on another.<p>Hell, you could create a project that has three very different components that all come together eventually.<p>If you still can&#x27;t keep the persistence, than that&#x27;s fine. You have a stamina gauge for any activity, you need to do what any marathon runner would do â€” keep at it. In any project you will eventually run out of steam and your interest will wane,you have to give up on some projects and just go a little bit harder in the next project. Build up your fortitude and try to make every new project last a little bit longer than your last project.<p>1 to 2 to 3 to 6 to 12 to 24 days, weeks, months. Eventually you&#x27;ll build up your resilience and your confidence to accomplish great things.<p>If you&#x27;re a gamer, this is your experience tree.

They make their money empowering others, not accomplishing real tangible things.')
