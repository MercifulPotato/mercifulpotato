I&#x27;m imagining a world where mathematics becomes too advanced for even the brightest human being, but progress is preserved by proof-generating programs running in data centers. The data centers churn out exabytes of mathematical proofs, and humanity employs an army of what are effectively philologists&#x2F;semioticians to dissect, mine, and excavate these proofs for meaning.')
