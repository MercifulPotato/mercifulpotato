It&#x27;s an investment vehicle focused on generating a particular kind of return by investing in a particular kind of company.<p>VCs don&#x27;t invest in businesses as much as they invest in return-generating vehicles. If you can find a way to turn a grilled cheese business into a billion-dollar return-generating vehicle, then the VC will invest in it. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s an actually sustainable business or even really a business at all. Heck, you could be giving away grilled cheese and putting advertisements on the bread and if it fits the VC model then VCs will invest in it[1].<p>This is why &quot;businesses&quot; like WeWork are so divorced from business reality. Because they don&#x27;t need to follow the typical path of traditional businesses, which are dependent on cash flow and customers and mostly industry or region-specific competition. Banks can loan to traditional businesses they understand. VCs invest in the businesses that don&#x27;t fit those molds. This is why venture investing exists - to chase those non-traditional businesses that have the promise &#x2F; potential to generate huge returns. The specifics of the business really don&#x27;t matter.<p>It follows then that if you&#x27;re building a VC investment-return generating vehicle then what you&#x27;re doing is not the same as building a &quot;normal&quot; business. You&#x27;re in an ecosystem dominated by the needs for big returns. Board members don&#x27;t know about or care about traditional business needs. They only care about the dynamics of investment return vehicles.  This reality is not the same as the traditional business reality.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crunchbase.com&#x2F;organization&#x2F;melt-shop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crunchbase.com&#x2F;organization&#x2F;melt-shop</a>')
