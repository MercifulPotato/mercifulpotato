Would love to see search within, filter, and resort result sets. Would love pro option to allow REGEX patterns as query tokens. Depending on results getting tabular data back would be awesome (think ranked queries such as top exports for &lt;country&gt; where results would have a table of item and quantity, etc.). The latter is akin to Google’s knowledge graph boxes with structured facts. Finally transparency mechanism and a “don’t be evil” commitment to not censor results like Google clearly does. Stay neutral. Give excellent results.')
