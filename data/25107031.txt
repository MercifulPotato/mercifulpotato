If the Koch Bros. spend about $200M a year on activism, they&#x27;re actually substantially outspending Greenpeace. Which, well, is to be expected: Greenpeace is a non-profit that&#x27;s very often taking positions opposing major corporations.<p>(Greenpeace is actually a collection of quasi-independent groups around the world, but since the Koch&#x27;s activism is primarily focused in the US, it makes sense to compare them to Greenpeace USA.)')
