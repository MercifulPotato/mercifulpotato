That should give you a hint that I might know way more than the armchair experts.<p>Any article that talks about Myanmar and doesn’t include the word “China” all over it, is probably propaganda of some sort. I won’t go more into this and I will allow people to do their homework and make up their own minds about the good and the bad of all of it, but Myanmar is perhaps the first country the modern-West has totally lost from the grasp of its sphere of influence.<p>Sanctions won’t work. They will just punish businesses that were stupid enough to work with Americans and Europeans. At the end of the day, Myanmar is going to come out of this period looking more like China than like the British colony it was before — guess what that’s meant to prepare us for, in terms of the way the world looks by the end of this century?<p>The military couldn’t have done any of this without China’s permission. This is a giant fuck-you to the West, and it’ll work, because the West has zero leverage. Also, every Western ambassador and diplomat ran away like a scared child at the beginning of coronavirus, so they’re not even in the country to state their case. Guess who IS around?<p>PS: If you work for Facebook please tell your deranged CEO to leave the mini State Department he’s set up in Menlo Park to sit down and stay out of this one. They’ve done nothing but cause Myanmar to endure more violence and instability than was ever necessary, and made a GREAT case for the country to embrace China’s Great Firewall.')
