It’s even one of the primary reasons the prices have been able to go up so much for a degree (economic value).<p>The PhD programs, research, and tenure track academia in general is an entirely different beast with some pretty fundamental flaws. Very few companies require PhDs so the job opportunities for a PhD student who wants a position that requires one are scarce.<p>I got my PhD from a top 10 CS research university and it was shocking how much competition the graduates had to get a tenure track position at some third rate university when they graduated. Publications in top journals and even a solid post doc just got you the opportunity to fight 8 other equally qualified candidates for a single slot.<p>The professors do not emphasize enough that tenure track research faculty is nothing more than a fantasy for 90% of the graduates, and that’s ignoring the 50% of PhD students who dropped out before finishing.')
