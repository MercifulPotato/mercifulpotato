Xarm makes good arms for interfacing with Opentrons, so then it comes to everything else necessary to get to full automation.<p>1. Automated plate hotels\nI need plate hotels to storage samples that interfaces with my robot arm and robot systems. This I&#x27;m basically using Theo Sanderson&#x27;s designs for this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thingiverse.com&#x2F;thing:2668120" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thingiverse.com&#x2F;thing:2668120</a> since buying them commercially is so darn expensive. I really need this for my system, so I am building em.<p>2. Plate sealer &#x2F; unsealers\nMy entire full automation pipeline is built around NOT needing a plate sealer or un sealer (something you can&#x27;t do with the vast majority of screening systems). Automated versions of just the sealer itself cost more than 2 liquid handling robots and a robotic arm combined (and all it does is seal plates!) I think there is an opportunity for building simple but effective automated plate sealers and unsealers.<p>3. A train system \nI think Concentric (Ginkgo&#x27;s COVID company) uses something similar, but basically a system that can use small trains to bring plates and reagents around a lab to different robotic stations. I&#x27;ll probably just do that with lines of robotic arms, but I definitely spent quite a bit of time thinking of how to do this. (in my factorio megabase I really learned how to route trains, and I think it&#x27;s exactly the same problem I face with my robotic work stations). I&#x27;m not sure how to scale the selling of that though.')
