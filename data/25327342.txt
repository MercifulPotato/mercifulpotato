I&#x27;ve even seen Docker employees recommend in forums using v2 independently of v3 if you need certain features (I can try and dig up a link from my archive if you&#x27;re interested).<p>Compose file version 2 is not deprecated, unlike version 1. It remains stable and supported (though no new features are added), it&#x27;s very well documented and still widely used because of the additional features it supports over v3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;compose&#x2F;compose-file&#x2F;compose-versioning&#x2F;#version-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;compose&#x2F;compose-file&#x2F;compose-version...</a> (compare with the v1 deprecation notice above it)<p>I don&#x27;t know about &quot;sucked in practice&quot;, we use it because we love it. They released a new version to push users toward swarm, which we don&#x27;t need. Such is life sometimes. It&#x27;s had some bugs and problems in the past and if something better comes along we&#x27;ll use it, but for the time being Docker compose satisfies all our needs and I think it&#x27;s a beautifully designed UX and reliable piece of software in its current form.')
