If it&#x27;s not getting hot enough, use something else to get it hot enough (blowtorch, maybe).<p>For smoothing out the surface, you could just use a flapwheel. You can get them for angle grinders. This will also take off seasoning if necessary (but it&#x27;s a bit worse for the pan if you&#x27;re not also trying to smooth it out). Be sure to wear a respirator and googles if you&#x27;re doing this.')
