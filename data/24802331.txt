There, admittedly, I don’t have any performance issues—but that’s because I have a <i>ridiculous</i> amount of overhead for something like Slack!<p>I sometimes use lower-end machines to test stuff, like a 2011 Macbook Air with 4GB of memory. There, I have all manner of problems—the fans spin up, and the whole Slack interface becomes extremely slow to respond. Simple things like changing channels and loading threads take seconds at a time.<p>These computers <i>are</i> inherently slower by modern standards, but there’s simply no reason Slack should require so many system resources!')
