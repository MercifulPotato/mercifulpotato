As somebody else here said, daily productivity is hugely important -- it&#x27;s not all about the virtues of the language and&#x2F;or the runtime.<p>Ever since I started using a language server on my Emacs (plus `rust-analyzer`) my flow has improved because I can almost immediately see compiler errors or warnings but `cargo run` and `cargo build` are still slower than they should be. Seems like no matter how strong your machine is, those final steps can never go below 6-7s. (I have a fairly modern Xeon workstation)<p>Those 7s of delay sound funny for many and I&#x27;ve been made fun of for mentioning it but I&#x27;ll stand behind my statement: when you&#x27;re in the productive speedy flow state, you need instant feedback. If you don&#x27;t have it, you lose your motivation to iterate rapidly.<p>Even though I believe Rust to be the future of low-level and mega-fast computing, it still has nothing on the Go and OCaml compilers&#x2F;linkers, sadly. Even Elixir -- a dynamic but compiled language -- feels near-instant when you use LSP.')
