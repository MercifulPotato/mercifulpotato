So I started searching, read the Readme on Sia&#x27;s project on Gitlab, and then came upon this website [1] which harshly demonizes both Sia and Skynet due to maintainers banning a critic, and allegedly being generally toxic.<p>This is very much not a good look at all for the whole thing, and I suggest the developers should both solve this problem amicably ASAP, and also add very clear &#x27;WHAT THIS IS AND HOW IT WORKS&#x27; links on every page related to the project, with many real world examples of how&#x2F;why use this and with nearly no use of specific jargon that&#x27;s not introduced clearly during explanations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siasetup.info&#x2F;guides&#x2F;using-skynet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siasetup.info&#x2F;guides&#x2F;using-skynet</a>')
