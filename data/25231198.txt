Much of the same observations can be made about the Empire of Japan. I&#x27;m sure Imperial Japanese soldiers earnestly believed their subjugation of China and other mainland powers was just, but that doesn&#x27;t alter it&#x27;s depravity.<p>There&#x27;s value to be had in honestly recognizing that if I was born in Japan or Germany during the 1920s I&#x27;d probably have turned out just like the people I&#x27;m criticizing.
