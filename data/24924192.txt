You almost certainly won&#x27;t miss generics.<p>(Edit:  I&#x27;ve broken my own rule and given advice without first asking what kind of programming you do.  My assertion holds for most run-of-the-mill stuff, e.g. writing REST interfaces, network servers, etc.  If you&#x27;re within 2-sigma of the industry, you won&#x27;t miss generics.)')
