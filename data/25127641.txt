There are no cascading layers of abstraction that map onto the user&#x27;s comfort level with git.<p>Git also doesn&#x27;t prescribe workflows. Overtime, people have come up with standard workflows, but there are too many of them and they all have different mental models. The issue is that most of these workflows are only marginally better&#x2F;worse than each other and don&#x27;t necessarily provide additional functionality in any sense. It would be much better if there was only one way of doing things in git. It would make things marginally inconvenient for many, but the marginal loss of productivity would be more than made up by a consistent mental model and the increased reliability of the &#x27;canon&#x27; workflow.<p>Last, and certainly my biggest complaint is the terrible UX and the semantics they convey. It is almost as though the creators went out of their way to have naming schemes at odds with natural language.<p>I hope someone builds a keras-like tool for git. Interoperable with the tensorflow (v1) that is the git underneath, but exposes a much easier and in most cases feature complete set of abstractions that work for 99% of its users.')
