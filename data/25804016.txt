What I said was that people typically aren&#x27;t hired in at the associate level.  Those that are would typically be professors who have tenure at another institution, meaning that they&#x27;re <i>already at</i> the associate level or higher.  People who are denied tenure at their current institution and want to continue in academia would apply to an assistant professor job and negotiate a shortened tenure clock, meaning that they would be assessed for tenure in fewer than the standard 6 years that a brand new, never held a professorship of any type assistant professor would have.<p>Again, this is a lot of esoterica about the academic job market that not many people outside of those circles is going to know, so I don&#x27;t blame anyone for not knowing it.')
