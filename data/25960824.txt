Reuters did some investigative journalism and found out his identity through <i>public sources</i>. He&#x27;s not a confidential informant, he wasn&#x27;t trying to keep his identity a secret, and he was voluntarily interviewed by WSJ anyway.<p>And even if he <i>was</i> doxxed, it&#x27;s up to the courts to decide of free speech outweighs the right to privacy.
