Basically it says, assume you know everything needed to do the work or teach someone else about it, then go do the work or try to teach someone (by writing a blog post for example), and continue until you face a blocker where you actually don&#x27;t know how to progress or don&#x27;t know enough to teach that part, then go read just enough to get unblocked, rinse and repeat until you know it all.<p>What I like about this is that it maximises the search space to spend your learning effort on what really matters. Otherwise it&#x27;s easy to say... spend too much time on early chapters and not enough on later ones for example.')
