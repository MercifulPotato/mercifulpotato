When demand was greatly exceeding supply, you naturally saw the definition and requirements of data science roles loosening. When I contact companies about DS roles, I like to ask what they mean by &quot;data science&quot;. Often times you would find roles that were some mix of: SQL analyst (no DB admin skills required), Python hacker (no &quot;real&quot; software eng skills required), and basic stats (can you calculate a confidence interval?).<p>What I&#x27;ve seen in more recent years with growing supply and maturation of departments is the need for specialization. Can you do hardcore statistics? Are you an ML practitioner? Are you a data architect? Basically, the blended role DS hacker is more commonly (and correctly IMO) relegated to a various analytical and strategy roles.<p>Honestly you haven&#x27;t missed the boat and you don&#x27;t need a formal education, but I would highly recommend having a depth of skills in one or more areas of data science generally with an example or two to back it up. Basic skills are just table stakes at this point.')
