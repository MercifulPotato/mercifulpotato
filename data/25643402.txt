Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25643795, 25645551], score=None, time=1609835274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642834, text='&gt; + Super readability<p>I disagree; it uses a fraction of the available screen size (optimized for mobile?), the font is small, and worse, it&#x27;s grey-on-white; the contrast is too low.<p>I also did a bamboozle; turns out the profile on the linked page here is not actually the demo, but just an image &#x2F; screenshot on a landing page. Didn&#x27;t really clock that it was a landing page; maybe link directly to the example and update the landing page to not start with a product screenshot, but with the marketing blurb instead (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a designer, but I&#x27;ve seen other product landing pages that use large screenshots to highlight segments of the product along with short descriptions of the feature)')
