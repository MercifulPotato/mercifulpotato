Many jobs, high-paying and low-paying, wouldn&#x27;t exist. Of course, the business model for content distribution is somewhat nonsensical and the time until content gets in the public domain should be 10 years, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that IP law shouldn&#x27;t exist. Not to mention that the 29 billion number is probably also BS.')
