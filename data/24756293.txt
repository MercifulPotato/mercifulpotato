Facebook is a private platform and when you sign-up and use them you abide by their rules.<p>Some people are better at compartmentalizing than others. They can hold <i>freedom of speech</i> as it applies to the government in one thought-bucket, while holding corporate-enforced limits on their ability to say whatever they want in another.<p>But others can&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) compartmentalize. To them, the whole <i>freedom from the government</i> versus <i>freedom from private corporations</i> distinction seems arbitrary and distracting, especially in the US, where many government roles have been subsumed by private corporations.<p>I&#x27;m not saying your point is invalid, just trying to gain some perspective on the issue. Personally, I&#x27;m a compartmentalizer so I see your point.')
