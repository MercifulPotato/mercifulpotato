This interpretation of the data seems lacking. The same study should be done in places with minimal lockdowns with their covid patients: Sweeden and South Dakota.<p>What if it&#x27;s just mental illness is just up due to the lockdowns, and recovering from COVID is just a false correlation?<p>My mental health is deteriorating. I hate all of humanity. I can&#x27;t stand most of my friends. I can&#x27;t even stand reading most of the comments in this thread, which feel like they&#x27;re going on with this insane hysteria that&#x27;s sweeping our planet.<p>Yes COVID is bad and has killed many elderly (95% over 55), but the majority of us have been put in lockdowns that are likely very ineffective. We&#x27;re being told to cover our faces, our primary means of communicating with each other via facial expressions. Anyone trying to say the masks are not very effective (they&#x27;re not) are being silenced on all platforms.<p>This is insane and it&#x27;s hysteria. History will not look back kindly at this time.<p>We are not in this together. We&#x27;re in this alone. Humanity is looking through the world through the eye of a straw.')
