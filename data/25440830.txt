Users not only report bugs<p>This works only for popular open source software, and still doesn&#x27;t apply to infamous Unix mail servers or likes of GNOME. The &#x27;community&#x27; is often more interested in adding features than fixing bugs.<p>&gt;  so never use a service where in principle a program would do.<p>Comfort vs Freedom tradeoff. Sometimes data privacy &#x2F; freedom isn&#x27;t just that critical to justify costs and difficulties of self hosting.<p>&gt; Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS). For our freedom&#x27;s sake, we have to reject that too.<p>For what it is worth, SaaS has only benefited freedom of people working in big corporates. It has loosened the grip of enterprise software directly sold to C-suites by wine-and-dine sales methods.<p>And know what, software writers have to make good amount of money too. Just giving away free desktop &#x2F; server software doesn&#x27;t work out for most developers. I will happily accept if an open core software has a value added SaaS. And &quot;live cheap and write freedom respecting software for some semi-arbitrary definition of freedom&quot;, is just disrespectful to talented software developers.<p>&gt; someone has the power to silently impose changes in how the user&#x27;s computing gets done.<p>Again a convinience and security etc.. thing. Most use cases, you don&#x27;t care.<p>Stallman sees everything as black or white. (Linus Torvalds has also written on this)<p>I&#x27;d suggest Stallman once watch 2017 Tamil movie &quot;Vikram Vedha&quot; :-)')
