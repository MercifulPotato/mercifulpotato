Rent here is around half of comparable cities in my area. Issues that economists have with rent control in theory basically don&#x27;t exist because the rent control system minimizes them.<p>I think it&#x27;s absurd to say that rent control doesn&#x27;t work. Badly implemented rent control is just a useful mitigation. Correctly implemented rent control, with a healthy dose of public housing and private supply increase, actually is a solution - but the rent control and public housing part is a lot more important than the private supply increase and is also the part that YIMBYs such as the author never get implemented in practice.')
