What&#x27;s true however is that if your HW is not supported by at least Windows 8.1 you&#x27;re SoL.<p>&gt;  Better as in programs open faster, the file manager opens faster, the task manager opens faster. Everything uses less memory and less CPU cycles. Everything is snappier.<p>I haven&#x27;t observed any slow downs in Windows 10 for ages. As for &quot;less memory and CPU cycles&quot; it&#x27;s just outright false. Windows offers much better hardware acceleration for everything: display rendering, video encoding and decoding, RDP (VNC in X11&#x2F;Wayland taxes the CPU quite a lot and forget about effectively streaming video via VNC), etc. Linux is quite horrible in this regard.<p>&gt; Linux users don&#x27;t have to worry nearly as much about malware, trojans, viruses, exploits. It&#x27;s more secure.<p>Unless you&#x27;re obsessed with downloading software illegally, it&#x27;s not an issue in Windows either. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I had to deal with malware for my +20 of friends using it.<p>&gt; Linux distros generally don&#x27;t annoy users with stealthy automatic forced updates.<p>Windows updates are very much in your face.<p>&gt; Linux distros have a better app store experience than Windows, plus most of whatever there is free without much if any risk.<p>Except there&#x27;s 100 times more software in Windows.<p>&gt; Linux doesn&#x27;t have any phone home telemetry type &quot;features&quot; built into the OS.<p>No one has ever proven Microsoft accesses or downloads any of your files, or uses telemetry data to find out what applications you&#x27;re running.<p>&gt; Linux user experience is much more customizable. There are a much greater variety of tools at your disposal to customize how you want your desktop to look and operate.<p>This one is true however with a lot of choice comes a lot of confusion and doubt.<p>&gt; Linux is free.<p>Windows 10 OEM license can be bought for as little as $10. This is 100% irrelevant nowadays.')
