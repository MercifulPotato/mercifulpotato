Only oddity for me was one situation where a group of 3 of us had the person in the &#x27;middle&#x27; hearing both, but the two on the outside could only hear or see the middle person. We tried expanding the &#x27;circle range&#x27; thingy but then could hear the conversation happening across the room. I wish there was some way to make that whole process slightly more fluid.')
