You&#x27;re not supposed to use ketones to test accurate levels.  It&#x27;s to give you an idea of what&#x27;s going on.  There&#x27;s no way your strips are going to show purple if your body isn&#x27;t producing ketones for energy transport.  The exact level doesn&#x27;t even matter that much because what shows up in the urine is <i>excess</i>.  Sure, acetoacetate is not the only ketone, but it doesn&#x27;t just get created within the body for no reason.  If you are fasted and you eat a bunch of ice cream, your ketone strip test will plummet to showing no signs of ketones at all.  If you are fasted and you eat a fatty steak, at best you might see a slight decrease because of protein intake.  This is consistent and easy to reproduce.  I&#x27;ve repeated this test <i>dozens of times</i>.  Carb and sugar heavy food plummets urine ketone levels and keto macros don&#x27;t.  Your body isn&#x27;t going to produce an appreciable level of ketones when it&#x27;s got simple carbs ready to go, which is because the body is going to prefer glucose every time it&#x27;s given a choice.<p>And yes, you <i>do</i> bounce in and out of ketosis when you fast long enough, and it really doesn&#x27;t take that long.  Once you&#x27;ve expended your glycogen and you&#x27;ve digested all your food, your body doesn&#x27;t have a choice but to dig in to fat stores.  Depending on how much glycogen you have stored, what you&#x27;ve eaten, and how long it&#x27;s been since you&#x27;ve eaten, getting into ketosis becomes ridiculously easy because the energy your body uses <i>has to come from somewhere</i>.  You don&#x27;t need to measure ketones to have confidence in this.  It&#x27;s well studied.  If someone thinks that ketosis is hard to enter, I doubt they&#x27;ve gone more than a day without food.  Once you get used to fasting for longer than 48 hours, it becomes obvious when your body is out of glycogen.')
