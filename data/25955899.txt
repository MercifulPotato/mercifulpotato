Definitely not always the right thing to do, but could eek out some performance in where you get the same data multiple times.<p>Edit: I found that it is called memoization: Looks to me to very easily be extensible to allow timestamps too, to check if the record is older than X.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;833180&#x2F;handy-f-snippets&#x2F;851449#851449" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;833180&#x2F;handy-f-snippets&#x2F;...</a>')
