It&#x27;s still valuable to do, certainly, but it can be challenging.<p>In this scenario, the approach I&#x27;ve adopted is that I&#x27;ll spend time to fix the problem &#x27;locally&#x27; (in a fork if necessary), offer the patch upstream (to feed back improvements, which aim to be generic -- but also with selfish motivations to reduce maintenance burden), and then move on.<p>Anecdotally, that&#x27;s working fairly well so far - approximately an 80% merge rate over ~100 pull requests.  I don&#x27;t have great stats on how much time was spent on each, nor how complex each one was.  A few definitely took some detailed puzzle-solving and investigation.')
