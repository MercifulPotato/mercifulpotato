I&#x27;ve seen some very competent Polish tech leads, but no one higher than that really. It may be because the local value of a developer or tech lead salary is so high in Poland (esp. if you contract for rich Western&#x2F;US companies) that people don&#x27;t really have the motivation to move up the ladder - they&#x27;re living like kings already and build wealth that will stay in their families for generations.')
