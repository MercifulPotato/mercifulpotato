I don&#x27;t think I agree with the grandparent comment that some of those things should be easy, but I do think that comment contains good examples of the level of sophistication that would make an AI assistant more than just a curiosity for the couple times each day you prefer not to hit the button yourself (or if you listen to the radio while you shower).')
