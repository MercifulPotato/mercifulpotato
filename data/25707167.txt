He ignored Khashoggi&#x27;s killing to keep a good relationship with MBS, he said he &quot;fell in love&quot; with Kim Jong-un to try to get him to stop testing nuclear missiles, and he shut up about Taiwan and Hong Kong and Xinjiang because he wanted a better trade deal. (Shutting up about them might have been an unofficial part of the dealmaking -- threats behind closed doors.)<p>Some of it was clearly amateurish. Trump is a shallow man, and assumes others are as susceptible to flattery as he is. He didn&#x27;t get far with Putin or Kim, but he actually didn&#x27;t give away much -- US policy towards them is tougher now than it was four years ago. And the stuff with Saudi Arabia has worked out very well, though it does make my stomach turn a bit.<p>Now, though, the Trump administration is in the &quot;nothing to lose by doing what we want, and nothing to gain by doing things we&#x27;d rather not&quot;. So they can piss off Xi, and do something nice for Taiwan.')
