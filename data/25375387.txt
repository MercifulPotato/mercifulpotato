After 14 years of software development, I am done. I&#x27;ve switched companies 4 times in the last year alone looking for something that will keep my interest alive. It&#x27;s my first week at the newest one and I&#x27;m already uninterested. I even started helping out an acquaintance with a side business project that is really cool, but after a couple of weeks of that I&#x27;m no longer interested in it either.<p>It&#x27;s not depression leading to this; it&#x27;s the reverse. This problem is leading to depression! I get enjoyment from other things in my life (e.g. being outdoors, doing yard-work, building things). Just not programming&#x2F;tech. It&#x27;s been like this for several years now. I can go on vacation and soon as I get back, same issue... zero desire to work with technology.<p>With 4 mouths to feed and one kid approaching college age, switching to another field while retaining the same salary&#x2F;benefits seems impossible.')
