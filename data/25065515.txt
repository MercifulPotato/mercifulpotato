It’s essentially an expansion of WebSockets to include multiple streams and optional UDP-like delivery, while still being encapsulated in HTTP&#x2F;3 and suitable to be called by JS. Server sent events similarly only works if you have JS on the client receiving it, the browser doesn’t know how to render the events inherently.')
