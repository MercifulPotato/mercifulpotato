Item(by='danaris', descendants=None, kids=[25847562], score=None, time=1611155910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846770, text='I think that at least one thing that&#x27;s going on here that while OSS <i>does</i>, all else being equal, create more value for the world, when the world contains monopolistic megacorporations like Amazon, they will be able to disproportionately benefit from any such value.<p>As I noted in a comment elsewhere on this article, if the corporate landscape now looked more like it did 30 years ago, a good open source project with a permissive license would be likely to enable a wide variety of competitive small-to-medium companies to do cool things. Today, by contrast, even if there are small-to-medium companies who try to pick it up and do a cool thing with it, they&#x27;re not trying to compete with other companies in the same weight class: they have to compete with Amazon, a 900-pound gorilla who just muscles out or outright <i>eats</i> its competition.<p>So I don&#x27;t think a fair takeaway here is, &quot;It feels like permissive open source should be better, but because massive conglomerates like Amazon can make disproportionate use of that to hurt everyone else, restrictive licenses are better on principle.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s much closer to, &quot;It feels like permissive open source should be better, but because massive conglomerates like Amazon can make disproportionate use of that to hurt everyone else, <i>we should find ways to break the disproportionate power of massive conglomerates</i>.&quot;')
