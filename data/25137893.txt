There&#x27;s things where Nvidia has clearly provided emulation for certain features - I for instance play Watch Dogs Legion on my 1080Ti with Ray tracing enabled and it runs absolutely fine(because the ray tracing is being emulated in CUDA and the 1080Ti is enough of a beast to do it quickly enough), or there are things like DLSS which don&#x27;t have emulation - and there is no known official or unofficial way to run them on non-RTX cards. So it&#x27;s not just an artificial limitation made up by Nvidia.')
