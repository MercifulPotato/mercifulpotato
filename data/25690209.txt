People also die from loneliness, isolation, lack of exercise, depression, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, malnutrition.<p>Do you even fucking realize how much our response to COVID has impacted food programs worldwide? How shutting down major economies has pushed our children back by _years_ of educational attainment?<p>People die from everything, for fucks sake. People die from TB, which inoculations against are way down this year. People die from lack of clean water, which financial assistance from developed nations has tanked this year.This is not even counting the delay in cancer treatment, heart treatment. Hospitals in my state were essentially shut down all Spring and Summer when we had incredibly low community spread. So the woman who is six months late for her mammogram, is her cancer less important than COVID?<p>When you say people die and it is a big deal, are you only concerned for well-off white people in developed nations? Because I do say you&#x27;ve turned a blind eye to all the death and famine around the world to suddenly be on your high horse when it comes to COVID.<p>Edit: I am sorry but I need to come back to this. Do you have any idea what these lockdowns are doing to mental health of teens and adults? Suicidal ideation is on the rise as is self-reported depression. So are you saying that those who kill themselves from despair and depression aren&#x27;t as entitled to support to help _them_. We closed down a nation to support those at risk from COVID. What will we do to support those who are dying from other means, due to our response?')
