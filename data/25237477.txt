Item(by='OJFord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606571357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235715, text='London has plenty of pedestrian crossings, but they&#x27;re unmarked, at least not in the same way - a stop line for cars before the lights, sure - except for &#x27;zebra crossings&#x27;, which look different, have different rules (no traffic lights and cars must give way to pedestrians) and would never be called a &#x27;crosswalk&#x27;.<p>I suppose they just don&#x27;t need to be, because <i>not</i> using one isn&#x27;t &#x27;jaywalking&#x27;.  If there&#x27;s too much traffic you identify a safe crossing by zebra stripes (or flashing beacon) or traffic lights or island.<p>When reCaptcha first asked me to identify the &#x27;crosswalks&#x27;, sure, I guessed it must be the road markings. But I just (still, to this day) select all the road markings that aren&#x27;t obviously just centre direction seperating lines. I might get loads wrong, no idea.')
