All your traffic is going through Bubble&#x27;s servers where it is TLS-intercepted and accessible as plaintext. Compared to a browser extension like uBlock, you don&#x27;t see what is happening on Bubble&#x27;s servers. You essentially need to trust a startup with <i>all</i> your internet traffic.<p>The claim that it&#x27;s &quot;open source&quot; a bit disingenious after looking through your GitHub repositories. It&#x27;s not like you could test Bubble locally and then decide to use your hosted service.<p>I think the overall use case is solid, but would be much better served with a browser extension. Also, very likely mitmproxy won&#x27;t really scale that well to lots of users.')
