I mean, imagine what a double blind study to, say, &#x27;prove&#x27; that smoking causes lung cancer would entail. The ethics of causing something we have reason to suspect is harmful to a population sample is ethically extremely problematic; hence, all we frequently have is correlative.<p>Even when it&#x27;s something there isn&#x27;t as big an ethical issue for it&#x27;s usually not single blinded, let alone double. Diet, for instance; the groups know what they&#x27;re eating. Did the differences happen because of the different diet, or because of something else (such as increased energy leading to more exercise, or the perception that they were eating &#x27;healthy&#x27; lead to them actually becoming so, or picking up other healthy habits? Etc).<p>As I said, establishing causation -with any degree of rigor-, is basically impossible. Otherwise we&#x27;re just left with &quot;hey, a whole buncha correlative studies indicate this, so, maybe take it as true?&quot;')
