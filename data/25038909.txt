Standard retirement advice is that one should save enough money to live in retirement at a similar lifestyle that they lived while working. If the idea of these pensions is that your salary is lower, but you need to set aside less for retirement, what is the issue?<p>As far as the $2 million figure, if you go to any retirement calculator and try to figure out how much you need to save to have a similar lifestyle in retirement as to working, you will indeed find they advise you to save $2-4m. In the private sector, you&#x27;re expected to do this on your own, but you get a higher salary to compensate. Looking at my own career, a comparable government job seems to pay about $40k less than a private sector job.<p>If your argument comes down to the public pensions being too generous relative to private ones, shouldn&#x27;t we instead make private pensions more generous? Why do we want old people who work their whole lives to have a massive step down in lifestyle when they retire? Is that what you want for yourself or your parents?')
