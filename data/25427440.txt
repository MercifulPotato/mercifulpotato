Learned to not do it in coach ever again for anything more than a day&#x27;s worth of traveling. The seats are comfortable (much better than VIA Rail, which I took from Vancouver-Toronto earlier), but the random people getting on a random times, including in the middle of the night, is what got to me (VIA didn&#x27;t have this so much). Had a very sketchy homeless guy with clearly some mental affliction in front of me talking to himself for about 1.5 days, and two others quietly murmuring on their phones for 5h+, late into midnight or later. I&#x27;d also pack my own food because the restaurant car required appointments and the snack kiosk had nothing good or healthy. Both were severely overpriced.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate you can&#x27;t seem to make too many stops along the way. The company will allow for one, I believe, but as you try to add more the tickets get more expensive. The timing of arrival and the small-town location of many of them just make the option not very interesting for general tourism. I did have a few hours in Chicago which was pretty cool, though I didn&#x27;t see much and was very put off by the &quot;if you&#x27;re being shot at then throw your duffel bag at the attacker&quot; videos at the main station. But it was also the middle of winter and like 7-9am or so, so that definitely coloured my experience. Great diner experience though. No one does breakfast quite like North Americans.<p>Talking with a nice man from California in the restaurant car when I did go the one time I learned he paid as much as me for one of the private room options, just he&#x27;d booked a few weeks in advance. I believe he also had access to a shower, which would have been a game changer for me. I booked the way I did though primarily to test out the &quot;worst&quot; option and compare it to better options as I&#x27;d make more trips. This was what I learned so far. I&#x27;d like to do more though, because this seems like a great way to travel the country.')
