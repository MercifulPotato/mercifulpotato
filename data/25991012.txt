I really don’t get the fetishization of sticking ads next to unrelated content. Like I get the whole brand mindshare aspect but that’s not exactly a small-business type of ad campaign.<p>Like Jesus. If a company had good ad targeting I would actually pay to access it and use it as my product search. It’s remarkably difficult given the type of product you want to buy to survey the market and find different people that sell it. I’m currently going through that hell trying to find a water filter dispenser&#x2F;pitcher. All of the search results are garbage. I know there is more out there than just the 17 models of cheap plastic crap from Brita&#x2F;Pur but it’s an absolute slog to actually find anything.')
