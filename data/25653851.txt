They deal on a daily basis with issues from being hacked to being kidnapped.<p>Anyone can use our free, open source iOS&#x2F;Android apps. Web version in testing here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;umbrella.secfirst.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;umbrella.secfirst.org</a> Learn more about our work helping some of the most courageous people on the world at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secfirst.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secfirst.org</a>.<p>We have found some awesome people here on HN before over the years (Hey Rok!) and now it would be great to find some people who are interested in helping give us a bit of a boast - from funders to founders. Especially techies who can volunteer time and possibly someone interested in coming onboard and helping us build out an open source business model around some of our tools (specially our CMS, Tent) to allow other organisations to help manage and train their own staff security more effectively. We&#x27;ve already had a lot of interest in that area, so it would be great to have people help us explore that opportunity to diversify.<p>Ping me rory AT secfirst.org or roryireland on Twitter.')
