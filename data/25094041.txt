Make frequent backups, and if it comes down to it, you can always point DNS at a new provider.<p>Second, don&#x27;t put anything on a VPS that you aren&#x27;t willing to let the VPS provider or whatever Gov. has jurisdiction access. Where email falls on that spectrum for you is of course your own decision.')
