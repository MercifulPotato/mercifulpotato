Item(by='nwienert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610771967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25800053, text='Yea, it&#x27;s definitely a workaround for not having algebraic effects, you can basically think of it as a yield.<p>Of course ideally the language would have it first class, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they are immensely useful. Having composable stateful logic that always handles side-effects is incredibly useful, and it works really well within the immutable data &#x2F; top down data flow model of React.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear the alternatives, as I spent years researching and working on many (Redux and FRP&#x2F;reactions) and they&#x27;re simply not as nice.')
