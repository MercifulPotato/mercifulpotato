Is that fully released such that I can buy it right now? Apple site says 17th Nov. Can&#x27;t know if it breaks things until it is released.<p>I also said &#x27;architecture change&#x27; so by your count that would be 2. But Rosetta was only for PowerPC to x86 wasn&#x27;t it? There seems to have been emulation for the 68x chips but was it seamless without breaking anything?<p>I mean any company could change architecture but rely on a customer using an emulator that isn&#x27;t really not breaking things.<p>So by my count, 1, but if I am wrong and the 68x translation was equally as seamless and breakless than 2.<p>But to say it was unheard of you need to reference all the other companies that transitioned architecture and broke stuff. I can&#x27;t think of another general computing supplier who did that but I might be wrong - can you give an example?')
