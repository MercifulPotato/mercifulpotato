We haven&#x27;t run into any dramatic issues at this scale.<p>Our architecture is arcanist&#x2F;phab over git --&gt; stash (git) --&gt; custom build server that&#x27;s basically identical to gitlab --&gt; artifactory.<p>we use pants, but we made that choice before bazel was a thing.<p>Bazel is probably the most &quot;scalable&quot; solution, but it isn&#x27;t always the most intuitive&#x2F;developer-friendly. It&#x27;s worth exploring the alternatives (biggest ones imo are pants, buck) to see what you like the most. They&#x27;re all pretty similar, but Bazel has some hard-to-replicate bells and whistles that mean it&#x27;ll probably be the eventual winner.')
