But this line is pretty misleading:<p>&gt; the one we created when we kidnapped millions of people in Africa and stripped them of their original culture<p>Nobody was kidnapped. Individuals were bought from already-existing African slave trade markets(markets which had been run by and for Africans (and Arabs), preceding any European commercial relationship.)<p>Although you may have used the term kidnapping liberally (&amp; with some artistic license), it is fundamentally not true &amp; very misleading.<p>In Africa, buying and selling slaves was widespread at the time.<p>I think the treatment of African slaves(&amp; their descendants) in America is bad enough without having to exaggerate the origin.')
