Is it a pattern of criminal behaviour, or is it police bias&#x2F;somebody systematically accusing this person for whatever reason? Aggregating multiple not guilty verdicts and&#x2F;or cases that weren&#x27;t perused into something that results in criminal sanctions is dubious, and in some sense may invert the burden of proof (you now have to show the allegations against you are _false_ to challenge them, rather than just showing guilt hasn&#x27;t been proven).')
