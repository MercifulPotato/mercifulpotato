They are different things with different implications.<p>I prefer to call the former &quot;human rights&quot; and the latter &quot;societal rights&quot;. My problem with the EU and others is that they call everything &quot;human rights&quot; with no regard for the distinction, in what I believe to be an attempt to stall out discussion about the latter: &quot;How can you be against this thing? It&#x27;s a <i>human right</i>, you monster.&quot; Except they <i>are</i> different. The latter kind of &quot;rights&quot; are given to you by your society and require the labor of others <i>on your behalf</i> in order to work. This makes them not so simple.<p>To my mind, every society everywhere should enshrine the former, and the latter kind need to be decided on a society-by-society basis, and also might change with time.')
