The KORG multi-engine SDK uses a subset of C++; perhaps it uses an embedded CPU or DSP implemented in custom or semi-custom silicon rather than on an FPGA. Or maybe the synth&#x27;s microcontroller has enough horsepower (and a real-time monitor with some sort of isolation) to run audio code.<p>Certainly it&#x27;s easier to write C&#x2F;C++ rather than Verilog or VHDL.  ;-)<p>I still think digital audio is a killer app for FPGAs though.')
