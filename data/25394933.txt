Rewrite the Mozilla mission statement. I read that and have no idea what your organization does. Mission statements seem like corporate naval gazing, but if it is honest and well written it keeps everyone focused on what you are working towards.<p>2. Refocus on Firefox R&amp;D and core technologies - Firefox needs to be the best browser. It is the thing that makes the company money and makes it recognizable to the lay person. You will never be able to outspend Google, Microsoft, and Apple, but they are always going to have more competing priorities pulling their best engineers away and causing political infighting about what should be crammed into the browser. Mozilla does not have to have any of that.<p>3. Invest more in Thunderbird the application and develop Thunderbird the privacy focus email service for independent professionals and small businesses.<p>This comes across a bit negative, but it is because I love Firefox and have loved many other Mozilla products in the past. I very much would like to see Mozilla succeed and create more products that I can love.')
