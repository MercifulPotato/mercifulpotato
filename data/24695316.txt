Especially since I did actually take some funding (from Earnest Capital), I launched around the same time as them, and I&#x27;m still nowhere close to $1M ARR.<p>The Canny founders are absolutely phenomenal startup founders, with a world-class background in product design and engineering background. They executed extremely well, chose an excellent target market, built an incredible product, and marketed it extremely well by sharing their story and progress.<p>This is like comparing yourself to a star basketball player in the NBA. (Especially considering that the founders came from careers at Facebook.) Meanwhile, most of us are just regular software engineers who are trying to make things work as a solo founder. I don&#x27;t have a strong background in design and UX, and I&#x27;ve made a lot of mistakes. I&#x27;m still proud of my achievements and I think I&#x27;m building a great company at a sustainable pace, but it can still be a bit depressing when you see people executing perfectly and growing at an incredible rate.<p>&quot;Marathons&quot; are an over-used metaphor, but it&#x27;s a good metaphor. You&#x27;re almost certainly not going to finish first, even if you&#x27;re a world-class athlete. But even if you finish last, I think that&#x27;s still something to be proud of. (Where &quot;finish&quot; could mean achieving profitability, or having an exit.)')
