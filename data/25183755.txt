And Iâ€™ve built dark mode css off of it as an inspiration.<p>Edit: the &quot;Dynamic&quot; (GPU) mode doesn&#x27;t work on all sites. On HN I&#x27;ll use Filter+ with the settings -20 brightness, contrast off, sepia +30, grayscale off.<p>While on Github I&#x27;ll do -5, 0, +30, 0. Mainly just tweaking the brightness while having Sepia on most sites.')
