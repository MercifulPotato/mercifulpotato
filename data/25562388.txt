It does a very good job of framing issues faced by children (anger, jealousy, fear, etc.) in a realistic ways and teaching them coping mechanisms.<p>I&#x27;m sure the parent poster is familiar with it, but figured I&#x27;d throw out a good word for any current or future HN parents of young children who might be on the lookout for something better than the average drivel the passes for children&#x27;s TV.')
