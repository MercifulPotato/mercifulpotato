That visit to the Prime Minister is more of a &#x27;royal visit&#x27; than peers comparing notes. Remember they insinuate that WWII is entirely a Wizard dispute that got out of hand -50 millions dead.<p>Then there&#x27;s the secret police visits to erase people. Heck, Harry&#x27;s best friend wants to be one when he grows up! Just like dear ol Dad! Who comes home with &#x27;Muggle Artifacts&#x27; that they somehow don&#x27;t need any more - presumably because they had to be put down. I half expected a collection of gold teeth or whatever.<p>All that made &#x27;disliking Muggles&#x27; into a red flag in my reading was, that a segment of Wizard society wanted the cattle to be managed without spooking them - gently and quietly. So they wouldn&#x27;t be a danger to Wizards, not out of any consideration. The other segment was fine with running them thru the chute to the slaughterhouse. Both opinions were current even in Hogwarts. But neither regarded them as more than cattle to be managed.<p>And of course Wizard society had the right to manage them, that was never questioned. Such a book could only be written by the British, with their tone-deafness about class and privilege.<p>Anyway, I enjoyed the books too.')
