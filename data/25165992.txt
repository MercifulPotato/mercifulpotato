In their struggle to make sense of this incoherence, the masses assume that the elites are intentionally conspiring against them. The masses don&#x27;t understand that the elites are simply delusional.<p>Unlike the masses, the elites don&#x27;t feel any disconnect between their experienced reality and mainstream social narratives. The problems in our society are so massive and so obvious that the masses cannot imagine that the elites could possibly not notice them; so they think that the elites must be pretending, they must be conspiring.<p>There is no conspiracy by the elite. It&#x27;s just plain old delusion backed self-serving optimism bounced around within echo chambers.')
