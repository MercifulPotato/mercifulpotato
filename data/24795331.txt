While I like the idea of separating seeing only what my followers post and seeing other posts, it gets really blurry when the people I follow are clicking the &quot;like&quot; and &quot;retweet&quot; buttons. I would guestimate around 30% or more of my twitter feed are posts people I follow have liked or retweeted rather than posted on their own.<p>And the network can make that happen on its own, without an algorithm reordering content - if someone I follow is retweeting something that someone they follow retweeted.')
