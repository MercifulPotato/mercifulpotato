There are principals that can be effectively integrated to a backyard garden. But, to have as close to a self-sustaining cycle as you can, you&#x27;re going to invest thousands and thousands of hours. Honestly, I have never figured up how many hours we&#x27;ve spent on this, just because it&#x27;s a hobby and quantifying it would spoil part of it for me.')
