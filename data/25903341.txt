Prior to Napster we would share our music collection over ICQ. By the time we graduated most of my contacts were on AIM. I only began using it again once I moved abroad and my co-workers, mostly East European, were on it. They knew I was old based on the number of digits in my UID :-).<p>Each subsequent company I worked at had a different preferred chat app: ICQ, AIM, Skype, MSN.')
