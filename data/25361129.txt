So I&#x27;m wondering what it could be?<p>- Are the results false? Would a country lie on the numbers? It looks like the US estimation was misleading halved in two[1], the real numbers paint a much different picture placing the US much higher than any European countries.<p>- Are the results misleading? For example, I see that different years are listed for different countries (2012 for France, 2019 for the US), or that Germany&#x27;s numbers include &quot;around 375,000 asylum seekers and refugees in temporary accommodation&quot;.<p>- Is reality misleading? For example, it could be that homeless in Europe are taken care of and thus you don&#x27;t see them much, whereas in the US they are all over the streets because there are no aids. Or it could be that most homeless people in Europe don&#x27;t live in the cities and are thus out of sight.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020-07-06&#x2F;why-is-homelessness-such-a-problem-in-u-s-cities?cmpid=BBD070620_CITYLAB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020-07-06&#x2F;why-is-ho...</a>')
