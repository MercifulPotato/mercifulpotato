It assumes that I have information about the identity of a user, but the only thing I have is the email address.<p>If my app asks for more data, which are backed up as a service to the user (no tracking), that is of course connected to the email address of the account. However, there is no effort from my side to find the actual identity of the user.<p>This whole identity thing is very confusing. Might need to contact Apple developer support.')
