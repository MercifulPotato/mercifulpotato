I look forward the 3.6 release, the listed improvements sound really great.<p>Why should MuseScore also be a sequencer, or support VSTs. Those are two very different family of functionalities; making a good sequencer is hard -- as they apparently found out. And there are many of them out there already, many of them excellent.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to output MIDI in realtime from MuseScore and use a sequencer &#x2F; VST host at the other end, with an internal MIDI router in between. I just tested this now and it works well (Windows &#x2F; MuseScore 3.5 &#x2F; loopMIDI &#x2F; Reaper).')
