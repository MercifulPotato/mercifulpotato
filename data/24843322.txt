So the question shouldn&#x27;t really be if there is an instruction, it&#x27;s whether the one you&#x27;re using is the most performant for your given CPU.  Old Linux kernels would actually calculate CPU speed, and whether 16-bit, 32-bit, FPU, MMX memory copies were fastest and pick one for the kernel to use.')
