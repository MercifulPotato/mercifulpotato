The MacBook Air, the iPhone, the iPad, Airpods, an ARM laptop, the notch, multiple lenses on the phone, the eSIM?<p>Sci-fi enthusiasts and online concept artists were all about the in-ear wireless headphones but everyone made those ugly ass things which attach behind the head. Then Apple makes the Airpods and it turns out everyone and their uncle can manufacture shitty knock offs <i>and</i> good copies.<p>So the design idea exists, the manufacturing capability exists, but the product doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Then Apple comes along and makes it and half the people think it&#x27;s revolutionary and half the people think that it is this copy of this other completely shitty version of the same product.<p>Why does it take Apple to make the first good version of anything? I like my Jabra Active 65 and I liked the Airpods before but I couldn&#x27;t get the former until the latter came to be.<p>Maybe someone will make a fast ARM laptop now that Apple has demonstrated that it&#x27;s possible. Genuinely seems like an industry of followers with one design leader.')
