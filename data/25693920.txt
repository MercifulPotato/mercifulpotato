Item(by='pbourke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610153995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25693170, text='&gt; There is no way Trump would ever be convicted in a court of law for what he did.<p>It doesn’t matter. The standards of the courtroom are not being applied here. The facts are plain: there were a hundred off ramps for Trump over the 2 months since the election and he chose to take none of them. He failed in his duty to the Presidency as an institution and the idea of separation of powers and coequal branches of government. He tried to intimidate the Congress into doing his bidding.<p>You get that it’s a much more essential question than whether he is technically allowed to do what he did, right? Impeachment and the 25th amendment are political remedies that must be used both to punish what this president has done and to warn other presidents that they cannot cross the bright lines that define democracy.<p>He is the nations principal law enforcement officer and he aided and abetted lawlessness of the most dire kind.')
