Everyone knows what country we&#x27;re in and that most people celebrate Christmas, so why would anybody be offended by saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;? This matters because if you don&#x27;t see it as an &quot;inclusive&quot; move, then it just comes off as a way to snub people who do celebrate Christmas.<p>If I&#x27;m Jewish in America, I&#x27;m used to people talking about Christmas, so I&#x27;m probably not gonna be offended by it anymore, but if someone said something to me about the <i>right holiday</i> I would probably appreciate it.<p>Whether &quot;happy holidays&quot; vs &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; counts for much instead - since it&#x27;s still no more personalized to me, especially when still wrapped in red and green - I can&#x27;t really say myself, since I celebrate Christmas personally, but I don&#x27;t have any reason to disbelieve the non-Christians who&#x27;ve told me they appreciate things like that. It&#x27;s <i>something</i> to say &quot;hey, we realize that you exist!&quot;')
