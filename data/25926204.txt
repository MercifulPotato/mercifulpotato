The fact that they worked so well is due to the work of the subeditor who compiled (and still maintains!) the rule corpus – as well as the sheer volume, there are quite a few carefully ordered rules. Because style guide matches are reasonably sparsely found in content, and usually reasonably specific as to what matches (even if it&#x27;s difficult to produce a correction) it turned out to be a surprisingly tractable problem to produce something useful with regular expressions alone – but we&#x27;d never have discovered that was the case unless someone had spent literally years doing it!<p>General maintainability is a priority, and we&#x27;d like to improve our rule management tooling to make the process of rule maintance generally accessible to editorial staff. We&#x27;re also working on making noisy rules match more specifically, which usually involves migrating the initial regex into Languagetool for e.g. pattern-matching on part-of-speech.')
