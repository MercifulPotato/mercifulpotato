It has created its own positive feedback cycle for support, because its beneficiaries are long-term residents, which means older older and wealthier people, who vote more. If a) your rent isn&#x27;t going up, because you own and your taxes are fixed, and b) your kids are old enough to be out of school, and c) you live closer to work because you bought when the areas were less developed, then you&#x27;re insulated from the 3 main problems that Prop 13 creates.<p>Those who would benefit from its repeal - renters, people who moved out, people who choose not to move to CA in the first place because of cost and governance, children, etc, either don&#x27;t vote as consistently or can&#x27;t vote in CA at all.')
