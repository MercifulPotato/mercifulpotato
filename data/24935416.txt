All you need is an offline-first system with mandatory redundant caching and no unattended cache flushing. Ideally it should also intend clients to distribute seen messages between each-other. It can also store each message hashes in a blockchain.<p>Legacy e-mail should be gone for good, with its 7-bit headers (it takes 24 bits to represent a 8-bit symbol in &quot;quoted-printable&quot;), codepage hell (most of the Americans can hardly understand, meanwhile e-mail software still doesn&#x27;t default to UTF-8), overquoting tradition (most of the people quote all the messages of the thread below every message and the software encourages this), pointless subject field encouraged for every message (which usually remains intact when the subject changes, and often is of little informativeness from the very start), incompatible HTML formatting, etc.')
