Item(by='RcouF1uZ4gsC', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604167684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24945608, text='&gt; When one is told that God and the Devil are in conflict one always knows which side is going to win. The whole drama of the struggle against evil lies in the fact that one does not have supernatural aid.<p>Lewis would have rejected the sentiment of that last sentence. For him, all of human history is part of the drama of God vs the devil. And although there has been supernatural at points in the struggle, still what humans did still mattered.<p>For him, a large part of the struggle is humans surrendering themselves to be used as the vessel for Godâ€™s plan.<p>In some sense, Merlin is a type of Mary who opens himself up to be the human body that the supernatural will inhabit, even though he knows it can ultimately destroy his body.<p>As an aside, this is one of my favorite books, and I would love to see it made into a movie.')
