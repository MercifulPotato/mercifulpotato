This processor announcement is for their CPUs without GPUs, so you&#x27;d need a GPU add on board, and both AMD and NVidia support that. AMDs processors with GPUs (they call them APUs) support that too. AMD tends to release desktop CPU, then high end desktop&#x2F;server, then laptop APU and finally desktop APU. They only released Zen2 desktop APUs a couple months ago, and they&#x27;re currently OEM only and very hard to find in the US (grey market imports only, AFAIK, but send me an email if I&#x27;m wrong, address in profile)')
