Item(by='detaro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602448230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748744, text='GPUs are complex computers in themselves, and the driver needs to provide compilers etc that target them (e.g. when it comes to shaders, applications hand the driver source code that is then compiled for the specific GPU architecture). Combine that with many different product generations and configurations being supported, code apparently being autogenerated and thus probably not optimized for size and you get to this.<p>EDIT: monocasa points out below that the compiler is not a correct example - true, that does live in e.g. mesa userspace code.')
