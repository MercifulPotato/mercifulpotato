Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=[25360131], score=None, time=1607526248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358561, text='&gt; Nope, IBM, Azul, Amazon, Red-Hat, Alibaba, Twitter, Microsoft also seat at the Java table.<p>I know Java has stakeholders but, what I&#x27;m trying to say is the table is at Oracle&#x27;s HQ, not somewhere else.<p>&gt; Should I also start listing the dark sides of each company that seats at ISO C and ISO C++ table?<p>A primer would be nice, actually.<p>&gt; Python working groups also need money from those corporations, and Python is yet to provide the performance levels of Java, so much for free beer development.<p>I&#x27;ve never alleged that Python takes no money from corporations and, Python doesn&#x27;t aim the performance of Java. Their byte-code even doesn&#x27;t get optimized. Instead Python prefers native libraries for performance. SciPy, NumPy, PyTorch and others obtain native performance on any system they run and, it&#x27;s enough for Python.<p>No need to move the goalposts and compare apples to oranges. Python is never meant to replace Java. Java is not meant to replace system programming languages like C&#x2F;C++. You may like Java and it might help you to pay the bills but, pushing other languages around just because they don&#x27;t fill your needs from your point of view is not the correct stance.')
