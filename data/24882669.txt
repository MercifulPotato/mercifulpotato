Basically we&#x27;re a communication tool for construction, maintenance work and visitor management. Our selling point is simply data consistency, e.g. you can&#x27;t edit posts, unlike on Facebook, and deleting will give a notice. Photos taken from the app are signed and location stamped. I think it&#x27;s interesting that people comment you can just take a photo of an odometer, but that&#x27;s not something that two parties do all the time; it&#x27;s best to just automate that process.<p>Blockchain is not a &quot;killer&quot; feature of the app, but it&#x27;s another layer of security. Databases are the core, but staff with access can edit a database in seconds. Maybe one way to think of it is like cash registers. The person operating a cash register can still steal it, but it&#x27;s a lot harder than if it were just a box. It won&#x27;t stop a dedicated person, but will greatly discourage doing it casually.')
