It seemed to have issues overheating and dying. Bought the Insignia version of the same from BestBuy and it works like a champ (even when it&#x27;s 100f outside and my house has no AC).<p>It&#x27;s not about where you buy it, but the quality matters.<p>It was an eye opening experience when I left the 1 star review, the vendor keeps pinging me with bribe offers to take it down. So when you see even a little bump of 1 star reviews, you have to know that those are the people who have some integrity and there likely is a proportion missing.')
