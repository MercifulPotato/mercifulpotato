Item(by='just-juan-post', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605154039, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25051710, text=' - Upvotes and downvotes made things a competition rather than a discussion<p>- Unsure if I&#x27;m talking to genuine humans or people who are paid to post<p>- Block &#x2F; mute features allow users to self-create bubbles<p>- Certain ideas are not allowed via downvotes (frequent) or deplatforming (rare) or calling them misinformation (becoming more common)<p>- Too many people.  I don&#x27;t really know anyone in these &quot;anonymous only&quot; communities (HN and Reddit) but I did &quot;know&quot; people back in the day when things were smaller (Something Awful)<p>- Politics are somehow dragged into everything and everywhere and it&#x27;s almost impossible to avoid it (see also Covid news)<p>- We all thought bringing broadband and information to people would make them smarter and more progressive.  I didn&#x27;t.  It increased radicalization and polarization.  Now everyone can easily find ammo against the &quot;other side&quot; and there are a million ways to start fights and create reactions.  People avoid discussions with others due to their viewpoint on a unrelated matter.<p>- Full post history is available and people will search it to dig up dirt on you.  That little thing you said 10 years ago can be used against you (extreme) or people will look at your post history and pre-judge you (frequent)<p>To answer your question: yes.')
