If kids were left to their own devices to learn without any adult supervision it&#x27;s possible (likely even) that they&#x27;d end up distracted at best, or at rick of causing or experiencing damage to themselves or their environment at worst.<p>So... I guess I&#x27;m not sure what the model ought to be. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some contrast to be found to cultures where there&#x27;s more live-in family (grandparents, aunts uncles etc.) than you find in American&#x2F;Western households.')
