It would effectively be a dial tone. Each node broadcasts toward, say, its three nearest neighbors. It sends a carrier that also periodically encodes info about how to use the node and the “IP addresses” of other known participants.<p>Latency would suck though. A complete ping to another “live” station could take hundreds or thousands of years. The vast majority of repeater nodes could be dumb unmanned devices periodically sent out and placed in orbit around other stars.<p>What if our solar system has one and we haven’t noticed it because it’s not that big, is in close solar orbit to easily harness a lot of power, and is only aiming its signals at our three nearest neighbors. Heh.')
