Kind of feel that whatever software is developed for it wouldn&#x27;t have much of a future because it wouldn&#x27;t be portable and interoperable with other software.<p>For example, for a smartwatch I ultimately want to run a timekeeping app that connects to an emacs daemon (for working with org-mode buffers) through a VPN to a personal server, taking into account the watch eventually evolving to one that supports a cellular modem.<p>Doing something worth doing, from scratch, seems too much. I wonder what their vision is. What are they hoping PineTime eventually evolves to? Are they expecting it to never stop being a companion to a phone?')
