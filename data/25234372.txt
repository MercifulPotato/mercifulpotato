At least under some circumstances:<p>- modern architecture having fast atomic fetch_add&#x2F;sub<p>- weak memory ordering making atomic fetch_add&#x2F;sub even faster (if Acquire&#x2F;Release ordering is used)<p>- optimize the usage of reference counting by eliminating pointless reference counting, e.g. as done by Objective-C&#x2F;Swift <i>automatic</i>  reference counting (ARC). Or e.g. done when using borrows in rust for everything except the places you know you really need to clone the Atomic Reference Counter (also ARC but a different one ;=) ).<p>Reference counting was for a long time basically guaranteed to be slower then garbage collection because of slower atomics, no weak memory ordering and &quot;naive&quot; usage of reference counting introducing a lot of unnecessary reference counter increased and decreases.<p>But with modern hardware and compilers it&#x27;s no longer as clear cut, at least in practice wrt. to modern hardware.')
