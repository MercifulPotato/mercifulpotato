People on HN are sometimes really flippant about the lesser discussed segments of software industry.<p>We had to run the hardware lab with strict quotas in the middle of the raging pandemic, because the critical equipment can&#x27;t be moved. I had to personally go to office several times to use the jigs to use special test devices, I can&#x27;t even imagine our remote developers in Poland&#x2F;Ukraine traveling to Berlin just to work on the experimental devices.<p>Also a lot of people are overlooking the compliance issue.
