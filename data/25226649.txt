No, we’re absolutely not done? You just asked me to commit on the spot to something I potentially haven’t thought about before you just brought it up. I haven’t had a chance to reflect or even to respond. And you think we’re already boom, done?<p>Edit: If you want to actually be done, you could end with something like “I would appreciate if you were mindful of this going forwards”. Then you’ve said what you need to say, and your feedback stands by itself regardless of how the other person reacts to it.')
