That&#x27;s the only way I can see the context of what brought me to the change from the code history and runtime contexts.<p>What do other people do to review large sets of changes?  Have you found any good ways to make both the code-history and runtime context changes available while debugging?<p>(On a more practical note: are there any good ways of going from a diff to a list of breakpoints in VS?)')
