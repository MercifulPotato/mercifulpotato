Worked cleaning out freezers in an ice cream factory. I&#x27;ve done plenty of crappy manual jobs. But I knew that&#x27;s what I would get at the time as I was uneducated and unskilled. I was happy to have an income that relied on not needing any skills. Sorry you are annoyed, it&#x27;s my opinion.')
