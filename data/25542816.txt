I have a slightly different philosophical view, I consider CS to be on equal footing with most of traditional mathematics. In my view:<p>- Traditional math (which came mostly out of physics and geometry) studies primarily infinite but countable structures (functions on countable sets, infinite series). The finite structures are often considered trivial, and the uncountable structures are considered to be too large to have practical importance.<p>- Computer science (gosh I wish there was a better name of the two disciplines) is concerned with finite structures which are too large (in practice, functions on sets with more than 2^32 elements) to be represented by enumeration. In analogy to finite&#x2F;countable&#x2F;uncountable sets distinction in traditional math, small structures that can be enumerated in practice are trivial in CS, larger structures (infinite ones) are pretty much impractical, and they are simply universe in which we operate. (This leads to algorithmic languages, which are essentially descriptions of arbitrarily large finite sets.)<p>- There are other branches of mathematics, logic, category theory, algebra, which are concerned with building bridges between the two above subareas, which are probably many.<p>My point is that for (theory of) programming, you need computer science (focus on large finite sets), and study of infinite sets is less useful. But historically, it&#x27;s not how mathematics became subdivided, and it is a distinction useful from applications of mathematics, not mathematics as a general study of structures (regardless of size).')
