Basically if you see any indicators of company highlights on Yelp, they&#x27;re paying for it, and they&#x27;re passing off Yelp&#x27;s extortion to you by increasing margins. Yelp tries to keep a visible dichotomy on their site by offering &quot;Sponsored Results,&quot; but the reality of their listings is that they&#x27;re almost <i>all</i> sponsored results.<p>Their reputation is so poor among some circles now that I don&#x27;t see them staying in power 10 years out. They&#x27;re going the way of the BBB.<p>As a result, you&#x27;re safer searching for certain types of businesses on Google Maps, but even Google has &quot;GOOGLE GUARANTEED&quot; and possibly other paid-for indicators which make me not trust their results.<p>The market incentives are so bad among rating and business directory sites that I can only imagine that at this point, only a mutual company dedicated to business directory services can survive long-term. I don&#x27;t think any exist right now.')
