They can rediscover that the internet at its&#x27; core has no rules and is open to anyone willing to put in the technical effort. There&#x27;s nothing stopping them from building their own platform from the ground up. However, that requires a modicum of technical skill, which by the looks of every &quot;Parler-like&quot; community that has been stood up, is non-existent among these people. Similar to things like ISIL, these type of people are great at taking over existing infrastructure and crowding out voices of reason, however left to their own devices, they crumble due to total technical incompetency.')
