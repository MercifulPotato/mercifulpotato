If that&#x27;s not possible, start interviewing with other companies without mentioning it to your current colleagues.<p>I have a friend who was doing the same thing as you, went to another team inside the same company, and actually the same kind of thinking that you have (helping other people) helped him get multiple promotions, and he&#x27;s a team leader with a nice salary, and his team loves him.<p>Also one more thing: he was using an old language, that&#x27;s why he was afraid of switching teams. I suggested him to learn any modern language used inside his company to have leverage to be able to switch company if he wants...he just needed to get a bit outside his comfort zone, after that everything came for him (he&#x27;s still with the same company, but he&#x27;s happy now).')
