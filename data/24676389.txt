How is Rust view &quot;state is evil&quot;? At its core, Rust is very imperative and procedural.<p>Global reasoning about state is hard, hence the assistance from borrow checker. Locally mutating local state in small function? Put a reference to vars, if you want them to be mutated, just make them mut. It&#x27;s also as fast.<p>In a way, Rust does better job of localize&#x2F;encapsulate mutation than functional&#x2F;monad world.')
