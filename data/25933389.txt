Most labs have their own &#x27;dialect&#x27; of common mol bio techniques that &#x27;work&#x27; in their particular setup. Perhaps the reagent from their particular supplier requires a longer incubation time, or the enzymes are wonky and you need to add more. Everybody I know does washing steps their own way - they say the &quot;official&quot; protocol is too long&#x2F;cumerbersome&#x2F;wasteful. More often than not, their own variant of the protocol is documented in their lab books, but not in the publications, where it cites the original protocol.')
