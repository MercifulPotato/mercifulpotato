JPEG2000 was a bit more efficient than JPEG by virtue of being a newer, more computationally intensive format, not because of wavelets. A modern format like the h.265 derived HEIF still uses DCT&#x2F;DST based transforms. For video the situation is worse, as AFAIK no-one has been able to come up with a decent wavelet based motion estimation algorithm.')
