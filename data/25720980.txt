Then roasting in dry heat. Finally, resting it. All meats must ‘rest’ for 15-20 minutes because it continues cooking evenly right after the oven.<p>When you get it out depends on preferred doneness. Medium rare, medium, well done. Most white meat is cooked well done.<p>Or you cook sous vide. Wherein, the Maillard reaction is to be done separately.<p>Chicken legs have to be seared first and then goes into the oven. And then rested. If you have seasonings, let it sit in marinade for 20 mts in the fridge and then 40-45 mts in a 425 deg oven.<p>While chickens and legs can also be brined for a crackling crispy skin but whole birds cook unevenly. Spatchcocked birds make for more even cooking.')
