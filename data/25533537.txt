It turns out that evolution prepared your mind for this. You&#x27;ll step into the role comfortably once you&#x27;ve gotten through the first time experiences with newborns.<p>- You&#x27;ll feel things you never felt before. One of the ways evolution prepared you is that you&#x27;ll feel a new kind of pride when your child accomplishes anything new. I still remember vividly both of my daughter&#x27;s first steps after 20 years. People who are never fathers will never feel this exact emotion. It can be surprising.<p>- Another feeling you will likely encounter is the &#x27;rescue response&#x27;. It&#x27;s a kind of flow state your mind will go into if your child is in imminent physical danger. It&#x27;s happened to me twice in 20 years. No thinking, time freezes, only acting to remove them from the danger.<p>- An important one is that the mother&#x27;s personality is going to change. It will be fine, but be prepared to see a new side of her that she likely won&#x27;t know herself. Evolution has prepared her, too, and in even more impactful ways. I&#x27;d suggest reading &#x27;The Female Brain&#x27; by Louanne Brizendine. It&#x27;s research and science based and will help explain a lot of what&#x27;s coming.<p>- Fatherhood is the &#x27;meaning of life&#x27; for men. Preparing your children to be successful human adults is what you&#x27;re all about. If you accept that and run with it, you&#x27;ll have a fulfilling life.<p>- It will be fine.')
