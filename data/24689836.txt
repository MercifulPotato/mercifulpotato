Particularly when I’m rationalizing committing work in progress before leaving for lunch or before writing experimental code. So rebasing to consolidate a couple commits and reorder some others is helpful.<p>The commit history is performance art.  You don’t need to know that I left out a comma. Or that I tried to make a bit of code easier to read but introduced regressions in the process (that also breaks bisect). You <i>do</i> need to know that I changed this code over here because I changed the code over there and broke something, because I either missed something or you’ll have the same issue the next time.')
