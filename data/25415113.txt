It&#x27;s ridiculous that people are allowed to drive cars before being able to use the road. Airline pilots learn by building up hours in a small aircraft during the day. Then they learn at night. Then they move to larger aircraft.<p>It should be mandatory to learn to use the road on bicycle before even applying for a car licence. The biggest problem I see is that people simply don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to use the road outside of a car. Neither on foot nor on a bike. Dashboard perspective is a real thing. It makes you see other people as obstacles rather than people who are just trying to go to work or return to their family, like you.<p>Requiring bicycle training would dramatically increase the number of cyclists on the road, essentially taking it back from the tyranny of motorcars. It would also ensure that those who do decide to learn to drive have the experience necessary to be a good road user. Additionally, if they do end up causing an accident the licence can be revoked and they can get back on the bike.')
