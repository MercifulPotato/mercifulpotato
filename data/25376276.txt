Sure, for thousands of years there have been things called &quot;markets,&quot; but they were far more limited in scope and their role in society was not nearly the same.<p>&gt; 2) The market needs constant interference in order to not destroy itself (and again you seem to be referring to a great range of economic activity, perhaps all of it, but not all of it because you&#x27;re also saying it would destroy &quot;much else&quot;)<p>I mean, isn&#x27;t this obvious?  The market itself is not going to enforce contracts, it&#x27;s not going prevent a wealthy person from paying for a private army and making his own rules, it&#x27;s not going to do anything about monopolies and cartels (at least not on a reasonable timescale), it&#x27;s not going to manage negative externalities, it&#x27;s not going to address or mitigate socially destabilizing economic forces, etc.<p>The market is like a car: it some ways it may be a modern marvel, effortlessly regulating the timing of its complicated internal workings in a way no person could, but without a driver it will run out of gas and as happily drive into a wall than not.')
