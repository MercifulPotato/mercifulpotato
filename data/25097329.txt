Even though redux devs themselves have come out and said that it&#x27;s not for every situation. Where does that leave people?<p>I really think there should be a greater focus to be more ergonomic rather than theoretically good. There should be one package that someone can just jump into. Separating react-redux, redux, and now redux-tookit is just frustrating.<p>I just get this gut feeling with redux that people just wrote and wrote stuff, without really stopping and squashing it down. The fact that part of the messaging with using a toolkit also involves reading up on the essentials is a problem.<p>Even if the problem space is very complex there shouldn&#x27;t be this much information - I think it might be easier to learn some programming languages than the entirety of the redux ecosystem. And frankly, I don&#x27;t even think the problem is that complicated, the basic flux model isn&#x27;t that complicated. And yet it&#x27;s been made to be so complicated. I recently did a refresher, and on the react-redux example, just in the intro of a basic todolist, there&#x27;s ~50 things that are highlighted - implying you should remember them - in just the section of setting up a store. Not the entire section on stores, just the intro outlining the brief overview of the rest of the tutorial.<p>There is just so much stuff.<p>I don&#x27;t even think the toolkit makes things that much simpler either. It&#x27;s a step in the right direction, but it feels really leaky when I get into the intermediate and advanced sections.')
