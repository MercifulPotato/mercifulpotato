With my Nikon I could try at (very) high ISO for a natural-light shot or use an off-camera flash to shape her face in a more flattering way. But perhaps people used to the very flat &#x2F; boring light common in mirror selfies won&#x27;t care about this.<p>The blur on the edges of the fur look digitally smeared rather than optically blurred.<p>[edit - okay, I didn&#x27;t spot that he used off screen light rather than flash. But the effect is similar and hasn&#x27;t given  any pleasing sculpting of the subject. Other processing may have made things worse]')
