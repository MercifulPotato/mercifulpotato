My doctor scheduled the appointment. I had no say in it. This doctor is at one of two offices that I am allowed to choose from based on my insurance&#x27;s negotiated contracts. This is insurance that is provided by my employer that I had no choice in. When I first saw the doctor, he prescribed meds that I had no choice in. The specific meds he prescribed were chosen as these are what the insurance company would prefer from a clinical perspective although they were extremely unlikely to help. And, on top of all of this, not once was I informed of the cost prior to services being rendered and if I had asked, I would have been told this wasn&#x27;t possible.<p>How is any of this libertarian? The libertarian solution would be that only individuals would be allowed to purchase insurance, that insurance would distribute funds to the individual (not the doctor or pharmacy), all fees would be provided prior to service being rendered and individuals would purchase meds without a prescription.')
