But I would agree that it&#x27;s probably best to define e^x through its power series, especially because it directly generalises to complex arguments. (Another good definition is as the function f whose derivative equals itself, and which satisfies f(0)=1, but that&#x27;s not very constructive.)<p>Of course, you can also go another route: you can define the number e (e.g. as the limit of (1+1&#x2F;n)^n), then you can straightforwardly define natural number powers of e by repeated multiplication, then integer and rational powers through reciprocals and roots (you have to prove n-th roots exist, but that&#x27;s doable), and then you can define real number exponents via limits (maybe this is what you mean by &quot;interpolating recursively&quot;). Now, when we come to complex numbers, you can use Euler&#x27;s formula as a definition instead of a theorem, and define exp(a+bi):=e^a * (cos b + i sin b). Of course, at the end of this whole exercise you can prove that this definition is exactly equal to the power series definition.<p>Another benefit of the power series definition is that it also generalises e.g. to the matrix exponential (exp(A), when A is a matrix).')
