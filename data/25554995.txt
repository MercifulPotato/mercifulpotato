Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609109981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554586, text='&gt;<i>I also see the deployment of those massive fleets of satellites in LEO to be suicidal.</i><p>Incorrectly, fortunately. First, remember space is big. At hundreds of km up, even tens of thousands of satellites are by definition spread across a greater &quot;surface&quot; area than the entirety of the Earth. There will be fewer of them then there are aircraft flying through the skies.<p>Second, you might find it reassuring to look up orbital drag. The atmosphere doesn&#x27;t simply stop at some set point, but rather gradually thins to irrelevance (or arguably to the bow shock of the solar wind). But anything below 600-700km or so requires regular reboosts or else it will experience decay (eventually exponential) and burn up&#x2F;crash (depending on construction and design). SpaceX is leveraging its launch capabilities to have lower satellites which don&#x27;t last as long, but offer superior performance, eliminates many of the space trash concerns, and doesn&#x27;t lock them into design decisions nearly as much.<p>I mean, is this really such a surprise? SpaceX of ALL players clearly has <i>enormous</i> vested interest in making sure space access remains straight forward. Like, that&#x27;s their entire foundation of business. If LEO really was closed off, no more SpaceX.')
