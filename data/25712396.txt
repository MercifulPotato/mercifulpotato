Do I adapt my pronunciation to yours for the length of this conversation? Or do I pronounce it my way, causing the extra step in your translation of my speech, then also causing you to wonder why I am saying it differently, furthermore causing you to consider whether to change your pronunciation to mine, if nothing else to end this extra thought process every time?<p>Also, if I adapt my pronunciation to yours, I guess now I need to remember to say it your way every time we talk forever, and say it Henry&#x27;s way when speaking to him, and now I have this whole table in my head of various pronunciations for various individuals.<p>And then what happens if I am in conversation with you and Henry at the same time? Do I say things your way, his way, or my way? And what do you do? And what does Henry do?<p>---<p>Or we could just stop, agree upon a common pronunciation, and move forward at the normal speed of conversation.<p>---<p>To clarify, the tone never should be condescending. This is a small matter. Therefore the tone should be light.<p>The pronunciation that is deemed &quot;correct&quot; is usually the one of the majority. So it is just an attempt to get everyone on the same page. It strikes me more as &quot;inclusive&quot; than &quot;anti-inclusive&quot;. If I were &quot;anti-inclusive&quot;, then I would silently let you say it your way, smile inside, and then talk behind your back to Henry about what a newb you are.')
