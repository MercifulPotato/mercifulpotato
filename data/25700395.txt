The article says Haskell is hard to learn&#x2F;use and not appetible for business. A similar article could be written about RISC architecture in 2007 when x86 ruled. Then Steve Jobs built the iPhone and with it an empire based on RISC architecture. And now Apple Silicon it&#x27;s threatening desktop and servers, last standing of X86.')
