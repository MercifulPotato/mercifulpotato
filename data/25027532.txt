It gets just as much solar energy per square km as the land, so it can support a roughly similarly dense ecosystem.<p>The problem is more about what type of fish we like to eat than the sheer volume: if we were willing to make do with krill and plankton we could sustainably consume many times our current intake, but not so when we want cod and tuna.')
