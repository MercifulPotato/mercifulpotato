They&#x27;re not thinking of cases the system must handle, and in the absence of that (essential) complexity, they come up with an incorrect mental model that they believe works (as they&#x27;re not aware of the counter-examples to it).<p>This happens <i>often</i>. As another example, a former PM of mine used to assume that if our wearable recorded heart-rate data, it also had sweat data. That is, the wearable either had a lock, and recorded, or didn&#x27;t. But sweat came from a different sensor than HR, and the two sensors could independently get or lose their signal. And so, sometimes one was null, sometimes the other, sometimes both, sometimes neither.')
