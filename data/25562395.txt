High ground, effect of various terrain types. Slower movement, terrain which only infantry can cross. Garrisoned structures. C&amp;C has this stuff, Starcraft or Warcraft never did (specific single structures but not neutral buildings). Small scale you say? What about directional armor and flanking, crossfire.<p>CS:GO is a very accessible first person shooter game suitable for all skill levels. It changes little over years and visuals are far from state of art. But they&#x27;ve figured out the formula for FUN. It&#x27;s not exactly my cup of tea, but if you can do this for FPS you can probably find a FUN real time strategy formula as well. A formula that&#x27;s not overly complicated and doesn&#x27;t feel like juggling balls for 25 minutes. I think Starcraft is not that formula.')
