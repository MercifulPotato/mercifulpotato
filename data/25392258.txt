Money continues to be a motive even for those with enough to satisfy every need, because it becomes a marker of status, achievement, etc. If you remove that motive then you remove the output of some of our best minds.<p>You&#x27;ll certainly remove their clout over society but I think you also need to consider the significant downsides to this proposal. Maybe you would be better off finding ways to limit the power of rich people over society (eg political contribution laws) instead of trying to ban being rich?')
