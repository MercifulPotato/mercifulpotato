Obviously Nyxt is very different from more conventional browsers. I&#x27;m an Emacs and StumpWM user, and I&#x27;d love to have the same kind of power in browser environment. But without easily accessible docs it&#x27;s just a little bit too high barrier for me.<p>&gt; it would drift from different versions people were using<p>Good point. Maybe as a first step just copy that paragraph from readme file to a more prominent place on site? It&#x27;s very unusual for a project site to have no manual.<p>Then make the latest version of docs available online. It should be clear 1) what version it talks about, 2) how to check version of user&#x27;s installation, and 3) how to open the embedded help.<p>Then if really needed add docs for previous versions, like some projects do. For instance <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;index.html</a>.<p>I suppose at least some basic concepts have been stable enough to not change anytime soon?<p>Or does Nyxt still change substantially from the UX point of view?')
