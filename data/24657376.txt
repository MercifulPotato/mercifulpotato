You’re now saving $18,000 a year which is cool but almost al your other expenses stay the same (car, Xbox, TV, Internet, insurance, etc).  You’re going to lose more than $18,000&#x2F;yr in TC in the near term and long term (after you leave stripe) you sure and he’ll are.<p>So the moral of my story is don’t move out of a high cost city for the money, it doesn’t add up.  Move out for a myriad of other reasons that may be meaningful for you (family, life, etc)')
