It had two wheels in front, so it wasn&#x27;t unstable like a Reliant Robin.<p>The thesis was that it was a good urban vehicle.  As a commuter car it was fine as long as your commute was under 45 minutes.<p>Unfortunately it was a single occupant vehicle, so as soon as we had a kid it was a nonstarter for my wife.  Also it could only carry a single bag of groceries.<p>People buy cars with multiple &quot;jobs&quot; in mind, and also like the flexibility of changing plans mid trip (stop at grocery on the way home, for example, or go pick up a sick kid from school).<p>And Smart cars (the Smart brand I mean) took over the urban market in Europe.<p>I don&#x27;t see any future in 3 wheeled cars.')
