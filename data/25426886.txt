Many places in the world still do not have refrigeration, running water, electricity, sewers, paved roads, mechanized farming&#x2F;milling&#x2F;textile production, etc.<p>People carry their own water, chop their own firewood, cook over a hearth fire in small hand-made thatched mud huts, make their own furniture, grow their own food (possibly using animals to plough), prepare their own food by hand from scratch, make their own clothing, do their laundry in a stream,  poop in the woods or in an outhouse, clean themselves in a sweat bath or with a damp cloth, carry goods from place to place on their backs or in simple unpowered carts, etc.<p>Though there are fewer and fewer such places as time goes on. For instance rural Mexico has changed dramatically in the past 2 generations.')
