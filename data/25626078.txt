This doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case at all to me.<p>Take diamonds for example. Prior to the mid 1900s, diamonds weren&#x27;t nearly as sought after as they are currently. It took the marketing and advertising efforts (among other efforts, like monopolizing the mining process) of De Beers to convince the public that diamonds should be highly coveted. It was advertising that pushed the public to think spending X months&#x27; salary on a diamond ring should be normal. De Beers is obviously highly derided, but this a pretty clear cut case that advertising is NOT zero sum. The value of diamonds went up because of advertising, and nothing else depreciated in value as a result.<p>I won&#x27;t even touch on your other points about unbranded goods, except to say that consumers definitely show preference for branded items, and I don&#x27;t really see why that is a problem.')
