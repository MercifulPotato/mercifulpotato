When we had wildfire smoke descend on our area, the stores sold out within hours.  If you live in an area which routinely experiences wildfire smoke, it&#x27;s worth stocking a few filters, both 20x20x4 for box fans and whatever size your furnace uses.  It made a huge difference to have fresh filters to swap out every few days.')
