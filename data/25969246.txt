Item(by='syops', descendants=None, kids=[25969414, 25970060], score=None, time=1612016218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969151, text='Obviously I&#x27;m speaking in the vernacular and as I stated I used the terms as they meant <i>to me</i>.<p>Besides <i>logically sound</i> and <i>sound argument</i> aren&#x27;t the same thing in my mind.  One refers to soundness of logic and the other to soundness of the argument.  And that was the essence of my point.  There&#x27;s a difference in talking about an argument and talking about the logic used.  Logical fallacies are only useful in determining if the reasoning was flawed.<p>I didn&#x27;t disagree with anything you wrote and even clarified my meaning so as to be clear.  There is also the fact that, linguistically speaking, every person has a unique language.  The meaning of words can vary slightly between people who nominally speak the same language.  That&#x27;s why I mentioned <i>to me</i> in my previous post.<p>Clearly I was not writing in a mathematically precise way.  I took mathematical logic in graduate school many years ago but am not qualified to use all of the terminology in a mathematically precise way.  But this is an internet forum and not a course in mathematical logic.  The standards of rigor are not so strict.  Hence my phrase <i>to me</i> ought to have sufficed as far as clarification.')
