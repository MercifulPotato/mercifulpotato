People will start doing something that probably unthinkable now but will be very obvious in the near future. Personally I have one application in need of the proper integration of their disparate systems and already started talking to their R&amp;D engineers but see little improvement being implemented.<p>FYI, AMD has come up with SSD storage and GPU integration before but with limited success [1], but if they can also integrate FPGA together that can probably be a recipe for a great success.<p>I think AMD and Intel (since they both own GPU&#x2F;CPU&#x2F;FPGA technology) really need to come up with open and intuitive design tools for these new systems or just sponsor the work on MLIR and LLHD by LLVM and ETH Zurich, respectively.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;extreme&#x2F;232416-amd-announces-new-ssg-a-gpu-with-1tb-of-ssd-storage-attached" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;extreme&#x2F;232416-amd-announces-new...</a>')
