Using sda is fine if you&#x27;re experienced and know what drive has what name, but technical references should stop relying on them already. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re getting some useful cross-platform compatibility out of old-fashioned commands or anything, every modern Unix has its own way to specify disk names.')
