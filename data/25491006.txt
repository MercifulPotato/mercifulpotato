It just has layers of deniability baked into the business structure like any good limited liability entity.<p>What it comes down to is that with NSO group:<p>1. Israel has access to the best 0-days it needs<p>2. The knowledge to develop further exploits is maintained within the Israeli intelligence apparatus<p>3. Israel is able to dominate the digital intelligence apparatus of autocratic regimes and, as a consequence, be able to defend itself against those tools<p>4. Israel is able to use it as a back channel for establishing and maintaining relationships, as well as exerting power and leverage on those nations<p>Given that it is an Israeli-government entity, much like the rest of the Israeli government, it is politically untouchable and buried under layers of denial. It&#x27;s a direct, toxic exploitation of the relationship that Western countries maintain with Israel.')
