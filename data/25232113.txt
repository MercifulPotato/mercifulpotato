Nothing special here, all HNers will relate. Of course, many of these ideas may be actually bad or really bad, although without trying you might never now.<p>What I do, though, is writing them down, and perhaps 1 out of 100 ends up being successfully implemented by someone else (unrelated to me). Again, nothing special here.<p>Is there any way to leverage these ideas, provided you donâ€™t have time to execute them? Is there any feasible way to externalize their development? Assuming you are not Google and can not afford funding a Google X-like lab.<p>Some possibilities I can think of at the moment is either becoming a professor and taking lots of interns, or funding a small startup with a bunch of developers.')
