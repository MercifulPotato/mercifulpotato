It&#x27;s as if product management would intuitively combine short-lived aesthetics with short-lived materials. Maybe they know from the beginning which new releases are merely novelty and which are intended to become permanent fixtures in the programme?<p>It would make sense on many business levels (e.g. I&#x27;d image negative impact of flimsyness growing almost exponentially with each year a bad product stays in the catalogue, designing for cheap <i>or</i> sturdy being muchbless costly than designing for cheap <i>and</i> sturdy and so on), but I have no idea if Ikea are good enough to consider that consciously (I do think they&#x27;d at least be closer top that level than most others)')
