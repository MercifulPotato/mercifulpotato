Granted, it was early in my career, but I don&#x27;t remember CentOS soliciting support, and I had no idea they were struggling to cover costs until this comment. If it had occurred to me, I would have kicked them a few bucks (and probably convinced an employer or two to do something more substantial). I suppose the Internet makes CDs less useful, but I liked when more FOSS projects used to sell media and merchandise.')
