You&#x27;re forgetting people buying drugs on dark net markets. Bitcoin got big because of the Silk Road. Drug use doesn&#x27;t lean left or right as much as it leans fringe (though certain drugs do, e.g. LSD on the left and meth on the right.) Given everything Bitcoin&#x27;s been and continues to be used for (drugs, ransomware, investment, remittance across borders) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll get significantly more tarnished by association with insurrectionaries.')
