I forgot if I asked him on Twitter or if someone else did, but it came down to asking why Basecamp doesn&#x27;t use Stripe&#x27;s subscription API.<p>He said it didn&#x27;t exist at the time but he also said it wasn&#x27;t a ton of work to get it all working using the basic single charge API. Details are spotty since it was a random tweet from a while ago but the overall feeling of it was it&#x27;s very doable.<p>I feel like the topic came up in one of those YouTube videos where DHH walked through real life code in Basecamp.<p>Even today it might be worth it. I mean if you try to integrate an abstraction on top let&#x27;s say Stripe and Braintree, there&#x27;s quite a lot of differences between the 2 for subscriptions. How much more work would it be to write your own subscription logic once and use it anywhere vs writing a really good abstraction.')
