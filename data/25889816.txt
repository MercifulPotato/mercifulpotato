So it will basically take 5 days to use all of the stored energy with no charging if you are running 40 amps of continuous loads at 120V. That’s pretty good. Not enough for a stove or electric heat but definitely enough for all your lights and appliances and a small air conditioner.<p>What is great is the 30 year\nLifespan vs. 5 years expected from batteries in grid scale storage applications.<p>80% charging efficiency and 50% round trip efficiency yields 62.5% generating efficiency. To charge 40 kWh at 80% efficiency would take two 10 hour days with 9 three hundred watt panels. But you’d want to power your loads those days too, so probably a 20-25 panel array would be an appropriate size. 25 three hundred watt panels is $8k CAD. On top of the $22k USD for the hydrogen storage. Pretty decent setup for $30k!!')
