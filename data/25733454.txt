And it&#x27;s going to have to sacrifice visual quality or use a ton of bandwidth (or both).<p>Switching to Peer to Peer for 1:1 or small group chats would be nice.<p>Low latency requirements being part of the BT spec would also be nice[1].<p>OS&#x27;s fixing their drivers and entire end to end audio stack, that&#x27;d also be nice.
