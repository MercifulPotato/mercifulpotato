Of course, you can introduce extra static checks ahead-of-time (e.g. mypy for Python). Static typing is meant as a proof that a program is well-formed in some sense and that proof does need to be checked at some point before the program executes. (This is extremely simplified, of course.)<p>The use of runtime-types for other purposes, e.g. dynamic dispatch, id quite a different story. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, Julia makes heavy use of this, but it&#x27;s still interpreted.')
