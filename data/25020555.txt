Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=[25021325], score=None, time=1604790101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018289, text='&gt; The media response that “there is no evidence of fraud” shifted to “no widespread fraud” at some point in last three years.<p>What a blatant red herring.<p>The media did no such thing.  What &quot;the media&quot; did was listen to the Trump campaign&#x27;s empty claims about having lost the election to this magical massive widespread wave of voter fraud, and proceeded to ask the Trump administration for evidence of this massive widespread wave of voter fraud they were complaining about.<p>Asking a source to substantiate their bold claims, or fact-check them, is now passed off as media manipulation?<p>And let&#x27;s be honest here: if Trump is complaining about tens, if not hundreds,  of thousands of votes being either fabricated or destroyed, how is a typo in a projection or a postman failing to deliver the mail any substance to that gargantuan claim?')
