It allow a low integrity process to run code as a medium (aka normal) integrity process. The exploit runs `splwow64.exe` which explorer &quot;helpfully&quot; auto elevates to medium integrity. The exploit then tricks `splwow64.exe` into running arbitrary code.<p>It does not grant admin privileges.<p>In practice this vulnerability isn&#x27;t that scary on its own. Sandboxes don&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) rely solely on this form of mandatory access control for their security. However this attack could be used as part of a chain of exploits in ored to escape a sandbox.')
