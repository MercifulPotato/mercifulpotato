It was really strange at first as I always remembered Macs to have great font rendering when displays were even lower res than that but I can&#x27;t stand how it looks on them. Having Windows scale to 150% on them just looks soo much better. I have a 4K 15&quot; ThinkPad and a 4K 27&quot; external at home and, even though they are the same resolution, they are such different sizes and I like to scale them differently to make things closer to the same size when I drag them back and forth - but only when docked. At other times I scale at a lower percentage to give me more realestate. With Windows I can do this on the fly these days without even logging off and everything looks great and &#x27;just works&#x27;.')
