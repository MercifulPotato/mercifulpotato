It is easier to change design before a line of code is written.\nDesign is precisely what is needed in order for the dev team to break down the projects into tiny chunks where nothing is unknown.<p>Your time estimates should always include time for research and design. The customer can sign off on what you&#x27;re about to write at the end of that (whereas beforehand you give them a wild ballpark figure made by senior devs - not management!)')
