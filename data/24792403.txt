Pilots see strange things, strange things very quickly moving past their aircraft.  If they have &quot;jet man&quot; in their minds, they will see jetman.<p>Similar things have happened with drones.  Brief every pilots about small drones and for the next couple weeks ever paper bag or large bird whipping past them on approach will be identified as a drone.  They aren&#x27;t tell lies.
