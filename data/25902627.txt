Give up the expectation to be able to push them in the direction where you want them to go. Rather focus on that they should understand, why you _care_ about it. Because you care for them.<p>I understand, that you are rejecting their position completely (and from my point of view you are right), but try to understand where they coming from without communicating the scepticism and your objections directly or in subtext.<p>Not that I think they are right, but chances are there are some good reason how they got into that. Likely they want to know the truth. Encourage them in that process without pushing for a direction.
