Unix time is an elegant concept at first glance, ideally it&#x27;s a free-running, monotonic counter that abstracts us away from timezone problems, an unambiguous representation of time. You only adjust the timezone settings or the timezone database, the time itself is never adjusted.<p>Unfortunately, using UTC rather than TAI as Unix time&#x27;s foundation is a fatal mistake. As Unix time cannot represent leap seconds, all the previous advantages break down - we had to freeze or advance the Unix time itself to compensate for that limitation. If there&#x27;s a TAI-based &quot;new Unix time&quot;, the leap second handling can be simplified a lot. The underlying time is always correct regardless of leap seconds. Sure, a missed leap second notification makes all civilian time faster or slower by 1 second, but the situation is the same for UTC if there&#x27;s no time synchronization.')
