I definitely agree with you on the design and information fronts and will be working a lot on this piece.<p>For functionality piece I would love more feedback. Do you have any suggestions of features you would love to see? I have received very positive feedback from musicians, but am only just starting to get listeners using the site!<p>I am also curious if you used the site on mobile or web. For now I&#x27;d say the experience is far superior on web!')
