Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607111706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25301003, text='&gt; One drawback you omitted is that you have to set it up and learn how to use it before you reach a point where it competes with other less sophisticated solutions.<p>I&#x27;ve not found this to be the case. org mode has an extremely shallow learning curve.<p>If your note taking flow is simple, it will be correspondingly simple in org mode.<p>Once you start adding sophistications to your workflow, you may find <i>some</i> tool that is easier to use than going through the trouble of configuring org mode, but only if that tool&#x27;s author shared a very similar mindset to you. I&#x27;ve not found this to be the case for my workflow. Even worse, if you decide you want to try some other workflow, that tool likely will not be as flexible and you&#x27;ll have to hunt for another tool. And possibly migrate all your notes to it.<p>If you use a <i>flexible</i> solution that lets you alter your workflow, you&#x27;ll find it will compare with org mode in terms of ease of use.<p>&gt; I think there&#x27;s also some kind of discoverability issue with org-mode features: I don&#x27;t really know which features should I look into to improve my setup further and have something really nice instead of a glorified markdown.<p>I mostly discover these by reading people&#x27;s blog posts on how they use org mode. Having said that, I tweak it very rarely, often with a few years in between any major tweak&#x2F;exploration.<p>&gt; One day I&#x27;ll just read the manual from start to finish and try to start properly from there, one day.<p>It&#x27;s a good idea, but don&#x27;t expect a massive productivity increase from it. Often you&#x27;ll read something and say &quot;That sounds cool, but I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d use it.&quot; I usually get more insights from other people posting how they used feature X than from reading about feature X in the manual.')
