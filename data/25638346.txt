Delusional disorder ala the DSM is defined by delusions per se but not hallucinations (not saying this is a &quot;real category&quot; as opposed to a coincidence of phenomena or lack thereof, but it is the diagnosis). So individuals who meet criteria for this seem very normal -- they&#x27;re lucid, coherent, and so forth -- until you get them on a certain topic.<p>With delusions of pregnancy it is that they are pregnant. They have tests that are negative from multiple places (over the counter, in the clinic etc.) and often a few friends, family, and partners have counseled them about it to no avail. The general explanation is that they&#x27;re all in on a conspiracy to thwart the pregnancy, because they&#x27;re jealous, or don&#x27;t trust their ability to be a parent, or whatever the case may be.<p>I&#x27;ve seen cases where the delusional pregnancy goes on for years. This is biologically implausible. Some individuals just sort of avoid this topic; others will assert that there have been multiple pregnancies, usually aborted by those who are trying to sabotage the pregnancy (e.g., secret medicines to induce abortion, etc.).<p>All mental illness is sad at some level (well, nearly all), but the delusions of pregnancy are as well. It&#x27;s clear someone desperately wants to be a mother, and genuinely believes people are aborting their pregnancy, or attempting to, or otherwise is unable to have the child.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could think of many other delusional examples involving significant formative events but outside of broad themes they&#x27;re often idiosyncratic.')
