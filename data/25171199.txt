How I got rich was I was born to middle class parents who sent me to a private high school that taught me to work hard, and despite going into heavy debt for college, didn’t die from starvation or homelessness because every time I hadn’t eaten for a couple days or my bank closed my account and rent check bounced, my mom or a friend would lend me money to survive, and eventually some bets paid off. Not spending helps, but the family and friends were the dominating factor.')
