Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611585214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25900853, text='No: I am not (in fact, I am really strange: I am a super famous person who has decided to have a single public phone number and email address that he gives to <i>everyone</i>). I think part of the problem here is that you seem to think leaning heavily into the anonymous communication scenario, but that isn&#x27;t how other people conceptualize wanting to not have their real phone number or email address given to random people: the real play is almost entirely about being pseudonymous, where you might have your name (or a &quot;well-known alias&quot;) and a photo of yourself attached to the account... but not a real phone number or email address (which tie your identity together to other systems). This use case is so common that even tech people whom I feel &quot;should know better&quot; opt for solutions like Apple or Facebook login rather than giving away their real email address to a random website!<p>So, first, to address this: it is frankly extremely rare to have a realistic attacker model that cares about eorher governments or a chosen large corporation having access to your chats, at least &quot;in the West&quot;. Like, seriously: sit down and list who you think falls into this category... this is a list which starts with &quot;political dissidents&quot; and continues into some really strange low-likelihood scenarios, as the entire premise surrounds a government or law enforcement agency subpoenaing your messages.<p>Most of the people I know who are in this category are simply people who <i>want to believe</i> they will one day be targeted by governments for being too dangerous. I can still motivate this software for people, based mostly on scenarios involving bad people getting jobs at large companies to access your information (this is a big issue with Facebook), but even those scenarios barely work against companies like Google (which have good internal information controls). I have gone into this in more detail before (with someone shilling Signal who hilariously ended up just admitting that Signal doesn&#x27;t work here as it is a &quot;privacy issue&quot;).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23440928" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23440928</a><p>The ironic thing is that, without <i>also</i> solving the untrusted contact problem, this set barely even includes political dissidents: I have tons of friends who do stuff like coordinate protests, and the #1 realistic concern is that the police--whom I also talk to a lot (I am an elected government official), and I know they do this--have managed to infiltrate their giant group chat and are just watching it all happen and writing down phone numbers. There is a big gap between anonymous and trusted, and it is where most use cases actually happen.<p>So, on the other side, pretty much every &quot;normal&quot; person constantly meets people with whom they want to communicate without giving away their real phone number &#x2F; email address. How do I know this? Because that&#x27;s what most people want to talk with the people whom they are casually dating. This is a big reason why everyone uses Snapchat for almost everything (and Instagram or TikTok for everything else): because it gives you a feeling of control over what people know about you.<p>Just earlier today I was watching someone on TikTok--in a video about dating communication--say &quot;using Snapchat as the only form of communication during the talking stage is <i>the move</i>: I&#x27;m not giving you my <i>phone number</i>... we just met! I would sooner give you a <i>urine sample</i>&quot; (this is an exact quote). The comments mostly agreed with everything she said (and she only had like three supposedly-&quot;unpopular&quot; opinions that were actually quite popular ;P); here are some of the strongest comments about the Snapchat mention.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.tiktok.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6921406816815451398.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.tiktok.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6921406816815451398.html</a><p>&gt; Yes! Snapchat! The only way they can’t use one type of social media to find you on other social media<p>&gt; Yes about the snap vs phone number. I started online dating after a 15 yr relationship and I got a phone stalker that texts me with new numbers<p>&gt; yeah idk why ppl hate on snap. I prefer it bc they don&#x27;t have my last name or extra info on me and I can see more what they look like beyond a few pix<p>Were there people who disagreed with her? Sure, but they were all either advocating for refusing to leave the dating app in the first place (which is itself a trusted provider protecting you from untrustable contacts), were advocating for a different but similar solutions (that still don&#x27;t involve giving out your phone number), or seriously said &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I am just old or what&quot;... to which I will note &quot;yes, you are apparently quite old :&#x2F;&quot;.<p>&gt; Snapchat is dead there are apps like Text+ that create burner numbers...that’s what I use<p>&gt; Yeah you’re right about this but the Snapchat thing is enlightening as somebody who was an adult before Snapchat lol')
