Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=[24707720], score=None, time=1602074644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707344, text='&quot;Just a regular guy&quot; is still assumed to have distinct personality, interests, hobbies and skills. &quot;Just a mom&quot; is not. That is not the statement on what actual moms are like, but what people imagine when they hear the phrase.<p>Like in the original comment this started with &quot;girls just want to be mothers&quot; is contrasted with being a person who has any out of parenting interests at all.<p>And for all the talk about &quot;noble&quot;, no interests at all leaves you with nothing to think about, nothing to talk about, nothing to do, nothing to be happy about when children are not present. Nothing to be proud about once the kids are not toddlers anymore and their achievements are their own.')
