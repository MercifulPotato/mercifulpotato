No gamer cares about heat, PS4 was a jet engine yet it sold like hotcakes.<p>The question is why would a gamer, a hardcore one, not the one that wants to play Candy Crush, spend multiple hundred of dollars and find space in his living room when he already has a PS5 and the new Xbox? What could possibly entice him?<p>And which game studio would port their game to a console that uses their own API, own OS, and is basically incompatible to anything else? Yes, the PlayStation is its own thing as well, but it&#x27;s the bloody PlayStation, not some big unknown.<p>I spend a ton of money on what is basically my hobby, video games, and right now, nothing would make me buy an Apple console. Absolutely nothing. Who cares about performance, show me the game lineup first.<p>EDIT: One quick word about the Switch: the reason it exists among giants like Sony and Microsoft is because it has Nintendo exclusives, and Nintendo is a common household name and has always been associated with &quot;games for the whole family&quot;. Well, the form factor too. But again, the emphasis is on exclusives and game lineup.')
