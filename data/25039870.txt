I&#x27;ve been following Cyrus, Philip, and Kumail for a while, and been really impressed by their work.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Gather and a few of the other competitors out there - out of all of them Gather nails the UX the most. It&#x27;s pretty simple, but it&#x27;s also powerful. Most of the other competitors in this space have thrown together a sloppy &quot;business&quot; platform, but Gather just feels much more accessible, friendly, and easy to use.')
