You took much longer and much fancier wording to say what could be said in a few lines, without losing any meaning. Verbosity for the sake of verbosity.<p>This is what I mean. Using long names compounds not only on itself. It compounds onto the entire codebase. Unless you blackbox the code, make it 100% bug free and it doesn&#x27;t require changes for future features, that code will be read. Reading takes a lot of time, but worse: it takes far longer for someone to process a much larger cognitive load. This is especially dangerous in huge codebases that need to be changed on a regular basis, usually retorted by &quot;it takes time to get in the swing of things&quot;.<p>We have better things to do in life. Respect the person who will read the code. Be concise.')
