I&#x27;m not in that target group but the product seems good and the landing page is so clean and clear. One note on the Pricing page, the [Show yearly plans] button wasn&#x27;t obviously a toggle to me so was hesitant to click it for another page load. Turned out to be a toggle switch for current view. Maybe consider showing it as a &#x27;slider&#x27; toggle?')
