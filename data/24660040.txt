Item(by='CaptArmchair', descendants=None, kids=[24660650], score=None, time=1601624104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24658876, text='&gt; I talked to many maintainers in the first few years of it&#x27;s existence who truly benefited from the contributions.<p>For sure, but the Hacktoberfest promotional website treats this as a second order effect, instead of the primary goal it really should be.<p>The primary motivation for participants is the free t-shirt, because that&#x27;s the incentive that&#x27;s being pushed. What is not promoted - and should be promoted - is the impact of contributing: making a change for the better, the social good, taking a step towards connecting with new people, learning opportunities, making a mark in the world with your name on, etc.<p>The problem OSS faces is not just finding enough contributors. It&#x27;s finding contributors who are intrinsically motivated to actively engage with a project.<p>And so, the current campaign inadvertently targets loads of people who don&#x27;t really care for the code or the projects themselves: they just want the exclusive t-shirt as a trapping and not much more.<p>I&#x27;m sure the campaign still attracts contributors who genuinely want to submit a good PR (I sure am going to do an effort). But frankly, if the campaign ends up devolving into a frenzy for t-shirts, it&#x27;s hard not to feel demoralized: that&#x27;s not the spirit of the campaign, and that&#x27;s quite likely not what DO originally intended, right?')
