My late stage startup stock in another startp grew 2x in 12 months, which is also an absolutely crazy rate of return. If only I could pick winners like that all the time.<p>Not all startups are winners, but this is basically what every investing forum tells you about retirement savings: you want higher risk investments (stocks) earlier in life when you have time for your investment to recover from a crash, and you want safer investments when you are older.<p>So what if you want cash when you&#x27;re close to retirement? Go work for a big public tech company and sell your stock every vesting period.')
