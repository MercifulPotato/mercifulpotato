I switched to MacOS during Tiger, and the experience has gotten steadily worse since then, double if you&#x27;re not into the iOS-ification of their desktop OS.  I know iOS is driving their +1T market cap, but come <i>on</i>.<p>So I pick up a beefy Windows machine for gaming and video editing. And Windows is just awful. They&#x27;re trying, but it&#x27;s <i>still</i> an inconsistent mess, UX all over the place depending on what first-party program you&#x27;re in. I get some folks like it, but it isn&#x27;t for me.<p>But I&#x27;ve also got various Linux distros running, and Gnome is   actually really usable. And honestly I don&#x27;t have a lot of bugs or missing functionality -- new Lenovo laptop, Arch or Ubuntu, everything just works out of the box, including external displays that don&#x27;t even require an adapter because I have HDMI out! But there are definitely bugs and issues, and there&#x27;s <i>no</i> software support. I&#x27;m lucky I get MS Teams so I can work with my coworkers, but I don&#x27;t get virtual backgrounds. I&#x27;d <i>kill</i> for some first-class support from vendors, but I know why it doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Moral of this story: apparently, as we approach the year of the Common Era Two Thousand Twenty One, desktop computing is still a mess.')
