There were Big LISP people on PDP-10s and Little People using UNIX. Having used both, I found it easier to get things done in Franz LISP than in the rather overbuilt Common LISP systems of the era. Franz LISP was set up like a UNIX program - you edited text files in some editor, then ran the compiler and run time system. Common LISP systems of the era were one giant application you never left. This is also part of the source of the EMACS&#x2F;vi split. Big LISP people used EMACS, and Little People used vi.')
