We talk about how bad the current situation is across the board. The processes are all pretty similar and generally bad at treating the people being vetted well, and tracking them throughout the process to close the loop. I attribute this to a top down problem across the industry where these teams are led by the same recruiting leads who jump around companies so processes are standardized and they&#x27;ve convinced everyone that the current process works well. I&#x27;ve tried to have conversations diving into the details and looking at ways to improve this experience and recruiters are not interested, as they think the only think that matters are some specific metrics that they are measured on. I can&#x27;t blame individual recruiters for this, since it&#x27;s how they are measured, I can blame recruiting senior leadership who has allowed this to happen and continues to be ok with it.')
