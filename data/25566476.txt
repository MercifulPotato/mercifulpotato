I hope they are curious and come back to source to learn how they have been mislead – intentionally or otherwise.<p>&gt;I hope that Greg Mankiw changes his “Skeptic’s guide” when he presents it in the coming days at a major conference in the US.<p>&gt;He has clearly misrepresented our work in significant ways and that should not be tolerated in an academic milieu.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bilbo.economicoutlook.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=43900" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bilbo.economicoutlook.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=43900</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bilbo.economicoutlook.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=43961" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bilbo.economicoutlook.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=43961</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bilbo.economicoutlook.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=43997" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bilbo.economicoutlook.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=43997</a>')
