Some of these were possible even before HTTP&#x2F;2 Push existed.<p>If you already have fancy middleware to predict the best assets to push for different users, perhaps you can extend the middleware to inject the dirty tricks as well.<p>- data: URLs inlined into the initial page HTML<p>- compression to remove the entropy of base64 encoding<p>- ordinary inlining, e.g. for JavaScript, CSS and (less likely) HTML fragments<p>- Cache and ServiceWorker to allow future pages to use the inlined assets without fetching them a second time<p>Combine the above with heuristics like you were using for HTTP&#x2F;2 Push to decide what to inline for each user.  So a user with an If-None-Match Etag or a cookie has probably seen the page before, and a user with neither probably has not.<p>As others have pointed out, &lt;link&gt; preloads are also available.  Although those don&#x27;t kick in until the first data from the initial page has been received, if there is enough page data, one extra RTT needn&#x27;t matter for some resources, especially JavaScript that is only needed once the user starts interacting with the page, items far below the fold, and other page resources if it&#x27;s a single-page application.')
