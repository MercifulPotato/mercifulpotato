A Gnome dev showed up and told everyone this is not needed because the problem at hand is solved with dbus in Gnome. Everyone told him that the extension is already widely adopted (not to mention dbus was Linux only at the time and solving this with dbus would cut off any BSD users from that feature). The response was basically &#x27;the only adoption that matters is Gnome adoption and Gnome did not adopt this, so it&#x27;s irrelevant&#x27;.')
