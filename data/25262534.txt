Map gets it wrong at least for one language. If not the entire Dravidian category.<p>I suspect that classification would piss off all the four southern states of India. This is close to linguistic blasphemy for that region.<p>On a diff note: no mention of Georgian(Caucasus) and Basque languages. They developed independently than any of the other languages of the world.')
