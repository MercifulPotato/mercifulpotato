It makes sense for compatibility reasons (your code may only be tested on one version of Chrome and later ones may break it), but most apps don’t need that. Using the built in Chrome copy in a “frameless” mode would be nice.<p>JavaScript (through TypeScript) is a very nice programming language, but it gets a horrible rap from bad or lazy programmers. It’s kind of like how PHP 5 was. Everyone still rags on JS for things that ES6 fixed just like how people rag on PHP for things that have been fixed since PHP 7.')
