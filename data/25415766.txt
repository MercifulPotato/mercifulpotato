Perhaps we are using multi-tenant to describe slightly different things.<p>A multi-tenant setup avoids the pain of maintaining multiple version in production. All multi-tenant customers are on the same server &amp; db versions by design, so any future upgrades can be done for all customers at once. Also, upgrades are expected to be painless (at least in theory) since there is never more than one version in production.<p>Customers with special needs are hosted as single tenant and of course you get to charge them extra $$$ for this special treatment.')
