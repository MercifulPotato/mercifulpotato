It was developed in 25 days from first virus DNA synthesis. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modernatx.com&#x2F;modernas-work-potential-vaccine-against-covid-19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modernatx.com&#x2F;modernas-work-potential-vaccine-ag...</a> but it&#x27;s going to take maybe a year to be approved by the FDA. All phase 3 trials are looking good. I personally would take this vaccine right now but the FDA will not allow me to do this.<p>How is the FDA&#x27;s reputation going to hold up when they approve all these vaccines a year or more after they were created and cost the lives of millions and trillions of dollars?<p>The FDA had no pandemic vaccine approval protocol which could have speed up the process. They could have used challenge trials with young healthy people. I can think of a pre approved process for mRNA vaccines where the delivery methods are approved but the only thing that changes is the mRNA payload.<p>I blame the government healthcare organizations for a lot of the impact from covid-19. First, they were anti-mask during the first major increase in the virus and now they are being overly cautious in approval of vaccines. They are way off on their cost - benefit math.')
