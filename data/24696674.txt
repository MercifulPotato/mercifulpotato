I am thinking more of a new virus detector that can be used in vitro or outside that can automatically adapt to viral changes (mutations). Let&#x27;s call it &quot;molecular morphing&quot; virus detector, if you will (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Principles-of-the-molecular-morphing-approach-Molecular-morphing-generates-a-path-in_fig3_261032438" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Principles-of-the-molecu...</a>).<p>For #2, sweet! Thanks for sharing! The new virus detection platform could be used to create personalized vaccines, yes.<p>For #2.1, oh. Software can definitively do things faster like try million iterations until they find the &quot;perfect match&quot; or strong bond (from my previous comments) for viral spike proteins.<p>For #2.2, also agree, I am more interested in the detection&#x2F;screening side of things for diseases in general.')
