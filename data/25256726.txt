That&#x27;s a second order effect at best.<p><i>address the systemic issues, which might impact your net worth</i><p>That&#x27;s a hell of an unsupported stretch. But it is typical of the mindset: &quot;rich people just want to stay rich, that&#x27;s all want, net worth, blah, blah, blah.&quot; Look, there have to plenty of tech people like me that wonder why I&#x27;m not being taxed more to address these issues. I&#x27;ve got money to burn, take some of it, Local Government. (Uh, oh, here comes the jackass to suggest I voluntarily write a check to the government coffers; thanks, that was helpful.) Park some of those assumptions about people that fell into money, and maybe some solutions can be implemented together. Otherwise the alternative is to listen to the sound of our own voices.')
