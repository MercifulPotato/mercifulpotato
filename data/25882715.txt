Actual leftist terrorist <i>organisations</i>, unlike the &quot;antifa&quot; (lol, America...).<p>Edit: I think OP meant, it&#x27;s not unlikely, <i>if</i> there was a real left terrorist organization, they would align with SWP, but the SWP is <i>not the terrorist organisation</i>. Same as with Antifa, for that matter. That&#x27;s what people mean when they say Antifa is an idea... seriously, it hurts it&#x27;s necessary to even say this.')
