I expect it will top out around $400k-$500k before falling down to ~$65k in 2022.... only to start running again and easily exceed $1M per coin in 2025.<p>This may seem absurd to make such predictions,but it isn&#x27;t a guess like yours are, it’s based on modeling bitcoins fundamentals. You guess is informed by, presumably, the stock market. That’s reasonable  if you think if bitcoin like a stock.  But it isn&#x27;t.<p>Bitcoin is a new form of money, —the hardest money ever— that is going through the technology adoption lifecycle.<p>Most people really don’t understand bitcoin, yet adoption grows in fits and spurts, and that’s why we get these huge bubbles in the bull markets and huge pullbacks in the bear market.<p>But in 2026 if I’m right will you still be predicting inly %10 annual growth in bitcoin price?
