The path indicates each site through which mail will be routed, starting at the left and going towards the right. Mixing ! with @ is not considered good. That is, use:<p>uunet!ucbvax.berkeley.edu.edu!smith<p>not:<p>uunet!smith@ucbvax.berkeley.edu.edu&quot;<p>In other words because UUCP was dialup and long distance expensive, email was routed through specific known hosts, which is why sometimes people ended up with long bangpathed addresses.')
