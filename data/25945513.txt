You&#x27;re projecting a positive spin on this when I literally said &quot;this is actively hurting investors&quot;<p>-<p>Something insane is happening, claims of market manipulation are flying, Congress is saying they&#x27;re going to investigate, what started as a meme is suddenly picking up more daily volume than SPY...<p>There&#x27;s going to be a bloodbath, and their options are:<p>- do absolutely nothing, watch people get slaughtered.
