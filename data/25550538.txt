For known and suspected confounding variables you can use blocking on top of that. For example you can randomly split each age group in half in order to ensure the intervention and control arms have similar age distributions.<p>Blinding and placebo control helps prevent behavior modification from the intervention itself, but it&#x27;s possible that people who receive the saline placebos behave differently, since they don&#x27;t get any side effects. I believe AstraZeneca&#x27;s trial in the US uses a saline placebo, presumably because an active placebo might accidentally also work against the virus.')
