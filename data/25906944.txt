I mainly used the airpods as a mic for Zoom calls so the content is voice either way. The quality degradation is drastic enough that I don&#x27;t even try to use the Airpods on my computer for voice calls anymore. However, they&#x27;re still my go-to for use with my phone and it doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as bad there. Yes, they have different modes for mic on vs mic off but on my phone they are <i>usable</i>.')
