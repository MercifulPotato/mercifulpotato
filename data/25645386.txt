Item(by='mikelevins', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609854216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25626886, text='So I tried this with R:<p>1. Define an S4 class.<p>2. Create an instance of the S4 class (let&#x27;s call it A).<p>3. Redefine the S4 class.<p>4. Examine A.<p>R complains that there&#x27;s an error in slot(object, what), because A is missing a slot from the (re)definition of the S4 class.<p>This is promising, in that R realizes that A is supposed to be an instance of the redefined class. So far, so good.<p>What I would expect to see next is that either R automatically reinitializes A with the new slot (it has exactly as much information about the new slot as it had about the old ones when I created A), or, if it wants intervention from me, it presents an interactive session I can use to tell it how to initialize the new slots.<p>It didn&#x27;t do that, but maybe I just don&#x27;t have the options configured properly to make it happen.<p>Smalltalk and Common Lisp meet my expectations: they notice that A is an instance of a redefined class and they either reinitialize the instance automatically, or they present an interactive session that I can use to tell them how to do it.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that R has this feature and I&#x27;m just missing it because I&#x27;m a noob.')
