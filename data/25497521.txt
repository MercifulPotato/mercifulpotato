I&#x27;ve been a Nikon user for 3 decades myself.  Canon has always historically had better lenses and Nikon has had better bodies but lots of third party support.  I do have some Nikon primes, but most of my lenses are made in Japan by Sigma or made in Japan or Germany by Zeiss.  I have had exactly two lenses made outside of Japan by Nikon from their consumer line, and both were subpar optically compared to the Japanese made lenses in their pro line-up.  It&#x27;s such a stark difference, in fact, that I have taken to mostly buying used consumer lenses from the earlier auto-focus days (1973 - 1998) because these lenses are on par with the optical clarity of current generation pro lenses if cleaned professionally.  You can usually acquire one for a significant cost reduction compared to buying a new pro lense and have it cleaned locally by the camera shop and get something really quite good.  That&#x27;s how I acquired my 600mm, 500mm, 400mm, and 300mm telephotos for birding, as well as my 50mm f&#x2F;1.2 prime for general use.<p>Seems if I add any lenses to my collection I&#x27;ll be buying used or new from Sigma&#x2F;Zeiss.  I saw the shift happening already and had mostly already been doing that.  I will say the new PF series pro lenses with fresnel lens elements are really great though.  While I still have my older 300mm, I also got the new pro series 300mm prime from Nikon as it&#x27;s significantly smaller and lighter weight, doesn&#x27;t even require a lens foot and can be shot hand-held if you have a steady grip.  I suppose I should start budgeting to acquire the 500mm version of the PF lens before they move production out of Japan as I find it unlikely I&#x27;d buy anything else that&#x27;s Nikon branded for lenses.  For shorter focal length stuff Zeiss is far far superior.')
