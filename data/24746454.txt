I think it is different than free software where folks are contributing as a community and can sometimes thrive as a business by providing support. IMO free &quot;hard&quot; content such as this is destroying a lot of small content creators that used to earn a living but are now forced to abandon their professions. I fear it will create a bimodal distribution - top notch large houses (Getty Images, for e.g.) and free distribution sites (Unsplash) and nothing in the middle.<p>I fear a society that is used to free stuff all the time.')
