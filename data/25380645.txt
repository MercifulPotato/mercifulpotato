A program running on a single server isn&#x27;t similar here (you could accidentally create a DoS attack though).<p>Typical cloud function use is some event gets triggered like a user sign up, the function executes, then it halts. The above isn&#x27;t a standard use case and is so incredibly risky this approach shouldn&#x27;t be attempted in my opinion.')
