Their Graviton2 chip runs between 1-1.8W&#x2F;core [0] and has 64 cores. Their TDP is half that of the EPYC and Xeon equivalents. At data center scale that&#x27;s a huge savings in power. They could also increase density in the same power envelope.<p>If Amazon were to move significant amounts of their non-EC2 server hardware to Graviton they can see cost savings with no end-user impact. If an AWS product doesn&#x27;t run client code there&#x27;s no real requirement to run it on x86.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;15578&#x2F;cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;15578&#x2F;cloud-clash-amazon-grav...</a>')
