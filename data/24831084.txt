I have been on the pump&#x2F;CGM (MM670G) for just under three years.  I was on pills for 2-3 years, at first the metformin and glimiperide were enough and I got my A1C back to the sixes; but I maxed those out and it was climing agian. Then maxed out Onglyza, then maxed out Invokana at which point I switched to the pens.<p>The problem with the pens is that I would need 25 units of basal insulin and 25 units of the rapid acting insulin.  You can&#x27;t &quot;undo&quot; your 24 hour basal injection; so if you don&#x27;t eat enough carbs or exercise too much you can go low.  The pens are also not nearly as precise as a pump for delivering the rapid insulin.<p>After my A1C climbed back, my endocrinologist prescribed the pump and CGM closed loop system.  We did a blood test that showed I was T1, which was enough for United Healthcare to pay for the CGM and not just the pump.')
