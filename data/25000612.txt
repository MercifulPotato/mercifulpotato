See &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jerrybrito&#x2F;status&#x2F;1314254265251225600" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jerrybrito&#x2F;status&#x2F;1314254265251225600</a>&gt;, where it&#x27;s reported:<p><i>&gt; In most cases, the Department [of Justice] does not liquidate seized or forfeited AECs, as doing so allows them to re-enter the stream of commerce for potential future criminal use.</i><p>So note: if the DoJ auctions these off, it&#x27;s &quot;good for Bitcoin&quot;, as it provides further confirmation they consider them a normal form of property whose legal uses outweight any illegal uses.<p>On the other hand, if they refuse to auction them off, it&#x27;s <i>also</i> &quot;good for Bitcoin&quot;, as it permanently reduces the circulating supply, making all other units incrementally more dear.')
