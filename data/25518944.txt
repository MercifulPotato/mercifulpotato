Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608739248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25518752, text='My wife and I recently made the decision to totally remove YT Kids from the kids&#x27; iPads (which they mainly use for long car rides). It&#x27;s completely toxic in a way I didn&#x27;t even realize it would be, and the videos aimed at the kids are the lowest quality garbage imaginable.<p>I had thought maybe YouTube Kids wouldn&#x27;t be as bad as the InstaSnapFaceTwit, but it&#x27;s just as bad. The content recommendations are so bad that frequently videos will be in Russian or Korean (our native language is English). And YouTube Kids encourages kids to have zero attention span by showing all sorts of recommendations all the time. My youngest can hardly get through a single ten minute YouTube video without clicking something else.<p>Our new rule is they can have some occasional screen time (though playing with real toys and playing outside are preferred), but when we do have screen time, we can do activities that are creative or imaginative or strategic (like games or making art or writing). If we&#x27;re using tech as a consumption box, reading is best, followed by good movies that we can watch together.<p>I&#x27;m honestly happy now that YouTube Kids has been banned from my house. I&#x27;d commend every parent to do the same.')
