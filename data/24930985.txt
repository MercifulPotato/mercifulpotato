Item(by='dkarl', descendants=None, kids=[24931224], score=None, time=1603982607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929584, text='&quot;Welp&quot; might be a regional dialect, but it is used a bit differently from &quot;well,&quot; evoking resignation about something disappointing that can&#x27;t be changed.  &quot;Welp, with the gas out, we can&#x27;t use the range and oven to cook the nice dinner we planned, so we&#x27;ll heat something up in the microwave instead.&quot;  People who say &quot;welp&quot; also say &quot;well,&quot; so it makes sense to distinguish them in writing.  That&#x27;s not to say &quot;welp&quot; is appropriate diction for every kind of writing and every kind of audience, but where it&#x27;s appropriate, it&#x27;s appropriate.<p>&quot;Whelp&quot; has a standard English meaning, but I suppose you might see it used to mean &quot;welp&quot; as well.  I dislike this spelling, because in my experience, people who pronounce &quot;whale&quot; and &quot;wail&quot; differently also pronounce &quot;whelp&quot; (the dog one) and &quot;welp&quot; (resignation) differently, but I don&#x27;t know if that is universally true.')
