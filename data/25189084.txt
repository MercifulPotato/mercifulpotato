So then you get benchmarks comparing it to 14nm Intel processors based on 5-year-old technology, and 10nm Intel processors with half as many cores as the M1 because Intel&#x27;s 10nm yields are so bad they can&#x27;t make high core count processors, and Zen 2 laptops when the Zen 3 ones it will actually be competing with in a couple months are expected to be 20% faster. And Zen 3 desktops, which the M1 loses to badly on multi-threaded tests, but is competitive with on single threaded tests -- as expected, since modern mobile processors actually have single-thread performance which is competitive with desktops in general, but manages to amaze anyone who doesn&#x27;t know that.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say they&#x27;ve done a bad job. Making something which is even <i>competitive</i> with modern x86-64 processors is no small feat. But the fanboys are making it out to be some kind of coup when it does, in practice, appear to be a marginal improvement. And we still don&#x27;t even have many real-world benchmarks because most of the real-world applications haven&#x27;t actually been ported yet.')
