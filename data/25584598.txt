Assuming customers&#x2F;inputs are always lined up, you&#x27;ll process a similar number every hour and the quality is somewhat static.<p>In cloud infrastructure, I notice quality of work is highly variable. Some engineers will bandaid everything to get the task done. It&#x27;s easy to do that.<p>Other engineers create solutions taking into account the current technical environment, business requirements and future concerns. I don&#x27;t think we should hide from this fact. Software engineering as a profession becomes worth more the more we realize there&#x27;s a difference in quality and quantity dependent on the engineer&#x27;s abilities.')
