It&#x27;s an extremely cancerous experience on mobile, they actively work on making the ui as inconvenient as possible. Every iteration of reddits ui is even slower than the last one, which I consider quite an achievement considering how slow it was months ago already.<p>Reddit also has the &quot;gold&quot; thing going which is probably not what you&#x27;d want for your own forum, where some users are more equal than others because they paid money to an entity you have a questionable relationship with.<p>Unrelated: Google&#x27;s results decline in quality because google values engagement more than quality. It&#x27;s been like this for years. When you are the monopoly, you can easily trade quality for more money without negative consequences.')
