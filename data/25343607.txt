I think MS&#x27;s goal for GitHub is to be a &quot;loss leader&quot; to keep developer mindshare. They lost <i>a lot</i> of developer mindshare to linux, open source, etc. in the migration to the web and cloud.<p>Providing GitHub and CI for free to open source&#x2F;students is a great way to keep developer mindshare. Make sure it&#x27;s nicely integrate into Azure cloud for deployment and devops and you have a streamlined pipeline of leading large numbers of developers to your cloud platform.')
