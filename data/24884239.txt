I disagree with plenty of what he said here and there, but he&#x27;s not some total lunatic, he&#x27;s actually very intelligent.  I&#x27;d say a lot of things he talked about actually deserve a seat at the &quot;adults table&quot; for a change, it&#x27;s starting to seem like the &quot;adults&quot; have had a bit too much to drink and are acting irresponsibly.')
