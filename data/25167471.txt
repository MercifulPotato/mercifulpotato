My X1 Extreme Gen1 with 64GB and a family member&#x27;s P51 (or p53 dont remember) with 128 GB definitely do not. I bought the cheapest RAM tier and put in my own modules as soon as I got it.<p>Except for ultrabooks where the sacrifice makes sense, I don&#x27;t expect Thinkpads with soldered RAM to ever become standard. That&#x27;s just not their target market - their warranties even allow CPU repasting.')
