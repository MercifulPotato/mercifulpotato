Item(by='semi-extrinsic', descendants=None, kids=[25935896], score=None, time=1611780562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926927, text='The claim that the ultra-rich are taxed at a higher rate than anyone else in society is provably false. In 2015 the US Congress Joint Committee on Taxation calculated [1, p. 7] that implementing the &quot;Buffet rule&quot; would bring in an additional $7 billion in tax revenue per year.<p>In a nutshell the Buffet rule is making sure that the ultra-rich are taxed at no less than the same rate as a middle income family, namely 30%.<p>In total the changes proposed in [1] would bring a net increase in revenue on taxation of individuals north of $50 bn per year, even while reducing the tax burden on low- and middle-income families.<p>And no, the US does not have actual socialized healthcare. When you have parents sitting with a sick child in their car in the parking lot outside the hospital, waiting as long ad possible before they go to in, in case the kid gets better so they can avoid racking up a huge hospital bill, you&#x27;ve screwed something up real bad. This doesn&#x27;t happen ever in any country in Europe, period.<p>&gt;  Paid personal leave? You want to pay people to not work because of some imaginary zeroes?<p>I don&#x27;t understand at all the reference to imaginary zeroes here. My point is that government subsidised paid parental leave is a measure that significantly increases the quality of life of low- and middle-income families in the critical period of time when their children are very small. It&#x27;s a no-brainer even financially, the ROI from increased productivity in the workforce over the span of a decade is strongly positive. If you let a woman take parental leave and take care of her babies for a couple of years total in her 30s, versus working her to the bone in that period, I guarantee you she will have a net increase in her productive labor output during her lifespan.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jct.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jcx-36-14&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jct.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jcx-36-14&#x2F;</a>')
