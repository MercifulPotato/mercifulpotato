Which in and of itself would be an insane growth trajectory to achieve at this scale.<p>But at the end of those same 6 years you would reasonably need to model some significant efficiency improvements.<p>Tesla has predicted their battery costs, for example, will be reduced by 50% in that time frame.<p>There will also be significant efficiencies achieved elsewhere in the manufacturing line beyond just their tech roadmap for structural batteries, but certainly I would assume not quite a full <i>halving</i> of the cost to produce the entire car.')
