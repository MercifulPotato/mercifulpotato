The final project was for each of us to make Wikipedia pages describing some important topic that wasn&#x27;t covered yet. I made one on the university&#x27;s nuclear reactor which had just been shut down. I dug through many linear feet of archived info, scanning photos and collecting various info for the page. It was super rewarding. I was hooked.<p>Variously since then I have gone deep into some fringe but important-to-some topic and found hard-to-find sources. I&#x27;ve found it effective to collect and present this information in Wikipedia pages.<p>Like a few months ago I made the page for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment [1], the world&#x27;s first molten salt-fueled nuclear reactor, built and operated with intent to make nuclear-powered long-range aircraft. I&#x27;m pretty proud of the page, and go back to use it somewhat regularly. Having the platform of Wikipedia inspires me to go the slight extra mile in personal research in a way that can be used by everyone.<p>Thanks Wikipedia, for existing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment</a>')
