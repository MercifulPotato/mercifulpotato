I think each person can achieve great things, but only some will be able to achieve great things in the realm of theoretical physics. And some will achieve mediocrity with less effort. I don&#x27;t know if that warrants a pedestal or not since one mans greatness very well could be another mans mediocrity.<p>I want to say that it would be nice if society would recognize and be comfortable with the innate differences in all of us, since we are all just humans with spectrum for all things related to our biology, but I don&#x27;t know what that society would end up looking like.')
