Uncertainty can be and is built into models based on the quality and frequency of state polls, and 538&#x27;s model certainly takes the polling errors of 2016 into account by adding more uncertainty to states and pollsters which got 2016 wrong.<p>That said, most of the shifts in state results were within the margin of polling error, which is why Silver&#x27;s model gave Trump a much higher chance of winning than any other major models did.')
