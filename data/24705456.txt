I have a full motorcycle licence and no problem with a bike, but as soon as I step up to a car I just can&#x27;t estimate distances or space. (This cost a lot of fence posts on farms and could be deadly on a highway).<p>Navigation I&#x27;m mostly fine, because I can remember lists reasonably well. To get from my house to my sisters is left, left, right, left (straight for 30km), right, left, right, left. Do I turn the final right at the 4th or 5th street down the road? I never remember until I&#x27;m in the intersection and recognise it.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a memory palace, and it only works for me with a space I know really well and a limited range. For example the 10 rooms of my house I can use, I&#x27;ve lived here for 15 years. I couldn&#x27;t use different parts of the rooms because I just can&#x27;t visualise them. But since I can generally remember short lists pretty easily I don&#x27;t find a 10 room memory palace helpful.<p>Lastly I, like most people I suspect, remember songs and rhyme better. Want to know the periodic table? I can sing it at you (Thanks ASAPScience).<p>The worst part about aphantasia is trying to explain it to someone who hasn&#x27;t got it. I can recognise my favourite places instantly in a picture, but ask me to describe them and be preparted for a cubist impression. Heaven help anyone who is relying on me to complete a police identikit...')
