If I had the skillset that it sounds like you do, I might be inclined to hose on bare metal. But I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know what a 1U dual socket server is.<p>It would take me some time to build these skills, and to match the agility that the cloud offers. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth my time, and probably not the author&#x27;s time, either.')
