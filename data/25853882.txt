According to press release by Arla (the largest Swedish milk products company by far) some years ago (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arla.se&#x2F;om-arla&#x2F;nyheter-press&#x2F;2015&#x2F;pressrelease&#x2F;arla-dubblar-maengden-d-vitamin-i-mjoelken-1254843&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arla.se&#x2F;om-arla&#x2F;nyheter-press&#x2F;2015&#x2F;pressrelease&#x2F;...</a>, in Swedish), there was a national study done by the government organization that controls foodstuffs which identified a large risk for vitamin D deficiency in general population, perhaps despite fish eating and law was passed making enrichment mandatory. So they are enriching.<p>Edit: removed sidenote about cooperation between government and private companies, since it seems that there is an actual law governing this stuff. Almost all milk, milk-like and fatty products (such as margarine), except cheese, must be enriched (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kontrollwiki.livsmedelsverket.se&#x2F;artikel&#x2F;448&#x2F;livsmedel-som-maste-berikas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kontrollwiki.livsmedelsverket.se&#x2F;artikel&#x2F;448&#x2F;livsmed...</a>, in Swedish).<p>Edit++: Apparently data from the national study about food habits is available via an API which I think is super cute, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livsmedelsverket.se&#x2F;om-oss&#x2F;psidata&#x2F;apimatvanor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livsmedelsverket.se&#x2F;om-oss&#x2F;psidata&#x2F;apimatvanor</a> (also in Swedish, but hey, Google Translate is your friend)')
