You need to take a lot of decisions.<p>Moreover, those decisions which seemed good (to you...or the one that dictates those strong opinions) at the time you took it, are not valid just months or years down the road. So you will need to reevaluate them periodically.<p>Moreover, even if you are happy with your decisions, you might be forced to take them again, because the library went out of fashion, unmaintained, or the developers just stop responding to issues and ignore you completely. This is already happening to a project I work with where the react-router developers just went to build their own nextjs competitor and stopped responding to issues. Same with styled-jsx from the same next.js team, not even themselves seem to be using it anymore.<p>This never happened to me using Rails. True some gem might go away, but at least it usually is some helper thing and not the core of my f*ng application. Same experience with django and many other uncool stacks.<p>So, yes. React is amazing if you are facebook, google, amazon, building a side project or just working for your own resume. It is not good for the average business. It is not good for enterprise applications.<p>In my own experience, at least.')
