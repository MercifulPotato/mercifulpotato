Timing restrictions and calorie restrictions are two different stressors on the body, and all else being equal stress is positively correlated with neurodegenerative effects. It might as well be only isocaloric intermittent fasting is indicative of BDNF increase and hippocampal neurogenesis.<p>- Fasting time is a very specific slice of the circadian rhythm; between 15:00â€“07:00, so this study is only skipping dinner and not breakfast. This is important because body has different stress responses early in the morning (we wake up with higher cortisol levels) and our insulin mechanism also reacts differently to food deprivation based on time of the day.<p>- Limits of animal models already mentioned, and I think it is particularly compounded around the concerns around timing and bioeconomics of growing brain regions. Mice and humans have similar encephalization quotients, but size of neural cells are constant between both, so is the cost to create or upkeep them. Same concern goes for the number of days of energy each animals bodies can store. So the underlying calculus to make new brain cells or not might be vastly different. For example maybe humans need to undergo a much longer (e.g. multiday) fast before this effect kicks in.')
