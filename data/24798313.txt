If humans went extinct we have no idea how long it would take for another intelligent species to arise on earth, could be millions or billions of years, or never happen at all for all we know.<p>On the other hand there are no examples of any human regieme lasting for more than a couple 1000 years max.<p>Also a despotic regieme could still do good engineering and science and colonize other planets and whatnot, making it less likely we go extinct, also it would be likely to fragment into different societies at that point.')
