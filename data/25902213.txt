The point with building a database enterprise is to build something that is sufficiently general purpose - not just optimised for one workload even if that workload is valuable for one company. In that world, there is only open source. Even snowflake, which is cited as a good example of a new proprietary, is built on FoundationDB and is like a hosted version with <i>lots</i> of bells and whistles.  We are building a DB (TerminusDB) and started as prop and we couldnâ€™t see a way to make it work without going open source.')
