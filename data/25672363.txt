It was a protest against the election of the President itself - against all evidence, all facts, and all testimony from just about every official except the President, who egged this on.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to see heads rolling, but I was shocked at how delicately they were handled - cops even let them through barricades.<p>Contrast this with left-wing protesters and their treatment by cops, and you see a much different picture, of people walking or sitting down getting pepper sprayed, or 70-something men getting shoved to the ground in a public square by a team of armored officers.<p>There are a number of reasons to be angry at this stunt, and a number of conclusions to draw from it. First thing is first, if we had any kind of collective conscience, Trump would be impeached today.')
