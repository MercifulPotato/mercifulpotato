I won&#x27;t try to summarize in a sentence; it&#x27;s a complicated topic and she covers it well.<p>For a detailed analysis of the current troubles, I suggest the book &quot;Ages of Discord&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;show&#x2F;1796955228" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;show&#x2F;1796955228</a>).
