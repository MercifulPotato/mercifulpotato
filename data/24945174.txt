Its just what it says - shortcuts. I tried getting shortcuts to do things for me and all it did was give me more notifications. Sucks.<p>For example, when I get to work, i wanted it to log the time, all it did was showed me a notification that I had to click (!) before it did the task I asked it to. Silly.<p>One feature I&#x27;m using more these days is the &quot;share&quot; popup. For example, one shortcut [1] i hacked up accepts an amazon url, extracts the product id and opens that product on camelcamelcamel. So now I can be in the amazon app, hit the share button, click this shortcut and see the product price history. pretty useful. Without this shortcut it was pretty annoying. CamelCamelCamel folks could use something like this to increase their usage :)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icloud.com&#x2F;shortcuts&#x2F;fc526325b9eb4ebf99bce8da65ac4e3c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icloud.com&#x2F;shortcuts&#x2F;fc526325b9eb4ebf99bce8da65a...</a>')
