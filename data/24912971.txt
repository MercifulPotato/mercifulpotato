You might notice however shipping terminals don&#x27;t have a lot retail shoppers.<p>There&#x27;s in fact a whole <i>chain</i> of facilities that handle supplies to retail outlets. Every gallon of diesel fuel burned to get things from those shipping terminals to a retailer emits about 20 pounds of CO2. Increasing the number of things per vehicle reduces each thing&#x27;s CO2 contribution. It also decreases the shipping cost of each thing as it goes through that <i>chain of supply</i>.<p>The shipping for each iPhone might be a small portion of its retail price but it needs to be paid up front and in aggregate. So millions of dollars in shipping costs getting even a 30% savings is still millions of dollars in savings.<p>Besides the retail cost of goods is unrelated to the BOM and transaction costs. It&#x27;s what the market will bear. Savings in BOM costs or transport just go into the retailer or manufacturer&#x27;s pocket as profit.')
