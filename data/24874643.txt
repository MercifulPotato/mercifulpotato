For example, do they get bothered by regular guitar over microtonal ones? (those weird guitars w&#x2F; extra mini-frets)[1]<p>I&#x27;m really fascinated by our ability to perceive relative pitch even without training. See, for example, how &quot;detuning&quot; by a few cents in lo-fi hip hop provides a very distinct feel to the genre, compared to playing the same tune in standard equal temperament tuning.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thatericalper.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;maxresdefault-159.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thatericalper.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;max...</a>')
