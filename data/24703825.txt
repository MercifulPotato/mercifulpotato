People will lose their jobs, families will lose out. In either case, the employer is the actual baddie being forced to either raise the wage to an appropriate level or send the employee home (and then attempt to backfill the job with the local market, probably not easy). So if you are for an increased minimum wage, legislation at least in part intended to eliminate abusive employment practices across the low end labor market, (and I assume you are because of your rightful concern for the families) wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to praise this legislation and focus your frustration on the inevitable corporations that are taking advantage of foreign labor? Or is there more nuance to this?')
