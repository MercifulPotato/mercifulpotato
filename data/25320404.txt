Funny thing, Fick&#x27;s story about a picture in a news outlet changes: sometimes it&#x27;s his girlfriend, and sometimes it&#x27;s his mom who tells him something along the lines of &quot;Thank god you&#x27;re not involved in that&quot; about a photograph of Marines going on a mission to Pakistan.<p>&gt;<i>how the individuals within those groups behave and why that are very pertinent to tech and management in general.</i><p>One anecdote is Staff Sergeant Eric Kocher talking about Gunnery Sgt. Ray &#x27;Casey Kasem&#x27; Griego being a nightmare when he was helping &quot;Encino Man&quot;, but great when his job was <i>training</i> them for the second tour. This is a reminder that a person in different contexts can act differently and have different &quot;performances&quot;. Similar to &quot;Wartime Churchill vs. Peacetime PM Churchill&quot;')
