We played a game as kids where if you looked at one of us with the ok sign, the one doing the sign got to punch you in the arm. It was joke.<p>Even though this new origin is a bit of the tail wagging the dog (it started as a joke on 4chan), the ok sign has taken on the meaning of a white power sign in certain situations.<p>Unfortunately, people have trawled old pics and attacked people for using normal hand gestures. Context and nuance appears to be completely lost on many.')
