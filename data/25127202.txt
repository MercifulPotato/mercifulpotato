I didn&#x27;t want to send them an email for something this trivial and I was just leaving the comment in case anyone from Anandtech stumbled upon it. The typo is not really an issue and my comment was not a criticism. I was just trying to be helpful but I can see how that can appear to be when my comment is just about the typo and not the content of the post.')
