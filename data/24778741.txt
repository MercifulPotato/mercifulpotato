Corals can be easily &quot;fragged&quot; (branches broken off and glued onto other rocks can grow - this is often done in the reef aquarium trade) and moved to areas that are not as warm. Under natural circumstances this kind of migration would take a while but perhaps humans can help speed up the migration into waters with more favorable temps.')
