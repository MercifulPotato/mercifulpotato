Item(by='JumpCrisscross', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611901906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954370, text='&gt; <i>Robinhood is small player that could never have planned for this type of event</i><p>I disagree. It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that securities and cash from unsettled trades were unavailable to customers. The modern abstraction of frictionless trading is just that--an abstraction.<p>Adding &quot;free&quot; to the mix removes a balancing factor. (Less cash coming in at t=0.) Becoming a clearing broker removes another, though it adds control. There are vendors selling off-the-shelf systems to calculate clearing margin requirements and risks real time. I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing if Robinhood used one of those, or if they tried to roll their own.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s not an excusable pain point to push to one&#x27;s customers. Particularly not retail customers. Particularly not unsophisticated retail customers. These are complicated systems, far more than most professionals fully grasp. A simple back-up plan, like a fallback introducing broker arrangement, would have avoided this whole mess.')
