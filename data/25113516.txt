Item(by='klmr', descendants=None, kids=[25115512], score=None, time=1605543923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25112344, text='“Reprogramming” actually has a specific meaning in genetics, and it’s <i>not</i> editing of DNA, it’s the editing of (transient, i.e. epigenetic) DNA <i>modifications</i>. It’s definitely true that this is <i>not</i> what RNA vaccines are doing.<p>But I guess the parent comment was using “reprogramming our bodies into vaccine factories” as a hand-waving description rather than a technically precise term. And that description is then roughly correct: with RNA vaccines, it is correct to say that our bodies are being triggered to produce the actual “vaccine” themselves;  namely (at least in one type of RNA vaccine), the body’s cells are translating the injected mRNA to produce antigens, which is what a conventional vaccine contains, and which, in turn, produces an immune response.')
