My day job doesn&#x27;t deal with &quot;Google-like&quot; traffic (maybe one Google product&#x27;s worth of traffic), but we also only have about 10 servers to ingest what we do get. My current side project I expect to deal with even fewer orders of magnitude but I also want to be able to run it on a single server to keep costs and operational overhead low.')
