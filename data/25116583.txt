I am a long time subscriber because I like the social aspects of Strava but I almost never use the premium features. The basic free plan does almost all of what I need.<p>The most annoying part of Strava&#x27;s changes this year was removing access to segment leaderboards from their API (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dcrainmaker.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;strava-cuts-off-leaderboard-for-free-users-reduces-3rd-party-apps-for-all-and-more.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dcrainmaker.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;strava-cuts-off-leaderbo...</a>). This broke a bunch of 3rd party apps, including some that seem completely innocuous. For instance, I used an app that displayed a list of segments for mountain passes in the Alps and the number of times each had been crossed so far this year. The goal of this was to help people figure out when it was possible to cross a pass (which might be well before the road is officially open), but now that&#x27;s broken.')
