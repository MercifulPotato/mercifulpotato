A 480TB Backblaze 6.0 pod costs $22,000 to build. Dropbox has 90% of their data stored on their custom systems, and they have &#x27;multi-exabytes&#x27; of data.<p>Let&#x27;s just say they have 5 exabytes. A petabyte costs roughly $50,000 using this scenario, and 5,000 petabytes would then cost $250 million dollars alone.<p>If they had 20 exabytes...they would have a billion dollars in storage hardware alone?<p>This doesn&#x27;t include power, networking, labor, none of that.')
