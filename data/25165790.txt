You said being anti-LGBT is morally wrong.  Here&#x27;s some guy in Teheran.  He&#x27;s not a moral relativist.  He&#x27;s very much a moral absolutist, and he&#x27;s dead certain that LGBT itself is what&#x27;s morally wrong.<p>Why do we believe you instead of the other guy?  Why does <i>Facebook</i> believe you instead of the other guy?  Because Facebook is in the US instead of Iran?<p>Here&#x27;s my position:  I am a moral absolutist.  Still, I don&#x27;t want a moral absolutist deciding what Facebook thinks is appropriate content.  There&#x27;s too many systems of absolute morality, and too many of them differ from my own in important ways - ways that I&#x27;d like to be able to talk about.')
