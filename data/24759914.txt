Normally the weights are done in $, for example one extra healthy life year is $50k. It&#x27;s the concept of QALY. Does it take more than $50k of damage to the economy to save a life? If 200k old people died with average 20 years to live, the cost is $200bn. Thankfully with exponential pandemics the actions are pretty obvious, I.e. killing 200k people makes sense, 1m doesn&#x27;t and 10k would be too expensive economically.')
