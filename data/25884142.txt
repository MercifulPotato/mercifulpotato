I am currently working on a side-project that allows students find affordable housing and roommates. International students are on a F1 status(which is the student visa for US). However, there are many restrictions that prevents international students from making money on their idea or grabbing good opportunities such as raising funds. Is there any international students who built a startup in the US? What can international students do about this? Please let me know your thoughts.')
