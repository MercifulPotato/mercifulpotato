I have to push back often on Friday to say &quot;I&#x27;m out&quot;, he&#x27;s always cool with it but he tends to forget what day it is so I have to remind him. It&#x27;s on reason I stick with the well paid consultant by the hour work. I like programming but it&#x27;s not my sole reason for existence. The only reason I still like it is that I survived a burn out job and realized that I didn&#x27;t hate programming, I just hated not having a life because I was working such long hours and had no energy for other things.')
