But suppose you were plopped down in ancient times before Aristotle invented formal logic. Would you have invented it yourself because it&#x27;s so obvious and a no-brainer and you&#x27;re so practical? Well, if you think so, then why did it take so long for mankind to do so? Aristotle is practically yesterday, in geological terms.')
