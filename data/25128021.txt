Item(by='andrewmcwatters', descendants=None, kids=[25128342], score=None, time=1605639456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127938, text='&gt; It&#x27;s just that no one bothered to expose it.<p>Almost the entire quick start guide is about using Rust. So you know, if I want to embed it, how do I do it?<p>If I need a view offscreen rendered to a framebuffer, how do I get it? Can I blit? If so, how? How do I pass events to the browser abstraction?<p>Servo talks about none of these things and leaves it up to you, but 110% emphasizes everything possible about Rust.<p>I don&#x27;t care about Rust, I care about embedding web technologies. So how do I do it? They don&#x27;t explain.<p>The front page prioritizes these things, in this order:<p><pre><code>    * How to use Rust\n    * How to contribute to Servo\n    * Servo&#x27;s blog\n    * How Servo is governed\n    * How to donate to Servo\n    * Contacting those involved with Servo\n    * Downloading Servo\n</code></pre>\nNone of those things point me in the direction of how to embed it.<p>Maybe they should spent more time catering to the people they claim to be providing the software for and less to the Rust crowd.')
