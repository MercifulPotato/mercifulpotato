I basically wanted to create google trends but for content people create&#x2F;write.\nThe page is very raw but i think it&#x27;s the content that matters :D.<p>I think google trends is great but this is the other side of the coin, also google will never allow any deeper look into their data.<p>I have some more ideas for more features, but will see how it goes.<p>enjoy, feedback is welcome.')
