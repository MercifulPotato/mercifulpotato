The <i>Resident Evil 2</i> port from Angel Studios was impressive reuse of the console&#x27;s RSP, but I don&#x27;t know if those sort of experiences were what Nintendo was going for or what it&#x27;s audiences wanted anyway. I do think the PlayStation with it&#x27;s CD-ROM drive did better with a broadening audience especially as the NES crowd grew older though.')
