Still seems very strange to me that they allowed this situation to happen for such a huge (in traffic) website.<p>Not sure how exactly the service worker was broken (I didn&#x27;t have the curiosity to check in devtools, and now it&#x27;s gone), but I had this exact same issue and saw other people having it right here on HN, and this was the way to solve it too.')
