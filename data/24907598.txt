A problem here is they don&#x27;t differentiate from comsol.<p>That being said, he&#x2F;she&#x2F;it&#x2F;their would do a lot better focusing on a particular niche.  For example thermal desktop is used for widely in the space industry for space simulations because it is the only off the shelf solver which does radiative heat transfer and controls well. But all the thermal analysts I know the UI is basically garbage and it solves their models way to slowly. They also have huge issues with their simulations taking for every so if you hammered on that problem for a while you would probably end up with a customer base.')
