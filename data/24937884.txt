It&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s serious<p>I have read it, and it&#x27;s not good. It is an example of the worst aspects of pearl-clutching, can-you-imagine-what-this-means, ignore-the-actual-facts tendencies of the media today. He starts from a ludicrous premise and then doubles down on the ramifications, all without actually addressing the question of whether or not it is true.<p>You certainly don&#x27;t question the suspect if you already know their answer, and you have no proof to the contrary. At least not unless you are ready to cede to that suspect the moral high ground.<p>Firstly, Glenn focuses on the fact this &quot;de facto union of media outlets, Silicon Valley giants and the intelligence community&quot; is not asking the Bidens questions about the nature of these allegations. The simple answer is that &quot;union&quot; is focusing on questions of merit, unrelated to this fictional reality Greenwald is portraying.<p>If one were to accept the premise that these are questions of merit, then one must believe the predicates - that Hunter Biden would send a personal computer to be fixed, thousands of kilometers from his home, by a coincidently pro-Republican repairman, who is coincidently blind but is coincidently also able to confirm that it was Hunter Biden who dropped this computer off, and that coincidently this repairman has a speed dial to Rudolph Giuliani, and that the proof of all of this was coincidently stolen by the USPS. By now the product of all these low-probability events is vanishingly small.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t care if a journalist has a paranoid delusion as long as they are doing good writing and due diligence, and Glenn&#x27;s story has both.<p>Due diligence would require Mr Greenwald to start with a neutral or cynical mindset. Who is to gain from this story, what is required for this to be true.<p>It is telling that Mr Greenwald thinks there is the cabal against him, that the famously apolitical intelligence services are taking a stand contrary to his. And the thing it might tell him is this: start from the facts, and follow from there.')
