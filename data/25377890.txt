Even if that contract could be unwinded to allow for an acquisition, the question is what IP could DDG offer to Apple that it can not build with reasonable effort (if not already build as part of Apple&#x27;s search engine efforts)? There is also brand value, but a search engine with Apple&#x27;s name on it would already have it. I&#x27;d argue that a much likelier acquisition is the one of Microsoft acquiring DDG.')
