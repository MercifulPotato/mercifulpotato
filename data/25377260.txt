Nothing is more important than cash flow. A runway is not a development budget -- it is a loan in the form of opportunity cost. Always look for income at all times. And never, ever borrow money for the project.<p>Regarding people, keep active contacts with other people. Do not shelter behind closed doors. The world moves quickly, and if your team withdraws into its own bubble for 12 months, when you emerge you will find the world to be very different.<p>Regarding tech, Unity will work better than Unreal because a small team needs to reduce technical overhead as much as possible.<p>Regarding gameplay, favor simplicity over complexity.<p>Regarding art, maintain a cohesive and unique style across all elements of design.<p>Regarding players, start looking for them from day 1.
