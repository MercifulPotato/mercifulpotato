There are certain classes of mistakes they do not make (indicating they have internalised many more rules than may be apparent), and they can understand sentences which have grammar that they do not produce themselves (meaning that the level of output is not a good indication of their language development).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=a7Un06tDOn0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=a7Un06tDOn0</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zmghbKNiI1k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zmghbKNiI1k</a>')
