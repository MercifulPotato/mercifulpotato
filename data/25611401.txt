If we cease to die then humanity is doomed. Young people need to invent a world of their own at each new generation; if old people (and therefore, old ideas, old prejudices) never die then there is no room for new.<p>Additionally, from a practical perspective it becomes indefensible to make new people (have kids) because where will they all go?<p>Not dying is the most selfish attitude imaginable; that level of selfishness is irrational.')
