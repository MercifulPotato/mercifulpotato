In my undergrad, we had learned about Transistors, TTL, flip-flops etc., but as individual building blocks. Your reply paints a very good picture about what can go wrong they play together. Is there a book that you would recommend to learn more about this ?<p>Also, Honestly, I thought reflections would be negligible when we are dealing with mA and 0-5V ranges. But your reply makes me think that there is more to it<p>Finally, thank you for your reply. I gonna come back to this answer in the future when I have a lab setup that is more than a solder and some screwdrivers :)')
