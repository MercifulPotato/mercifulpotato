Pfizer, Moderna and AZ got to the approval gate first, but they started their lines months in advance knowing they needed to start delivering orders.  I assume that&#x27;s true of everywhere.<p>The simple truth is that there is no plausible way to deliver all the vaccines that nations want to inject right now, and given the size of the project there&#x27;s no way that distribution is going to be fair.  That is true at local levels (c.f. media stories of US boutique clinics getting vaccine before urban hospitals) and global ones the same.<p>The US and UK have an advantage of larger existing pharma industries and so have a head start, leading to grief in Europe like the linked article.  But... this wasn&#x27;t really resolvable.  If it wasn&#x27;t the EU it would have been someone else unexpectedly behind.  No one&#x27;s going to be happy until we&#x27;re all vaccinated.')
