After years of getting yelled at for small mistakes with little or no feedback, insane hours (weekend&#x2F;holiday meetings and deadlines) and zero growth I had completely lost any confidence. I became depressed, overweight, afraid to talk to people, etc.<p>I&#x27;m weary of drugs, even caffeine, but microdosing helped me regain some sense of direction and a bit of confidence to move forward. It is like simulated annealing as gwern describes. My mind was trapped in a minima and I needed a chemical shock to move it elsewhere.<p>As a side-note, I finished my PhD and am job hunting. Now, I&#x27;m exponentially happier around friends and family. I&#x27;m still rebuilding my confidence but I&#x27;ve stopped microdosing because I don&#x27;t feel the need.')
