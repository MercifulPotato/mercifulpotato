But if, for their next hire, they&#x27;re passing over every introverted thinker, person raised being told not to interrupt, etc.-- then I&#x27;d suspect they&#x27;d probably be missing out on a ton of skills that their org will probably need, and also personally missing out on traits&#x2F;practices&#x2F;behaviors&#x2F;etc. from which they&#x27;d grow by being influenced and meeting halfway.  (I think this is tricky example, since the whiteboard jam session is a very appealing idea to a lot of us, and we might ascribe mythical power to it.  But I think it&#x27;s also easy to imagine some big design insight coming in a pause in the excitement, from someone who was standing slightly back from the flailing markers, and who hadn&#x27;t said much in the first hour of battle.  Or even from someone who went off to work something out on the computer, that was being missed in the endorphin rush of whiteboard eureka.)')
