The difference is they are Amazon&#x27;s engineers, not your engineers.<p>My IT team is not going to break something on the most important day of the month for my business. Sometimes even when I want to do something mundane on the network, it&#x27;s &quot;eh, let&#x27;s wait until not (insert key date here), just in case&quot;. Amazon does not care what day is important to my business, they&#x27;re Amazon and they do what they want.<p>You are going to pay IT staff either way, if it&#x27;s your own hires (or an MSP), or you are paying via AWS fees. If you&#x27;re going to pay for IT, why wouldn&#x27;t you pay for IT that takes orders from you and cares about your business?<p>The other thing is, Amazon&#x27;s maintenance and upgrades is based around Amazon&#x27;s need to remain competitive and turn a profit, and to support businesses other than yours which may have larger needs. (The rollout of a new feature that causes an outage for you might not have any benefit to you anyways.)<p>Similarly, a single patched Exchange server running on a single VM on a VM host with a UPS backup on it is generally speaking, more reliable and has better uptime than Office 365. Hilariously, Office 365 also costs a lot more.')
