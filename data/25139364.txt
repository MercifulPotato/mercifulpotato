Perhaps have a thermal power plant work in tandem with an iron battery system.<p>Say a 20 MW solar plant, works for 6 months to generate powdered iron. Then start the 10 MW companion thermal plant, burn the iron powder instead of coal, generate electricity as a base load plant. Meanwhile the rust ash from the thermal plant is the new fodder for the solar plant.<p>I can see that the overall cyclic efficiency can be lower than existing plants, but definitely carbon neutral.')
