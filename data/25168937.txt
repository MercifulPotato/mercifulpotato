There are valid reasons for this, and it&#x27;s totally fine.<p>- Other people prefer working at home, and this is also completely fine and understandable.<p>- People other than yourself who experience challenges with either one of these arrangements are not idiots and the things they talk about are genuine issues that they experience, which are unlikely to be effectively solved by suggestions like &quot;you are doing it wrong&quot; or &quot;get a new job&quot;.<p>- Not everybody out there is in the same situation as you with regards to living arrangements, family commitments and so on. Solutions that seem obvious and easy to you are unattainable for others.<p>My hope at least is that the experiences we&#x27;ve all had over the past year will help to make work more flexible and inclusive, so that we can take all of the above into account. In particular, is seems inevitable that companies should stop adopting an inflexible &quot;no remote work&quot; policy and instead make it easier for people to work from anywhere.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some new and creative approaches â€“ like companies using their newfound remote-friendliness to make it feasible to spin up small branch offices in co-working spaces, so that workers&#x27; commutes can be reduced but they still get an office environment if it&#x27;s helpful for them.')
