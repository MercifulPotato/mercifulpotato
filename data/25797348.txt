It&#x27;s hard for anyone to argue that the CTF scene does not reflect the &quot;real world&quot; when it is producing solid work like unpublished virtual machine escapes. And even better, the work is shared in high quality writeups.<p>Secondly, this plus other vulnerabilities found in VirtualBox emphasises that off-the-shelf hypervisors cannot be considered to create a security boundary. Every serious nationstate possess weaponised exploits to break out of VirtualBox, VMware etc. KVM and Xen have a smaller attack surface and are known to have a better isolation model, but I&#x27;m sure there are still plenty of exploits given enough resources. Perhaps this is obvious to some, but some people really do think that VirtualBox VMs act like a sandbox, which is only true if your adversary is rather unsophisticated.<p>For a writeup from the same CTF, but focussing on networking and cryptography instead involving an exploit in a Chinese anti-censorship proxy tunnel, please see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cryptohack.org&#x2F;cracking-chinese-proxy-realworldctf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cryptohack.org&#x2F;cracking-chinese-proxy-realworld...</a>')
