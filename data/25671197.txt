It is not even that the outgoing president very deliberately provoked the attack, as well as a much wider opposition to the democratic process. The biggest problem is that the president was actively supported, in his provocation, by more than a few US senators, along with elected officials of several states (some of whom are plausible presidential candidates themselves.)<p>There is little doubt that if any of the extra-legal or simply bogus attempts to overthrow the election had succeeded, these senators, and most likely the republican  party as a whole, would have been happy to go along with that act, in what would, in reality, have been a coup d&#x27;Ã©tat.<p>Even if the supreme court put a stop to it - which is not a certainty - much damage would have been done.')
