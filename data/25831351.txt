But some of the things will last and last. The square frame will last forever unless it gets a really big impact. This is important because holding square is the only way you are going to get accuracy. I have no idea how people do this with a self assembled frame.<p>The main spindle might have issues with bearings but you should get a lot of life out of one. Ours run 16 hours a day and last 10 years plus. As a hobbyist even if you buy one with 95% of its spindle life left you are not likely to wear it out.<p>Keep the machine greased and it will last. A good machine will come with a service manual and tell you how often to grease each part. Most will have an auto greaser that will do most for you. Just have to keep it topped up.<p>All parts are easily replaced. Except the electronics and the computer but if you are wanting to build your own you&#x27;re replacing them anyway so it&#x27;s not an issue.<p>Vacuum pumps need regular servicing and replacement Blades every now and again but again hobbyist use they will last a long time just keep the filters clean. \nThey are almost always 3 phase so that might be an issue.<p>They have AC servo controllers that you would have to interface with and normally have a can bus for all the peripherals I don&#x27;t think it would be too much to get all of that going.')
