Item(by='ioctrl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607153708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311802, text='&gt; &quot;It says her paper was approved, she submitted, and then a reviewer had a complaint&quot;<p>It&#x27;s confusing because there are two approval processes happening in parallel, but my read is this:<p>She submitted the paper for internal review one day before the conference deadline. The paper was approved by the conference and she submitted it, and later it was rejected internally.<p>I&#x27;ve had papers rejected during internal review. It sucks. It&#x27;s very frustrating. But I never thought to fire off an angry email blaming the rejection on my employer&#x27;s institutional racism, and I never thought to threaten my resignation if the identity of the reviewer wasn&#x27;t revealed to me.<p>There is a lot of discussion about &quot;the paper that got her fired,&quot; but I&#x27;d guess it was these actions that got her fired.')
