There were lots of reasons why things changed and institutionalization fell out of favor (and not just in the US, but across the West). For example, right now, in most states, you couldn&#x27;t forcibly institutionalize, say, a schizophrenic homeless individual legally, even if the request came from the individual&#x27;s family. And if you try, municipal and state governments, bolstered by activists and rights organizations will fight you.')
