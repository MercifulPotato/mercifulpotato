To give you an example for movies. I&#x27;ve watched some of the movies which are top rated by experts. Frequently I&#x27;ve found that I just don&#x27;t like them. Too artsy. You know what they say about specialists: they know more and more about less and less until they know everything about nothing. At some point specialists basically turn into aliens. Their tastes stop intersecting with those of the average J. Doe.<p>In many cases you just want a brain-dead solution to a problem because you&#x27;re using your neurons for something else. And one of the safest brain-dead solutions is to go with a brand you already trust. Another one is to go with the crowd. Apple is kind of both.<p>And I say this as someone that generally avoids Apple products :-)')
