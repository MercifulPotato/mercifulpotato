Of course, it’s an enumeration fallacy—there’s no way of knowing whether those Tweets accurately represent the candidate’s followers or not. That said, journalists are happy to find real life followers of candidates&#x2F;etc with abhorrent views, but I suppose Twitter makes it easier to create the desired spin.')
