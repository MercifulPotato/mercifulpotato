There used to be ads in the newspaper classifieds.

Having a delivery company insert themselves into the process means they make accept orders where they don&#x27;t have enough drivers, have to transport it too far from the restaurant to the customer (many&#x2F;most restaurants have limits on delivery area for time&#x2F;quality), etc.<p>So this seems completely different because the delivery companies are inserting themselves into the process as though they were endorsed by the restaurant.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;archives&#x2F;jm&#x2F;criminal-resource-manual-1854-copyright-infringement-first-sale-doctrine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;archives&#x2F;jm&#x2F;criminal-resource-manual...</a>')
