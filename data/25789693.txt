No links to introductory materials either, I might add.<p>Those would be fairly trivial changes to the website landing page, but they could drastically reduce the steepness of the on-ramp.<p>By contrast, if I visit python.org, there is a clear funnel leading me to alternative development environments, beginner tutorials, etc.')
