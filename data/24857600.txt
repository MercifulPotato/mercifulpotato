Aside from Developer Edition there&#x27;s an Unbranded Firefox you can get from Mozilla in English only which will allow it. Or you can compile it yourself with the MOZ_REQUIRE_SIGNING flag disabled, which is not <i>too</i> hard. On Arch Linux it&#x27;s just download the firefox-nightly-hg AUR package and delete the MOZ_REQUIRE_SIGNING line, then makepkg -s.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-pwner224.neocities.org&#x2F;compiling-firefox&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-pwner224.neocities.org&#x2F;compiling-firefox&#x2F;index.h...</a><p>This also provides a good security benefit - for extensions that aren&#x27;t continually updated you can download them with the &quot;Extension source viewer&quot; extension and then change their ID in the manifest and manually sideload them to prevent them from auto updating and using invasive permissions - malicious buyouts by ad companies are not unheard of in both the Chrome and FF app stores.<p>And also important, you can tweak the extension code as desired. For example the Old Reddit Redirect extension, which automatically switches reddit.com to old.reddit.com also changes new.reddit.com to the old one, so if you ever want to actually visit the new design then you have to disable the addon. There&#x27;s no way to change this aside from editing the extension and then loading it unsigned.')
