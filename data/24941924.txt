Which happen to be:<p>- 4 weeks in length<p>- from Dawn to sunset<p>- No food or drinks including water<p>- Easier to control group, as you cant monitor 14 people through 4 weeks and make sure they don&#x27;t cheat. So the cheating is kept to the minimum because of the religious reasons.<p>I also assume, that those are men only. Women are not allowed to fast when on their period which happens to be once a month.')
