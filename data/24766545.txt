I re-wrote it in Perl and it completed in less than a minute (and it wasn&#x27;t even optimized because I was a non-CS newbie who was just learning Perl). I even setup a cronjob to compare the output from both and email to the concerned folks. It was never adopted because I was new and Perl was considered &quot;too-risky&quot;.')
