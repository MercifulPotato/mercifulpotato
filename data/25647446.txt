This is the coolest WASM demo I&#x27;ve seen since the first Emscripten release. Moving WASM execution from a compile-time choice to a runtime choice is pretty amazing. I need to noodle on the implications of the portability benefits.<p>&gt; The tradeoff is only some performance, there is no security risk. CheerpX used standard WebAssembly&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;HTML5, there is truly no difference between this and any other Web page you might visit.<p>I understand that the security model is more like a webpage than a local binary. What I don&#x27;t understand is:<p>(1) what is the relative difficulty of escaping a full, local VM vs a local browser sandbox vs microVM container? That is, if you want to run an untrusted x86 binary locally, is CheerpX + browser sandbox really as safe as VirtualBox or firecracker? I suspect there&#x27;s a speed&#x2F;security tradeoff happening somewhere.<p>(2) how complete is the set of operating system APIs available to an x86 running in WASM via CheerpX vs running that same application locally? That is, what local functionality might I sacrifice to use the browser?<p>(3) what is the nature and magnitude of the performance hit? Obviously you have to load the binary over the network in this demo, but locally-hosted resources should be fine.')
