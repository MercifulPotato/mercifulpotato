SQLite databases (and b-trees in general) tend to compress well so the physical logging isn&#x27;t as bad as it sounds. You could also store a binary diff of the physical page which would shrink it even smaller.<p>One benefit to using physical logs is that you end up with a byte-for-byte copy of the original data so it makes it easy to validate that your recovery is correct. You&#x27;d need to iterate all the records in your database to validate a logical log.<p>However, all that being said, Litestream runs as a separate daemon process so it actually doesn&#x27;t have access to the SQL commands from the application.')
