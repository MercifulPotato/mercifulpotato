(I don&#x27;t use Word...)<p>Are you sure about that? At least since Word 95, it used what you could call a two-dimensional markup system - paragraphs and character formatting was separated, and character formatting could span over paragraph starts and ends.<p>for example, the formatting codes could say &quot;from character position 5 in paragraph one to character position 2 in paragraph two, set bold to opposite setting of whatever was in the stylesheet of the paragraph&quot;. that would be very hard to present in a WP-like &#x27;reveal codes&#x27; view (or in HTML, for that matter)')
