As I understand it, that&#x27;s not true; therefore that title was misleading and needed to be changed. (Site guideline on this: &quot;<i>Please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don&#x27;t editorialize.</i>&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>)<p>If there&#x27;s another title that is even less misleading, we can change it again. Btw, as a rule, the best way to complain about a bad title is to propose a better one. We can&#x27;t come up with all of them and often adopt community suggestions (a few examples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20ok%20title&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>).')
