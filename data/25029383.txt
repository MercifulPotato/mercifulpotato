It sounds like you&#x27;re projecting your own motivation on to others.<p>&gt; Employment at a FAANG company.<p>I want to get paid more, and work on hard&#x2F;interesting problems.<p>&gt; Name on a research paper<p>I want credit for my work of course (why would you go out of your way to <i>not</i> have your name on a paper you contributed to), but impressing others is not the reason I would be in research (again - solving interesting&#x2F;hard problems and hopefully making the world a little bit better would probably be the motivation if that was my career)<p>&gt; False degree<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want this.<p>&gt; Membership at an exclusive club<p>Presumably this exclusive club does something together that I&#x27;m interested in, or at least has members that I want to talk to about something I&#x27;m interested in. (Or maybe we just go out to eat socially, that sounds fun).<p>Of course signalling status is useful as a means to an end. (E.g. I would want to appear as a competent&#x2F;successful developer while applying for said FAANG job, or as a wealthy person while applying for a business loan). But I gain little joy from status in and of itself.')
