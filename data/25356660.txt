Do you know what fractal-marketing is?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='After some research, I have improved (theoretically) the &quot;pyramids pitfall&quot; of the multilevel-marketing business model, adding a blockchain layer with Smart Contracts to it.<p>I wanted to name this kind of business model as fractal-marketing because thanks to Smartcontracts, an important fraction of the ownership of the product could be projected from the top (of the tree) to the members in the down-line. Avoid sending a huge percentage of the profit from all the structure to a short number of participants on the top, might permit the distribution of more resources to the down line thanks to the limitation programmed in the Smart-contract. I think this tweak is enough to close the argument &quot;multilevel-marketing is a pyramid because the top of the structure will have always vantage in front new arrival&quot;.<p>Displace resources to the down-line could change the perception of ownership of the product, especially if we use also the Smart contracts to fund, in a transparent way, the several departments involved in the development of the product.<p>I have thought of this kind of marketing for a specific product. A product that can be personalized by each seller in the structure of the organization. So is intended that beneath the layer of personalization given from each member, all members can take advantage of the improvements given from the developers to the product.<p>This form of business and cash-flow reminded me of a fractal and that why I was about to &quot;coin&quot; the definition of fractal-marketing. But after a short research, I&#x27;ve found this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;warrendouglas.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;premium-pov&#x2F;fractal-marketing, but this is the only reference about what fractal-marketing is that I found. And that is very different from my business model because the creator of the campaign don&#x27;t share any profit with people who help to perpetuate the propagation of the product (worse than marketing-multilevel from my outlook).<p>Have you heard about the concept of fractal marketing before?')
