It&#x27;s more of a hope that you can burst something out and go to sleep rather than trying to maintain that speed.  In a lot of ways DRAM hasn&#x27;t gotten faster in decades when you look at how latency clocks nearly always increase at the same rate of interface speed increases.  And LPDDR is the niche where that shines the most, because it doesn&#x27;t have oodles of dies to interleave to hide that issue.')
