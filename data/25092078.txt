Google and friends have the right to lock you from use of their services, but when such services encroach in your use of other services unrelated to google, that you may even have paid for, should google have the right to blanket block? Is it technically difficult to exempt google signin from account locks?\n Can we maybe also legally claim that if a company hosts your identify, that it has no right to hold it hostage? I mean, if I’m arrested, my identity automatically erased.<p>Finally, is it not possible to require that all such block critical to someone’s data require some form of govt approved appeals process?<p>I’m asking these questions so maybe someone can enlighten me on why they were not yet attempted, or if they where, why they failed? Is it legal complexity? Cost? Lack of large scale support, as in, is it only a niche concern that only the HN crowd is complaining about?')
