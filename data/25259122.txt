Yes, an intrachain alignment of an artificial sequence does not by itself give any information about co-evolution, especially since you don&#x27;t know whether your protein is actually folding. To assess co-evolution you need a multiple sequence alignment between protein homologs containing correlated mutations.<p>&gt; I understand that similar sequences may fold similarly (although as length increases, I highly doubt it, but IDK).<p>As long as the sequence similarity is kept between those sequences, length is not an issue.<p>&gt; Co-evolution suggests that aligned sub-sequences are also proximal<p>What do you mean by &quot;proximal&quot;? Close in space, or similar in structure?')
