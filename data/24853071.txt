Basically, the required amount of context switches (since all drivers run in user mode) impacts performance and cache use in a negative way compared to monolithic kernels. Whether this is still a significant issue with modern designs, I don&#x27;t know, but that was the argument back in day (i.e. the early 90s when Linux came about).')
