The more stress that can be applied to as much of the body at one time as possible, the more effective and productive the adaptation will be.”<p>&gt; “There is simply no other exercise, and certainly no machine, that produces the level of central nervous system activity, improved balance and coordination, skeletal loading and bone density enhancement, muscular stimulation and growth, connective tissue stress and strength, psychological demand and toughness, and overall systemic conditioning than the correctly performed full squat.”<p>― Mark Rippetoe, Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training')
