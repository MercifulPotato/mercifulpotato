It&#x27;s not a good idea as far as performance is concerned, but for a home use nas that is primarily intended for streaming media, it&#x27;s not a major issue, and enables you to grow to your heart&#x27;s content (even if it is a bad idea, as I successfully proved growing from 4 disks to 16 over a few years, before respinning as multiple 6-disk arrays)')
