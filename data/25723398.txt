It&#x27;s frustrating how much the Reference Manuals leave to the imagination. A lot of the peripherals are similar or identical across families. Some have subtle differences, and some have large ones. I haven&#x27;t found a shortcut - seems you really need to bring up parallel reference manuals.<p>For example, the RTC periph is the same on most STM32 devices. Clocks vary significantly between families, as expected, but at their core, are just different combos of multipliers and internal oscillators, which you can break out by comparing clock trees. Things like I2C vary wildly between families, and sometimes within families.')
