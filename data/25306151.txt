The priority is on the article, not who submitted it. That does make it a bit of a lottery, and it&#x27;s winner-take-all. There are definitely better solutions possible, and it&#x27;s on my list to work on that someday. We&#x27;ll expand how karma is reward for submitting an article (HN could use some karma inflation anyhow) and find some way of grouping related submissions together.<p>In the meantime, the lottery does at least even out in the long run if you keep posting good submissions.')
