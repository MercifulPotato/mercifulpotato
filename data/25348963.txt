So if you don&#x27;t stimulate antigen production for a while, your body &quot;forgets&quot; and stops reacting to it. The problem is that that timetable for &quot;forgetting&quot; is different for everyoneâ€”some people get over it fast, some people it fades, and some people it never changes and no one yet seems to understand why.<p>The allergist that treated me is one of the docs on several of the principal studies about it, and he&#x27;s been seeing patients with this for the last 15-20 years. He said he&#x27;s seen people that would react when Wendy&#x27;s contaminated their fryer oil with a dropped hamburger, and one guy who&#x27;s a dairy farmer that wouldn&#x27;t react to his own cattle&#x27;s products but would react to anything else. It&#x27;s truly a weird reaction!')
