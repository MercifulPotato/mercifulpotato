How open source is it? I didn&#x27;t get a great feel from the beta page, but will you make it as easy as setting up a docker container or helm chart? I&#x27;d suggest that if you want to align incentives as best as possible, consider one of those new-fangled OSS licenses that has the most recent updates closed-source, then auto-open sourcing after a time period. That way you can give away a really nice, well-packaged version for free, not worry about Amazon, and still capture a big chunk of revenue from bigger clients who need the newest.<p>2. What are your plans&#x2F;thoughts on denormalization [0]? Liron is a friend of mine and we&#x27;ve had interesting discussions on this since way back, I&#x27;d encourage you all to reach out to him, and consider it strongly. The &quot;holy grail&quot; for many years now has been obvious: a subscribable DB engine that handles denormalization. I hope you guys achieve it.<p>Good luck!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lironshapira.medium.com&#x2F;data-denormalization-is-broken-7b697352f405" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lironshapira.medium.com&#x2F;data-denormalization-is-brok...</a>')
