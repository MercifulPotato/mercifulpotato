But Machine learning can also lead to regressions or edge cases. Here a fun rant about autocorrect in iOS 13:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smh.com.au&#x2F;technology&#x2F;iphone-autocorrect-driving-you-crazy-lately-you-re-not-alone-20191128-p53eus.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smh.com.au&#x2F;technology&#x2F;iphone-autocorrect-driving...</a><p>The good:<p>&gt; Machine learning has enabled the iPhone to correctly predict oddly spelt suburb names like Prahran and Woolloomooloo, to read the screen of an article and guess the surname or product I&#x27;m about to Google, and to suggest the spelling Bryan over Brian, because the former is a close friend.<p>The ugly:<p>&gt; For at least two years now, my iPhone has insisted on autocorrecting Sydney to SYDNEY, every single time I type the word. After weeks of troubleshooting that included resetting the keyboard and uninstalling any transit apps I thought might be to blame, I realized the culprit.\nI have a few hundred contacts on my phone from a previous employer, all with UNSW SYDNEY as their address.<p>What should happen here with a few _hundred_ entries of &quot;SYDNEY&quot;? I guess it should be unlearned after the user entered a few times (once? two times?) by hand &quot;Sydney&quot; and user entered text privileged over other text corpora (even dictionaries?). But then you have other problems again like autocorrect learning potentially wrong spelling idiosyncrasies of the user.')
