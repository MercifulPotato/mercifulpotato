In some cases it may even be counter productive since it ends up entrenching attitudes and positions.<p>We also need to be aware of how our own attitudes contribute to our own perceptions.  It is not much of a leap to believe that we will be fired for our political views if we think that others should be fired for their political views, even if those beliefs and thoughts do not reflect reality.<p>I am not going to claim that civility must be maintained at any cost, there are certainly historical instances when it could not be.  On the other hand, being proactive and civil will likely reap more positive change than the alternative.')
