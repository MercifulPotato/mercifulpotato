I once thought about abandoning the DEs world for a WM - I don&#x27;t use any of the DE-standard apps anyway. I didn&#x27;t even use the taskbar those days - I used a 3-rd party dock instead. Then somebody told me a DE isn&#x27;t just about their own [webkit-based] browser, editor, media player etc - it&#x27;s about tons of esential conveniences you take as granted and don&#x27;t even think about as apps - e.g. the WiFi applet.<p>Whatever, IceWM looks awkward (I can see special charm in it and won&#x27;t say &quot;ugly&quot; but many people would) anyway. It actually seems an example of what I mean under a rough parody to Windows. Whoever can&#x27;t see the difference between this[1] and what does real Windows (even Windows 98, let alone styled XP) look like is kind of blind.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IceWM#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Icewmstartmenu.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IceWM#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Icewmstartme...</a>')
