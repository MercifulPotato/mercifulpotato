Pass is <i>simple</i>.  It is literally a few hundred lines of clear, easy to read bash shell script (yeah, that&#x27;s a phrase I never thought I&#x27;d hear myself saying, ever).  It&#x27;s simple because it&#x27;s created by composing standard, simple off-the-shelf technologies (bash, gpg, git).  Compared to more monolithic solutions, it&#x27;s easy to compose those very same technologies in a different way.  That, in turn, makes it easy to adapt to new settings, and super resilient to new use cases like different sync technologies.<p>(and yes, I do appreciate that this is not a feature that everyone wants&#x2F;needs)')
