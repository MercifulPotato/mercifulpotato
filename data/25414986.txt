Seriously: the first public CCS charger outside a lab was almost a year later and only half the power.<p>It wasn’t until VW started thinking about the Taycan and eTron that anyone actually deployed CCS chargers with more than about 50 kW in California (while Tesla customers were enjoying 120-150 kW). And most of the of public DCFC before about 2017-2018 in the US were actually Chademo, not CCS (which is why there is a Chademo adapter for Teslas).<p>Up until a few years ago, people were saying that Tesla should adopt Chademo because it was a common standard and offered more power than CCS (at the time) and there were more public chargers. Today, there are still more cars on the road in North America that can use Chademo than CCS. CCS is not commonly used in either China or Japan.')
