The first one is pretty beautiful but it could use some material on the &quot;deeper&quot; side of things, particularly the connection with geometry and Noether&#x27;s theorem. As for the others, they&#x27;re just too &quot;russian&quot; - I like how oddly practical they are, but they&#x27;re just not structured properly - StatPhys in particular just doesn&#x27;t flow very well.<p>The typesetting is also a crime against humanity - they should be done similarly to the Feynman lectures, so typed up in LaTeX rather than whatever they are now')
