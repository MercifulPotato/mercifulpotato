He got a BA in CS, which is an impacted major you apply to after 2 years (super competitive). He went on to be a developer for Deloitte.<p>After a few years, he went to law school and started working at Wilson. He&#x27;s now a partner and I believe he worked on Aurora&#x27;s acquisition of Uber self-driving car IP.')
