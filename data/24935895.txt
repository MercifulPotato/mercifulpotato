The tools I found (both paid and free) were either clunky to use or didn&#x27;t have a good engine (block-level deduplication, adjustable compression, encryption, speed, etc).<p>Here is a quick benchmark I did comparing BlobBackup to Duplicacy, Duplicati, Arq, and QBackup a few days ago. The benchmark doesn&#x27;t cover all use cases (I&#x27;m going to try to do some to different storage destinations when I find time), but it&#x27;s a decent measure of backup engine efficiency and speed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blobbackup.com&#x2F;10_gb_benchmark.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blobbackup.com&#x2F;10_gb_benchmark.php</a><p>I also put quite a bit of thought into the UI so it&#x27;s much more usable (subjective I know but try the free version yourself) than the alternatives.')
