Hyperinflation isn&#x27;t the cause of Nazi Germany, please keep the Godwin goblins under the control.<p>2. Hyperinflation isn&#x27;t a natural result of regular inflation.  There have been <i>countless</i> governments that have engaged in deliberately inflationary policies.  Basically none of them resulted in a hyperinflation spiral.<p>3. Hyperinflation isn&#x27;t even caused by spending policies in the first place!  It is the result of a collapse in national revenue, forcing a government to print money to honor debts that it can&#x27;t otherwise pay.  This leads to a collapse in confidence in the currency, and more printing, thus the spiral.
