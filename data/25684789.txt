It can also lead to a sort of &quot;workout failure death spiral&quot; -- you start to fail at your interval, and your pedal stroke slows down, so the resistance increases to meet your power target, and you slow down some more...<p>This can end up chasing you up the cassette if you don&#x27;t get back on top of it, or you don&#x27;t adjust the workout bias (ie, reduce the overall power targets to something you can hit).<p>but you really want this, at least for structured training. It may NOT be important if your goal is &quot;spin at home.&quot;<p>(Someone downtopic seems to think drawing a distinction between &quot;people who mostly ride outside fast in pacelines&quot; and &quot;people who mostly just like spin classes&quot; is somehow snobbery, but I don&#x27;t see it that way at all.)')
