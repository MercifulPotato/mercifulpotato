Really criticism is about improving and is an essential aspect of any democracy. It&#x27;s also fair to say that many that complain blame, but some take advantage and deserve blame.<p>But a big problem is that <i>any</i> criticism is considered a bad thing. I actually run into this problem a lot when I tell people it&#x27;s more important to criticize the leaders of your party, because you have a voice in that party. So you can actually iterate and improve your party. You don&#x27;t have a voice in the opposing party and many times complaining about the other is used smugly to express how your party is superior.<p>We forgot that critique is about improving, not hating.')
