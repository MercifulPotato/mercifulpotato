That still would come out at 5T tops, so on a financial basis better to just let it rip.<p>However the big assumption is that there would be no cost to economy without intervention as many people decide to stay at home, as confidence is lost and people stop spending, and that runs into a recession anyway. The 2008 recession cost $70k per person [3], that&#x27;s 23T.<p>It also assumes that the 5T could be spent elsewhere in saving lives.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.valueinhealthjournal.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;S1098-3015(10)60676-6&#x2F;pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.valueinhealthjournal.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;S1098-3015(10)6...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;data-visualizations&#x2F;public-health&#x2F;covid-19-deaths-by-age&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;data-visualizations&#x2F;public-health&#x2F;c...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coolconversion.com&#x2F;heath&#x2F;life-expectancy-calculator-us&#x2F;Life-expectancy-at-age_74_in-US_w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coolconversion.com&#x2F;heath&#x2F;life-expectancy-calculator-...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-much-the-2008-financial-crisis-cost-you-in-dollars&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-much-the-2008-financial-cri...</a>')
