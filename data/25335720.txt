And once we do, we&#x27;ll replace the current Gitter codebase with a Gitter-branded version of Element, and make sure it&#x27;s configured so all the Gittery stuff works as you&#x27;d expect... while also benefiting from all the work we&#x27;re pouring into Matrix and Element.  So, I&#x27;d see it more like Gitter sprouting E2EE, VoIP, widgets, reactions, video conferencing, open standard API, etc, rather than &quot;gitter being shelved&quot; :D')
