I think that everybody here is fairly technically inclined so what are your guys thoughts on this? My personal opinion is that using the term &quot;technologically impossible&quot; in this instance was not a good idea.<p>If @antirez is reading this, would love if you could provide any useful insights. FYI, I ask becuase of your background in research and development of &quot;TCP Idle Scan&quot; back in &#x27;98.')
