It is thus striking that we found almost twice as many bugs in Z3 as compared to CVC4. The solvers have different development models. Whereas Z3 relies on a single main developer and a couple of assisting developers, CVC4 is more of a community effort. CVC4 requires code reviews, Z3 usually not. On the other hand, issues in Z3 get usually fixed faster and Z3 has the larger codebase (Z3: ~400k LoC vs CVC4: ~200k LoC). The fuzzing practices of CVC4 did not play a role, though. As soon as they were in place (since August 2020), we applied their rules to both solvers. Our earlier work &quot;Validating SMT Solvers via Semantic Fusion&quot; published at PLDI 2020 (bug hunting from July 2019 - November 2019) showed the same trend. To the best of our knowledge, all SMT solver bug hunting campaigns prior to ours, found no bugs in CVC4 at all. CVC4 simply seems to be harder to crack.')
