That may turn out to be true, but it is also quite literally pre-judging.<p>Your argument also accepts that the <i>courts</i> judged these cases to have no merit, while implicitly denying that such judging was necessary.<p>How should a Google staffer differentiate between case number 9 (dismissed) and case number 10 (still on the docket)? And what hope can they have of coming to a better understanding of the details and merits of a case than the exact body (a court) which is set up to do precisely this?<p>The whole legal system is premised on every case being judged on its own merits, and rightly so.')
