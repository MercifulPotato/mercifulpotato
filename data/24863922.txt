Item(by='0xffff2', descendants=None, kids=[24876206], score=None, time=1603405461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853881, text='There are a couple of issues at play. One is that there&#x27;s so much interesting stuff going on that I (and most of my colleagues) tend to volunteer ourselves for lots of projects, which results in us going &quot;deep&quot; on a couple of projects at the expense of not having enough time to go &quot;wide&quot; by attending lots of talks that aren&#x27;t directly related to our own work. That part&#x27;s on me and I really could make more time in my schedule if I just said &quot;no&quot; more often (but again, I don&#x27;t say &quot;yes&quot; because I&#x27;m pressured to do so, I say &quot;yes&quot; because the work is really fun and interesting!).<p>The other question is why we have so many meetings per project. That one&#x27;s tougher to tackle and I don&#x27;t really have an answer. The one thing that I have identified is that we&#x27;re very in to making sure that everyone has their say on things before taking action. That&#x27;s a good thing overall, but it also leads to tremendous meeting bloat. A meeting that would only take 5 minutes if everyone restricted themselves to discussing <i>critical</i> issues before making a decision regularly takes a full hour in which we examine every pitfall, no matter how minor.')
