You are the protagonist of your own movie but a supporting role in other people&#x27;s or even just an extra.<p>If you think people think about you all the time, then you benefit from the message of this story about the 20, 40, 60 year olds.<p>But don&#x27;t take it too literally. It matters how you present yourself and what impressions you leave.<p>The good news is, you have to be really really bad to leave a long lasting bad impression (except if you personally screw someone over or cheat against them even in minor ways - people tend to remember that) and failed but honest attempts to get ahead don&#x27;t tend to compound, but success does compound. Meaning it&#x27;s worth playing a numbers game and diversifying your potential outcomes. A good impression can lead to a lot of value for years to come, a bad impression often simply means you can try again elsewhere with added experience.')
