To presume it <i>must</i> have been because they were so poor and not because they had delicious smelling food in their car and a near-guarantee that theft wouldn&#x27;t be noticed is, imo, disingenuous<p>To say that the only reason someone steals food is for hunger is to say that nobody has ever stolen food for any reason other than hunger.
