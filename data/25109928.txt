What if they are successfully preventing some malware from running on macs?<p>2) &quot;They don&#x27;t believe you should own your computer&quot; -- it appears Apple is planning to offer a feature that allows you to turn this behavior off.<p>It&#x27;s easy to assume Apple has malicious intentions here. But I think there is a larger issue which is that all kinds of bad stuff can in fact run on your machine without your intention. You could try to throw anti-virus software at the problem, and that&#x27;s one approach, and Apple is taking this approach. Which is the best approach? That&#x27;s a much more complicated discussion.')
