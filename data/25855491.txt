Sure, you can use a base index of zero and read left to right... but you can use a base index of -1 and read right to left and live a full (if lonely) life without considering the pass√© alternatives.<p>More precisely, I&#x27;m defining the &quot;base&quot; to be the right hand side of the array and operating on the reversed list -- it&#x27;s just a change of variables.  Python supports -1 based indexing, but does not support 1 based indexing.  You could easily define a language which only provides the -1 based indexing but does not support 0-based.  Let me demonstrate:<p><pre><code>  void *malloc_r(int size, int count) {\n    void *m = malloc(size, count+1;\n    m[count] = count;\n    return m+count;\n  }\n\n  void free_r(void *m) {\n    free(m - m[0]);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nMemory allocated through malloc_r is right-aligned and you should only use negative indices.  Best not touch m[0]!')
