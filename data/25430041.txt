You just need to know how to make one.<p>That&#x27;s not what I asked. Please answer the question: &quot;good&quot; engineering&#x2F;science - what is that?

I recently had a half-hour conversation...<p>Do you normally make sweeping generalizations based on one man&#x27;s half hour conversation with you? And yes, I do.<p>&gt; If I were &quot;arguing against philosophy&quot; [1], then why would I invest time in working with philosophers?! Good philosophy is needed now more than ever.<p>And now we&#x27;re full circle.
