Especially from the Moon or Mars.<p>Those crevices between the flaps, seems like great places for the atmospheric re-entry heat to punch through and destroy the Starship.<p>I would assume that during the initial re-entrant speed, the flaps would be locked, to minimize errant heat from entering the inner mechanisms. Then after itâ€™s bled off most of its speed, at the last few kilometers off the ground, would the flaps begin to actuate and adjust to the air speed of terminal velocity.<p>I wonder if atmospheric re-entry is the bigger test, should they succeed with SN9.')
