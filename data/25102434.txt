We can build remote-controlled &#x27;normal&#x27; helicopters that have fantastic performance and much greater efficiency (no need for 4x the motors and stubby blades).<p>The only downside I understand is that R&#x2F;C helicopters are very difficult to fly, but that should be straightforward to overcome by putting a basic computer + sensors between the controller and the servos - the user could control the helicopter as if it were a quadcopter, and the electronics transforms those inputs with its sensors&#x2F;gyros to control the helicopter appropriately.<p>This would seem to save costs due to fewer parts, lower weight, better battery efficiency, etc, but no-one seems to do it. I must be missing something?')
