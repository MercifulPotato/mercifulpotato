Every enemy (encounter) you meet is different in some way from every other, it&#x27;s always challenging you in a slightly different way. There may be reused ideas between the games, but within a single game, you&#x27;re never on clear a path of just doing more of the same. This is something almost no other company even seems to be trying, while From is constantly succeeding at it.')
