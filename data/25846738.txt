If you like that, you might also enjoy <i>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</i>, an absolutely heartbreaking novella about simulated children, and his follow-up collection <i>Exhalation</i>.<p>Orson Scott Card&#x27;s <i>Ender&#x27;s Game</i> is fantastic, and it&#x27;s follow-up, <i>Speaker for the Dead</i> is even better, and my favorite science fiction novel of all time. They won back to back Hugo and Nebula awards. Card is a polarizing figure for his outspoken political opinions, but if ever the art should be separated from the artist, it&#x27;s <i>Speaker</i>, which is an incredible exploration of empathy and responsibility, in addition to being a gripping, action-packed, science-literate read. Many more in this series, if you get into it.<p>John Scalzi&#x27;s <i>Old Man&#x27;s War</i> series is fantastic, if you&#x27;re into military science-fiction, or even if you&#x27;re not. Smart, funny, engaging and accessible, and reminiscent of Heinlein at his prime, minus the weird incest fetish. <i>Redshirts</i>, a Star Trek parody, rivals <i>Galaxy Quest</i> and only falls short because <i>Galaxy Quest</i> is so goddamn brilliant. <i>Agent to the Stars</i> is less appreciated, but in my opinion his finest novel, rising way above its goofy premise by taking it seriously, exploring the consequences and treating the characters with empathy and respect. Also hilarious.<p>Seconding <i>Dune</i>, which is a classic for a reason, and <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> (though I think <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> is a better place to start with Heinlein). Also Neal Stephenson, though I&#x27;d suggest <i>Cryptonomicon</i> over <i>Diamond Age</i>.')
