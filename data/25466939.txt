Soy can fixate nitrogen, so even a big part of the fertilizers is not necessary. Anyway, growing plats at scale is not so easy.<p>In their setup, they must pay for the electricity to produce the hydrogen. They must pay for the water. I&#x27;m not sure if they choose a yeast that can fixate nitrogen, but they will need the other fertilizers too anyway. They try to use a concentrated source of CO2, but I&#x27;m not sure if that can offset the other costs.<p>(And about agrochemicals to kill weeds, they probably need some antibiotics to kill the bacteria that will be happy to grow in the mix they use to grow the yeast.)')
