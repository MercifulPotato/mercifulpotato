There is an up-front cost to configuring your system, but once you have, you know what is there and how it is configured, so if something does go wrong, you know roughly where to look and how to deal with it.<p>Things that &quot;just work&quot; tend to have more &quot;magic&quot; going on that becomes a big pain when it breaks or doesn&#x27;t do what you want.<p>It really depends on how you use your system, for me, Arch is perfect, but for some, it&#x27;s just going to be an annoyance to set up for little gain over something where it is done for you.')
