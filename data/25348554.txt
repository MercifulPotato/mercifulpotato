The 737 in general is very compatible with commercial airports, so there&#x27;s probably not a lot of scheduldd routes 737-MAX can&#x27;t service because it&#x27;s too big.<p>If you have a preference to avoid this aircraft, you need to book flights on airlines that don&#x27;t have any, or that are too long for it, or be prepared to abandon your ticket at boarding.')
