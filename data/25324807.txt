Rendering games, videos, etc is largely constrained by things like memory bandwidth, culling, image decoding and blending - all stuff typically done with special-purpose hardware that won&#x27;t be very useful for compute or neural nets. Sometimes games or media have complex shaders that are entirely limited by compute, but it&#x27;s not terribly common.<p>Apple&#x27;s dedicated ML hardware is probably quite good, but we don&#x27;t have any way to know how good without doing math on die size + power draw and running benchmarks.')
