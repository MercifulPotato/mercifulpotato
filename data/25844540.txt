The fixed or preferred lower bound is the real problem. Any argument for&#x2F;against 0-based and 1-based indexing tends to gloss over the real problem because those arguments only exist to make some languages look better than other languages. As we move away from forced explicit indexing (e.g. arr.first() or foreach instead of arr[$LBOUND] or `for (i=$LBOUND; ...)`), it becomes clear that there is no such thing like the preferred lower bound for sequences at all.')
