Instead, I am referring to the &quot;fantasy of control.&quot;<p>However, now that you mentioned it, in these countries with low observed infection rates, are people free to gather in groups? Are they allowed to engage in usual activities? Are they allowed to travel freely?<p>If the answers to those and similar questions are not all no, then, clearly not everyone is willingly isolating themselves, and people who entertain fantasies of control or directing the power of government to limit their freedoms.<p>They have done so without ever paying attention to the costs of such limitations on the usual functioning of human beings.')
