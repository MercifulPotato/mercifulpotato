The entire world&#x27;s purchasing habits shifted towards guns, food, prepping gear, and TP. The prices of those items skyrocketed (when they could be found). I predicted at the time that, even though everyone was experiencing massive price inflation in the stuff we were actually buying, largely due to increased demand, it was not going to show up in the numbers because of the way inflation is calculated.<p>Put another way, if I&#x27;m in the market for housing, healthcare, groceries and gardening supplies, and the prices of all those things around skyrocketing, then it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me if the price of cars is down 20% since the crisis began. The inflation measures, however, don&#x27;t account for the shifts in purchasing demand, which should weight the measure heavily.')
