Still, I feel that there are some serious compromises in the hooks approach and wonder if there wasn&#x27;t some other potential future we missed out on.<p>What would it have looked like if class-based components got a v2 rev instead? I feel like a lot of the crazy with class-based components came from the myriad low-level callbacks. useEffect() is a better abstraction, but it seems like some sort of class-based analogue could have been created (perhaps registering effects in the constructor).<p>The other nice thing about hooks is composability. I haven&#x27;t given it a ton of thought but maybe that could have been addressed somehow too? Dunno.<p>I would be willing to accept some extra verbosity if it meant we could relax or eliminate some of the rules of hooks. The conditional rendering problem sucks.')
