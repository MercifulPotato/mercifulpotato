One of the early steps is defining your problem by interviewing consumers, which seems like where the misstep occurred. Being an avid cyclist with nearly no friends who bike, I&#x27;ve seen that they are not intimidated by &quot;technology&quot;.<p>They are afraid of looking like an idiot. If they ride with me I look really cool with a slick bike and low profile gear, while they are riding a walmart bike in baggy shorts with a dumb helmet, while visible to hundreds of people in cars.<p>IMO the solution is not a new bike - its better group rides. Most  people don&#x27;t show up to the gym and start working out on their own, they take a class at a gym with gear and other noobs. I believe the best way to get people off the couch and biking is letting them go to a gym, with a bunch of noobs, and ride bikes together. Don&#x27;t spend $400+, spend $75&#x2F;mo. (A bike is maybe ~70% of the total cost of bike gear).<p>I have a ton of cool resources from IDEO (now quite a few years old) and the creative thinking&#x2F;ideation process, I can post them here if desired.<p>For those misunderstanding my example: The difference is looking like you know what you&#x27;re doing, and looking like you have no idea what you&#x27;re doing. Regardless of the situation (biking, at work, or talking to women at bars) not knowing what you&#x27;re doing and having that be publicly visible can be a huge hurdle to overcome.')
