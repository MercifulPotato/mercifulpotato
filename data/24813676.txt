(By the way, this is actually, literally &quot;begging the question&quot; - &quot;It must be a dog whistle because I read it this way even though it doesn&#x27;t use those words or make that claim at all!&quot;)<p>An unexpected take on my words.<p>What I <i>actually</i> did&#x2F;said:<p>&gt;&gt; <i>Perhaps I&#x27;m misinterpreting this, but I wonder if</i> the author is suggesting (&quot;dog whistling&quot;) that in our (US) current two party system, that only one side is guilty of it?<p>&gt;&gt; Or perhaps the author is saying this only with respect to history, <i>and I&#x27;m getting all worked up about nothing</i>.<p>If you look more closely, you may notice that I am very explicitly pointing out that I am <i>speculating about</i> what the author is getting at, rather than, as you (incorrectly) say I say:<p>- and then [claim it&#x27;s (it is)] the author dog whistling<p>- It [must be] a dog whistle<p>- ...because [I read it this way] <i>even though it doesn&#x27;t use those words or make that claim at all</i>  (this one is rather ironic)<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a strong reason the author didn&#x27;t use the words &quot;Trump&quot; or &quot;left&quot;.<p>Assertions like this are suggestive of mind reading ability, and also that political rhetoric that does not say things explicitly does not exist.<p>Something else I said:<p>&gt;&gt; I guess my question is actually: I wonder how paragraphs like this <i>are unpacked in the minds of readers, depending on their particular worldviews</i>. Written English is so brutally flawed as a communication medium.<p>This &quot;how...are unpacked in the mind of the readers&quot; is interesting, and I think might explain why near every single comment I make gets downvoted.  I&#x27;ve always thought that it was people not liking my political views, but I think what it actually is, is that people aren&#x27;t able to read text literally.  As I was writing my message, I was &quot;reading between the lines&quot;, with suspicion, <i>looking for rhetoric</i> - but I was doing this with full conscious intention, and my statements were explicitly speculative - I was <i>wondering</i> if the author was <i>implying</i> (which often does indeed happen) the things I sensed.  If a logical, unbiased person (if there is such a person anymore) considers the article <i>and writing </i>techniques* - I could easily excerpt several examples) in it&#x27;s entirety, my suspicion doesn&#x27;t seem terribly inappropriate.<p>Your assessment (and I expect others) on the other hand, is that I have(!) read and said <i>very specific</i> things, that I <i>haven&#x27;t actually said&#x2F;done</i>.  Not only did you not &quot;respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says&quot;, you <i>grossly misinterpreted it</i>, and then asserted that misinterpretation <i>as if it was a fact</i> (because to you, it is just that).<p>Of course, there are very stressful times, the world is a complete gongshow, it&#x27;s hard not to get at each others throats - <i>&quot;these things happen&quot;</i>, so I&#x27;m not bent out of shape by it.  Rather, I&#x27;m actually quite relieved, because I now feel quite a bit less confused and frustrated about the world around me, and how people within it behave.<p>Thanks for your insight.')
