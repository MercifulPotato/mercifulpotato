It’s not because Intel’s fabs are struggling or Apple has found tricks no one else in the world knows about. It’s because Apple controls the entire software stack and therefore knows what they need on the chip. Intel caters to the entire market (one the M1 just noticeably shrunk) with myriad integrators, workloads, and users, and each has different concerns and priorities making accelerated algorithm blocks useless to some and not-fast-enough for others.”<p>This is an important point.  It applies up and down the stack for everything Apple does.<p>The people who suggest breaking up Apple are correct that it would destroy them, by forcing them to use inefficient generic components at every level.<p>If we want competition against Apple, the way to get there is not by hobbling them with the inefficiency of the old paradigm.<p>It’s by <i>the rest of the industry</i> figuring out how to collaborate on delivering similar gains without vertical integration.')
