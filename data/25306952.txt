It&#x27;s not clear to me if that actually takes place in the Efforce method, does the benefitting company have to buy tokens to pay the investors?<p>Also, if all savings are calculated based on meter readings sent &quot;directly&quot; to the chain, how do you account for changes in energy requirements due to upsizing or downsizing or any other change not covered by the contract?  A mechanism for this would seem to require a method of putting a thumb on the scale, and if that&#x27;s he case then why use the token instead of the more traditional method.')
