Though I think part of the cause for this accusation is that Bernie does well among non-voters. Thinking back to 2016 Clinton clearly had more support in the primaries than Bernie, but Bernie had a lot of support from people who didn&#x27;t normally vote. So it does make sense that when Bernie lost, that group didn&#x27;t feel represented by the democratic party.')
