One dose is good for reducing infection by 63%, two by over 90%.”<p>The number of people you need to vaccinate with a 63% effective vaccine versus a 90% effective vaccine is a huge gap.<p>There are two issues with vaccines that staring at these numbers won’t tell you:<p>1. Not everyone is going to get vaccinated.<p>2. The number of people who will get vaccinated is directly correlated with public trust.<p>If you release a vaccine that is 63% effective, the “this vaccine doesn’t work crowd” and their hugely amplified voices on YouTube and social media will be exponentially worse.<p>That snowballs into fewer people being vaccinated. Unlikely for us, with a less effective vaccine we need far <i>more</i> people being vaccinated.<p>So you want a more effective vaccine because fewer people need to get vaccinated, more people will trust the vaccine, and more people will get vaccinated.<p>(To pre-empt the bad-faith replies, this does _not_ mean we would sacrifice another six months to get a 98% effective vaccine (if it were possible) versus starting now. It’s a balance, of course.)<p>Also very important is that a second dose isn’t just for effectiveness, it’s to boost the immune system’s response so that the conferred immunity lasts significantly longer.<p>[0]: I struggled through this article. I find this self-congratulating “I’m smarter than everyone and I told you so in this other blog post” writing insufferable.')
