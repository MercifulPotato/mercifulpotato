They band together and adopt a narrative which they then spread through the networks which are aligned with them and in other public tools like youtube and twitter.<p>This is so incredibly successful that the only thing guiding their behavior is a change in polling with their base, rather than any philosophy based on values, convictions or general sense of morality.<p>Hell yes their outright lies should be banned from places like Youtube. They have no basis in reality and contrary to other types of false information, their information has the single goal of maintaining or increasing their power and delegitimizing democracy in the US.<p>Now from the point of view of the brainwashed conservatives, people like me are the brainwashed ones. There&#x27;s pretty much nothing we can say to them to convince them otherwise. We can try and prevent the bad actors from saying the things which lead them down the path to dismissing reality.')
