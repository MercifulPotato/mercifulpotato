When it came out, I nerded out and wanted one so badly. Luckily I couldn&#x27;t afford one.<p>From what I read was that the software was slow, and it was a pain in the butt to go back and re-frame or refocus a shot. People don&#x27;t do post-processing for mere white balance [1], why would they bother for focus, focal length, depth of field, pan, and perspective?<p>On the other hand, it means that high end gear is done. Once a well executed light field camera comes to market professionals will flock to it. They have to do post-processing anyway so they&#x27;ll adopt the camera that is smaller, lighter, single insanely fast lens. Most importantly perhaps, a camera where they don&#x27;t have to wrestle the bloody auto-focus (the kid! focus of the running kid on the edge of the shot!).<p>Better sensors and faster CPUs and digital cameras as we know them are dead.<p>[1] That&#x27;s why I like film, preferably B&amp;W.
