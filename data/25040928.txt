It’s not quite as bad as fake reviews as they encourage returning the product if it’s not any good. I do not engage in this personally but I have several friends who have had their accounts locked out from leaving reviews, so I highly doubt that Amazon is letting this happen. I think it’s more likely that Amazon saw his negative review as another supplier trying to take down a listing which is also a problem. The market of Amazon listings is incredibly complex, fascinating and likely beyond any hope without fundamental structural changes.')
