They may have started with physics, but they didn&#x27;t stop there. Many game engines are a collection of modules, Source included. So it becomes a fuzzy line when it becomes a &quot;new&quot; engine. Does replacing one module make a new engine or not? How about 2? 3?<p>And I very much do mean &quot;replaced&quot; there. Physics, since you mentioned that, was switched from Havok to the in-house developed Rubikon. And since Havok is a licensed middleware, they couldn&#x27;t just bolt some new stuff on and call it theirs. That&#x27;s going to be a full from scratch replacement.<p>Similarly the &quot;UI module&quot; was fully replaced, from the Flash-based Scaleform to Valve&#x27;s in-house Panorama which is fairly similar to HTML5&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS. This module replacement was also &quot;ported&quot; to Source 1, and was implemented in CSGO as well. Which gets back to the lines between game engines &quot;versions&quot; are blurry.')
