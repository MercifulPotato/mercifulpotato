Item(by='0xffff2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604937128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034862, text='S&amp;P 500 is only up 90 points right now, and I don&#x27;t see any evidence it was up 400 at any point today.<p>More generally, The DOW is way up, S&amp;P up moderately, and NASDAQ only up a little bit. That looks like it may well be a result of vaccine news to me, which is less good for the big tech companies that make up the NASDAQ than the broader set of companies tracked by the DOW and S&amp;P. I would expect an election related bump to have pretty equal effects on all three indices.')
