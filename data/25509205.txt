Even if the marginal cost of movies is 0 the cost of a bag of M&amp;M is so low it might as well be 0. Does that now justify stealing the bag of M&amp;M? No.<p>That does not even matter since looking at marginal cost of a movie makes no sense. Do you want to see movies? If yes then pay for them, if no then simply don&#x27;t watch them. Justifying stealing isn&#x27;t the way to go.')
