And then they are openly and increasingly hostile to developers who do not conform to their business model and do not want to pay them or distribute the app through their app store - and thus they keep crippling API after API to make sure that the developers toe their line.<p>It is because of Apple&#x27;s hostile attitude to developers that they no longer want to invest (or rather waste) their time on Apple platform.<p>Here&#x27;s a real life example of an app that is now no longer viable on macOS because it doesn&#x27;t suit Apple&#x27;s goals - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;tripmode&#x2F;apple-started-hiding-the-traffic-of-its-own-mac-apps-9dc83c5a9c5b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;tripmode&#x2F;apple-started-hiding-the-traffic...</a> ...')
