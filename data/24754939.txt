When you have a nice car people find a way to always park next to you, even if you are the last spot in lot. People parking next to you is a guarantee of dings, dents and scratches which are going to be 10&#x27;s of thousands to fix over time in a new Ferrari(). If they were allowed to get two spots, then I assume the lot has enough spots available so it&#x27;s not an issue.')
