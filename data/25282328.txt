I am an aspiring product manager currently working to make the transition I hope.<p>As a maker myself, I have always felt that there are so many tools for product management and managing a SaaS product. I realized that a lot of bootstrapped startups and makers in the indie hacker community and twitter were not all product people. Some might need product management knowledge or reference when building. There are so many free resources online and guidance but we dont have time to be searching all day.<p>This led to the idea of Docdrop. Its a searchable Airtable database with top FREE resources on product management to help you create your products strategy with a product mindset. Its distributed through Gumroad and Airtable within my landing page. You get access for life plus updates so I hope that would be helpful.Thanks!')
