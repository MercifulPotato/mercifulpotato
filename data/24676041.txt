These tend to be a problem when bugs crop up, because bug reports are like a personal insult to them.</i><p>Maintainers that have that attitude just shouldn&#x27;t have public bug trackers that anyone can submit to.  If they choose to do so anyway, and react poorly to legitimate bugs that are respectfully presented, that&#x27;s on the maintainer, not the reporter.')
