I&#x27;ve started using Spotify the beginning of the year (Before that a mix and match of Vinyl, Bandcamp and piracy; fuelled by friends, a bit of &#x2F;mu&#x2F;, RYM and music journalism) and I&#x27;ve discovered a handful of musicians I didn&#x27;t know before, but it usually just recommends me stuff I already know (and often don&#x27;t care for). Conceptually I like their mix of the week playlists, but I prefer listening to whole records, so I often just skip through the playlist until I find something that sounds interesting, which isn&#x27;t much better than RYM&#x2F;Journalism, but without any menaningful context (so it&#x27;s worse).<p>This is pretty much my favorite recommendation by Spotify: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R9982wYPPm0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R9982wYPPm0</a>')
