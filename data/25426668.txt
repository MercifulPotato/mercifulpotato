Every chip manufacturer does things differently. Some have a 11 frame buffer, some a 6 frame buffer, some will pipe data out after only a few frames.\nLet aside the tens of different YUV formats from diagonally interlaced streams to split-byte ones lest you want to work with the output directly and not let the decoder render to a surface directly (to avoid the latency of reading from the surface).\nBack then I ended up doing a lot of crazy things like piping &quot;empty&quot; NAL frames to the decoder, to force a flush among other things. If you really cared for low-latency specific streams it was very difficult to work with the fragmentation of the ecosystem.<p>That was a few years ago, the versions that came at around 2016++ (after API 23) were the versions that became more stable, and relied less on OEM specific magic.')
