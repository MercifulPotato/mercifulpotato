(e.g. Google has the same motivation to prop up failing competitors today that Microsoft had in propping up failing Apple in the 1990s)<p>Before there was Pinterest I thought `Damn my mother-in-law gets a lot out of Oprah Winfrey and there could be &quot;something like Reddit&quot; that scratches the name itch and appeals to women.`<p>Pinterest was that success and it&#x27;s really unique \nas a &quot;originally digital&quot; brand that wasn&#x27;t born in a global city (e.g. mainstream appeal that doesn&#x27;t seem mainstream to the tastemakers.)  Other brands aimed at women fall into schema that surround an individual celebrity (say Goop) or an idealized femininity -- so Pinterest looks very unique compared to that space.')
