Take this from the old jargon file:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;jargon&#x2F;html&#x2F;P&#x2F;point-and-drool-interface.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;jargon&#x2F;html&#x2F;P&#x2F;point-and-drool-inter...</a><p>From the earliest days of computing, hacker types have regarded ease of use and simplicity as indicative of stupidity and as a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of computing. This mentality survives to this day in the fetish that so many have for complexity and the fact that UI&#x2F;UX is often the last thing to get attention in designs led by programmers.<p>Apple meanwhile took the opposite stance. Computers should be easy to use. Complexity is bad, especially at the UI level. Things should &quot;just work.&quot;<p>Calling bullshit on the sentiment in that Jargon file entry above made Apple for a time the most valuable company on Earth.<p>The tax we now have to pay to them is a dumb tax for the cult of complexity and &quot;real men do it manually&quot; bullshit. To break the App Store and Apple semi-monopoly, start not by criticizing but by <i>asking why it is so successful</i>. Only by answering that question will any challenger including FOSS be able to successfully compete with it.')
