People with type 1 diabetes know the cost of insulin.  Has that prevented it&#x27;s price from moving to levels that many can&#x27;t afford?<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the costs are known up front when drug manufactures end up with patent help that allows them to gouge.  When medical devices are often produced by very few manufactures.  When hospitals enjoy local monopolies.<p>The thought that the only thing missing from keeping medical prices down is the price tag is just absurd.')
