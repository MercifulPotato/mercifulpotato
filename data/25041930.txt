You have to have a program to get those initial reviews and hint: they better be good ones.<p>Furthermore, you get penalized into oblivion if you get some bad reviews. So you are required to fix these problems with the customer directly. Either you are sending a free one, refunding, or something.<p>So the example in this post is extreme, but its absolutely not ridiculous given what I’ve seen from other sellers. Seems reasonable that they would take it to this logical conclusion. Instead of indirectly paying for a good review, directly pay for it.')
