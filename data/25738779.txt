Intuitively it seems like intuition is just a probabilistic analysis on incomplete data. For example that shadow is &quot;probably&quot; a predator that may eat me or that sound is probably a prey animal I can kill and eat.<p>Current AI which probably doesn&#x27;t fit either of our definitions of intelligence can design novel untrained strategies. See for example AlphaGo Zero.<p>It&#x27;s not even clear exactly how our brains work so its hard to imagine that they couldn&#x27;t be implemented with a sufficiently powerful computer but more broadly a computer doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a silicon chip any more than it meant a vacuum tube. If silicon chips prove an insufficient mechanism there is no particular reason we couldn&#x27;t somehow use a biological substrate or indeed even one we haven&#x27;t thought of.<p>Perhaps you simply need to acknowledge our limited understanding of the brain AND expand your definition of the term computer.')
