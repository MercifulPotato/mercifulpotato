You people are ridiculous. You claim to be &quot;the good guys&quot;, yet betray your hatred for your opponents on every turn.<p>This kind of thing is why you are the enemy and must be fought at all cost. And I don&#x27;t mean to be put into camps. You can still be cared for, but you must not be given power over other people.<p>Now you won, enjoy your newfound Utopia. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t live in the US, although I fear this will have bad consequences for the rest of the world as well. RIP freedom.')
