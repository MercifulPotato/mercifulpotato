You&#x27;re going to have to spell that one out for me.</i><p>Laws are written by human beings. In the US, a lot of laws were written with explicitly racist goals of denying certain groups equal access. We are still living with that legacy in myriad ways.<p>If you write laws designed to target certain groups and land them in jail, don&#x27;t be all shocked when a lot of those folks wind up in jail. And then, yes, &quot;x group just commits more crimes&quot; is a racist statement because it glosses over the context that the &quot;crimes&quot; they commit are &quot;crimes&quot; invented by White power holders to intentionally deny such people rights.')
