I&#x27;m surprised this hasn&#x27;t been studied at least a little. A fortune in implementation costs (system I was stuck with was 10 years ago now - absolute trash &#x2F; hell).<p>The patient wants time with their clinician. So in a 20-30 minute visit either the clinician has to be busy charting away (we called them progress notes) or you get actual patient time and more summarized to the point notes. Why can&#x27;t charts include decision useful info.<p>For example, if a patient has 5 objectives in their plan, why make EVERY 20 minute encounter go over all these objectives yadda yadda - is it unfair to expect the clincian will be working on these issues during their visit.
