I started taking Vitamin D as soon as I heard about it being of benefit ... early last year.<p>My reading of the literature showed that Vitamin D is useful for so many health effects due to its many interactions. Being low in general isn&#x27;t a good idea. I&#x27;m in direct sunshine for around 2 hours a day. White skin with a tan. So I chose a dosage that shouldn&#x27;t cause imminent death and then a few weeks after I got a full blood test. Mainly to confirm that side effects of too much vitamin D weren&#x27;t taking hold. Surprisingly even with taking the capsule once a day I found I was still low. So the doctor upped my amateur considered dose to his recommendation.<p>Get your own blood tested and confirm for yourself. Leave the anti-vitamin people to themselves. I got repeatedly criticized for supplementing. People quickly shut up when you show your blood results.<p>I realise anecdata is fun to mock, but in my sample size if I&#x27;d seen a study like this and fully believed it then maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have done the blood test. I wonder how many other people are low in vitamin D and have no clue.')
