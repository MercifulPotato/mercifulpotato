This compound is a well characterized photocatalyst with a bandgap energy of 3.2 eV (ref. 11â€“14), and its EQE for overall water splitting has been improved by up to 69% over the past years using various refinements.<p>Here, we increased the EQE to its upper limit by constructing highly active HER and OER cocatalysts on SrTiO3:Al particles site-selectively. This was accomplished by using a stepwise photodeposition method instead of an impregnation process, which results in random dispersion of the cocatalysts.</i>')
