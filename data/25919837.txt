I&#x27;m assuming that the type of empirical data produced by these experiments is a prerequisite to developing a finite element model for these materials&#x2F;techniques.<p>The worst case here is that civil engineers have to reinvent the knowledge that you believe other engineering disciplines have mastered using different materials. Computer guided in-situ reinforced concrete seems quite novel to me; perhaps that is a reflection of my own knowledge gap.')
