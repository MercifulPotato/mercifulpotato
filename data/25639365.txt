This expansion of power is really unpopular and enabled Brexit in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s also probably a proxy for immigration, mostly of the illegal variety, but also legal within the Schengen area. People don&#x27;t take too kindly to having a supernational body tell them who is allowed to enter their country, stay for long periods of time, and their very loose definition of refugee. I know that some nations are politically very much in alignment with the EU&#x27;s immigration push (Germany is obvious) but clearly the UK isn&#x27;t.
