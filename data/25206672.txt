Everybody knows how to do arbitrage but it&#x27;s still extremely profitable if you&#x27;re faster than everyone else. HFTs are consistently more profitable than slow trading firms, earning 40%+ returns, it&#x27;s just a much more capacity-constrained form of trading so absolute returns are lower.')
