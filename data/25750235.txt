It can clearly be used for to traffic drugs, humans, blackmarket weapons, etc. It can be used to flee justice, evade police, abets vehicular manslaughter, etc. The list goes on and on. Is it even controversial to support the highway system as is? Do we loose sleep over it?<p>I feel like we&#x27;ve all been a bit brainwashed by the government in our notion that &quot;free speech&quot; must have limits. I very much doubt that that is true. I think the <i>speech</i> part should always be 100% free. Of course any crimes that derive from it are and will always been fully enforceable. I just question whether or not the <i>speech itself</i> should be viewed as illegal, or something that should be regulated.<p>Obviously all of the insidious planning and hatred that presumably occurred on Parler is abhorrent. I think I can hate all of those things without believing that the site should be censored.')
