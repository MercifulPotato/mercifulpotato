Think of all the real estate that is taken up with gas stations.  Do we think those are all going to exist forever despite a shrinking customer base?  As society transfers to more EVs, gas stations can transition to EV charging stations.  Those stations can be denser too since a charger doesn&#x27;t require much more room than a parking space.  Combine that with the trend of faster and faster charging and the need for a dedicated home charger will decrease over time.')
