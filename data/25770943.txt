They spent time researching it and writing it, unlike our off the cuff comments.<p>I understand it will not convince you either, but I hope you will read it.<p>A Regime of Jewish Supremacy from the River to the Sea: This is Apartheid\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.btselem.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;202101_this_is_apartheid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.btselem.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;202101_this_is...</a><p>&gt; Israel accords Palestinians a different package of rights in every one of these units – all of which are inferior compared to the rights afforded to Jewish citizens. The goal of Jewish supremacy is advanced differently in every unit, and the resulting forms of injustice differ: the lived experience of Palestinians in blockaded Gaza is unlike that of Palestinian subjects in the West Bank, permanent residents in East Jerusalem or Palestinian citizens within sovereign Israeli territory. Yet these are variations on the fact that all Palestinians living under Israeli rule are treated as inferior in rights and status to Jews who live in the very same area.<p>&gt; Detailed below are four major methods the Israeli regime uses to advance Jewish supremacy. Two are implemented similarly throughout the entire area: restricting migration by non-Jews and taking over Palestinian land to build Jewish-only communities, while relegating Palestinians to small enclaves. The other two are implemented primarily in the Occupied Territories: draconian restrictions on the movement of non-citizen Palestinians and denial of their political rights. Control over these aspects of life lies entirely in Israel’s hands: in the entire area, Israel has sole power over the population registry, land allocation, voter rolls and the right (or denial thereof) to travel within, enter or exit any part of the area.')
