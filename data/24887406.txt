Very few features are part of the core Wayland protocol; off the top of my bind, there&#x27;s the input methods, and a few ways to describe shared memory with the compositor and some callbacks to handle device registration. That&#x27;s it.<p>For example, top level <i>windows</i> and popups themselves are an extension in Wayland (<i>xdg_shell</i> protocol rather than the defunct <i>wl_shell</i>), and so is the rather basic feature of compositing on the GPU (<i>dma_buf</i>) rather than going through some shared CPU memory.')
