The spirit of the term is grossly violated when Red Cross can be in any category with Harvard or the like--schools that expressly serve the rich (and <i>allow</i> the poor).<p>In no meaningful way can a school who charges $100k+ for tuition--which is required in addition to &quot;endowments&quot; and other such huge checks they receive to help pay their wealthy administrators--be considered an <i>actual</i> non-profit organization. It is a tax ruse.<p>To put it even simpler: if the wealth of my parents is a metric for how much they&#x27;ll charge me to attend, clearly &quot;profit&quot; is important, and specifically scarcity, a prime driver of profit in capitalist society. It sounds like the definition of &quot;non-profit&quot; in EU is different than here in the USA.')
