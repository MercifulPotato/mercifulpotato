Item(by='dnh44', descendants=None, kids=[25140033], score=None, time=1605719644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137457, text='You make good points and I&#x27;ve learned something about PWA&#x27;s, thanks. You also acknowledge that it&#x27;s in Apple&#x27;s interest to push native, which is absolutely true. The only thing I would disagree with is that you think &quot;Apple just needs to give PWA developers [...]&quot; when Apple does not &quot;need&quot; to do such a thing at all.<p>This isn&#x27;t just for the cut Apple takes from App Store sales. It&#x27;s also about differentiating their operating system and hardware from competitors products too. Operating system and hardware matter a lot less if the battlefield is the browser. So I think the argument that native apps are key and essential to Apple&#x27;s existence is a sound one.<p>Google for example is pulling in a totally different direction, towards a world where only Chrome matters. In China, it appears that WeChat won that battle already.<p>I think it&#x27;s great having so many different and opposing visions for what computing may look like. It would be a great tragedy if we ever ended up in a situation where there was only one remaining vision of what computing should be (unless maybe it was RMS&#x27;s vision, which I think would be pretty good).<p>Because of that, I think it would be a mistake for Apple to act against its own interest by giving PWA&#x27;s any kind of breathing room.<p>Also I may be wrong, but I suspect that users don&#x27;t really care for or about PWA&#x27;s, and that the only people who want push notifications for PWA&#x27;s are PWA developers.')
