I use it a lot for data munging, usually with the fluent interface (method chaining) style [1], e.g.:<p>df.loc[lambda f: ...].groupby(...).agg([&quot;mean&quot;, &quot;count&quot;])<p>It also plays nicely with the black autoformatter.<p>Anonymous functions are verbose and limited in Python, but you can still do many things and use a regular function when a lambda won&#x27;t do.<p>I guess one of the thing I need the most when doing data analysis is column name autocompletion, inside groupby, lambdas, for column selection...<p>I wonder if one could do it in IPython, similar to the string autocompletion of file&#x2F;directory paths. Basically a parsing of dataframe column names in order to autocomplete strings.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fastcore.fast.ai&#x2F;basics.html#Self-(with-an-uppercase-S)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fastcore.fast.ai&#x2F;basics.html#Self-(with-an-uppercase...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomaugspurger.github.io&#x2F;method-chaining" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomaugspurger.github.io&#x2F;method-chaining</a>')
