Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=[24919406], score=None, time=1603890363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916154, text='&gt; At least four customers complained that the merchandise was not authentic.<p>According to the article, one customer said the item didn&#x27;t fit, and wondered if it might be a knock-off, but they didn&#x27;t outright claim it was. And the other three complained about packaging. Depending on how you score it that&#x27;s <i>ZERO</i> customers complaining, or maybe one at most.<p>&gt;  The evidence of authenticity was illegible. [...] And this is just what I learned from an article from HIS point of view.<p>That was Amazon&#x27;s claim; he claimed he sent in the correct, authentic, legible invoices, and they were rejected out of hand because Amazon refused to accept invoices dated in the year the merchandise was purchased, and instead wanted invoices dated in a different incorrect year.<p>&gt; If he had paid to have his stuff returned<p>He claimed he tried at one point and the web portal rejected it.<p>Obviously, I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s right here, and some of his claims are a bit confusing. And he does admit to ignoring <i>some</i> notices. Still, if you&#x27;re evaluating his story as he presents it, taking his claims at face value, then: His evidence was <i>not</i> illegible, no (or at most one) customer alleged fake items, and he did make an effort to retrieve the merchandise.')
