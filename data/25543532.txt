They are trying too hard to guess what I am asking for, and sometimes I find it difficult to look for a variety of answers because I get the one &quot;right&quot; answer, posted on a couple dozen pages. Some searches turn up so many of their new widgets that I don&#x27;t even feel like I get a page of results... just canned questions and answers and widgets. Other searches give me 2 pages from a single site (pinterest, reddit, etc.), or most often, multiple pages of SEO-optimized content from people trying to flip Wordpress blogs for profit. If searching for reviews on retail products, I almost always ignore the first few pages of results on Google to try to find real reviews by real people.<p>I prefer search engines that are just search engines, and give me a basic list of results that I can judge for myself.')
