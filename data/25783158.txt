For most people, simple lifestyle and diet changes can make a dramatic difference.<p>Many people also overestimate the benefits of increased testosterone. This is doubly challenging because sudden testosterone increases can feel quite good for a short while, but the effects will subside as your body acclimates to the higher levels. When the initial effects wear off, many patients start asking for higher doses or looking to steroid cycles to augment the testosterone.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that testosterone isn&#x27;t an isolated hormone system within your body. TRT will alter a number of related hormones with various effects that aren&#x27;t well-studied. Exogenous testosterone can&#x27;t match your body&#x27;s natural cycles, either. A person might actually feel better with a natural testosterone level of 400-500 (actually totally normal and quite common) than a TRT-driven level of 600-700 due to these effects.')
