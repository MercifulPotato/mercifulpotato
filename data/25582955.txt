Cleaning it was trivial, just some cardboard and a well positioned light source.<p>On the flip side, cleaning out USB-C sockets from the same types of fluff is a pain because the data pins are in an island in the middle of the socket. Which gives you both less room (is requiring you to use a thinner implement) but also a greater risk of damaging the socket.<p>USB micro had the same problems as well.<p>I really with USB would address this because, with the best will in the world, devices sometimes get dirty.')
