It seems wrong to penalise the defendant because they committed a tort against someone who regularly successfully sues others.<p>Mind you, there&#x27;s a &quot;build footpaths where people walk&quot; aspect here too. If someone is suing lots of people it might be that the law is &#x27;wrong&#x27; (contrary to modal picnic views of morality, say) and that the <i>demos</i> don&#x27;t find the action to be something the law should prohibit?')
