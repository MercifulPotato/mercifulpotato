Item(by='jefe_', descendants=None, kids=[25910164], score=None, time=1611614893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908084, text='I&#x27;ve perused WSB for a while, but watching GameStop this morning, I&#x27;m worried this recent &#x27;short squeeze initiative&#x27; opens the door for various retail trading restrictions. Whether phase-out of commission-free trading, per-trade taxes, restrictions on options trading, tightening of pattern day trading restrictions, it seems something is coming. It&#x27;s tough to envision a circumstance where retail trading is permitted to interfere with such a fundamental activity as short-selling. It&#x27;s like a DDoS attack on the stock market, and I expect the defenses to be similar: additional vetting, limits, circuit breakers (which already exist but could be modified).<p>I really hope I&#x27;m wrong because their ability to make GameStop, Nokia, and BlackBerry trend in 2021 is genuinely hilarious.')
