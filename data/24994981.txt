Github doesn&#x27;t see any value in doing so (and i would agree). It&#x27;s not like github has any secret ingredient that makes github source special - gitlab has replicated most of github&#x27;s functionality, and so has many open hosting platforms.<p>The value of github is mindshare, rather than anything code wise.')
