If I want to use DynamoDB I can do so in EC2 or Lambda, serverless doesn&#x27;t dictate that. You also seem to believe one chooses Lambda because of complexity reduction and that&#x27;s not really the only reason. I can very easily port a node&#x2F;express API backend that connect to RDS to any other cloud provider. What about serverless makes you think that&#x27;s not the case?')
