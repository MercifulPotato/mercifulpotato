Web apps and app stores are equivalent from the point of view of end-user freedoms: in both cases, the code is controlled by someone else. Web browsers are even worse, because whatever code you have locally is transient and invalidated pretty much every other day.<p>Let me ask a different question: what if things that don&#x27;t need to be services weren&#x27;t a services? What if computing was primarily organized around end-user-controllable apps that only interface with remote services when needed?<p>(I.e. basically what we had on PC until recently.)')
