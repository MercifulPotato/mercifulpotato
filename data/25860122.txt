What if the aliens are giant gas clouds that have trouble with the whole idea of planets? What if the aliens are fluctuations in plasma flows inside a star and don&#x27;t realise there&#x27;s anything outside their environment?<p>As far as we know, there&#x27;s nothing out there. As far as we know, we&#x27;re the most advanced life form in the entire universe (for a given definition of &quot;advanced&quot;). As far as we know, every exoplanet is teeming with civilisations. We know nothing. So if we are engaged in speculating about aliens, then speculating that they&#x27;re probably like us, while allowing that they may not be, seems to me to be the only sensible thing to do.')
