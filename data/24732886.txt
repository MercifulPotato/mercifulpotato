Combination of feeling self-conscious bringing it into meetings and using it at work, and just not being in the habit of taking notes.<p>In the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve made a point of writing out the ideas and reasoning behind what I&#x27;m doing before writing any code. What I&#x27;m finding is I spend a relatively long amount of time at this, but even without writing code, I&#x27;m finding issues with my solutions on paper. Previously I would have just dived straight in and then gone &quot;ah, shit&quot; when I got to a blocking point.<p>It&#x27;s also leaving me with a catalogue of searchable notes about parts of our system, and since I&#x27;ve written these notes myself they usually include gotchas that I&#x27;ve encountered before. I use GoodNotes 5 for this, it can search through handwritten text with surprising accuracy.<p>I&#x27;m going to continue doing this, I think it will take longer to see if there is any effect on my productivity, but it &#x2F;feels&#x2F; like it&#x27;s faster to find a bug on paper rather than getting halfway through an implementation, plus I&#x27;m building up all this reference material.')
