Not every disability is obvious, not every disability is immediately provable to satisfy an adhoc request, and not every disability has immediate effects.  Your suggestion would lead to people being further marginalized, if every person feels that they can barge in for 2 minutes each.  Add up more and more people each stealing away 2 minutes, and that is quite a lot of time.<p>How would that even work, too?  If a random person decides that somebody&#x27;s disability doesn&#x27;t exist, do they then just barge in even more than usual.  &quot;I decided that your coeliac disease didn&#x27;t exist, so I used wheat as a thickener.  Your fault for not explaining it better.&quot;')
