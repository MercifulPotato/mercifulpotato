It&#x27;s co-produced by a company called Cygames which makes a number of other gachas. Gachas are kind of scummy, but for what it&#x27;s worth, Nintendo has pulled the reigns on them pretty hard. They&#x27;ve publically stated they don&#x27;t want kids spending too much money on the games as it hurts their brand. Cygames has stated they have lost potential revenues due to Nintendo&#x27;s influence. I think this is true as a free to play player who has pretty much everything in the game and zounds of currency (although it&#x27;s gotten a little bit stingier now).')
