MomentJS alternatives? We&#x27;ve all been there.<p>It&#x27;s usually a daunting and time-consuming activity to find a better library and decide on a Tech Stack for your next project. Usually we developers skim through a countless number of resources in a search for a meaningful information. Every developer has its own favourite list of resources to look up in.<p>I want to change that and that&#x27;s why I created Moiva.io\nMy goal was to gather, aggregate and present valuable information in an easy and digestible way - one chart per a meaningful metric. If possible and makes sense - show a trend.<p>I don&#x27;t want to clutter the page with useless information and useless metrics.\nI don&#x27;t want to present any scientifically calculated information which is hard to digest and understand.<p>Evaluation and comparison should be dead simple.<p>I have big plans for that project and lots of ideas. \nI want to create something really useful for developers.<p>That&#x27;s why your feedback is critical on that road.<p>- does the project bring any value to you?
