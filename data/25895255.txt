Whatever people you disagree with believe, is the business of people you disagree with. There is no need to &quot;flip out&quot; about it. Someone wants to take a knee, that&#x27;s his decision. Someone wants to fly a nazi flag at his own home, that&#x27;s his decision.<p>If a <i>group</i> wants to believe that America is fundamentally &quot;good&quot;, that is the decision, and the right, of the people in that group. If a group wants to believe that America is &quot;bad&quot;, that is the decision, and the right, of the people in that group.<p>For instance, I believe the fundamental &quot;goodness&quot; of America is this ability to believe what you please so long as you don&#x27;t bother anyone else and play well with others. As an example, people are free to dislike black people. That is what is &quot;good&quot; about the US. However, people should not be free to stop and frisk every black kid that comes along due to a bias stemming from that dislike. Why? Because that infringes on the rights of the black kid. Who, in turn, should be free to like or dislike you.<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;circle of like&quot; kind of thing. Or a &quot;circle of dislike&quot; if you prefer. It can be whichever! That&#x27;s the beauty of America.<p>I explained all that so that maybe you might have a better idea of where my belief that lefties and righties are problematic is coming from. You can believe that America is &quot;good&quot;. You can believe that America is &quot;bad&quot;. Where I part company with you is if you &quot;flip out&quot; and attack people who believe the opposite. As that is as clear an indication as any that you don&#x27;t really believe in America as envisioned in the Constitution.')
