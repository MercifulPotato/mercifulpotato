Avionics. Medical hardware. Fields where the link between bug and death is as short as possible, and so the stakeholders have demanded solid engineering.<p>What are the consequences of GP&#x27;s acquaintance writing poor code? Some trading firm becomes slightly less efficient at trading. Impossible to evaluate the net human loss from it (if it&#x27;s a loss at all).<p>The civil engineering equivalent would be something like fa√ßade design or layout. If your building is ugly or confusing, it will annoy or waste the time of the people who live and work in it, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t fall on their heads nobody is going to withdraw your certification.')
