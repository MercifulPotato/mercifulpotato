At some point, one group&#x27;s freedom starts to impinge on on another group&#x27;s freedon, and you have to decide who gets the freedom and who doesnt. Unrestricted freedom for everybody is a fallacy that sounds good on campaign posters but ends up with somebody&#x27;s freedom being ignored.<p>Do you think the freedom to say whatever you want on Twitter is more important? Or is a private companies&#x27; freedom to define how their platforms are used more important?')
