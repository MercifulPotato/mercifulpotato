The peer-review process won&#x27;t care to repeat your experiments. And the chance that other lab repeating your experiments was slim -- why spending time repeating other people&#x27;s success?<p>In contrast, in industry, an experiment has to be bullet-proof reproducible in order to be ending up in a product. That includes materials from multiple manufacturing batches of reagents, at multiple customer sites with varying environmental conditions, and operator with vastly different skills.')
