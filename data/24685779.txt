The server worked well on my local Windows 10 machine, but when deployed to a cloud instance of Windows Server 2016 it ran very very poorly, just barely quickly enough to process data in time.<p>That&#x27;s when I discovered that doing a &quot;process more data if there is any, if not - sleep(1)&quot; loop is a <i>very</i> bad way of doing it, as on Windows Server 2016 &quot;sleep(1)&quot; means &quot;sleep 16ms&quot;. It all worked fine once the timer resolution was changed to 1ms, but yeah, the default value will screw you over if you have anything this time sensitive and are using sleeps or waits on windows.')
