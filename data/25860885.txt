Several industrial compilers for languages used by people for work are made by people who recognize that tooling is important. So the compiler is also a service or set of services with (depending on how you think about it) a database of information to query. It significantly increases the scope of the compiler and adds another dimension of performance and reliability to the system. For example, it may be a good idea to allocate a bunch of memory up front as a part of batch compilation to process some stuff. In a tooling scenario that can be a bad idea unless that large allocation routine is done in a way that the memory is pooled for the many, many requests it&#x27;s going to get over its lifetime.')
