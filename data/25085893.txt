Either Salatin or Shepard, I forget which, feeds his animals treats inside of his animal trailer so they don&#x27;t even get stressed out getting on the truck, the way you&#x27;d put treats in a cat carrier or dog crate.<p>If we want intact ecosystems in farm country, you&#x27;re going to be using farm animals for their similarity to wildlife. That&#x27;s a lot fewer animals, with a lot longer lives, but in the end you still have maybe a 10th of the volume of animal products. Not many grade A, thick-cut T-bone steaks in that supply chain, but plenty of soups and stews. And really, selling that animal may be most of your profit margin. They&#x27;ve eaten marginal and surplus foods all year.<p>Most of these fad diet folks have this stuff all wrong. We didn&#x27;t eat all fruits and nuts. We didn&#x27;t eat all meat. We ate a steady diet of opportunistic foods, and meat was a <i>supplement</i> to our nutrition, one that was critical in us developing the mental faculties and ecological range to have this argument in the first place.<p>To be a vegan requires you to use a global supply system for your food, which has its own carbon footprint problems. Meat is a seasonal food that got us through winter and early spring.<p>It has been asserted, sometimes as a throwaway line, in a number of historical documentaries I&#x27;ve seen, that part of structural classism in the middle ages was denying meat to the working class, leading to developmental delays. Malnutrition made them dumber. Easier to control. &#x27;Course, they gave themselves gout in the process...')
