It&#x27;s possible to build a generic ARM kernel that will boot on a lot of hardware, as long as the bootloader passes the right device tree blob.<p>Most device vendors don&#x27;t really have a need or incentive to use this, though.  A generic kernel is much larger and wastes flash space, and most vendors don&#x27;t care about running anything but their OS image on it, so they of course just build a kernel specific to their hardware.<p>But in theory it should be possible at some point to use a generic ARM Debian installer to install your own OS on a random ARM device, assuming the relevant drivers and device tree have been upstreamed.')
