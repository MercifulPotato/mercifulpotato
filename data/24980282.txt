It is so easy to use Docker in Azure. You can create a web app (App Service) directly off of a Docker image. When you make code changes just push the new image and the web site automatically updates. Even more interesting is Azure Container Instances where you run a docker image briefly and pay only for the brief time you run it.<p>I use AWS lightsail, which is awesome, but would be even more awesome if it supported Docker images out of the box.')
