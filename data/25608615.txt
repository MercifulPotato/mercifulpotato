I&#x27;m really tempted to try this as I&#x27;m already in the habit of using anki on a daily basis. Would you be willing to share your Python script?<p>If I may, how do you ensure you&#x27;re only getting one or two cards per book? Do you create a deck per book, or is all in one deck and there&#x27;s some trickery in the review settings you do?<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s really interesting to me that there is a non-linear approach for the reviewing, what&#x27;s the impact on your enjoyment of books?
