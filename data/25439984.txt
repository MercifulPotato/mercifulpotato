What really means something to rational, self interested people is quality of life for themselves and their family. China under the CCP has seen the greatest improvement in quality of life for its citizens in history. The US system has: eroded quality of life for its citizens over the same time frame, engaged in forever-wars and destabilised international relations. As a European, I am quite happy with a complete realignment towards Russia and China. Non-interference in other countries internal affairs must be established as a guiding principle of international relations. The USA is morally bankrupt and should focus inward on fixing its broken system.')
