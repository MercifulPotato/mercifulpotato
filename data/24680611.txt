I’m writing my personal statement for applying to PhD programs right now, after spending a few years in big tech and both the concerns as well as the benefits resonate with how I’ve modeled my expectations.<p>I think I’ll end up in a similar place - hyper-focusing as a graduate student and then transitioning out of academia after.  One understated part of academia is that for a lot of fields (Such as the bio-adjacent fields I’m interested in), academia is one of the few places willing to take on trainee risk.  I hope we can keep academia as a place where we’re willing to take risks to educate, which I think starts with reforming the processes informed by the critiques this post levies.<p>One thing I would advocate for is forcing pre-registration of experiments.  Publishing a design for experiments with an intent, a hypothesis, and a afterwards a quick summary of the results.  That process for FDA trials has naturally led to a large buildup of both positive and negative results, while also inhibiting post-hoc statistical baboonery.')
