There are also a lot more security conferences that people present at some with a more narrow focus than the well known conferences too leading to more specialty content.<p>I do a weekly podcast[0] talking just about the latest exploits and strategies&#x2F;research from the last week and pulling content for that is basically just following a ton of RSS feeds. There is a lot more getting written these days compared with the years when Phrack was regularly released. Unfortunately its also more spread out and harder to find.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dayzerosec.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dayzerosec.com</a>')
