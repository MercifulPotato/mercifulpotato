Installing charging capacity for 20, or 50, or 100 cars is something else. I&#x27;m not sure how most existing apartment buildings could handle all of their tenants charging their cars at night at the same time. I&#x27;m not even clear on how much strain that would put on the electrical grid.<p>How much more power would we need to produce to handle the demand if everyone had electric cars instead of gas cars? That power consumption would be added on top of all the power consumption we currently have.')
