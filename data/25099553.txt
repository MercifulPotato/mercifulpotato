Also plenty of places now offer small discounts. I&#x27;m not doing it for the discounts, but that of course adds to the normalization. (Also: Covid makes things more complicated and I&#x27;ve been wary of using my reusable cup once again, though I also massively reduced my coffee-not-at-home-consumption, and after all that&#x27;ll be over at some point.)')
