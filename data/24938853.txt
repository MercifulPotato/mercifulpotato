I think it&#x27;s suitable for people as long as they have non-zero exposure to geographic coordinate systems.<p>One thing about this topic that makes it hard to learn is software ergonomics. It seems like a lot of tools can work with GeoJSON now, and as I understand it GeoJSON has simply declared that there is only one coordinate system and every file uses that one. Declaring a different CRS is not allowed in the standard. However, ESRI ArcGIS will emit GeoJSON with any CRS you want. In fact if you don&#x27;t tell it specifically to use the GeoJSON standard, it will instead emit GeoJSON in EPSG 3857, which is not just irritating but plainly incorrect. It further confuses the issue that the 3857 system has six other alternate names, each seemingly as well known as any of the others.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that geopandas will cheerfully perform a spatial join of two dataframes despite the fact that it knows full well that the two frames have incompatible coordinate reference systems. It will warn about this condition but it will do the join anyway and you might not see the warning after a million lines of console spew.')
