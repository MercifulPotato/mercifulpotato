Index all of the images with digikam and further organize them there.\n</code></pre>\nAnother path would be to add all drives as &quot;removable collections&quot; to digikam and manage all of them there. digikam also has fuzzy search so it can find not only identical but similar images so you can deduplicate them.<p>Both ways are applicable to videos as well.<p>I&#x27;m currently using the second path since Digikam is already my primary photo cataloging and managing tool for years and, it works wonders.<p>---<p>On mac, Gemini II and Retrobatch would allow for a similar workflow but, I didn&#x27;t use them as my primary workflow tools. Gemini also has similarity search so it can deduplicate similar photos.<p>I&#x27;m not using Windows for more than a decade so, I don&#x27;t know anything on that front.')
