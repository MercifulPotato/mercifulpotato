There is tremendous reuse of previous problems (at times to a ridiculous extent, see 6(d) in the answer book) - I noticed that this consolidated my memory of them, but the physical model additionally tells me I&#x27;d best &quot;test&quot; myself on all the problems - especially the later ones which haven&#x27;t yet been reused.')
