It wasn&#x27;t until later that I realized the benefits that the people around me provided. With that said-- with some exceptions of course-- none of the kids want to be foster children. Especially those that understand that they are disposable. Kids are smart and know when they will just be shuffled around or placed in a group home. When I was fortunate enough to placed with my brother, we would act out -- looking back it was almost as a way to confirm that nobody really cared.
