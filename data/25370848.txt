If she did send the message, she would have known that she was accessing a state system when she had no business doing so at that time. And shared logins are clearly bad security practice, but that isn&#x27;t against the law. You aren&#x27;t allowed to break into someone else&#x27;s house if they don&#x27;t have a lock on their door, or if the lock on their door is easily pickable after doing a 5 second googling on how to do so. I don&#x27;t see why the electronic equivalent would be any different.<p>The guns may have only been drawn because she (again, allegedly) waited 20+ minutes to come down after she knew the police were there with a warrant. If everyone just left the house immediately, I doubt they would have felt compelled to draw their guns (or, they would have drawn them in an empty house, which isn&#x27;t so bad).<p>There&#x27;s no real logic to people who choose to violently resist the police. Officers have been killed by people who they were just going to give a verbal warning to. Or weren&#x27;t even interacting with. And those kinds of situations are the ones that cops are trained on. So even if they are rare, that is what they are taught to do, because it is safer from the cops perspective to have their gun drawn on someone who is non-violent, rather than not have their gun drawn on someone who may turn violent.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t like it if an officer pointed a gun at my family in my own home. But I also wouldn&#x27;t behave the way she did by not responding fairly quickly to officers who show up with a legal warrant.')
