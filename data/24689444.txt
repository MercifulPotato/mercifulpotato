The CDNs should win where they have a nearby endpoint.<p>A comparison of the additional latency (due to slow webservers etc) seems like a more relevant thing to measure if we&#x27;recomparing the services themselves. Eg something like time to first byte MINUS network latency. Otherwise you already had your answer with the ping times..')
