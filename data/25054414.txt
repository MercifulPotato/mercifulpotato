This is not normal. It might happen, but it should not be thought of as ok.<p>Even if he was violent multiple times against his father and family, which I&#x27;m not reading and I don&#x27;t know why we might think that? I would still think love would be there, depending on the severity. Hurting other family members might destroy that love. But I don&#x27;t know why we think this might have happened.')
