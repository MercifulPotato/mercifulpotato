To be honest, the codebase was pretty clean, I could easily understand what&#x27;s going on, I&#x27;ve used phpStorm as my IDE since I&#x27;m used to the feeling of Jetbrains tools. Managed to hack and do the changes in just one week without any prior PHP knowledge.<p>Would I build something new with PHP? Now, I wouldn&#x27;t. It is not that bad as a language to hack on Wordpress or small websites with Laravel but beside that, it is hard not to choose JVM or Node as platforms for your future projects.<p>Maybe a PHP implementation built on GraalVM will enable PHP to call into JVM libraries. GC and other things will be provided for free, though I think it will be some work since the majority of PHP is native code and its syntax is quite messy.')
