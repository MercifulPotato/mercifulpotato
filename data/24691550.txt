Based on the article you linked, there were years of financials that the investigators would have had to go through in order to substantiate the charges they filed. They had to investigate ownership of multiple homes, multiple cars in multiple states, and correspond with tax authorities in several states.<p>This isn&#x27;t an investigation that they just trumped up because of the Flloyd case; just the correspondence part alone would have taken months, and these charges were filed less than 8 weeks after the Floyd incident based on a substantial record of tax violations.<p>Chauvin was <i>already on their radar</i> for tax fraud. Politics had nothing to do with it.<p><i>Registering your car in a lower tax state may not be legal but it&#x27;s not exactly uncommon, and plenty of people probably don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s illegal.</i><p>True, but they&#x27;re not charged with tax fraud because they failed to pay use taxes. RTFA. They were charged with tax fraud for <i>falsely changing their state of tax residency</i> so that they could avoid Minnesota sales&#x2F;use taxes despite all evidence showing they were still Minnesota residents.<p>TLDR: Chauvin was not a political target. He was just a bad apple, and in addition to beating suspects was <i>also</i> a tax fraud.')
