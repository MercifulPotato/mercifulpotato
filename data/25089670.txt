The first is that they could justify continuing to do this to their shareholders based solely on the cost savings from not paying margins to Intel, even if the performance is only the same and not better. Their customers might not appreciate having the transition dumped on them in that case, but Apple has a specific relationship with their customers.<p>And the second is that these things have a long lead time. They made the call to do this at a time when Intel was at once stagnant and the holder of the performance crown. Intel is still stagnant but now they have to contend with AMD. And with whatever Intel&#x27;s response to AMD is going to be now that they&#x27;ve finally got an existential fire lit under them again.<p>So it was reasonable for them to expect to beat Intel&#x27;s 14nm++++++ with TSMC&#x27;s 5nm, but what happens now that AMD is no longer dead and is using TSMC too?')
