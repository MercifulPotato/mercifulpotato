Musk&#x27;s plan looks like it exploited this blind spot.   Reusing the first stage was so obviously impossible that even with the evidence of nine first stage engines staring them in the face, they thought this was just to minimize development cost.   It was only when the legs went on that the penny dropped.<p>And now, no one else will be able to repeat the free R&amp;D flights that SpaceX got by trying to recover first stages off expendable launches sold at expendable launcher prices.')
