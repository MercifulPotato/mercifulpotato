If I write code on my own just for myself I use the highest level of brevity.<p>But if I write code for a team, then in some places I will use explicit type annotations and variable names to aid people unfamiliar with the code to understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>What you are saying is pretty much &quot;it&#x27;s easier when everyone only uses nails, because then all I have to bring is a hammer&quot;. I think it&#x27;s good to use screws sometimes.<p>However, your second point I agree with. OOP vs. FP is a different story. This is about paradigms not about mere syntax. So here, a team must be aligned, which can be a challange when using Scala. It&#x27;s not a language for corporate drones.')
