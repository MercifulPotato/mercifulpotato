There were 5 of us on the panel, each representing a different C compiler. I was in the middle. We got asked &quot;does your compiler system work on a floppy only machine?&quot;<p>Vendor1: &quot;Yes. We have a special install for it, carefully distribute the files among floppies, and you can do it.&quot;<p>Vendor2: &quot;Yes, we can do it. It has a special install, blah blah blah.&quot;<p>Me: &quot;Yes. It costs $200 extra and comes with a hard disk.&quot;<p>The question never progressed to Vendors 4 and 5, the question never came up again from anybody. That marked the end of the floppy-only era as far as I was concerned :-)<p>It still took some more years before we could stop distributing the compiler on a stack of floppies and go with a CD.<p>P.S. The price of a &quot;hard card&quot; (a hard disk on an expansion plug-in card) was $200 at the time.')
