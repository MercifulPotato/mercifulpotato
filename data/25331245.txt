It also spreads faster (higher reproductive number), is much more often spread by asymptomatic&#x2F;presymptomatic people, and nobody has any apparent pre-existing immunity. (And the seasonal flu is a serious deadly disease which stresses hospital systems every year, not some joke. Even if Covid were only as bad as the flu, it would still be a real threat.)<p>The method used to estimate flu deaths every year is far more expansive than the method used for confirmed Covid deaths.<p>One interesting thing to see is that the social reactions vs. Covid have radically reduced the amount of flu spread this year vs. previous years.')
