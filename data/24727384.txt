Now I have the house but still don&#x27;t do any of these things.  It feels like why do I want a bunch of <i>stuff</i> that I&#x27;ll just have to get rid of someday once my kids grow up and I can be a nomad again.<p>Physically I&#x27;ve been settled for almost a decade now and locked in for another decade plus, but mentally I don&#x27;t think I ever changed and this just feels like a longish stopover.<p>Also most of what interests me I can do on my laptop anyway.')
