Item(by='ynik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604563760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995585, text='Windows PE files have, in addition to the section table, also the &quot;Data directories&quot; which are a whole bunch of pointers into some of the sections. Some of these serve the same purposes as some ELF sections. So it&#x27;s a bit unfair not to include them in the count when comparing the systems.<p>And of course many of those 42 ELF sections are for debug info. On Windows debug information is usually stored in a separate file (.pdb), which also makes the comparison unfair. I have to admit though that Windows&#x27; handling of debug symbols is much more useful (especially when you have a symbol server).')
