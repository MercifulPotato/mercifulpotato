I&#x27;m an indie game dev and I really hate that the industry has become this way.<p>I also am upset that nearly all sports franchise games have become solely micro-transaction driven (ie Madden, Nascar, etc).<p>I definitely will do everything I can to prevent my kids from falling into games with these types of &#x27;reward&#x27; systems -- and I&#x27;ll personally only be making games if I&#x27;m able to do so <i>without</i> resorting to slot machine monetization tactics.  Once it gets to the point that there&#x27;s no other way to monetize, then even [the &#x27;bad&#x27;] big tech starts looking like the lesser of the evils.  =\\<p>Government regulation is absolutely needed IMO, and I&#x27;m generally not a &quot;regulate it&quot; type guy.')
