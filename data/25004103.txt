As someone who comes from a country of starvation deaths, I can easily see how the homeless in SF would be considered the 1% of the world.<p>If the milk of human kindness is all about spreading the wealth..how about spreading the wealth to other countries?<p>Why should I pay for the homeless in SF when they live in the richest country in the world when I can send the money to Kenya or Vietnam or India and truly create meaningful impact. And so thatâ€™s what I do. My taxes already pay towards the healthcare, food and if in SF..smart phone and BART tickets for the homeless. No more tax hikes without an explanation for the $350 million dollars spent in just one year for SF homeless population.')
