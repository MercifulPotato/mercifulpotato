Item(by='chihuahua', descendants=None, kids=[25464653, 25468825], score=None, time=1608268855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25462190, text='I used to think Wirecutter was useful, until I saw their recommendation for &quot;the best bike rack&quot; (for carrying bikes on the back of a car). They insisted that the best kind of bike rack is the type that is attached to the trunk lid using nylon straps and hooks. That&#x27;s the cheapest kind, but also the worst by far, from my own experience and also just common sense. If $100 bike racks that scratch your car and have the bikes wobbling back and forth are really the best kind, why would anyone spend $500-$700 for high quality hitch-mounted and roof-mounted racks (that are easy to use and don&#x27;t risk scratching your car or your bike) ?<p>It convinced me that the people writing these &quot;reviews&quot; have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about and cannot be trusted. When the recommendations are for categories that I&#x27;m not an expert in, they can recommend whatever they want and I can&#x27;t dispute it. When it&#x27;s for a category that I know something about, and the recommendation is for the very worst kind of cheap junk product, it does raise a lot of doubt in my mind.')
