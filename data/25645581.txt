And then, at the end, he didn&#x27;t &quot;agree&quot; that there is some inflation in the real estate space:<p>&gt; Of course, there are areas of the country where housing prices are out of control. But this is how averages work. Some data points are above average while others are below average.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t believe that he&#x27;s arguing against a strawman. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of discussions on HN alone that the &quot;true&quot; inflation is much higher than the reported inflation, and that this can only be measured by looking at BitCoin prices, for instance.')
