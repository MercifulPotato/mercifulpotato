Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605305180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25087572, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve seen some developers be really adamant about how a bug was actually a feature.<p>And sometimes they are feature, and it&#x27;s the users that are mistaken on what the project they are using is offering them.  It&#x27;s a fine line, I&#x27;m sure, but different projects have different goals, and those goals will align to a specific user&#x27;s needs differently depending on the user.<p>&gt; So like the previous poster said. I am wondering if Github et al. should not contain a private channel.<p>It might depend quite a bit on the project.  In an open source project with many contributors, there isn&#x27;t really any meaning to &quot;private&quot; other than &quot;limited to a subgroup of the people that care&quot;, and those people may have little to nothing with the design and implementation of the items in question.  In a project that is mostly driven by one author that controls it and accepts some patches, that might be a lot different, and criticism may be received differently.<p>There&#x27;s a whole spectrum there, and even if you provide the tools to allow different types of contact, what&#x27;s to prevent people from using the wrong tool most the time?  Rust, PHP, Perl, Bind, Apache etc aren&#x27;t going to benefit much for a private list for first contact of regular bugs, but people would  use it.  Meanwhile someone&#x27;s random personal project is still going to get people making public requests even if they prefer them private.  In the end, I think we&#x27;re all better served by a &quot;public by default&quot; for open source stuff, and for things people feel is actually private (security related items, for example), they&#x27;ll look up a private contact or personal contact for someone related.')
