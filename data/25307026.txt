Moreover, Paris doesn&#x27;t build tall buildings, so the housing isn&#x27;t very dense (compared to a typical US city). I&#x27;m very skeptical this would create enough housing to lower property values.<p>EDIT: Oof, that&#x27;s quite an error on my part. I was absent-mindedly conflating &quot;downtown areas&quot; with the whole city. My bad. Never the less, I&#x27;m skeptical that this change will amount to much in terms of lower property values, but I&#x27;d be happy for someone to articulate why my skepticism is misplaced.')
