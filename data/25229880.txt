Item(by='whateveracct', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606493842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229291, text='&gt; The uncomfortable truth is that most people don’t give a shit. For example, it’s absolutely shocking that the common paradigm for engineers at Google is to come in at 11am and leave at 4pm. In no world can you be working 5 hours a day and be giving a shit, and so the conclusion is that very little meaningful work gets done at Google. Maybe a bit of a hyperbole, but not far from the truth. That culture is broken.<p>This statement shows how anti-worker this guy is. Good on such a Googler.<p>If you encounter a leader (like this guy) that thinks working hard for 8 hours a day is bare minimum  (like this guy), do _not_ give them your labor if you can avoid it. You only have one life, so don&#x27;t waste it making guys like this far richer than they would ever make you.<p>I hope plenty of BigCo and startup (especially Scale) employees are shaving hours with no repercussions thanks to Covid remote work. Such a huge effective hourly wage bump, and the only things harmed are corporations and their leaders (abstractly and relatively.)')
