Item(by='ceejayoz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603738071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897359, text='&gt; Do you believe it would be acceptable for a company to refuse to do business with people who are members of feminist organisations?<p>On a legal level, yes. I would avoid doing business with that company as a result, but they&#x27;d be well within their rights to do it. I&#x27;d be well within my rights to boycott and tell my friends about it.<p>&gt; And if your argument is that it&#x27;s possible to pretend not to be a feminist, can the same not also be said for someones sexual orientation?<p>My employer&#x27;s health insurance would allow me to add a same-gender spouse, but doesn&#x27;t ask if they&#x27;re a feminist.')
