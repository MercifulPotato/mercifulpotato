It&#x27;s semantic and part of the meaning of the text in the same way and to the same extent that punctuation is markup.<p>Nobody would put punctuation in a metadata file. But why not? It&#x27;s markup in exactly the same way that a lot of HTML is. In fact formats such as Markdown can be considered extensions of punctuation just as much as they are simplifications of markup.<p>I remember reading a discussion of word processor document formats back in the 90s, concerning the representation of layout and embedded images and tables. One participant was saying that conceptually the correct way to treat such inclusions is as a character. It&#x27;s part of the text, not some external thing imposed on the document from outside. For a page layout system such as DTP you might make a different choice because the focus is different, but for word processing I thought this was a very insightful point. A lot of markup is part of the data as well and best treated as such.')
