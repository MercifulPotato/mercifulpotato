Apple might as well just have said: &quot;Here, malware developers, focus your efforts on these few apps. The payout when you find an exploitable vulnerability is fully unmonitored, unfettered access to the network (by default) to do as you please.&quot;<p>This is beyond irresponsible. Apple <i>knows</i> there&#x27;s going to be bugs in their code. Doing it anyway is completely hypocritical to their own privacy-focused marketing.')
