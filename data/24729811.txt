While Gender-identity is the new age belief that your &quot;Gender-identity&quot; or gender for short, is a preference you can change (With or without sex change operations depending on your political view). The obfuscation of the word itself is a problem in discussions. I find it distastefull how people can &#x27;identify as&#x27; male&#x2F;female black&#x2F;white. they are immutable characteristics that no one chose for. If you believe that humans can be tribal and racist but should rise above superficial judgement and look at the content of their character then wether or not you personally identify as certain characteristics should be a moot point.')
