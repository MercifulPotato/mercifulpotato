At $10&#x2F;payment, that&#x27;s $1K&#x2F;s which is $3.6 Million in one hour.<p>If that&#x27;s &#x27;The Stripe Limit&#x27; that every Stripe customer has, wouldn&#x27;t it kind of imply that&#x27;s plenty enough for even much bigger customers?<p>As &#x27;FaaS&#x27; scaling - as far as I knew that was the entire point of Lambdas - that they could scale quite quickly.<p>The alternative, EC2s would need to also &#x27;scale very quickly&#x27; and could very well run into the same &#x27;prioritization&#x27; problems, no?<p>In reality, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a problem here with Lambda - while possibly not the most ideal option - I think that AWS has ample overhead to supply this little company with their little burst.<p>Amazon accommodates some pretty big workloads. A call to AWS support may very well have supplied them with the answer as to the real limits on scale.')
