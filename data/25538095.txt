There&#x27;s variances now, which came out really recently. Before that, it was even worse. People would have separate designs for each possible state.<p>Let alone how limited the possible actions are. It&#x27;s just frames, boxes, and vector elements. And no, vector grids are not enough to make it special. It&#x27;s almost the bare minimum in a design tool.<p>The only reason figma seems great is because the competition is somehow even worse. Sketch is by all accounts slower even though it&#x27;s native, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you because it&#x27;s Mac exclusive, so it leaves me and lots of people like me in the dust. It&#x27;s terrible for people like freelance designers that might want to share designs with prospective clients.')
