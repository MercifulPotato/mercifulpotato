This is confusing.<p>&gt; For each account on a given site, you&#x27;ll have an independent RK.<p>Is this only for usernameless sites? Sites with usernames can just use normal keys, right?<p>&gt; (But the only sites where you can use RKs are basically Microsoft or demos.)<p>How do sites request to use RK’s? Why would Microsoft request RK’s when they can use the associated email address as a unique username?<p>Also, I can’t find anything about hardware security keys on my Microsoft account page, much less usernameless authentication.<p>If there’s multiple usernameless accounts per site how does the user select which RK to use? This seems impossible. If it is in fact impossible, then only one RK per authenticator would be necessary and only one usernameless account per site per authenticator could be used.')
