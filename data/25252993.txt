And no one actually said easier, they said faster. Code is typically full of parenthesis special notations and characters. Nobody&#x27;s speed-reading code. That doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p><i>Because</i> code is harder to read that prose I think that favoring short lines is better. It forces you into breaking your code in more digestible bits rather than a 500 char single-line monster statement. Honestly it&#x27;s very similar to the argument against very deep indentation (forcing you to break your code in subfunctions) so I wonder why you feel differently about this.<p>&gt;Marginally. Most code is pretty succinct anyway and you can easily compare it side to side. In real life, this is almost never a problem.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you mean. Succinct how? If you have only ever encountered succinctly written code I envy you.<p>And it&#x27;s not just about comparison, I generally have two or three different code listings side-by-side, or maybe some code on one side and a manpage on the other for instance.<p>&gt;&gt; It encourages shorter names<p>&gt;Arguably an anti-patern.<p>Agreed. Sure you shouldn&#x27;t go overboard java-style but very explicit names are never a bad idea. That being said even a very long symbol will seldom exceed 30 chars in my experience, so it&#x27;s not really an argument <i>against</i> 80 columns either.<p>We all agree on indentation.<p>&gt;&gt; Enforced by a tool<p>&gt; The root of all evil. A tool for stripping away context and making hackily written code under pressue and time limitations and carefully planned out code look the same to the naked eye.<p>Now that I 100% disagree with. If your code is supposed to be a quick hack and a placeholder then add a comment saying that, relying on subtle formatting cues to judge the quality of some code seems very fragile.<p>Tool-enforced coding style is good. It saves puppies. It makes waterfalls taller. It makes the air taste sweet. And more importantly it means no more bickering and bikeshedding about coding style.<p>Uniform code will always be more readable than a codebase where everyone has their own idiolect.')
