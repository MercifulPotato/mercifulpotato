Well, modern humans are descended from the few that survived the ice age, so I think there may be something to that.<p>But as a former Minnesotan.... I can say there is plenty to complain about with respect to cold weather.  Joke 1: Minnesota has four seasons, they are called: almost-winter, winter, still-winter, and road-construction.  Factoid 1: During grad school at U of M, I had a sticker for a commuter student parking lot only 6 blocks from the EE building.  That winter I learned that in a -45F wind chill it takes 4 blocks for your beard to fill with ice, but in a -55F wind chill it only takes 3 blocks.  Proverb 1: &quot;There is no such thing as cold weather, only cold clothes.&quot;  That comes in handy in Minnesota. Related factoid 2: I had a parka that I called my &quot;snow blowing parka&quot;  because that is what I wore early in the (still pitch dark) morning to clear out the driveway so that I could get in to work on time.  If it was as warm as 0F I never wore it, though, because I would overheat in it if I was working.  Got a surprising amount of use out of it.  6 months after moving to California, I found it in my closet and thought to myself: &quot;What the HELL were you thinking, bringing this thing out here?&quot;<p>So yeah, cold weather in Minnesota is generally somewhere on the not-fun to dangerous end of the spectrum, and layering up is the way to go, with a good dose of thinking ahead.  But on the list of reasons I would never move back, cold weather is actually number 3.  Number 2 is ridiculous taxes for what you get, number 1 is those infernal deer flies -- think pesky like mosquitoes (the Minnesota state bird) except that every bite takes a chunk of flesh.')
