So at the current state of the world, I wouldn&#x27;t <i>object</i> to Apple doing this, but I&#x27;m still in favor of white supremacists being able to do this, because I don&#x27;t know of any mechanism by which you could stop precisely white supremacist terrorists from coordinating but not also citizens coordinating against state power.<p>I don&#x27;t want white supremacists being able to carry out terror attacks, but I want people to be able to coordinate demonstrations and civil resistance, and I&#x27;m not aware of a way to do this without also enabling white supremacists, and I think that&#x27;s a valid tradeoff.')
