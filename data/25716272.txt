I&#x27;ve prioritized physical activity of all kinds (sports, exercise, yard work) over other activity. I&#x27;ve invested in equipment (I have a treadmill, bike trainer, batting cage, free weight setup, cable weights) and I focus on the habit. That said, I could get by with a pair of running shoes. No need to over complicate things.<p>This adherence to fitnesd is a stark departure from many friends and my entire family. This makes it harder as my fitness is an individual activity insofar as when in the company of friends and family, I sometimes need to justify this activity to them. There is no guilt for me associated to following a different path and course of section from others. As a technologist, I have to remind myself that there is no guilt associated with time for myself VS time away from the computer and my business. Sometimes that is harder than it sounds, even though it sounds ridiculous.<p>This focus results in running 4x&#x2F;week, weights 3x&#x2F;week with other cardio and outdoor activities&#x2F;sports mixed in. Sometimes, if I&#x27;m away from my equipment, fitness can be body weight exercises and walking.<p>For me, taking 30-60 minutes daily (not necessarily all at once) gives me mental fitness also - free time for my thoughts and for myself. This plays into my introversion tendency to recharge away from others. And the timing is right! I may not be able to easily justify 60-90 consecutive minutes in anything. But if I can exercise for 15-30 minutes here and there it adds up.')
