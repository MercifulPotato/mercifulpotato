They will readily give you recommendations to cut sugar out of your diet. They will also closely monitor your blood levels for a ton of different alarms. It&#x27;s odd because it&#x27;s stuff that regular doctors &quot;should&quot; do but instead a regular doctor just prescribes stuff when you get frequent headaches or prescribes different stuff if you have moods.
