It comes in three variants:<p>* F-35A (Conventional TakeOff&#x2F;Landing - CTOL)<p>* F-35B (Short TakeOff&#x2F;Vertical Landing - STOVL)<p>* F-35C (Carrier Variant - CV)<p>While an unofficial nickname hasn&#x27;t solidly grabbed on, I think, given that USAF Fighter Weapons School calls it the &quot;Panther&quot;, that will probably be what holds at least in the US.')
