Most frustrating was I couldn&#x27;t reproduce the error at the helpdesk with same dock. The weirdest thing was usb peripherals were working fine, but somehow Windows kept giving me a non suppressable popup every minute ad infinitum. I don&#x27;t see the point of docking stations anymore now you can get 49&quot; screens with USB-c connectors. No reason to put a docking station in between or dual screen setups anymore')
