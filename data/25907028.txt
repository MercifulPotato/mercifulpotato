It depends on the workload. Here&#x27;s an example: MySQL 8.0 is benchmarked at over 1M QPS on I&#x2F;O bound reads using Optane SSDs. [1] You would need to show that proprietary software hits 10-100M QPS for this workload and hardware configuration. Oracle and SQL Server are often faster because they have better query planning but it&#x27;s not orders of magnitude.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dimitrik.free.fr&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;mysql-performance-1m-iobound-qps-with-80-ga-on-intel-optane-ssd.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dimitrik.free.fr&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;mysql-performance-1m-iobo...</a>')
