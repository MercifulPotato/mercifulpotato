I paid someone to replace the capacitors on it and I&#x27;m sorry to say it never worked after that.<p>I have about 30 vintage floppy disks that I want to try to copy off to preserve and publish publicly for historical archiving - impossible of course without a controller.<p>I figure maybe an electronics expert with a magnifying glass, a keen eye and precision soldering skills might be able to make it work again.  Perhaps some of the solders are bridged or something - just guessing here.')
