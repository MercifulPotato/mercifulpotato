Two things stood out for me:<p>1. My academic friend really had a limited understanding of the success of machine learning in driving engagement online.  How algorithms can and will enhance whatever mechanism they discover to drive engagement numbers.  And how our brains are not wired to compete against them.<p>2. He took exception to the word addiction in the context of phones.  He felt a phone could not drive addiction in the same way as a substance.<p>My opinion is that our academic research is significantly behind due to the sheer speed and exponential growth of phone&#x2F;app usage.')
