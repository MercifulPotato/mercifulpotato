Item(by='orwin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608132160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25443427, text='I disagree with some parts of MMT, and with most orthodox or neokeynesian economists (i think DICE was the model that made me think &quot;well they&#x27;re mostly just idiots&quot; and stop reading economists papers, and Nordhaus nobel prize just made me feel even less respect for the profession). So i&#x27;m really not in the economist&#x2F;MMT camp. But any deflationary money can only facilitate trade, and nothing else. You can&#x27;t build on this.<p>Crypto was exiting and, a hundred desillusion later, is still interesting for most people here, but BTC breaking 20k is (at least for me) just boring. It was interesting to know it reached the previous peak at 18k, but 20k, 25k, 30k... Its deflationnary, so of course it will go up. You can&#x27;t pay taxes with it, you can&#x27;t loan it, you can&#x27;t invest it on the  primary market. It&#x27;s boring money.')
