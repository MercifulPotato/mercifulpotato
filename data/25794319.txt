I can understand conceptually how a government could disable internet connectivity to _outside_ the country by having some control over the connections that cross borders.  _Inside_ the country you would need to have control over the internal routing mechanisms as well, assuming the DNS lookups could all happen in-country?  (this is not my field&#x2F;I don&#x27;t know the correct terminology).<p>How would people with satellite internet connectivity be impacted (I assume there is some government entity able to turn off a satellite, but that probably only applies to a few countries in the world?)?<p>EDIT: I should have thought about this for a few more minutes before posting the original question - the shutting down ISPs is glaringly obvious in hindsight...  I am still interested in hearing people&#x27;s thoughts on satellite internet, though.  HN occasionally talks about initiatives to have LEO satellites provide internet access.  If the people running the satellite were outside of your jurisdiction, it would seem like these instances would be mitigated for many places in the world?')
