But a lot of people are used to thinking about performance like it much matters anymore. You’d be hard pressed to find much of a difference between yearly updates of the same model phone.  But I think a lot in this community will look at those numbers, I mean that’s how most people grew up when thinking about PCs and seems to be how Android devices have also marketed to people.  I think now the majority of people just upgrade to the latest phone of the OS they prefer. I mean personally after deleting social media and a lot of other items off my phone I wonder what I really use my phone for other than texting, taking pictures and checking email and my calendar.  I could easily get by with some basic phone (honestly contemplated getting some e ink phone with basic capabilities).  But there are plenty of people out there that use their phone constantly and for a host of things. All that to say I feel like phones won’t have another large advance for some time, small iterative changes.  That jump from the original iPhone to the iPhone 3G seemed gigantic. Sure there have been form factor changes but even on the android front there have been changes but not things that are revolutionary to the majority of users.')
