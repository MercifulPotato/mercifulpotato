I really like nested voice channels (like Mumbles linked channels) but really they don&#x27;t show their benefits until you&#x27;re deep into more complicated stuff (raids&#x2F;etc) then the average person hits.<p>I think discords biggest (gaming-related) pull is that it&#x27;s so simple to onboard someone. Once you get someone through the &quot;two clicks&quot; of on-boarding, it&#x27;s much easier to get the them to say, especially since it&#x27;s cross platform.')
