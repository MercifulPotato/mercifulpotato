This led to materials inside the tanks reacting and making it that much harder to safely empty them out.<p>Years ago they had to install special ventilation around some takes due to the contents producing flammable gases.<p>In hindsight, of course, it&#x27;s not surprising that even the double-walled tanks face issues with corrosion.  Vitrification is the best process they&#x27;ve been able to come up with, but that&#x27;s not a fast thing to do.')
