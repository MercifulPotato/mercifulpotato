That smells like authoritarianism.</i><p>That&#x27;s not authoritarianism, it&#x27;s a <i>reaction</i> to authoritarianism. Internet is mass market now, and mass market is distributed authoritarianism. Individuals have no meaningful say over how computing looks for them.<p>General-purpose computers are still available, but it&#x27;s not a given there will be for much longer. There are many market incentives working against them. Music and movie industries wants to get rid of general-purpose computers to a) eliminate problem of piracy, and b) exploit customers more. Web industry side-stepped general-purpose computing entirely, by providing software as a service, hosted on company-owned infrastructure. Corporations want to control the machines people work on for reasons like espionage prevention and liability (the true meaning of &quot;security&quot;). This creates strong business incentives for things like Trusted Computing. Most end-users don&#x27;t even understand what &quot;general-purpose computing&quot; means, much less care. Those who do care, are too small a group to form a market-significant niche.<p>If talk about open web and general-purpose computing seem authoritarian, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s either that or nothing. As a developer, I can spend my time optimizing my little subspace of computing for sanity and ergonomics, but I still have to interface with increasingly closed world to do anything. Despite web technologies technically being somewhat open, I still have to deal with shitty garbage websites of my bank, of stores and restaurants I order from, etc. - because I have only so much spare time to up-fix things myself. The only way we get less shitty computing is if the market is forced to deliver it.')
