Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609559958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605320, text='False positive vs. false negative is a false dichotomy, because it misses an important group: the people who never apply for a job, because they&#x27;re aware of a company&#x27;s hiring process and religiously avoid it.<p>Your &quot;metrics&quot; will always miss this group, because they won&#x27;t even engage at all with your company, or they&#x27;ll walk away from the process as soon as they learn the details of it, probably without even telling you why.<p>Another commenter here described tech hiring as &quot;adversarial&quot;. This seems accurate. If my first impression of a company is that they treat me as an adversary, as a criminal who is lying about their resume as has to prove to them otherwise, this is a giant red flag to me. I don&#x27;t want to work for someone like that, so I&#x27;ll just walk away. Companies seem to forget that interviews are a 2-way street, and they have to convince the candidate that they&#x27;re a good place to work. I don&#x27;t want to be taken for granted. The way that job candidates are treated by a company is a sign of how they will be treated as employees.<p>It&#x27;s ironic how everyone talks about the danger of a bad hire, but it seems to me that the danger of a bad boss is even worse. (The horror story &quot;My experience at Apple&quot; is in another HN thread right now, and many commenters seem to enjoy saying &quot;That can happy at any company&quot;, which proves my point.) I&#x27;m less afraid of coders who can&#x27;t code than I am of managers who can&#x27;t manage.')
