That&#x27;s a lot of dough.<p>I feel like 202x might be another decade where no new chip making companies emerge. I had great hopes for Nuvia becoming one of them. My first most primitive reaction is that this is like another PA Semi[1]: great talent &amp; new prospects, fresh air, vanishing into one of the super-massive existing players.<p>Qualcomm does some open source work, but most of the support comes from outside engineers reverse engineering their products or otherwise doing the work[2]. The Freedreno graphics driver for example allows their gpu to be used (OpenGL, Vulkan drivers), &amp; has been a huge effort. That work mostly comes from Google engineers like Rob Clark (who started Freedreno iirc), Eric Anholt, Igalia engineers like Danil, &amp; countless others[3].<p>In the wifi-router world, where Qualcomm also has a huge presence, we rely on hunting around for open-source code drops of what usually seems like pretty old but better than we&#x27;ve got code, such as this recent find[4], which is hopefully going to help us catch a couple years up in support level to what Qualcomm is doing today.<p>Nuvia explicitly stated they wanted to chase hyperscaler market. And I think a lot of this was positioning. That hyper-scalers wanted good tech, would use good tech. Where-as a lot of the world, they want what they have but better, a lot of legacy concerns, hand holding. Nuvia wanted to build a new platform, a good, well supported platform, with next-gen technologies. We were all expecting open-source perhaps Rust-based firmwares &amp; management systems, pursuant to latest OpenCompute Project specs &amp;c. They were clear about targetting hyper-scalers, &amp; big chips, but somehow the hope always was that they&#x27;d help reform &amp; reshape computing &amp; what was available to everyone. They certainly talked the good game, sounded real good on Twitter. Ah well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;more-details-shake-loose-on-apples-a6-chip-including-a-500m-development-effort&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;more-details-shake-loose-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=search&amp;q=Qualcomm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=search&amp;q=Qualcomm</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mesa3d&#x2F;mesa&#x2F;commits&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;freedreno" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mesa3d&#x2F;mesa&#x2F;commits&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;freedreno</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.openwrt.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;adding-openwrt-support-for-xiaomi-ax3600&#x2F;55049&#x2F;60" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.openwrt.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;adding-openwrt-support-for-xiaom...</a>')
