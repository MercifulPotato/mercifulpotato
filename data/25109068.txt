In this <i>purely</i> hypothetical scenario, might this phenomenon offer some logical explanation for the amount of extreme polarization of opinion that can be witnessed in the world etc.?<p>The answer is yes.  <i>If</i> people’s political opinions were being manipulated by aliens en masse (assumed as a premise), then it would be very likely that the amount of polarization in the world would have some connection to that.<p>But assuming arbitrary premises like this this doesn’t seem like a very useful way to learn about the real world.')
