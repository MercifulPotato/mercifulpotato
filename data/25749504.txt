You&#x27;re referring to the braindead behavior that `&#x2F;dev&#x2F;random` can block because it thinks its entropy pool has been depleted, which is of course dumb because once the pool is sufficiently full it can&#x27;t be emptied.  What&#x27;s going on here is the scenario where the pool genuinely is empty because it hasn&#x27;t been filled yet.  This can only happen at early boot, but is a genuine thing that happens; unlike it becoming empty later.')
