For example, a shop in Germany that sells to a customer in Italy has to collect Italian VAT and send that VAT to the Italian tax service.<p>VAT MOSS simplifies this by allowing vendors to send those taxes to their local tax service which handles the international transfers so while vendors still have to charge multiple tax rates they only have to register and pay taxes in a single country.<p>Apparently the UK wants to continue collecting VAT from EU vendors but since they have left the EU they must invent their own scheme to do so.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;business&#x2F;taxation&#x2F;vat&#x2F;vat-digital-services-moss-scheme&#x2F;index_en.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;business&#x2F;taxation&#x2F;vat&#x2F;vat-digit...</a>')
