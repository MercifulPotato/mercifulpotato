I don&#x27;t think you appreciate how convenient the single-account, cross server approach is. Discord has made its way across a ton of communities and likely will continue to do so. It held up to scale and scrutiny especially in early covid times.<p>The problem with basic protocols is they are inherently very slow to develop and iterate, so problems stick around for a long time. UX can vary widely across different clients for the protocol. SMS has had huge longevity and will stick around for a good while longer, but I don&#x27;t think anyone is arguing that SMS is actually better than the internet based closed systems that exist today.')
