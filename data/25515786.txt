What Shannon’s channel capacity theorem says is that a channel with a certain bandwidth and SNR can carry a certain rate of information.  It doesn’t matter how the source information is encoded.  Actual modern signals on a transmission line, like gigabit Ethernet or your cable modem are not just on and off pulses, they are complex analog waveforms.<p>The reason for bits being the normal representation of information is that they’re easy to do math on, and in a computer, digital logic is much more efficient in binary than in higher number bases.')
