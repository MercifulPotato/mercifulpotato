But it doesn&#x27;t matter, because we&#x27;re not prosecutors or the IRS.<p>But I still call it tax evasion colloquially, because I&#x27;m just an average Joe who can&#x27;t prosecute anyone so my legal opinion doesn&#x27;t matter. My judgement is not whether it&#x27;s illegal, but whether it&#x27;s immoral and scummy.<p>My neighbor, a self-employed painter, claiming his work truck (that he also uses to pull the family camper) as a depreciating business asset is tax avoidance, and I can get behind that. Ikea registering as a nonprofit with 99% overhead is tax evasion, and it&#x27;s scummy.<p>Society, as represented by the government, wants charities to exist to assist with causes that society values, like, I suppose, architecture. They encourage this through the tax code. Society also want for-profit businesses to pay their fair share of taxes. This is blatantly a deceitful manipulation of the tax code, whether it&#x27;s legal or not I don&#x27;t care, they&#x27;ve abused the law to do things it wasn&#x27;t intended to do')
