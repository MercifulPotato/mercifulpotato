Then they’ll hire a contractor to build and design the factory. Then all of the staff that build it will be part time contractors from a temporary workforce company. The end result will be a piece of faulty garbage that barely drives, with nobody in the company to blame for its failure.<p>Most likely, GM will sell these contracts to someone who can actually execute, and they’ll make a tidy 2% profit to continue their mediocrity into the next decade.')
