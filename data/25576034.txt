Actor&#x27;s have only really been done in Erlang, and more recenetly in Akka and Orlean&#x27;s. AFAIK, there aren&#x27;t any other paradigms other than CSP or threads for concurrency.<p>Actor&#x27;s can have race conditions, same as any other concurrent system but I&#x27;ve personally never actually had any given the design patterns in OTP and Elixir. It&#x27;s really helpful (to me) that each actor is always deterministic in itself and doesn&#x27;t share data, only messages. It also maps nicely onto multicore.')
