My only issue with it is:<p>&quot;The overwhelming majority of content that people see on Facebook is not polarizing or even political—it’s everyday content from people’s friends and family.&quot;<p>When I used FB I didn&#x27;t find it polarizing or political but I did find I couldn&#x27;t see content from people I knew. Other pages and crap overtook it and filled my feed. It was essentially useless to me.<p>I don&#x27;t think FB is evil.. I think they are just about competent. Everything from them has been crappy. Remember when they spammed emails, chat was terrible, the apps were terrible, the notification icons didn&#x27;t work on the website, FB messenger didn&#x27;t work well.. etc, etc. Some things have been improved now but their talent is pretty lacking for a big tech company.')
