Rust is lower level than Java, so Java would be calling Rust, not the other way around.<p>Rust isn&#x27;t aiming to displace Java.  They&#x27;re two different levels of abstraction.  It&#x27;s the same with Python.  Rust isn&#x27;t aiming to displace Python just as Java isn&#x27;t aiming to displace Python either.<p>Rust one day could displace C++, but the odds are low, because in response to Rust C++ has stepped up its game and has changed as a language drastically.  Most modern C++ features are concepts from Rust.')
