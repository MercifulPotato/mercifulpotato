In this way, we align incentives between the OEM, the consumer, and the environment.  If a consumer is not using a product, we want to incentive them as much as possible to input it back into the marketplace where it can find another consumer (and we capture another transaction).  If a consumer is using a product, eventually some part of it will wear out, break, or go out of date, and we want to enable that user to keep using the product by getting them the part and&#x2F;or service they need to keep using it.<p>The goal ultimately is to bootstrap a large enough install base on each product category we enter to make it worthwhile for third party compatible part&#x2F;product makers, refurbishers, and service providers to participate in the marketplace.  The resulting ecosystem of providers makes the product and marketplace serve more consumers better, fostering network effects.')
