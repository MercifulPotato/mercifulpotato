I&#x27;m not sure why programming is the one field people make a joke of.  It doesn&#x27;t happen in any other field that I&#x27;m aware of.  Hear me out.<p>Do you ever see ads for &#x27;become a doctor in 6 weeks, land a job&#x27;?  Or plumber?  Or electrician?  Or anything else?  No, but you do for programming.<p>Do you ever see people whining that being a medical doctor is too hard and confusing, and demand that everyone should just have a handheld with webmd?<p>Programming as a field requires many years to really understand.  And even when you understand, it&#x27;s just some niche, not -everything-.  Nobody knows everything.  And that&#x27;s not completely dissimilar from other trades&#x2F;professions.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to gatekeep here.  I encourage everyone to learn to program, -if- they take the time to learn.  If they don&#x27;t, they do not belong doing it as a profession for others. Just as people can toy around with wood in their garage, so long as they don&#x27;t call themselves a professional carpenter.  That&#x27;s how you end up with glaring security and privacy problems that we read about nearly daily.  Imagine if anyone could call themselves a doctor, and constantly read stories of people dying from horribly botched practices.<p>I think the only real solution here is for the profession to be certified somehow, as other countries do.')
