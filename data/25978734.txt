Did they spend&#x2F;distribute all of it or it is still saved?<p>&gt; Miners will get 2.4M&#x2F;21.0M, that is a 11% inflation. And they have to spend most of it in the mining. Just call this 11% a developer found, and the difference is not so much.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your point please elaborate more on your point, thanks!')
