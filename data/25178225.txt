Moderators&#x27; options before Section 230 were either:<p>1) assert some control over the content, thus showing you are engaged with it, meaning you can be held liable for it; or<p>2) do nothing and avoid sharing any guilt.<p>My go-to example of a Section 230 defense is a library sued by a mom whose kid looked at internet porn on the library&#x27;s computers.  It&#x27;s not the library&#x27;s fault there&#x27;s porn on the internet, so even if they had policies and safeguards trying to prevent this, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to punish them.')
