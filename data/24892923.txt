Who has jurisdiction? Besides, reporting news itself is usually still allowed as long as it is not political agitation (&quot;Biden did something bad&quot; is ok, &quot;vote Trump&quot; is not). I&#x27;ve been tempted to test this by posting agitation to Facebook from the USA (Poland still has election silence) or showing up with slogans to the polling stations (you can still vote when abroad in a few places set up by consulates), but I still like to visit my family from time to time.')
