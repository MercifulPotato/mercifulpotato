Item(by='axguscbklp', descendants=None, kids=[25122864, 25123060], score=None, time=1605613828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121253, text='&gt;Took the names for Project Wide Awake and other internet surveillance programs from the X-Men comic book series, in which illegal government programs hunt human “mutants.”<p>This sort of &quot;geeky but psychopathic&quot; type of humor seems to be not uncommon in surveillance agencies. I suppose it makes sense that amoral intelligent people would be drawn towards intelligence agencies, as I suppose sadists were probably drawn towards organizations like the Gestapo, KGB, and Stasi. There&#x27;s something I find galling about it - not only is one&#x27;s privacy violated, but what&#x27;s more is that the violators go about their business with corporate bureaucratic banality and &quot;joking around the office&quot; sort of humor.')
