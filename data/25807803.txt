If a citation get&#x27;s invalidated for whatever reason, papers citing it would automatically get invalidated too, and so on. Until someone fixes or removes the faulty citation and revalidates their part of the chain, and so forth.<p>Just imagine authors having puplic wallets proving their authorship.<p>If someone wants to pick up this idea, I&#x27;d be happy with 10% of the earnings that can be made with it.')
