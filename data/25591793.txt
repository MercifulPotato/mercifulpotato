At the very least it confuses the QFT level description of light and electrons with the EM classical description.<p>The &quot;waves&quot; you mention add up because each photon sent in through the glass takes all the possible paths, and you need to add up the contributions from all these paths to see where this <i>single</i> photon wants to go. This looks like wave propagation mathematically. The reason the waves add up is because they are all the same photon.<p>If you send in two unrelated photons, they get their own waves and in that case they <i>do</i> coexist without interference, for all practical field strengths (there are light-on-light scattering effects that come into play at immense field strengths, just now starting to get probed).')
