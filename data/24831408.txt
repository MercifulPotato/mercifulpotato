I.e. where would you and your brother have ended up if you had stayed in school and gone the traditional college path?  You say you&#x27;re making $150k now as a software engineer, but there&#x27;s a damn good chance if you had stayed in school and gotten a CS degree in college you would be making a lot more than that now (and earlier in your career as well).<p>As others have mentioned, you also have to consider how few career paths offer the kind of &quot;no formal training&quot; entry bar that programming does.  What if your brother had hated computers and realized at age 22 that he wanted to be a doctor?  He&#x27;d be years behind his peers.')
