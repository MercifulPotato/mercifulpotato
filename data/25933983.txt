Remember, there are no cert authorities that are human people. They are all corporations or institutions. Having to get an incorporated entity&#x27;s permission to communicate will have dangerous consequences eventually. HTTPS everywhere is done with the best of intentions but it will be the centralizing push that provides juicy targets for government and corporate censorship.')
