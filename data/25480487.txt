In college and for a few years out of college I was terrible about doing this. I had easily 30+ domains I carried for a few years (some I renewed, some I replaced with other &quot;ideas&quot;). After thinking about it a lot I realised that spending money makes me feel like I&#x27;ve accomplished something without having to really do any &quot;work&quot;. I had to break the same habit when it came to buying things in general, I used &quot;retail therapy&quot; to make myself feel better and feel like I was solving a problem. Oftentimes buying that thing was not necessary for the change I really wanted to make but it made me feel like I was making an effort when really I was just throwing away money.<p>Domain names are the same way, I would purchase a domain for a project I dreamed up in my head thinking that buying the domain would motivate me to work on the project (wouldn&#x27;t want to throw away that money after all right? right?). All it did was give me the endorphin rush I desired and then let me go back to doing whatever I was doing (which was not working on said project).')
