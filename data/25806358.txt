What&#x27;s political? Even posting your own boobs can be political and some of these &quot;free speech&quot; sites won&#x27;t even do that, a hypocritical bunch. Some people like different things, many may even be disgusting and potentially illegal? Should I be sued because I won&#x27;t host such things? Also, if I host a server, where&#x27;s my freedom to only host what I want and be able to freely delete something on my server if I wish?<p>Freedom of speech isn&#x27;t freedom of reach. Just because you can&#x27;t say something on my server doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m censoring just like you can&#x27;t say anything you like in my house or to or about my kids lest I be free to kick you out. Where&#x27;s the freedom to host a sovereign domain without someone telling you that you have to host certain content?<p>Sounds like the bill&#x27;s as hypocritical and disastrous as the people wanting to implement it.')
