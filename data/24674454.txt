For example, if the keys are strings of length N, then it&#x27;s O(N) for just calculating the hash. Or if the keys are bitmap images, the hash function could apply image recognition and use recognized features as hash values. So, textbooks and other sources probably just ignore the key size and hash function because they could be literally anything.')
