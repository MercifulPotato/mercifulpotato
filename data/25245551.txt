It was out of reach financially, but also on its way out with the Commodore corporate problems. My parents drove me to B&amp;H Photo in Manhattan to take a look at one, but they were pretty honest about it being near the end of the line for Amiga, sadly.<p>The closest I got was a subscription to Amiga World and a NewTek magazine if I recall correctly. I must have read and re-read the same articles on the visual effects for Babylon 5 about a thousand times.<p>Despite the cost, the Toaster plus Amiga was insanely inexpensive compared to the alternatives of the time.')
