Item(by='throw_away_cto', descendants=None, kids=[25965920], score=None, time=1611977693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965712, text='I want:<p>- enough wealth to be retired in 5 years&#x2F;buy a house&#x2F;whatever<p>- a C-suite job with high status<p>- a job with a large degree of autonomy and responsibility<p>- to gain experience growing an engineering organization<p>- to gain experience shipping a great service&#x2F;product<p>But DEFINITELY NOT revenge. Selfishly speaking, I want all the above but to do it myself and go through the journey myself. Bringing the experienced person onboard will not give me the front seat of the journey which might be selfish. But what do we live for if not to live our lives and make decisions and risks and to be accountable for them? On the VC side of course they will pick the safest route to a successful exit and return. I just think it&#x27;s unfair but justifiable.')
