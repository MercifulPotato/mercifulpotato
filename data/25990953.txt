I&#x27;ve been buying things on Amazon for over a decade. For a while I got my groceries through them, I watch a lot of stuff on Prime Video. You would think they, of all people, know what I like. I can&#x27;t think of more than a couple times where anything suggested to me was actually something I wanted.<p>Even when I used FB, the ads were so off target from things I am interested in as to be laughable. Like, THIS is the best you can do with teams of engineers making &gt; $200k&#x2F;year throwing AI at everything? I&#x27;m not convinced that all of this tracking crap is just a way for them to market their ad business - &quot;Look we gather all this data about people, your ads will definitely be seen by people who we know for a fact will be interested in them because of coding and algorithms and machine learning and blah blah blah.&quot;')
