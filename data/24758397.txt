I have used it for a very long time, and it has been very stable and reliable. The only technical requirement is that you have control of a globally routable IPv4 address where you can set up a tunnel endpoint. I.e., &quot;carrier grade NAT&quot; (a contradiction in terms) won&#x27;t suffice.<p>I still use HE&#x27;s tunnel even though Spectrum Cable has provided good native IPv6 service for several years. Ping times over HE are just as good as native Spectrum, probably because everybody peers at the same place in Los Angeles.<p>The only problem with HE is that Netflix is clamping down on VPNs, and they consider a HE tunnel to be a VPN. So my home router advertises the native Spectrum prefix with a higher priority than the HE prefix.<p>My own frustration with IPv6 is that virtually no public hotspots support it. My Verizon phone does, so I often use it as a hotspot even when public WiFi is available.')
