If we accept the unfairness at the scale of a single individual, at which scale do we start getting troubled by the unfairness, and why?<p>Further, there are numerous occurrences where &quot;the systemic level&quot; and &quot;the individual level&quot; collide. Perhaps the most familiar examples are hiring, admissions, or promotion practices. For every given instance, you are hiring (admitting, promoting) an individual. So to &quot;counteract&quot; the unfairness at the systemic level you might have to be actively unfair at the individual level. It&#x27;s a bit like the infamous trolley problem all over again.')
