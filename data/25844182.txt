That is not to say 47 didn&#x27;t exasperate the problem. The city also had diversion programs for non-violent crimes, both misdemeanor and felony, before the proposition was enacted. SF has had an epidemic of car break-ins for the last decade and the organized shoplifting rings have been a thing for generations.<p>I never experienced drug or grocery stores locking up merchandise until I was visiting a friend in SF in 2007. Then again that was also the first time I saw used condoms and needles in the gutter, a person taking a dump between two parked cars, and two men humping in the bushes of Golden Gate Park.')
