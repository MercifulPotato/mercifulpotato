I once went in person for a qualification and being on one spot on the track was not particularly great, I&#x27;m glad I experienced (for the real experience) but I prefer watching on tv where a director chooses where to go to show the best of the race every given moment.<p>Some reasons are more personal than others but here&#x27;s my take (although I haven&#x27;t been watching in the past 3 years):<p>1. Nostalgia, I used to watch F1 every race as a kid with my dad (we never had sports pay tv, and F1 was broadcasted free as opposed to soccer [I&#x27;m european]); we used to watch Moto GP too for that same reason and this are the only 2 motorsport I actually would still watch, I don&#x27;t really have interest in any other, so this might be the most important factor.<p>2. races used to be more exciting, objectively: a combo of less technical&#x2F;financial differences between teams, less safety rules, old school tracks (that seem to be better suited for overtakes for some reason) made it so that more drivers were able to compete for each specific position. Financial standing of a certain team is nowadays the number 1 predictor of success. Give today&#x27;s mercedes to most drivers that can be called F1 drivers with a straight face and after getting to know the car they are going to do well, even compete with Hamilton. Same thing was probably true with Schumacher once he got to Ferrari (that was my nostalgia time, so it hurts to say): yes he was exceptional but 80% was the car (and arguably his ability to communicate what he&#x2F;it needed to the engineers), 10% his instinct on setup&#x2F;aerodynamic, 10% him being truly unique (at the time) on wet conditions.<p>3. pit stops, used to be more exciting (and dangerous with fuel refill) I suppose but I think it still brings a sparkle to the race, strategy and actual timing of the stops are a big moment that can make or break a driver race<p>4. one race is not a good measure for determining the overall excitement for the season: first of all there are better races and worse races; then overall there is some excitement from how much risk taking and calculation are involved in a race depending of current championship standings. Also, if you are so inclined there is drama in between races (usually not into that personally)<p>5. last, you said you followed Raikonnen: if you literally just watched 1 driver (not sure if it&#x27;s possible, but I think so) by setting the camera only on his car, I&#x27;m sure you were doomed to boredom, the &quot;race as a whole&quot; is at least a bit fun on every race, but the race of a single driver? probably booooring: 2 hours and unless the driver somehow is fighting all the times (good car but classified last somehow?) there&#x27;s going to be a lot of nothing going on.<p>Also races with mixed weather are very unpredictable and add a huge variable, making for usually awesome races in my opinion. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t happen very often.')
