Item(by='bruckie', descendants=None, kids=[25996928], score=None, time=1612221356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25993577, text='&gt; Someone who is going to try heroin is going to try heroin.<p>Tautologically correct, but I think the implication here is that availability doesn&#x27;t affect whether someone will try heroin. I have a hard time believing that: it seems obvious that on the margin, there are some people who would try heroin if it were easier to get (and wouldn&#x27;t if it were harder). We can argue about how big that margin is, but it seems hard to argue that it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>(Apologies if that&#x27;s not actually what you were implying.)')
