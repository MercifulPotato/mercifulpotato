Snopes? She sent me a link to a blog that mentioned some Snopes scandal, as if saying Snoopes can&#x27;t be trusted 100% (and yeah sadly there was a scandal involving the founders of Snopes).<p>Of course she has her cheap-o fake-news Wordpress sites as her &quot;sources&quot; about her &quot;knowledge&quot;, and she&#x27;s convinced they&#x27;re telling the truth. I end up seeing the equivalance, why do I believe the network of MSM sites are telling the truth when she can believe the same thing of the network of fake-news sites? One thing is, MSM sites fact-check each other, but a lot of things she thinks are fake news aren&#x27;t being &quot;fact-checked&quot; by MSM...<p>A funny thing though, she&#x27;s a &quot;Bill Gates wants to kill Africans through vaccinations&quot;, and she said &quot;Search for this theory, but don&#x27;t use Google, they&#x27;re paid off by big pharma, use Duck Duck Go.&quot;. Then I had to tell her, &quot;You do know Duck Duck Go uses results from Bing... which is owned by Microsoft?&quot; (I think she knows the BG&#x2F;Microsoft connection).')
