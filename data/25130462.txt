At least by taking away the megaphone that&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Even if there&#x27;s no specific law that backs him up, that alone may save lives.<p>Second, even if technically not legal, presidential orders are OFTEN followed. It can be challenged in the courts for years but in the mean time, an order like that will probably have the effect of getting at least another 50M masks put on. That&#x27;s a fucking win.<p>The other thing that is 100% legal, is the executive branch can restrict funding in specific ways if a state does not behave. If I was Biden, I would start there.')
