Probably not.</i><p>It does not. Youtube does not explicitly, or implicitly, provide the user a license of any type. Youtube has <i>licensed</i> the right to provide a temporary copy of a video to a user.<p><i>Why that should be youtube-dl&#x27;s fault is yet another question, of course. </i><p>It normally wouldn&#x27;t be...except that some idiot decided to include unit tests to make sure that youtube-dl could be used to download music videos covered by RIAA licenses. That basically makes the RIAA&#x27;s case, especially since youtube-dl must be regularly updated to handle Google&#x27;s countermeasures.')
