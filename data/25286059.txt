So if I am a bit skeptical, I hope you understand.<p>&gt;  Since meat animals neither photosynthesize nor can they convert energy from plants with 100% efficiency, eating meat means you just indirectly eat even more plants.<p>Because humans can convert energy from plants with 100% efficiency right? Humans are much less efficient than herbivores. So using your logic, we are back to eating herbivores. Sorry.<p>&gt; We could farm people and kill them for meat by the same argument kill less animals by the numbers.<p>&quot;it&#x27;s sophistry&quot;<p>&quot;The best diet for humans, animals and the environment is the hunterer gatherer diet. Unfortunately, that isn&#x27;t possible with modern civilization. So the current industrialized omnivore diet is the best we can do. If you truly want to destroy the environment and animals, then industrialized veganism will do that.&quot;<p>If you truly care about the environment and animals, then go live a hunterer gatherer life. It&#x27;s the absolute best diet you can have for the environment and animals. If you hate animals, environment and humans, be a vegan. I know your lack of nutrient has robbed you of your ability to concentrate and think, but try your best. Even a vegan suffering from vegan mental fog should be able to understand why the hunter-gatherer diet is so good for the environment and animals.<p>Who do you think harms the environment more? A privileged virtue signaling vegan consuming a globalized industrialized vegan diet or a native living off the land? Which do you think is responsible for more pollution, oil use, animal deaths, etc? The privileged virtue signaling vegan.')
