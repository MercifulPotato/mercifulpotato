That I have a server that renders this table, pre-populated with onClick handlers that magically know what function to call to tell my browser state that it should focus a specific workflow?<p>Or are you suggesting that I reload the entire application to use &quot;pure HTML interactions&quot;?<p>I really want to understand - how are you making this construct both not fragile to iterate on AND not require a page reload or server round-trip after the user clicks on a Table row.')
