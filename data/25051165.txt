I don&#x27;t think this is something I&#x27;m willing to change my mind on.<p>Prisons are literally one of the worst things we&#x27;ve made. They serve no purpose other than to dehumanize, rape, assault, and other fucked shit to &quot;undesirables.&quot; It allows us to put problems to be solved to a later date, instead of addressing them head on and making sure it doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Prison should be an optional rehabilitation option for people, with it potentially being forced on a very very small minority of the population. No more than 0.01% of the population should be in forced rehabilitation, and no more than 1% in optional rehabilitation.')
