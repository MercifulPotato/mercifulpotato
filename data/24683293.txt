That really did take away the skill from driving and make it technical arms race. There is still skill required now.<p>I do agree rules have killed some of the fun, it seems to be the reliance on aerodynamics as a means to gain an advantage after the limits on engine power and lifetime (top teams having a &quot;qualifying engine&quot; that was destroyed after one qually session, and race engines designed to last one race was crazy though).<p>Aero being so important means following other cars for an overtake puts the car behind at a real disadvantage, hence the &quot;DRS&quot; hack.<p>The trouble with F1 is that the &quot;anything goes&quot; environment they had until the 80s&#x2F;90s will always be more exciting than the rules they have now to stop drivers killing themselves. They did seem to choose rules that disproportionately worked against creating fun races though.')
