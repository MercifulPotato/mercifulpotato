Since I had f-all to do other than walk for several hundred more miles, I offered to lend them an extra pair of eyes to speed up the search. It turned out that 2 of them were dead, one killed by lightening under a tree, the other fell off the ridge. We never found the 3rd cow during all the time that I was there (4 days in total). They told me that it&#x27;s normal for herd animals that when they break lose from the herd for too long that they become very hard to integrate back. Once you separate them for a few days and they learn to survive by themselves, even you catch them they&#x27;re becoming very likely candidates to bolt on you in the future.<p>weeks later the farmer texted me to say thanks once more and to update me: The 3rd cow has turned up (weeks later). And since the animal was back it already tried to do a runner on him a couple of times.<p>Maybe this sounds silly but I think humans are very much alike. Once people are happy by themselves and able to live without the need for friends (either due to circumstance or free will) it becomes difficult to integrate them back. I value friends and those I know from 30 years ago. But making new friends? It&#x27;s not for want, but it&#x27;s impossible to get close to anyone the older you get.<p>See also:<p>- Lancet study on &quot;the psychological impact of quarantine&quot;:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)30460-8&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a><p>- consider men especially. very few of my male friends are actually able to create new friendships as they age. women are more skilled and open to maintain relationships. if you think this is hyperbole think about your own or other people&#x27;s dad&#x27;s in their 50ies or older and imagine them going out by themselves to actively bring new people into the group&#x2F;family for the purpose of becoming friends. (friendships don&#x27;t work that way, they rely on common struggle that is needed to build trust. the older we get the less our chances of going through a common struggle (like puberty).
