It’s a massively scalable distributed system that has been running in production for many years at Twitter, Apple, Netflix and other places (more recently it’s being replaced by Kubernetes, but that’s beside the point of this thread).<p>Mesos is interesting as a whole but it also has some parts that are notoriously hard to get right (like their Paxos implementation).<p>It also contains an RPC library that implements an actor model and uses futures and promises (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;mesos&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;3rdparty&#x2F;libprocess" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;mesos&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;3rdparty&#x2F;libproc...</a>), as well as a header-only utility library called Stout (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;mesos&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;3rdparty&#x2F;stout" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;mesos&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;3rdparty&#x2F;stout</a>) with a lot of useful functions.')
