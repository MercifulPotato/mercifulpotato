At least it would have been better than nothing, and the safety issues are very well known.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-vax, by any means. Just trying to understand why we chose this path rather than tried-and-true. I&#x27;m sure plenty of people would be a lot less conspiracy-minded if the vaccine was just a run of the mill recombinant protein particle one, even if we needed boosters 2-3x a year.')
