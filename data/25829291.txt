In reality, there is no upper bound. Software engineering can and does involve unexpected problems that would take infinite time to solve.<p>Ergo, project timelines are more accurately averaged between {min_time} and {infinite}, and, given that, remaining risk is the only true metric that should be reported. I.e. how far are we along in terms of project completed, such that we can say only x% of the project remains, and therefore that 1-x% did not explode.')
