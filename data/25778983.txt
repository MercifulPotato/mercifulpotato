Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610644193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775473, text='&gt; I have seen countless comments from vegans that said meat eaters should be butchered instead of animals. The comments didn&#x27;t get deleted. An no, I did&#x27;t want to complain about them, venting is healthy and without victims on the internet.<p>That&#x27;s the difference between merely saying something, and saying something with the likelihood of actually carrying it out.<p>Parler would still be around if there not been an mob attack on the capitol connected to it (and no legitimate fears of further mob attacks on inauguration day, etc.)  If vegans actually started and organized butchering of meat eaters, I&#x27;m pretty sure the forums where they planned such things would get shut down quickly.')
