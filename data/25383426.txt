The essential point of async is to be thread-like, but with lower overhead; or in environments where you cannot use processes and threads - but there&#x27;s no very convincing reason for testing to be it.  And choosing to prioritize dealing with runtime overhead over dealing with coding complexity isn&#x27;t an obvious win.  Note that promises make sense for processes and threads too; the key question is whether you really block, or virtually block.<p>Nothing wrong with async code; but it&#x27;s often sold as the &quot;obvious&quot; solution to, well, several things happening and some of them taking long - and it&#x27;s just not that great a solution.')
