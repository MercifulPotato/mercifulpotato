Item(by='baloleanuandrei', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1608547632, title='Ask HN: Building a database of A/B testing examples', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hey everybody,<p>I’m currently gathering examples of A&#x2F;B testing from various websites, everything will be added in an Airtable, which will be embedded in a website. The plan is to have 33% of the DB available for free, and the rest under a paid plan, something like $14.9 per year or similar.<p>For now, I have the following information for every example:\n- Company&#x2F;Website\n- Website Type (SaaS&#x2F;eCommerce&#x2F;Content etc.)\n- Website Business Type (B2B&#x2F;B2C&#x2F;B2B2C)\n- Website Industry (Web design&#x2F;Development&#x2F;Marketing&#x2F;Automations&#x2F;Finance etc.)\n- Specific page&#x2F;URL where the A&#x2F;B test was live\n- Variations (2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4)\n- Winner Variations (if applicable)\n- Date when the test was first detected (if applicable)\n- Date when the winner variation was live (if applicable)\n- Elements used in the test (Homepage banner&#x2F;Checkout page&#x2F;Product page&#x2F;Pricing page buttons&#x2F;Landing page bullets etc)\n- Winning logic (a couple of sentences of why we think the winning element was better than the variations) (if applicable)<p>Please note that everything is still WIP, some of the above might be removed or we might add something new if we can.<p>Right now, I need help with a couple of questions:\n- Is this something of interest? Even if you’re not willing to pay to have access to the rest of the DB, I would still be interested if you guys are interested in this or not.\n- Besides the information listed above, is there something else you would like to see&#x2F;need? \nLooking forward to hearing every piece of advice you might have!<p>Tks')
