Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603742183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897935, text='&gt;Up until the Surface line, Microsoft never shipped any computers at all, much less &quot;malware ridden&quot; ones. I think that exactly illuminates how high of a mountain Microsoft would have needed to climb to earn people&#x27;s trust when Microsoft is also in general mainstream mindsets saddled with the problems of other company&#x27;s behaviors.<p>The root problem was Microsoft was content extracting high margin license fees and not having to do any customer support by pawning it off on &quot;manufacturers&quot;.  This is not a result of other company&#x27;s behavior, this is Microsoft&#x27;s behavior that it chose to sit back and take advantage of the fact that people had no choice.  Nobody told them they couldn&#x27;t get out there and offer a premium product at a premium price and provide premium service.  But Microsoft decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it for them.<p>Apple did, and so Apple earned its spoils.  Microsoft still has time, they can tell their shareholders that we&#x27;re aiming for the long term, not next year&#x27;s cash flow.  They can spend the next 10 years developing hardware and supporting software and providing customer support at stores. The idea that a company with the resources of Microsoft can&#x27;t create a competitor to the experience Apple offers is ludicrous to me.  The only reason would be that it lowers their current rent seeking margins.')
