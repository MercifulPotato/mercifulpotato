I would suggest it shows that the vast majority of people having knee surgery didn&#x27;t need it in the first place, or haven&#x27;t tried alternatives.<p>If your knee is genuinely shot to bits and needs replacing with a artificial part, I can&#x27;t see any scenario where placebo surgery would relieve pain anywhere close to an actual arthroplasty.')
