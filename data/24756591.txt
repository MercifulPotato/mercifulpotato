The city I was going to didn&#x27;t have good public transport.  Sure if you go to one of the cities in Europe (or Asia) at anyone can name there is good transport. However even in Europe (or Asia) there are a lot of tiny cities and towns either without good transport, or limited transport. (There are of course some tiny towns with good transport)<p>Notice above I qualified it with Europe or Asia. If you go to South America, or Africa odds are even the city you are going to doesn&#x27;t have good transit for most people. (A handful are building, but there are lot of cities that could have good transit that don&#x27;t have it)')
