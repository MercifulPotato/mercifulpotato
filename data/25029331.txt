Look at the money people donate to streamers!<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this statement.<p>What you and I see are those with the means to do this.  I knew quite a few techie types who used to spend fairly enormous amounts on strippers.<p>However, the system itself is rigged against those who are barely scraping by.  Here&#x27;s my anecdote from the system:<p>I had a car seized over a <i>single</i> $44 parking ticket (parked longer than 3 days at the commuter train station terminal--which you can exceed by being a couple hours late after the weekend).  Once it was towed (instant $200 fee tacked on) and in storage for a couple days, the fees were worth more than the car!<p>And they auctioned the car <i>before</i> the time to contest the ticket had even expired.  I would have had to cough up several hundred dollars that I would not get back just to contest the ticket.  &quot;Innocent until proven broke.&quot;<p>If your institutional superiors yank your slave chain and you have the temerity to not show up immediately and say &quot;Yes, massah!&quot;--you will get the whip.<p>As someone in tech, this was just stupidly annoying and I&#x27;m probably going to save money--my insurance went down by almost the value of the car.<p>However, they swept almost <i>thirty</i> cars with mine.  And were laughing about it.<p>At least one (I would actually estimate probably about half) of those belongs to someone who can&#x27;t afford to lose that car but can&#x27;t afford to get it back now that its been towed.<p><i>I</i> can absorb losing a 25 year old car.  Most people driving one cannot.<p>&quot;The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.&quot;')
