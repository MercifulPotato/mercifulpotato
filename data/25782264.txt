But a place where they congregate and communicate, then it certainly is, because they&#x27;ve been blocked from most other platforms.<p>It&#x27;s not a coincidence that places with little to no moderation like parler, voat, 4chan, 8chan, various subreddits before reddit decided to crack down, etc. are flooded with these people. It happens over and over again and is entirely predictable.<p>Your point about the potential for government restriction is valid, but the reality is that if these platforms are predictably flooded with bigotry and violence and don&#x27;t have a plan for dealing with it, it&#x27;s very likely that eventually a plan will be imposed on them. It&#x27;s a complicated issue, one that unfortunately Hacker News handles discussion of very poorly.')
