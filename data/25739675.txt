(disclaimer - I&#x27;m not advocating for &#x2F; against the action either way).<p>In civisilised society &#x2F; discourse one must assume rules of engagement in order for co-operative interaction between agents to take place.  To take an extreme demonstration - if you club me over the head and steal my meat while I approach you to trade, then a co-operative interaction cannot take place; physically so.<p>If we impose the additional rule that we must continue to observe those rules of engagement with agents who themselves have ignored them - then it&#x27;s pretty clear (at least in the extreme example) that we expose ourselves to exploitation.  And many philosophies and cultures do impose this rule (Christianity - for example).<p>In the process of discourse - it&#x27;s plausible to argue that the ability to express oneself is one such rule of engagement.  So, this ISP might feel that FB etc have broken the rules of engagment, and they might feel that they are under no obligation to adhere to those rules for agents that themselves aren&#x27;t playing ball.<p>Now you can challenge this line of thinking on all sorts of interesting grounds - and I encourage folks to do so.  However - the discussion gets nuanced fast...<p>I don&#x27;t think you can just claim this action as prima-facie self contradictory - and to do so, I feel exposes the bias and lack of generosity in those attempting understand this action.')
