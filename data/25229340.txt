Sure theoretically there was long term a way to salvage it. But it was always unrealistic given the large change in economics and society it requires.<p>But there is a difference between a bad and a even worse situation.<p>So just because we can&#x27;t reach a perfect outcome doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t try to reach a better outcome.<p>Because of this I really don&#x27;t like arguments like &quot;we are at the point of no return&quot; as it&#x27;s often used as a argument that supposedly any improvement is pointless. (Through I think you do not mean it that way).<p>I mean the way we are heading will like not directly lead to a extinction of humans, but it might make live unbearable for most of humanity and it also might prevent us from reaching the necessary tech to survive other extinction events.<p>But this also means that &quot;just making thinks a bit better&quot; can in the long term have a major difference even if it won&#x27;t prevent a climate catastrophe.')
