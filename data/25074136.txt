It was an amazing subject that I absolutely loved. One caveat, the teacher was an absolute authoritarian dictator that took away a lot of our freedom in how we were allowed to take this class (e.g. you didn&#x27;t take your book to lecture? You fail the class instantly). That completely killed the fun for me of the whole course. I think there are parallels here with the working world.<p>Contrast that with another course called gaming and technology. It was relatively similar in content, but the teacher was quite good at facilitating and slightly below average at teaching. This resulted in people who aren&#x27;t independent learners not liking the course and the independent learners loved the course.<p>Ultimately, there were also all-star teachers whom everyone loved.<p>One of the fondest memories I had was when I went to an honours program and saw teachers auditioning in front of us. One teacher was so amazing at presenting that I didn&#x27;t even care for what she was teaching, I just took her course because she was an amazing presenter (and teacher, I later found out).<p>When I look at the satisfaction from those courses, I can see how external circumstances at work are way more important than the work you&#x27;re actually going to do.')
