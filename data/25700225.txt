I don&#x27;t think the development environment sucks, but you are free to disagree. In my opinion, the developer experience is ultraslick, it&#x27;s easy for beginners to get started with and there is very little type theory to getting started.<p>Yes, Haskell has been bad at teaching to beginners, by forcing people to learn theory before build something, but it has been really catching on for the better recently.<p>I think a &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; programming language can be subjective, but I have never tried more enjoyable languages than Elm and Haskell. I feel confident using these languages because of the static types.<p>Some will probably say that the usefulness of types is an illusion and I can live with that, but I don&#x27;t think it is.')
