Then when they&#x27;re adults they lack any kind of critical thinking skills because they&#x27;ve been miseducated and they&#x27;re easy targets for disinformation.<p>To me, the solution is obviously better education. When people believe the Earth is round only because that&#x27;s what they were told, it&#x27;s not that hard for a clever talker to convince them the Earth could be flat. When people know the Earth is round because they actually understand the physics behind it, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re ever going to convince them the Earth is flat.<p>Instead of admitting our education system has failed, people&#x27;s ignorance is being used as an excuse to tighten control over the media even further.')
