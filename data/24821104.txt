It&#x27;s just virtually never the case.<p>It&#x27;s a lot more common that the respondent is trying to get points on SO and wants to appear smarter than he&#x2F;she is.<p>&gt; If anything, your type of criticism does not respect the low effort involved in almost every question asked.<p>This reminds me of my years in university. There was always a professor with this attitude, and it was <i>always</i> the case that the professor was misunderstanding and not helping the student.<p>Students do ask lots of questions where a professor rightfully says &quot;You don&#x27;t want to do X, you want Y.&quot; But the few professors that <i>insist</i> on it are always problematic. Thank God for TAs and other professors one can turn to.')
