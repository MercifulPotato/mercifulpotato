I wanted to make the same points, but my reply to this comment was much angrier and accusatory, and was not nearly as civilized or mature as yours. I will try to emulate this style of rebuttal in the future, and to be a little nicer when I can, even when I&#x27;m angry. Your username definitely fits!!')
