My hiring was actually a trap, in that my job was mainly to fix and&#x2F;or fire an entire team of people. Nobody on my team liked me, nor did they like the direction the company was going, so a nontrivial part of my job was monitoring that my team doing anything at all in the right direction.<p>It was rough, because I was held accountable for things that my team refused to take part in. I was a new manager, and my boss had made it clear that I should basically do whatever it took to not fire anyone. I was a new manager, and I tried really hard to work with the team to get them on board, but ultimately there just wasn&#x27;t any resolution other than &quot;These people aren&#x27;t right for this company&quot;. By the end of it (meaning when I quit), I was so burnt out I didn&#x27;t care. I fired two, two quit, one changed teams. I got terrible reviews that year, but I also didn&#x27;t really care. I didn&#x27;t want to be good at what they wanted out of me, I learned.')
