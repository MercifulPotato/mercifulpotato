Unless you&#x27;re going to set up an Anki deck for your Zoom meeting notes, it&#x27;s unrealistic to try to remember action points from every Zoom call we&#x27;re on. The brain is an efficient machine, and it will naturally remember things that come up often enough. It works quite well on its own. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever sat down to try to remember how to write a for loop in whatever my preferred coding language is at the time - you just remember it after a few semi-regular lookups.<p>If you feel your memory is limited in an area you do value instant recall that doesn&#x27;t inherently produce regular repetition, there are ways to steer your long term memory consolidation. For example, you can train yourself to remember everyone&#x27;s names when you meet them, if you value that. If you don&#x27;t value it or put any particular effort into training it, there&#x27;s no reason to think you&#x27;ve gone senile if you forget the name of most people you meet the first few times.<p>For most things, I think the second brain solution is ideal. You value something enough to want to be able to recall it at a moment&#x27;s notice, but you don&#x27;t have any real need to instantly recall it without reference. We&#x27;re not taking closed book exams outside of school [1]. This is where all the Zoom notes and book quotes are placed, where you can further digest, interpret and later recall them if and when they become relevant.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortelabs.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;knowledge-building-blocks-the-new-meaning-of-notes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortelabs.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;knowledge-building-blocks-the-new-...</a>')
