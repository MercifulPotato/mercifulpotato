Hopefully any similar signs of long term side-effects will be discovered before low-risk groups start to receive the vaccine.<p>Personally since I belong to a low-risk group, there will be quite some time before the line reaches me where I need to make a decision, in which more data will be available from high-risk groups. It will also take time for my country currently pressured health care system to allocate resources for vaccinations without causing even more problems. My current estimate is many months from now.<p>Outside of long term side-effects I am concerned about how long the protection last. It is difficult to calculate risk without knowing that data point.')
