Item(by='war1025', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609104466, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551941, text='Having just gone through and looked up a bunch of articles criticizing Jordan Peterson (Most of them seem to be written by Matt McManus, so I guess he&#x27;s trying to make some sort of name for himself by association), it seems to me that basically the people who like Peterson like him for his life advice and the people that don&#x27;t like him don&#x27;t like him because of his political and philosophical views.<p>I guess it seems completely unremarkable that someone would have useful things to say in one regard while having less useful things to say in another.<p>Also I guess I view him in the context of a university professor who wrote a book and has some lectures online, not in the context of the mega-celebrity he became. I think being catapulted to fame like that is bound to mess up pretty well everyone and probably also muddy their message quite a bit.<p>I mean, at its core none of the things Peterson has to say are really all that revolutionary, they are pretty basic life advice. &quot;Take responsibility for your life&quot;, etc.<p>Obviously there is an unmet need for that basic life advice because people (particularly young men) ate it up.<p>One article complained about him relaying a story of getting a kid to eat. My only conclusion is the person that was complaining doesn&#x27;t have kids, because his story was extremely relatable, and I&#x27;d guess basically universal among parents.<p>Anyway, yes if you try putting Jordan Peterson up on a pedestal, he&#x27;ll probably fall off it. If you view him as someone that maybe could give some good advice while you&#x27;d otherwise just be killing time anyway, I guess I think he holds up to that metric pretty well.')
