I know at least the older Amlogic (805?) based boards run a custom kernel, which ended up stuck at a specific version. You can&#x27;t just install any arm distro on them, it needs to be specifically built with the hacked up kernel. And support tends to end sooner and get spotty (it looks like Odroid C1 is finally supported by Armbian, but hadn&#x27;t been for quite some time). I don&#x27;t know how much of this applies to this specific board, but there&#x27;s a lot we take for granted in x86&#x2F;amd64 land.')
