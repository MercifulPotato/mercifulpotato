And they usually are also implying that <i>compatibility</i> should be defined solely by Sun&#x2F;Oracle, ie. that Oracle should be allowed to require your own Java implementation to be fully functional and 100% compliant to their spec before it is in any way legal, and implementing a mere subset of relevant functionality is not permissible.')
