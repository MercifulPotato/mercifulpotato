The contrast between &#x27;black&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27; is still extreme relative to what people normally have around them. The same goes for the neon colors. They are &#x27;diluted&#x27;, but they&#x27;re still incredibly garish and generally look unnatural. If you don&#x27;t like the word &#x27;unnatural&#x27; just replace it with &#x27;digital looking&#x27;.<p>Now, looking &#x27;unnatural&#x27; isn&#x27;t necessarily bad (especially for a website interface) and something like text should definitely have a high contrast, but it&#x27;s definitely something to keep in mind.')
