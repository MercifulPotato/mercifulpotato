Hypocrisy is pretending Twitter are a free speech platform. They don&#x27;t even respect your President&#x27;s free speech.<p>Twitter attaches &quot;Learn how Voting by mail is safe and Secure&quot;to his posts now too.<p>Like how exactly do they know how well the mail-in voting will go, and the future?<p>Some states have laws so they won&#x27;t even start counting the mail in votes until election night, and there is a hard deadline to declare a president. Do you really think it will go well? Or do they want to drag out the counting for weeks, and create instability?<p>Also, why take the chance your mail in ballot might be lost or rejected. Tens of Thousands have been rejected in past elections. Just vote in person if you can. \nDon&#x27;t listen to Twitter fact checkers. They are actually promoting the higher risk option, thats easier to cheat with.')
