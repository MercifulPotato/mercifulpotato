I use it as personal and work related knowledge base. It has been developping quickly. I really appreciate publishing features and github sync. I&#x27;m self hosting knowledge graphs for my team and despite some early hiccups it&#x27;s working really well and intuitive. Glad to see it on hn as well.')
