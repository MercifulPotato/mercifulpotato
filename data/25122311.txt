I can vote in elections without being affiliated with a party. In Germany, for example you don&#x27;t have the choice but to have your race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;religion&#x2F;address on file with the central government.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not complaining about how it is in Germany&#x2F;other countries in Europe. The trust in government is quite high here, and for a good reason :)')
