Or where they mixed up districts across multiple states when attempting to prove there were more votes than residents?<p>&gt; take ballots out of suit cases<p>You mean the official ballot cases that all ballots are stored in?<p>&gt; Keep denying the fraud. That&#x27;s how you destroy democracy.<p>Take a long, hard look at your media sources. You seem like a smart guy and you&#x27;ve been fed a bunch of stuff by professional grifters and scam artists. This lawsuit is going to disappear like all the others not because there&#x27;s some grand conspiracy, but that _people actually don&#x27;t like Trump and didn&#x27;t vote for him_.')
