Eh, I have that with X thanks to Intel&#x27;s drivers.  Though I absolutely understand that&#x27;s not a universal experience.<p>Different display DPIs?  Anything that falls back to Xwayland (which unfortunately is still a lot of applications) look like blurry garbage for obvious reasons, which means it&#x27;s actually unusable in a lot of circumstances.  And that&#x27;s assuming solid application-level support (I seem to recall Firefox had mixed DPI regressions that were recently resolved, but that&#x27;s only a vague recollection).<p>TBH, I was really <i>really</i> rooting for this feature as it could be really nice, and I was deeply disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work out.<p>Touchpad gestures?  Okay, legit these are really nice!  Three-finger workspace switching in Gnome is pretty slick.  OTOH, the lack of that feature isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker, either.<p>General touchpad improvements?  Funny thing is, libinput is being backported into Xorg, which means that you can get a lot of those benefits without switching.  For example, I&#x27;m using Firefox with libinput2 and it&#x27;s a fantastic improvement!<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d love a killer feature that&#x27;d push me to Wayland and cause me to put up with all the functional regressions.  But I simply haven&#x27;t found one... :(<p>So, at this point, I&#x27;m waiting for the regressions to be resolved.  Hopefully we&#x27;ll get global hotkeys, broadly supported screencasting, better application-level support for things like mixed DPI, and lots of bug fixes so I can finally make the switch!')
