There is little specific about, say, author perspectives, level of formalism vs appeals to intuition, interesting proofs or explanations of particular theorems&#x2F;topics, helpful or not indexes, etc.<p>Saying &quot;X book is great&quot; or &quot;I liked book X&quot; and not giving a reason does nothing for me. As written, these reviews detract from the list because they draw the eye to no benefit. As a rule of thumb, the words &quot;good&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;epic&quot; should be avoided at all costs in this kind of writing<p>I apologize for being harsh -- I&#x27;m giving this feedback because I didn&#x27;t notice any affiliate links which suggests to me that you do want for this to be a useful resource (not that it wouldn&#x27;t be true if it had affiliate links, just would suggest other motivations took greater priority)<p>Thanks for spending the time on it regardless')
