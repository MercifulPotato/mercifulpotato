We all learned a dozen short-long pairs at school (like 눈 <i>nun</i> being either eye or snow), and of course the education got all of us tricked into thinking that we&#x27;re making these distinctions (if only we try hard enough).  But looking at it objectively, I don&#x27;t think a single person around me used vowel length distinction.  If you have to &quot;think&quot; whether a word is long or short, that means the distinction is dead.  No English speaker has to &quot;think&quot; whether <i>fan</i> or <i>pan</i> is the correct word.  An actual sound distinction comes automatically for native speakers.<p>Similarly, ㅐ&#x2F;ㅔ (&quot;ae&quot;&#x2F;&quot;e&quot;) distinction was dead before I was born, but schools insisted that they&#x27;re well and alive.  Not sure what they&#x27;re teaching these days.')
