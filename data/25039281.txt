Pretty much any niche market you can think of will be 100&#x27;s of times larger.  You can literally put pretty rocks you pick up in a streambed and generate higher revenues.  With a little hard work and luck, some of the companies listed will grow 1000&#x27;s of times in the future (but they&#x27;ll still be considered &quot;small businesses&quot;).<p>To argue the other side, an old boss of mine would say that some of the products listed are really features.  One of his favorite mantras was: &quot;A feature is not a product and a product is not a company.&quot;<p>To respond to the &quot;is it really just this hard&quot;, well... yes and no.  If you are unwilling to market&#x2F;promote&#x2F;sell your product or just give most of the value away, then sure, it&#x27;s very very hard.  However, if you&#x27;re willing to hustle on the &quot;business&quot; side of things, then it may not be that hard.  One thing that too many techies get wrong is that they try to be innovative in everything.  Don&#x27;t -- just innovate along one axis.  For everything else, just copy best practices and you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Side note: commission driven sales is a viable strategy for <i>some</i> product categories in <i>some</i> markets.  But for most, it&#x27;s not.  Remember, in business, almost everything is context dependent.  Any good tactical advice of &quot;do X&quot; is also bad advice in a different context.  And vice versa.')
