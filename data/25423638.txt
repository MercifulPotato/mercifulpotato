Those are two very different claims.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any doubt about the former claim, personally. The latter though, I think it&#x27;s too early to tell, especially since we&#x27;ve seen recently how certain hackers have explicitly started putting bait signs from other nation-states to misdirect.')
