The key for me was enjoyment... playing with others, picking the kind of music I vibe with, not bothering with exercises that are devoid of emotion and joy. I slapped frets on my violin to make the learning curve easier, which made a few people raise an eyebrow, but... I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m here to enjoy it, not to become a purist.<p>Can I real sheet music? Nope. Do I understand all the fancy words describing techniques? No. Am I good at this? Good enough that when I play, people dance. That counts as a success in my book.')
