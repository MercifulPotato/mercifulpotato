Losses mean that outflow is greater than inflow, so wages can be related to losses, but they are not mutually exclusive.<p>Cuts to jobs and reduced hours can be because of losses, or they could also be due to efficiency gains, in which they could be related to profits instead. Divisions and jobs can be cut because they make neither profit or loss.<p>Employee&#x27;s don&#x27;t share in losses or profits unless their compensation is somehow tied to profits.')
