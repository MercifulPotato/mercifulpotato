Doesn&#x27;t seem to be borne out by benchmarks comparing chips with varying iGPU resources and same memory setup.<p>Sure, they&#x27;re going to be meomry bound some of the time, and it depends on what kind of bw&#x2F;compute balance the GPU code is tuned for... but we didn&#x27;t stop putting more cores and wider SIMD on chips either just because then current SW didn&#x27;t fully utilize them.')
