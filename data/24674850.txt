But the protections for speech and the press (ie the ones actually relevant to Assange) have no such qualification. If they were prosecuting him for, say, standing in front of a government building yelling &quot;Down with the NSA!&quot;, the fact that he&#x27;s not a citizen would arguably be in any way relevant.')
