You just have to follow some instructions point by point and if you do not understand something, tough luck, the professor has already moved to the next exercise.</i><p>People shouldn&#x27;t just accept this sort of thing as normal. You&#x27;re paying (in the US or UK anyway) a lot of money for a degree level education. That means it needs to be fit for purpose, and if you&#x27;re not learning then it isn&#x27;t. You need to stop the lecturer and ask them to go over the point you didn&#x27;t understand, or ask for additional time after the lab, or at a push, make a complaint to the course leader that the lecturer isn&#x27;t teaching you well enough.<p>Learning to stand up for yourself and ask for what you need is a big part of the university experience.')
