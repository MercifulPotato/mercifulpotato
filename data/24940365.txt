Item(by='fareesh', descendants=None, kids=[24940814], score=None, time=1604047935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24933054, text='There seems to be a premise in the USA that if Russia has a hand in true information coming to light, the bigger story is about Russia&#x27;s hand in it, and not the information itself.<p>This narrative has been seen a lot, and often times it is invoked as the default narrative whenever things are being claimed in a particular political direction.<p>I would like to question this at a fundamental level. At what point does the information itself become pertinent? Shouldn&#x27;t the information itself, if true, always be the focus of the story? If the information is unverified, shouldn&#x27;t there be some attempt to verify it? If it cannot be verified - then it&#x27;s probably best to dismiss it, but if people involved in the situation start coming forward to verify the context of the information, shouldn&#x27;t it merit further investigation?<p>There is this guy - Tony Bobulinski. He&#x27;s a navy veteran from a family of veterans and he&#x27;s pretty much coming forward to say that the emails are all true. In his absence, it&#x27;s ambiguous, but now that&#x27;s come forward, why is there still hesitation to take this story seriously?<p>Frankly I find it difficult to believe that there is no coordinated media attempt to silence this story because at a personal level many of them want to cover up anything that makes one candidate look bad.')
