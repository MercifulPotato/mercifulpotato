How am I priviliged if people from a foreign country colonized another part of the world? I and my ancestors didn&#x27;t have anything to do with this. Our country was, in fact, &quot;colonized&quot; for more than a hundred years too.<p>All the minority groups you just mentioned are also Caucasian, so they are priviliged, but at the same time they... are not? In your original post you made a racial claim that just didn&#x27;t make much sense to me at all, same as all race-related stereotypes that try to somehow classify groups of billions.')
