They indeed will have both for another year.  There was no requirement the Stream product even use the CentOS name.<p>CentOS was a community project whose leadership and control was taken over (acqui-hired as you say) by Red Hat and then it&#x27;s core use case for the majority of people actually using it was discontinued.  That is a statement of facts that happened as I understand them, not some spin on my part.<p>If Red Hat had not stepped in, perhaps some of CentOS problems (trouble getting releases out on time) would have been worse, or perhaps some other companies would have stepped in.  We don&#x27;t know, but we do know that CentOS has not been changed to be something different than it was before.  It used to be a free re-spin of RHEL.  Going forward it&#x27;s something entirely different.<p>Red Hat always had the option to stop funding&#x2F;providing resources to CentOS and name their new thing something else, but they didn&#x27;t, and now they&#x27;ve effectively co-opted CentOS to be something different than it was originally intended to be.')
