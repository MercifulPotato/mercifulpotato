Of course, extremists on either side would hate to be bundled together, their ideology is different but their extremist approach is not.<p>But I can&#x27;t help but think this is a very asymmetrical horseshoe where the right side extends much further then the left side ever did. The problem is not even necessarily the particular ideology but rather that the right side is willing to be far more extreme in their views. That in itself is exceptionally dangerous no matter what the views are because it implies a very, very unpleasant life for those who don&#x27;t share them.<p>It&#x27;s the reason why today the US is so divided, there&#x27;s no more overlap, the 2 sides each sit in their corner. The only possible response to increasing extremism on one side is increasing extremism on the other side until one has enough power to quash the other.')
