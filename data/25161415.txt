Giving a higher rank to a AMP page that people like vs an page the is more accurate information seems like an issue to me.  People are larger not smart enough to discern an accurate answer (look at how bad society wants to regulate FB, Twitter, etc for posting information that does not pass &#x27;fact checks&#x27;).
