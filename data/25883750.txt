I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with him. Some people complain he isn&#x27;t &quot;balanced&quot; i.e. 9&#x2F;10 of his criticisms are aimed at comparatively &quot;good guys&quot; i.e. liberals, while he rarely talks about conservatives. But I think that&#x27;s perfectly fine, his niche is feeling a void left by hyper-partisan mainstream media- not everybody have to be expert on everything.')
