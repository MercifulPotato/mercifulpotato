Your death rate is X.<p>During corona, you donâ€™t commute, but still drive tipsy 1x&#x2F;month. Your death rate is way higher. Maybe even 10X.<p>Crucially, your death rate per month remains unchanged.<p>PS: part of the effect is also lack of practice. You think your reflexes and skills are the same as when you drove daily. They are rusty.<p>This part kills a lot of middle age motorcyclists jumping back on the bike after 20 years.')
