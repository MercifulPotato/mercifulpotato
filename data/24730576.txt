Authenticizer is here for you! Authenticizer is a platform that acts as a gatekeeper, allowing you to login to websites with only one main account. Not only does this reduce the need for multiple passwords, but this also greatly secures your online identity. Currently, we&#x27;ve just launched, so we need developers to implement our API into their sites so that our users have places to use Authenticizer. If you own a website or app, why not use Authenticizer as your login system? It&#x27;s simple, free, privacy-respecting and free.')
