But it&#x27;s not an accurate description of the world in which we actually live. There&#x27;s tons of places, even in developed countries like the US where its extremely cheap to buy fertile land that you could live off of if you were so inclined. People choose not to do this because they like to live in urban megacities. They like to live with all the comforts and benefits that the system has provided them with. They want all the benefits of capitalism without the costs.')
