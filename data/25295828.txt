And pc manufactures might not afford lower sales for a few years while this happens.<p>- Windows seems to still have issues with app portability and emulation. But who knows, maybe MS will push harder<p>- Making their own chips and also licensing cores to vendors like Qualcomm, might spook them. It&#x27;s not a good position to compete with someone who owns the IP you depend one. This might be a good thing for RISC-V<p>But we&#x27;ll find out in a year or two what is the play. Competition is good for everyone. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like apple having exclusive access to new nodes, be it because apple is willing to pay premium, or that other companies avoid low yield.<p>Anyway, seems like TSMC will have their hands full for a few cycles.')
