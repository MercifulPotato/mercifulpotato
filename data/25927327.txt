I think sadly the general public is right not to believe as strongly in science as it maybe once did, the results though are dramatic in &quot;baby bathwater&quot; kind of proportions.<p>I think science should fix itself. Just publishing paper should not be the metric to reward. A retraction should seriously reward the flaw finder (like sometimes with exploits), and really harm the flaw author&#x2F;publisher: both scientist and journal.')
