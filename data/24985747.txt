It does a great job with Apple&#x27;s Image Capture on my Mac either using the document feeder or the flatbed.<p>What I love about the document feeder is that it will scan both sides of the pages and combine them into one PDF.   Really handy for dealing with real estate and other legal documents that are 20 pages long.<p>I have rarely had a page skip but then you can scan that page and use Preview to insert it in the proper place in the PDF.  You could feed 10 pages, then flip them and feed them in again and combine manually.   But it&#x27;s very nice that the machine will do it for you.<p>We also have a Brother color laser printer, an HL-3170CDW.  Its print quality is better and faster than my machine but it likes to go offline for no apparent reason after a couple of days.  The easy fix is to power it off and on but it&#x27;d be nice if there was a better one.')
