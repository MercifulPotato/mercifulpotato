This sounds distinctively worse than convincing a democratically elected government that you need protection (e.g., because the market is failing to some degree and your industry is important for the country in some form).\nThis wouldn&#x27;t be a good result for consumers either.<p>Google is not an underdog screwed by some corrupt government and is just too honest and noble to bribe the law away or invest in any form of lobbying.')
