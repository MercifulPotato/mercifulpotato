(In this case they still don&#x27;t know your destinations unless they are watching them too, but you&#x27;re no better off than if you were an ordinary client.)<p>(I&#x27;m not mentioning this to criticize I2P&#x27;s design, just to point out that the benefit you get from this decision depends a lot on your threat model!)')
