That was happening in parts of Europe from 1945 to 1990. This what is happening in USA right now is nowhere near that. It&#x27;s just free market. If you&#x27;re banned from a certain platform you can reach your audience in another way. No one is censoring your speech. It&#x27;s just a certain company not wanting to serve a particular user. If it was actual censorship then you wouldn&#x27;t be able to even print it on paper and distribute in your neighborhood.<p>Free speech != guaranteed access to a company providing access to a big audience')
