Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611345600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862992, text='&gt; I&#x27;d be curious to see varying definitions of &quot;factual&quot;<p>Go to any &quot;fact checking&quot; site, they regularly &quot;fact check&quot; opinions and predictions about the future, which can&#x27;t be &quot;factual&quot;. Ask any of the current gatekeepers, which regularly block people expressing controversial opinions (about things like how to handle the beer bug or riots or any other current issue) for &quot;misinformation&quot; - completely ignoring the idea that opinions and facts are different things. The definition of &quot;fact&quot; in &quot;fact checking&quot; is basically &quot;fact is something you don&#x27;t get deplatformed for saying&quot;, more or less. Of course there&#x27;s no better definition - why would they commit to any definition if &quot;fact is what we say it is&quot; works so well?<p>&gt; Pre-filtering is not what&#x27;s been proposed in the article<p>It is. That&#x27;s what &quot;amplifying factual voices&quot; is - that is the only thing it could be - a filter. It doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% block - but to be of any efficiency, it has to privilege one viewpoint and suppress another, and the choice will be made by the gatekeeper. It&#x27;s not imagination - it&#x27;s a basic requirement without which any mechanism like that would be useless. It has to make privileged opinion easy to reach, and excluded opinion hard to reach, otherwise there&#x27;s no amplification.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s been proposed is to introduce an improvement to how things are pre-arranged<p>&quot;Improvement&quot; is a tricky word. When you define what is better for me, and &quot;improve&quot; things according to your definition, what happens if I disagree about what is better for me? Then your &quot;improvements&quot; are actually obstacles for me. But what if you&#x27;re so sure you know what is better for me that you are determined to force it on me regardless of my opinion? That makes any such &quot;improver&quot; my enemy - they may think they are helping, but they are not, they are hurting.<p>&gt; This is about trying to find the best way<p>When the &quot;best way&quot; is determined unilaterally by the oligarchy of the gatekeepers, it&#x27;s usually the way that is best for them, not for me. I didn&#x27;t ask for their help, and yet they are determined to force their &quot;best way&quot; onto me, whether I want it or not, whether I consider it best or not. This is a very common pattern that is repeated in human history again and again. Being on the receiving end of it is never fun, and rarely improves anything for the people being &quot;helped&quot; against their will.')
