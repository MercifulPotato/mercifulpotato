If you are coming from another FAANG or startup and leaving behind lot of unvested stock, you might get that matched. Or if you have other offers they will prefer to increase RSUs rather than base salary. Every year you then get refresher RSUs which are quite significant (as big as your base salary but spread over 4 years).')
