You can easily sand and reapply finish, you can easily reglue a broken part. And when everything goes wrong with an old piece of furniture... you&#x27;ve got firewood.<p>IKEA furniture is built to last just enought time, it&#x27;s full of composite materials that for sure are really hard to recycle.<p>This is the same BS speach as Apple not providing a charger.<p>If you want to provide greener solutions, provide things that can last longer, are easy repairable and upgradable. It will hurt your profits because you won&#x27;t be able to shove as many products down the consumers throats, but that&#x27;s the way it has to be.')
