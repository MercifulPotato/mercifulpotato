Do you want to spend the least amount of time exercising as possible?<p>If you are a programmer, this may be you! It is certainly me.<p>For the algorithm junkies, I present you with an efficient algorithm for working out.<p>It is based on a well-written, concise guide from one of my close friends on high-intensity interval training (HIIT): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;So-Many-Gains-So-Little-Time-Effective-Strength-in-Minimal-Time-Version-0-6-d6a8b7cd00e748dc948b4147cec3b6a7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;So-Many-Gains-So-Little-Time-Effective...</a><p>The pitch is: muscle mass is very important to quality of life and longevity. No, you don&#x27;t have to be a gym rat, working out 5 days a week to get a toned body. My friend argues (with much research) that you basically need to work out once, maybe twice a week - VERY HARD - to cover your weight lifting needs. Cardio is separate but need not be excessive (e.g. run twice a week for 20 mins + get up and go for a walk everyday). If you&#x27;re serious about this just once a week, you&#x27;ll by and large get the results you&#x27;re after.')
