So, let’s avoid the popularity contest and address the claim that 0-based indexing is “inherently better”, or worse, “more natural”.<p>Maybe I missed the comments about 1-indexing being &quot;unnatural&quot; but if the author is referring to the discussion I took part in, then this is a strawman.  It wasn&#x27;t about what was &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;unnatural&quot; but about people switching from their primary language to secondary languages and gotchas like 1-indexing being error prone.<p>We had a platform team at my last company looking to adopt Lua for client customization.  The primary authors became familiar with Lua in writing the code logic but everyone else would be touching their part, or contributing back to the core, not as people familiar with Lua but as C++ developers who would be blindly making changes in another language.  It felt similar to maintenance of our Perl scripts.  You don&#x27;t brush up and become an expert on a language you interact with on a yearly cadence.  It is important in these cases to have few gotchas to make casual contributions easier and safer.<p>This says nothing about using 1-indexing when your target audience isn&#x27;t 0-indexed programmers (speaking of those who choose to use Lua and not to Lua&#x27;s creators).<p>Unfortunately, for me, even with my complaints (this and language compatibility), I&#x27;ll probably still use Lua for some projects of mine.  I&#x27;ve looked at others and I&#x27;m mainly concerned about the community size.')
