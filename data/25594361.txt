I failed the hCaptcha challenge maybe 8 times in a row on a few different days. Maybe I&#x27;m not human. I&#x27;m convinced that an algorithm can likely identify a train or a truck or a motorbus in a 25x25 image better than I can. I squinted at a building thinking it was a train. I analyzed the reflection in the body paint of a vehicle wondering if those were traffic lights or railway lights. Is a garbage truck, a truck? Does just one railway car, or part of one railway car count as a train?<p>The ask:\nAre you able to do it? Is there a better solution?<p>I understand this is a first world problem, but what about folks that may be differently abled than myself, especially in vision or congition? I saw there&#x27;s a way to set an &quot;accessibility cookie&quot; but I did not go through the process yet.<p>P.S. Happy new year!')
