In my opinion, the barrier to entry for using Svelte is lower that for React or Vue, yet it still achieves equal -- and in some ways better -- results.  To me, it provides what was promised by Web Components, but was never delivered on.  From what I&#x27;ve seen, Rich is pretty open about discussing the good and bad of Svelte, and he seems committed to continuing it&#x27;s improvement for years to come.  Thanks Rich, Svelte gets my vote, and I look forward to using SvelteKit...already having &quot;Great Success!&quot; with svelte&#x2F;sapper.')
