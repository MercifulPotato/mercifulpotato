It’s a community driven project meaning that anyone can contribute their own narrations or translations as long as the original poster allows it.<p>The other aspect is live journaling, which means when a user is asked something they can reply verbally and it automatically records the response.<p>I’m currently at a stage where the whole web app is pretty much complete, will be adding in subscriptions, mobile apps, programs and a teachers portal in the upcoming months.<p>Currently looking for someone to help with marketing and sales. Given it’s entirely bootstrapped hiring someone is not yet an option. Would love any form of advise and discussions on next steps and possible collaboration.<p>The app is live at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samarambi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samarambi.com</a>, but still in beta so expect some odd behaviour now and then.<p>PS. Just launched (soft launch) on New Years so content is pretty much minimal!<p>You can contact me on yasser.fadl(@)vlandor.com')
