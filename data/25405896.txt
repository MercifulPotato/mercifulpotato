There was good documentation in place and an onboarding process that made it easy to transfer the foundation of the architectural knowlegde.<p>2. The work was clearly delineated and compartmentalised, so understanding the overall architecture wasn&#x27;t critical for at least the entry-level tasks.<p>3. The architecture was a simple, standard pattern I was already very familiar with: for example a Django monolith.<p>I&#x27;d also like to add that a better name what I called &quot;architecture knowledge&quot; would be &quot;institutional knowledge&quot;, as it does not include just the architecture per se; it includes the auxiliary things like development process, testing mechanisms, deployment etc.')
