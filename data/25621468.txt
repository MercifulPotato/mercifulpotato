App Store was used as a moat to sell iPhone. Steve <i>always</i> had a product strategy. Just like iTunes was used to sell iPod. It also kept things simple.<p>Apps and Smartphone was also not a necessity like they are today in a modern society. Steve passed away in 2011. That was the iPhone 4S. It is not even far fetch to say most of the world at the time were not even on Smartphone. ( It is crazy we think back now, how they world have changed in the space of 8-9 years.)<p>I did like to think Steve will have a different perspective. Tim Cook is exceptionally at execution.
