There&#x27;s money to be made across the spectrum of fast and smart. My experience is just way on the left side, where the special sauce is only barely statistics-y but extremely technical (both from a software&#x2F;hardware standpoint and market microstructure saviiness standpoint).<p>I&#x27;m not trying to gatekeep who can call themselves HFTs or not. The main thing I find funny is if you ask 10 firms if they&#x27;re HFT or quant shops, it will probably not actually line up all that well with exactly how many orders they send or how speed-sensitive they are.')
