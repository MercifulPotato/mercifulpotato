I couldn&#x27;t find the original NPR interview on the NPR homepage, so I--confusingly, in retrospect--linked the Chotiner followup, which was on the front page of a major publication.<p>Also I should add that the original NPR interview <i>was</i> on the &quot;front page&quot; of link aggregator sites like reddit and hn, because that&#x27;s where I originally saw it.')
