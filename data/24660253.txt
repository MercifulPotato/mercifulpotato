Linux had much more time to harden than comparable OS. From a technical perspective it isn&#x27;t a real time OS and does come with unnecessary functions that are probably not relevant to the application, but I think people underestimate the amount of bugs in embedded systems. Minimal OS or bare metal doesn&#x27;t really matter much.<p>To my knowledge there was never an incident where common OS was responsible for failure, but it has been a myth for ages.<p>If it does fail it is probably due to a hardware defect, but a risk analysis would show a plethora of possibilities for fail safe systems.')
