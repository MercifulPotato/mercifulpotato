Winner-take-all on a state by state basis with single-party primaries produce candidates who are far from the median voter and then campaign to drum up support among their party base. Universal primary systems encourage candidates with broader appeal outside of their party to end up as the party nominee, who then have a much easier time running a general election campaign on appealing to opposition party voters rather than being forced by the positions they took in their primary to campaign only to boost turnout among their existing base.')
