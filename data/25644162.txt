We do so through our knowledge of structural dynamics and signal processing (knowledge here is a big plus for the role as SW developer!). We work with the innovation centers of OEMs as BMW and Volvo, for example.  VIBES has grown considerably and that is why we are now looking to expand our team.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vibestechnology.com&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#job-587862" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vibestechnology.com&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#job-587862</a>')
