I don&#x27;t love Electron, and if you don&#x27;t want it a browser version is available too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.actualbudget.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.actualbudget.com&#x2F;</a><p>The mobile app uses React Native and has a custom UI just for mobile, but it shares styles and a few small components with web. I don&#x27;t believe that you can build one UI that works well on both desktop and mobile.<p>All platforms share the backend code which runs in a separate process&#x2F;thread. On mobile, I use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JaneaSystems&#x2F;nodejs-mobile" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JaneaSystems&#x2F;nodejs-mobile</a> to run the JS backend locally.<p>That&#x27;s mostly it. No UI frameworks are used. I love UI&#x2F;UX design so I built it from the ground up to be as usable and performant as possible.')
