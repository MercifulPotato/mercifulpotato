They spend enormous amounts of money to build those submarines - and then did not even care to take care of rust inside, or to support them.<p>Supposedly those submarines are not active any more (probably explains the photos), but the typical state of &quot;not caring about things&quot; is a very communist approach. Even in military.<p>Compare this with the American approach of caring about quality.<p>I mean, probably better for everyone if their ships go down as often as they go down, but just wanted to make an insight on mentality.')
