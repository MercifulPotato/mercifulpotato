It’s that increasingly experts don’t share basic assumptions with the public.<p>Prop 16, which would repeal the affirmative action ban in California, was pushed heavily by educational experts. It failed by a large margin. Here is how the Center for New American Progress, a think tank (whose CEO will lead Biden’s OMB), responded: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;education-postsecondary&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;493186&#x2F;california-not-bellwether-affirmative-action&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;education-postsecond...</a><p>This is one assertion they made to support trying again with different poll wording:<p>&gt; Moreover, older voters who remember the 1996 ban may hold the misleading view that the law was a “prohibition against discrimination,” as the law’s original backers framed it in this way.<p>This is just a play on the fact that your average person defines “discrimination” quite literally (the majority of every racial group say race shouldn’t be even a small factor in college admissions). But educational experts often have a different view of “discrimination.” Thus it’s “misleading,” the article asserts, to say that the existing provision that bans disparate treatment by race is a ban on “discrimination.”<p>When experts change the meaning of commonly understood words to get a different polling result, do you think that creates trust?<p>(FWIW, I supported repealing the ban in California initially. But when you ask people “do you want to give some people more resources, preferential treatment, etc., in order to erase historic disparities” they say “no.” I want to do that, within reason. But it’s a dog that won’t hunt. So experts keep playing with the language, coming up with terms like “equity.” And thats made me very skeptical of trusting educational experts with these new powers.)')
