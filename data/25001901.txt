I really like the concept of the add-on trackball or track point and it&#x27;s been something I&#x27;ve been looking for in a keyboard, especially if I were to switch from MacOS to Linux and loose full support for my track pad.  Hot-swap switches are a plus and PBT keycaps are a must.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m prepared to pre-order but I&#x27;ll be keeping my eye on this one.<p>Can anyone with the V1 comment on the experience?  I&#x27;m especially interested in the experience of using this keyboard with the track ball.')
