Loopback is a network, right?  I like the general idea and I think AWS really cheated them (ethically), but I wonder if there&#x27;s something better that&#x27;s completely safe for small business to ignore as easily as something like the MIT license while forbidding use by huge providers like AWS.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mongodb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;the-agpl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mongodb.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;the-agpl</a>')
