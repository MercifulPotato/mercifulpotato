And, consequently, I think you&#x27;ll find any attempt to define which things are not &quot;speech&quot; ends up being functionality equivalent to dialing back from that theoretical 100%.<p>In general, you can&#x27;t have 100% freedom over any finite resource. If there&#x27;s only one dessert in the fridge, you and I can not both have 100% freedom to eat it.<p>If you presume that any meaningful &quot;speech&quot; has some non-zero audience size, then speakers are competing for the finite attention of other humans. You can&#x27;t have perfect freedom for that.')
