Congress is plenty pissed off, and the Capitol Police work for them (I believe they technically are a part of the legislative branch, not the executive). And I think every law enforcement agent in the district should be ashamed of what happened.<p>I should point out that the photo going around showing the difference between the BLM response and the response to this mob is of the DC national guard, not Capitol Police. The DC national guard was not mobilized when the rioting started yesterday. Apparently it was requested but the DoD had not approved it. You can bet there will be some investigations there, and people involved will try to hide themselves in the bureaucracy and pointing fingers.<p>My bet is that, in a year or two, we&#x27;ll see some serious reforms in this area. Probably an expedited procedure for mobilizing the DC National Guard, or Congress will be so angry they will demand an expansion of the Capitol Police force, since that force works directly for them.')
