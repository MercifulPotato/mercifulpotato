It is required for guns, which are actually a constitutional right unlike voting for president. It is required to buy beer, rent an apartment, use most government benefits, or get a job. It&#x27;s even required to enter many campaign events for democrats! So, that doesn&#x27;t sound like good faith at all.<p>Funding the ID is fine. Some bullshit election ID card is no good. It needs to meet the normal standard, as specified by the Real ID Act of 2005. The US passport would be acceptable; let&#x27;s make those free. The military ID would be acceptable.<p>Say, want to bias it against republicans who never travel to foreign countries? Make a US passport the only valid identification. I&#x27;m fine with that.')
