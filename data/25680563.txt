This study essentially affirms that certain genes act as a risk factor in life. To simplify my point: if we know the genes that cause some to be more likely handicapped in life, should we give them extra support? Should we give some personal tutoring to everyone lacking x,y and z genes? Free gym membership to anyone lacking the (probably non-existant) gym rat gene to encourage exercise? I&#x27;m fully aware that this would be premature, but maybe in 20 years?<p>Something like extra screenings for anyone with higher genetic chance of cancer isn&#x27;t controversial, but I wonder if we&#x27;ll ever be ready to go further than that.')
