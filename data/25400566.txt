If you are serious about achieving something, you should seek useful feedback. Willingness to pay is one powerful feedback mechanism.<p>True, but many of the markets we have are neither free nor fair. And even if they were, we should exercise caution before concluding that what is discovered is a <i>need</i>. Markets are equally capable of exploiting wants, socially conditioned propensities, addictions, manifestations of the subconscious, etc.<p>Even developments which appear unambiguously good can lead to unexpected side effects and easily overlooked externalities.')
