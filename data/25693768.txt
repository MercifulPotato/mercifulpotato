Why can&#x27;t someone turn Signal federated? Wouldn&#x27;t the centralized server just be a different server? Sure, you&#x27;d need to roll a custom app but plenty of people do that. I constantly see people here complaining about it not being federated, but the server is open sourced, so what&#x27;s the issue?<p>Side note: isn&#x27;t it good to be centralized while the app is quickly rolling out new features? Then a switch to federation would be better when all the features are enabled?')
