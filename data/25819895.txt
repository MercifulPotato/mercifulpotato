Let’s say you accidentally leave a pawn hanging and 90% of 1100 players would spot it, and 10% of the time you are safe. In this engine, as the 90% is the most likely move it spots it 100% of the time.<p>So this example shows that if you pick the most likely move for a 1100 player every move, you end up scoring better than a 1100 player. Of course it works the other way too on spotting brilliant moves that others miss, but I guess at 1100 level play there are more opportunities to mess up!')
