Item(by='screwt', descendants=None, kids=[25113946], score=None, time=1605528128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110609, text='ELO ratings start at 600 for absolute beginner.\nWith a good amount of effort, a dedicated amateur can reach ~1500 without too much difficulty, and at that level you&#x27;ll beat any casual player. 2000 is international standard. Best human player is around 2700.\nNote - chess.com does not use ELO ratings - they have their own rating system which is more complex (includes an uncertainty factor based on how recently you have played), but is supposed to be roughly equivalent.\nThe author of the article is playing blitz chess (3 minutes a game) rather than standard chess, so the ratings are largely irrelevant to standard levels.')
