Have interviewed at a few places and have been unsure what to say in the application. Also, have been insanely tired and unable to deal with the stress of interviews. The prospective employer didn&#x27;t know about my situation. I completely tapped out in one of the interviews and was unable to focus but to the interviewer, I probably appeared like I struggled to answer their question. It&#x27;s been life changing going through this.')
