If 1&#x2F;100 people were always getting an amputation within 90 days of any arbitrary starting point, there would be many, many more amputees around.<p>Mental illness being something that may lasts months to years, this certainly seems to be closer to the amputation case than the headache case. That implies that getting Covid can, indeed, be said to increase your chance of developing mental illness.')
