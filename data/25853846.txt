Since the pandemic in March last year, I exclusively eat lunches of about 600grams with around 20 types of veggies. It feels amazing after doing so, I never have an after-lunch dip any more. Some performance sports I do got 5-10% directly measurable improvements (cycling and bouldering) after switching to these lunches. Not completely sure it is the cause, but all signs direct to it.<p>I simply cut these veggies in small and balance the salad out on sweet, sour, salty and calories. After a few months of doing this I started to crave these salads.<p>Most of the veggies come from the greenhouse area, but not all. You can tell most of them, since they are quite clean already and do not have any dirt&#x2F;soil on it.<p>Taste of these veggies is mostly <i>different</i>, not necessarily bad, although I would not describe it typically as being richer in taste. Redish is less sharp, carrots are much more crispy and less fibery, letuces are much fresher (they come with clod, so dont degrade a bit, even after two weeks in the refrigerator), tomatos are more watery but also much, much more varied (small, ultra sweet super juicy ones; bigger fleshy with delicious sour pits; characterfull flavory ones; many more), chickory which is sweeter, bell pepper which are more varied and edible as fruits, sweeter, juicier, cucumbers as small, medium and large where the small ones are really tender, many herbs such as mint, coriander, sellery, rosemary, parsley come as plants which I consume over about two weeks.')
