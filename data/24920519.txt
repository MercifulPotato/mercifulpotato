It was intentionally introduced to pest Australian rabbit populations (to cull them) and studied.<p>After ~30 years of evolution, they found the dominant strain had a 70-95% death rate and left long-lasting lesions. Other strains with higher (~99%) and lower (~50%) death rates weren&#x27;t as stable &amp; prevalent.<p>Once a virus is transmitted (enough), what happens to the health of its host is irrelevant.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;immunology-and-microbiology&#x2F;myxoma-virus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;immunology-and-microbio...</a>')
