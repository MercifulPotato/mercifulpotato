It was great for the top few - the NYT, the Washington Post. But why would you read the Cincinnati Enquirer if it was equally convenient to read the Wall Street Journal?<p>Similarly, the rise of DoorDash etc is going to be bad for most restaurants. If there are 100 Chinese restaurants in my city, why would I ever order from one that wasn’t one of the best? Any restaurant whose food isn’t good enough to win on DoorDash is going to be hurt when more people choose delivery.<p>It will be great for some, though. The best restaurants with big delivery volume will be able to expand and improve their margins by operating at a larger scale.')
