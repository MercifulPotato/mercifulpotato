Which to me is a self-defeating argument.<p>I have had plenty of interesting discussions with people at dinner-parties&#x2F;gatherings that start out on the surface as being a disagreement over morality or a different political leaning, but then once you get right down to first principles they admit that actually they think it&#x27;s impossible to know the truth, so what does it matter anyway? This is always so frustrating, but it&#x27;s important to get to this point so that you can debate the real issue, rather than going back and forth on the surface level issues that ultimately don&#x27;t address the underlying disagreement.')
