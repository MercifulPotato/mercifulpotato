Item(by='OminousWeapons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609609127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614391, text='TL;DR I agree with the intent of this law but I disagree with the exact implementation.<p>There are groups of people who have legitimate safety concerns (victims of domestic violence and stalking, members of law enforcement, victims of abuse from law enforcement, public figures potentially subject to political violence such as the people certifying voting in this recent election, high net worth individuals, corporate officers of companies some people have beef with, activists, LGBT in very religious areas, reporters, whistle blowers, etc) who are using these tools as part of a DIY witness protection program to safeguard themselves against violence and intimidation. This is undermined if people can trivially unmask the beneficiaries of companies used to obfuscate purchases of assets such as a house or car. I agree that this data should be available to law enforcement during an investigation (ie with a subpoena), but allowing bank employees or any member of law enforcement to trivially access it whenever they want opens up the door to abuses and leaks (selling access or granting access to friends, contacts, or others intent on doing the owners harm). It also assumes blanket trust in those with privileged access and there have been many instances in the past of this trust being abused. It should require more than knowing or being a cop or a bank employee with access to be able to DOX or come after someone who is not breaking the law but wants to remain private.')
