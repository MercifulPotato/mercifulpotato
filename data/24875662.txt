The iPhone and iPads I use today are materially the same things as the ones I had half a decade ago.  The only new products that come to mind are airpods and the Watch, and I credit Tim Cook with those, but I can&#x27;t think of anything else.<p>Apple&#x27;s valuation doesn&#x27;t do me any good (or ill!) as a customer.  I feel like there are a lot more bugs in Mac OS than there were in the past, and I&#x27;d happily trade Apple&#x27;s market cap for a return to confident OS upgrades.')
