I made a single simplifying assumption, for the sake of clarifying the particular qualities of that thought experiment: that voters would understand the policies of the second and third parties to be identical. In that case, IRV isn&#x27;t &quot;unlikely to break 2 party dominance&quot;, as you claimed above. So, that claim isn&#x27;t universally true. It might be true in some circumstances, but we don&#x27;t know what those might be. You&#x27;ll need to explain more carefully why we should reject RCV in favor of some more perfect alternative.')
