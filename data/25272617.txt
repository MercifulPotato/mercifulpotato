There is almost no part of computer science that hasn&#x27;t at some point intersected with chess computers, from early forays into game theory, through close-to-the-metal optimisations like bitboards and vector operations, right up to the state of the art in deep learning. I genuinely think you can get a fairly complete CS education just by building a series of increasingly complex engines (and UIs!) and you will find yourself in the company of basically all the greats like John von Neumann, Alan Turing, Donald Knuth, Ken Thompson etc etc.')
