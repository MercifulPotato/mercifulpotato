Item(by='garganzol', descendants=None, kids=[25059689, 25059253, 25059183, 25059235, 25059228], score=None, time=1605108133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25058363, text='3% is good but fairly common conversion rate for an ad. Not really groundbreaking nor newsworthy.<p>But why it&#x27;s on HN then? The answer - you are the product and HN is a marketplace. This makes HN kind of spoiled place to be at, as it amplifies the illusion of &quot;good things&quot; you &quot;must have&quot; or &quot;participate in&quot;.<p>I really miss the golden era of BYTE magazine in the 80s. That was a classy act. But what we have now is a noisy reactor, where nearly everything is worthless but fuels illusion and false hopes. We give in without even considering an evident fact that we are being manipulated for cheap.<p>Yes, I may sound too dark, but then let&#x27;s not call HN &quot;a community&quot;. This a commercial enterprise with its own interests under the hood. Not the neutral place for intellectual discussions as it tries to appear.')
