Item(by='antiterra', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611869979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25949019, text='State Farm Arena video doesn’t show fraud to any reasonable degree, at the absolute <i>best</i> it’s an irregularity. The Antirim report is massively flawed, written by an ‘expert’ with no credibility who used Minnesota counties to ‘prove’ Michigan fraud. Hand waving at ‘affidavits’ is not evidence. The statistics arguments don’t stand scrutiny when known limitations like sample size, turnout volatility and count completion are taken into account.<p>Bundling together lots of individual garbage theories into giant piles doesn’t net you anything other than garbage theories, just like bundling bad mortgage securities didn’t mitigate risk in the subprime crisis.<p>Instead of saying ‘lots of statistical algorithms,’ name one, or even two, that stand up to genuine scrutiny (and that aren’t the readily debunked Charles J. Cicchetti claims.) Don’t hide behind the sheer number of crackpot theories. Or, you know, admit you have nothing but a hunch based on cognitive dissonance.')
