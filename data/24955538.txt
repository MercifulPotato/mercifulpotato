The re-licensing of current&#x2F;new code is one thing, but removing the license on the old code? How is that possible? What about copies elsewhere, are those no longer validly licensed? That&#x27;s not how I thought licenses work.<p>These guys just appear to go from bad to worse, ignorantly making shit up as they go (on a road to certain self-destruction, if you&#x27;d ask me).<p>Also, why don&#x27;t I hear more people about how GitHub was used to not at all host any code, but instead only as a (marketing) referral point for proprietary stuff somewhere else? I said goodbye to GitHub a while ago, so I wasn&#x27;t aware this this had become acceptable practice.<p>Anyways, if this was a court case .. this would probably be the point where a judge would look these fellows straight in the eyes and say something along the lines of: &quot;With arrogant behavior you so clearly displayed, you yourselves have squandered any of the sympathy, lenience, and benefit of a doubt I usually give to defendants, and will hereby sentence you to the harshest possible punishment. Not only to give a clear indication that your behavior is in no way acceptable. But also to serve as a reminder for any future parasites, whenever they think of making up their own rules as they see fit&quot;.<p>Either way, I think this shit is going to haunt these guys. Unless I got it all completely wrong, probably well deserved too.')
