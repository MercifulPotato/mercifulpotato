You&#x27;re in for a big paycheck here I think. And you won&#x27;t be shooting yourself in the foot either. Other tech companies will understand if you spin this in a funny, can-you-believe-these-morons kind of way. You don&#x27;t want to come off as bitter or angry.<p>Your relationship with this company is soured even if you are vindicated. I know I personally would not be able to let go of animosity towards the coworkers for being so quick to judge me that way. Who in the favabeans does the IT guy think he is also? He shouldn&#x27;t be commenting on your actions prematurely, but of course the game of telephone probably distorted his original intent anyways.<p>Regardless, everyone&#x27;s going to play CYA and the IT guy will be loathe to take any blame upon himself. He is very likely to find a way, any way, to discredit you and make you look bad.<p>Don&#x27;t be rude. Explain yourself and defend yourself. Admit to nothing. You may feel pressured to admit to partial responsibility. Do not admit to anything improper under any circumstances. Do not take fault for any little thing whatsoever under any circumstances. You are legally\n&amp; morally right here. You will be vindicated. Just stand your ground firmly and respectfully.')
