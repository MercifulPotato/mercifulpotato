Also, I was replying to somebody who complained about connection issues on his phone. He probably doesn&#x27;t want to have a random timeouts when he travels from one place to another and potentionally miss important messages...<p>Furthermore, IRCCloud is not centralized in the same way as Discord is because you are not forced to use it. IRC is still an open protocol. For example Matrix has a big chunk of people using the official &quot;centralized&quot; Matrix server and the same is true for Mastodon with mastodon.social. Some prefer to self-host, others do not. I don&#x27;t see the problem here. Gmail wasn&#x27;t the downfall of email either.')
