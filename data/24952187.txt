It&#x27;s characters seemed to think as if they were living in today&#x27;s world, and it is lacking in description and establishment of a firmly historical premises.<p>For example it makes no effort to give a sense of the vocabulary or pattern of speech of its time.<p>So in which sense Wolf Hall is to be feated as great historical novel in a language which has a grand tradition of historical novels from the time of Walter Scott onwards is debatable.')
