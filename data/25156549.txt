I will say that my parents turned on a chat filter pretty quickly, as incredible amounts of obscene stuff was posted on lots of the random servers I played on.<p>Hypixel is pretty great (I actually still play sometimes!), and they have a good curse filter and it’s definitely family friendly.<p>To be honest, I spent a ridiculous amount of time on MineCraft over the past 10 years (definitely over 5k+ hours), and it’s taught me an incredible amount. It’s where I picked up my first O Reilly book, on Minecraft mods, where I learned for the first time how to self host a server, and also where I made some really great friends.<p>I’d be more worried about your kid finding something like social media FROM Minecraft - for example, I spent a ridiculous amount of time on Reddit, which I found through MC. As a kid whose parents don’t really care about what I do on the internet, unlimited access to viewing whatever I wanted wasn’t necessarily a good thing.')
