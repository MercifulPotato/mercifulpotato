Your first obstacle is the UI and getting your hands to do what your brain wants them to do without thinking about it. For myself learning guitar, this was the hardest obstacle. Once you sort out the mechanics of playing without thinking, you can start thinking about the music and actually having fun.<p>My only question is, do you really want to learn the piano?<p>Cause you need to want it, to get through those first few weeks&#x2F;months of getting used to the UI. Until you break that barrier it&#x27;s going to be un-fun and sound terrible and be very frustrating. The desire to play needs to be great enough to push through that. If you don&#x27;t want it, you&#x27;ll struggle to force yourself to push through.<p>To answer your actual question, Youtube and other musicians are what I feel most help me grow right now. I&#x27;ve done in person classes, bought books, bought multiple online classes and trawled Youtube for endless hours looking for lessons and song play alongs (getting a sense of the pattern of how important really wanting to learn to play is?). It wasn&#x27;t until I started playing with other musicians that my abilities and understanding really took off.')
