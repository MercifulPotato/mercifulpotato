When I applied for an internship at Google, apparently I was one of the only candidates in their internship database that listed AS3 as a preferred programming language. That got me an internship on the YouTube player team (the main player was still Flash!).<p>This is just one example of how important Flash has been to my career.<p>(When I interned there, the team that sat next to us was working on the HTML5 player. Everyone knew Flash&#x27;s days were numbered.)')
