Unfortunately, client certificate authentication in websites is rare (unlike for instance ssh, where public key authentication of both the server and the client is common).<p>Another way to detect MITM attempts would be if TLS channel binding were used for authentication, since any MITM would be using separate connections for the server and the client and therefore the authentication (bound to the TLS connection) would fail. I don&#x27;t know if newer authentication protocols like WebAuthn support it, and if they do, how common is the support for it in browsers.')
