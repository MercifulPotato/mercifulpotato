Only in america, can people talk about their human rights being infringed by the mildest inconvenience.<p>Nobody &quot;wishes they had your courage&quot;, because the people who think like you can muster that same immeasurable strength not to wear the mask, as it turns out pretty easily. The rest of the world just thinks you&#x27;re a selfish cretin.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m not in lockdown here. We had some temporary rule tightening, and it&#x27;s getting relaxed again because thankfully all in all, the people here who think like you are just noise and there aren&#x27;t many for it to make a big impact on the stats.')
