And literally every one of these &quot;free speech&quot; platforms (Parler, Gab, Voat) was immediately turned into a cesspool of conspiratorial rantings, hatred and racism.<p>Voat was probably my &quot;favorite&quot; of all. Literally the only reason it got any traffic were people were mad they could no longer post to r&#x2F;fatpeoplehate.')
