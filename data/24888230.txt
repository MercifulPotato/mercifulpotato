Since this decision costs them $0, why do you want to put costs into the denominator?<p>~4% == $10 Billion &#x2F; Revenue<p>Or:<p>~20% == $10 Billion &#x2F; (Revenue - RecurringCosts - OneTimeCosts).<p>Which number looks more correct to you? I guess it depends on how you use the number, but from my perspective, the lack of costs means that its more logical to compare it to Revenue as a whole.<p>Note: Operating Profit is &quot;Revenue-RecurringCosts&quot; (without one-time-costs associated). Operating Profit would be &quot;more correct&quot; if this were a hypothetical decision with recurring costs. (The one-time-costs would just muddle the discussion).')
