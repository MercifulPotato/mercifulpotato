[2]<p>While the Arecibo Telescope is significantly smaller, costs if rebuilt by US contractors would also be much higher than in China.<p>FAST can also only use about 300m of its 500m dish at a time due to limitations with focusing, so its effective size is closer to the Arecibo Telescope than its total size suggests.<p>So make that two F-35 and we&#x27;re pretty much spot on and we&#x27;d have a budget for some 3-5 years of operation, too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f35.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;cost" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f35.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;cost</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-01-china-meter-fast-radio-telescope.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-01-china-meter-fast-radio-telesco...</a>')
