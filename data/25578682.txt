It also gives you no selectivity for remote networks that use NAT, so if 1.1.1.1 is actually an ISP using CGNAT for thousands of customers then they&#x27;re all stuck with going to only one of your services.<p>(If I read your post as written, it also seems to say that the client needs to pick a custom source port and if they&#x27;re using NAT then they also need to get that source port unaltered through all of their layers of NAT. And they&#x27;ll be limited to one connection at a time, perhaps one connection for however many people are behind the same CGNAT, because only one connection can use a specific source port at a time.)<p>So yes, you can pile hacks on top of hacks on v4, but it&#x27;s not similar effort to just permitting the connection in a firewall, and it has a bunch of extra limitations too.')
