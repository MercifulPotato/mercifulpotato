While the site has ~250 words of value editorial at the top of the pages I&#x27;ve looked at, the descriptions of the products themselves are extremely thin (~30-50 words), and would likely fall foul of this Google policy:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;docs&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;affiliate-programs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;docs&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;guideline...</a><p>&quot;Pages of product affiliation where the majority of the site is made for affiliation and contains a limited amount of original content or added value for users.&quot;<p>Also, the site may not comply with this policy:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;docs&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;guidelines&#x2F;scraped-content" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;docs&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;guideline...</a><p>&quot;Sites that copy content from other sites, modify it slightly (for example, by substituting synonyms or using automated techniques), and republish it&quot;<p>While I have seen much poorer quality affiliate sites than this ranking in Google, IMO this model is on borrowed time. I think the way to survive in this market is by increasing the value:affiliate ratio, and diversifying income sources, so affiliate revenue isn&#x27;t the sole focus.')
