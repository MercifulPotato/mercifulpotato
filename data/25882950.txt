MMAP removes the need for the DBMS page cache and relies on the OSâ€™s paging algorithm. The gain is zero memory copy and the ability for multiple processes to access the same data efficiently.<p>Apache Arrow takes advantage of mmap to share data across different language processes and enables fast startup for short lived processes that re-access the same OS cached data.')
