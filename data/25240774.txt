In this case you have to think illogically on purpose in order to have any chance at succeeding.</i><p>I think that&#x27;s mixing up cause and effect. People who succeed usually have reason to believe they will. Don&#x27;t work on your belief; instead, work on your ability. You&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re ready when you think you can, realistically, succeed (though best to start as soon as you <i>can</i> do what you&#x27;ll definitely be able to, and think you might be able to handle the rest, because learning as you go is often much more effective than trying to prepare for hypothetical eventualities ahead of time).<p>And it&#x27;s a lie that you need to <i>believe</i> you will succeed. You just need to act like it. Be invested, and don&#x27;t quit until you actually can&#x27;t go on any more (unless there&#x27;s an actual dead-end, like you&#x27;ve got a business with 70% of your target audience as customers and still can&#x27;t afford to feed yourself with it). Though you might not need to compensate for this particular cognitive bias, if you&#x27;re already practised at it.')
