If not, then perhaps the fundamentalness of it is just an artifact of the formulation.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of solar neutrinos which, for a while, we weren&#x27;t sure if they were massless or not. We had to observe them experiencing a duration of time to conclude they were massive. If we didn&#x27;t find that, maybe it was just an even shorter duration, not the absence of one and we would never be able to tell the difference.')
