So I assume<p>- LocalCDN was forked because Decentraleyes actually appears stale which is unfortunate.<p>- LocalCDN doesn&#x27;t have public ownership.<p>- LocalCDN isn&#x27;t a recommended webextension and thus updates won&#x27;t undergo &quot;thorough technical security reviews.&quot;<p>- LocalCDN does support more assets&#x2F;CDNs (which increases privacy beyond Decentraleyes) and will support more.<p>- LocalCDN has not slipped a new permission in. Compare LocalCDN&#x27;s manifest.json with Decentraleyes&#x27;.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;privacytoolsIO&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fc05uh&#x2F;comment&#x2F;fj836n1?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=comment_timestamp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;privacytoolsIO&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fc05uh&#x2F;comm...</a>')
