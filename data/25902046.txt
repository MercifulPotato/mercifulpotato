I would strongly argue history tells us this is precisely what happens when government has too little influence and corporations therefore become centers of power.<p>My argument is not about the intensity of the influence but rather about the type of influence, and what influence the government is allowed.<p>I agree with most &quot;progressives&quot; on the nature of the problems we face as society, where I differ is on what should or can be done to solve them. History as shown that leaning on Authoritarian government regulations do not work out very well either, and leads to all kinds of unintended consequences.  As the libertarian saying goes &quot;Government: If you think you have problems now, what until you see our solutions&quot;<p>The ironic thing as well is when people paint &quot;unfettered capitalism&quot; with &quot;corporations&quot;  A Corporation is a government created liability shield that does not exist in a &quot;unfettered capitalist&quot; system or rather a true free market.  Corporations are part of the government regulatory apparatus system.<p>One of the key problems we have is the regulatory capture, because we have allowed government to create corporations, which in turn become powerful and desire to capture the regulations that created them so they can make themselves more powerful,  vicious circle<p>&gt;&gt;We would disagree on what &quot;too much&quot; means, obviously.<p>I dont know that we would disagree with &quot;too much power&quot;, currently it is not how powerful the government is that I have the most problem with, it is the centralization of power that more concerning. The US for all its flaws did get one thing right.  Power is best when it distributed. Power wants to consolidate, and centralize,  it is up the the people to resist this and we the people have been very poor at that,  especially since the Great Depression. We now look to the Federal government to solve all of our problems this is not how our system was to be.')
