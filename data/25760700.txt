One of my exes who self-identifies as an anarcho-Communist has been angry with what she sees a Facebook’s anti-left political censorship for at least seven years; and if you see her censorship as justified given her politics, there’s also stuff like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewducker.dreamwidth.org&#x2F;3936987.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewducker.dreamwidth.org&#x2F;3936987.html</a><p>People have been begging for these companies to censor threats of violence for ages (meme is something like “Twitter: What changes would you like? Users: Remove the Nazis; Twitter: Timeline now scrolls sideways, likes are now called florps”)<p>The consensus response until now has been that corporations are private and have the right to kick off whoever they want. When I have suggested that their power to do so needed to be constrained the way governments are and for similar reasons, I got a lot of flack for it.<p>That said, I don’t have the American attitude to freedom of speech as an end in itself, rather I value it as an instrumental goal, so I’m a lot more comfortable with <i>some</i> censorship than many people on Hacker News, even though I still want <i>as little as possible</i>. As little as possible just isn’t “none” in my opinion.')
