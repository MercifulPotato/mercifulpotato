They turned everything upside down. Tried to force us to sign contrats that would make them the owner of our public contributions which lead to an outrage so they backed down. Later they did &quot;patent minig&quot; sessions where they tried to extract good ideas from people for free. They also shut down all projects and pushed their Watson shit on us. They didn&#x27;t give a shit about company culture, and people in general so 90% of the employees who had even a tiny bit of ambition left for a startup that was created by people who left IBM after the acquisition.')
