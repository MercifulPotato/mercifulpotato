It&#x27;s extremely hard to draw any conclusions from this.<p>&gt; The number of burials carried out by victims of Covid-19 in Manaus, in January this year, exceeded the data for 2020 for the city. Last year, 1,285 burials from the disease were counted, against 1,333 in the first 21 days of 2021 alone.<p>The &quot;first wave&quot; happened starting in ~May 2020 (and testing increased across the year) so this kind of un-normalized comparison across time periods isn&#x27;t useful.<p>&gt; The total made in January for all statements (all types of death, including coronavirus), was 2,964 - the highest number of burials carried out in a single month since the start of the pandemic. In 2020, the month with the highest burial record in Manaus was April, with 2,433.<p>This is a great example of bad data reporting: it&#x27;s almost impossible to interpret this without comparison to historical mortality trends for the region. It <i>sounds</i> like mortality is slightly higher overall, but it&#x27;s really difficult to say.<p>&gt; Last year, May was the month that registered the most burials due to the disease, with 348. In comparison with this year&#x27;s numbers, January 2021 brings 283% more burial records.<p>Again, same issue as the first quote: making a non-normalized comparison to May 2020 ignores the substantial increases in testing that has happened since that time.')
