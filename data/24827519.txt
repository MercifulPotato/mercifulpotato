Turns out a lot of interpreters hide bits away in what they precieve to be unused address bits.<p>Its one of those lessons that everyone seems to be constantly relearning. Address spaces grow.<p>One of my first &quot;real&quot; jobs, when this topic came up a very senior person said something to the effect. We continue to find ways to use up one of those bits roughly every year. Moving from 32-64 bit VA&#x27;s is going to get beyond the end of my career but someone will have to deal with it in the future. So its a little slower than 1 bit a year, but everyone is adding a few more bits (52&#x2F;56&#x2F;etc) because there are actual commercial computer systems with a few tens of TB of ram today. If persistent memory ever becomes a thing, someone _WILL_ want to mmap their multi PB storage cluster, and then there will be a scramble for more address bits.')
