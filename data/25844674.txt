I join all of Wall Street in hoping that Ma is okay and his creative spirit continues --maybe we can get him back to Los Angeles (where he spent much time prior to launching his Chinese initiatives).\n[[For those outside of FinTech: Bartiromo is perhaps the most well connected financial reporter in the world and the first lady to report from the floor of the NYSE. She is a large part of what made FNN&#x2F;CNBC what it is today before moving on to larger digs on FBN and has enough clout to launch her own financial network anytime she chooses.]]')
