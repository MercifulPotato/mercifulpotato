That&#x27;s the excess interest (above the risk-free rate) embedded in the asset value.<p>I should also add that it&#x27;s not the case that the bank &quot;no longer has&quot; the money lent out. The bank doesn&#x27;t actually move money from some depositor to the borrower. The bank credits the borrower&#x27;s account with money created from nothing, and it feels comfortable doing so because there is the asset backing it. The Federal Reserve doesn&#x27;t have to be directly involved at this stage. It allows banks to do this as long as capital requirements are satisfied.')
