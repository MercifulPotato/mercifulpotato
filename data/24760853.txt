Places like the SF Bay, Boston, Austin, Seattle, NYC etc attract folks for more than just the jobs. There&#x27;s culture, great schools (at least in the greater Seattle area), and many other reasons why people may choose to live in these locations. So while there certainly will be an adjustment that occurs, it might not be as significant as one would imagine.')
