Perhaps even rampant with it. An easy search will show you that large regulated institutions participate and engage in fraud at all levels of their institution. Why is it that crypto must bear a larger burden of scrutiny against the status quo?<p>I believe that fraud is easier to identify and financially punish on public blockchains. Exchanges and other entities already have the ability to blacklist an address&#x27;s assets and prevent them from off-ramping into fiat ms being used in future transfers. Businesses exist today to prevent payments of blacklisted assets.\nCompared to cash, blockchain based cryptoassets have more choice in enforcement against fraud. Also, crypto assets can be seen by all publicly on chain. It fairly easy to trace the work of cryptoasset fraudsters')
