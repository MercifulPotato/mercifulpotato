Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608274525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463819, text='&gt; My pet theory is that Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the Left are thoroughly (and probably unwittingly) influenced by the infiltration, and are the medium for memes and messaging that divides us so much. It&#x27;s as though we&#x27;re about to re-fight the Civil War.<p>Interesting you should attribute that to “Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and the Left” since the people spreading memes and propaganda literally advocating either a new Civil War and publicly advocating military overthrow of the lawfully elected government are on the Right (the former groups like the Boogaloo bois; the latter a number of prominent figures, including recently pardoned former National Security Advisor Gen. Michael Flynn.)<p>&gt;  China, the master that it is at cultural revolution and re-education, is playing a shrewd game.<p>Both the pro-Trump elites counselling extra-Constitutional violence and some of the more (superficially, at least) grassroots groups in the White nationalist&#x2F;supremacist vein preaching race war have been well documented to have been engaged with and influenced by Russia; China less so.')
