It is recommended to stay below 3,000 mg of tylenol within 24 hours, which is only 6 extra strength pills. If you take a bit extra and get over 4,000 mg per day for multiple days, you can get major issues. There just is not much margin for error with tylenol.<p>Huh? To actually think that taking 6 extra strength pills in 24 hours isn&#x27;t enough margin of error? I mean maybe if the person is completely clueless and doesn&#x27;t read the medicine instructions.<p>Honestly, if you&#x27;re in that much pain that you&#x27;re gobbling up 6-8 extra strength pills per day, every day, you should be in the hospital with an IV hooked up, or addressing the chronic pain issue that&#x27;s causing it. Or have the doc prescribe you something way stronger.')
