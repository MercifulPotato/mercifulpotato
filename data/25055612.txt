I know the CEO of a failed GC company and his experience seemed neutral to positive; they’ve also bid on something where I knew the founder and generally came across very well also. Trying to discuss the fact pattern and underlying principles, not the specific people involved.<p>——<p>This thread comes off as very tone deaf.<p>As a small minority shareholder the fees to receive a $800k wire round to zero.
