I hate this approach with a passion.<p>E-mail is NOT INSTANTANEOUS. It was never meant to be. It happens to arrive quickly for most people most of the time, but you should never, ever, base a service on that.<p>Many systems have greylisting in place: a new sender gets a 4xx reply, and is allowed through only on subsequent retries after a pre-set time period. This is often as much as 30-60 minutes. It&#x27;s a good approach to reduce spam, it turns out a lot of spamming software does not bother to retry, or doesn&#x27;t want to incur the cost.<p>So, if you try this OTP-over-Email approach, you end up with frustrated customers, who 1) have to wait up to 60 minutes, 2) their OTP doesn&#x27;t work, because you expired it after 5 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s terrible. Don&#x27;t do it.')
