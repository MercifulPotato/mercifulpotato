It&#x27;s about private entities withdrawing the infrastructure of speech, which obviously gets a lot more complicated to reason about and legislate.<p>I&#x27;m mostly okay with Apple and Google removing the app from their stores. I&#x27;m slightly less okay with Amazon withdrawing their services. But if Parler ends up reborn on a server running out of someones house or business I would be very much against their utility providers cutting off access.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that I&#x27;m with you and don&#x27;t quite know what to think about this either.<p>However I do worry that if we&#x27;re not careful as a society someone posting on HN (or maybe a government approved Facebook group) will eventually say:<p>&gt;The internet was a hate site, filled with conspiracy theories, radicalization and racism. So it&#x27;s no loss that it&#x27;s gone, and it took far too long to deal with it.')
