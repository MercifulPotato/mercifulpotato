We hit you with fraud, misrepresentation, or any number of torts. Do you threaten someone with bodily harm? Oh boy. Cyberbullying? Depending on your state, that might be a problem. Lying while under oath or to a federal agent? That&#x27;s potentially a few years behind bars.\n\n</code></pre>\n...and yet, ALL of those things happen routinely and without consequence on a COLOSSAL SCALE.<p>Folks on HN like to pretend that laws and courts function like clockwork or computer programs, executing flawlessly and automatically. They don&#x27;t. People get away with stuff ALL THE TIME. And if it does ever end up in a court, &quot;winning&quot; is an iffy proposition even in the best possible circumstances.<p>In the case of political disinformation, the problem is even more intractable. Talking heads can lie their heads off to audiences of millions of people on incredibly powerful platforms. I don&#x27;t just mean &quot;lie&quot;, I mean deliberately say a demonstrable untruth with the intention of misleading others on serious matters and be completely unaccountable for it.<p>There&#x27;s the recent example of Trump retweeting a completely fabricated story suggesting that Biden had members of Seal Team 6 who were involved in the OBL assassination &quot;executed&quot;. Turns out the story was &quot;launched&quot; from Miami Florida at the &quot;American Priority Conference&quot; the week before. In a few short days, a disinformation campaign was able to fabricate a completely fake story, gain 3M youtube views, and &quot;induce&quot; the President to retweet it to 85 Million followers. The source story was then quickly pulled from Youtube, but everyone involved (Gary Franchi, Anna Khait, Nick Noe, and others) is totally free to do it all over again. They still got their twitter, facebook and youtube platforms, RIGHT NOW, during a super tense time right before the election.<p>These platforms are very much &quot;owned&quot; platforms. They&#x27;re not like newspapers but they have the same responsibility to act with some level good human judgement. Laws aren&#x27;t ever going to be able to keep up with this crap.')
