Approximately one-third of the total human diet is derived directly or indirectly from insect-pollinated plants (fruits, legumes and vegetables).</i><p><i>Crop Dependence<p>The almond crop is entirely dependent on honey bee pollination. Without honey bees, there would be no almonds. More than 80 percent of the world&#x27;s almonds are produced in California.3 To pollinate California&#x27;s approximately 790,000 bearing acres of almonds4 requires more than a million colonies of honey bees.<p>Numerous other crops are 90 percent dependent on honey bee pollination. Some of those crops include apples, avocados, blueberries, cherries, cranberries and sunflowers. Other crops such as cucumbers, kiwi fruit, melons and vegetables are also pollinated by honey bees.*</i>')
