I will dig deeper into the resources linked here as there&#x27;s a lot I have never seen before. The main topics are more or less exactly what I&#x27;ve found to be key in this space in the last 2 months trying to wrap my head around data engineering in my new job.<p>What I&#x27;m still trying to grasp is first how to assess the big data tools (Spark&#x2F;Flink&#x2F;Synapse&#x2F;Big Query et.al) for my use cases (mostly ETL). It just seems like Spark wins because it&#x27;s most used, but I have no idea how to differentiate these tools beyond the general streaming&#x2F;batch&#x2F;real-time taglines. Secondly, assessing the &quot;pipeline orchestrator&quot; for our use cases, where like Spark, Airflow usually comes out on top because of usage. Would love to read more about this.<p>Currently I&#x27;m reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Kleppman, which is great. I hope this will teach me the fundamentals of this space so it becomes easier to reason about different tools.')
