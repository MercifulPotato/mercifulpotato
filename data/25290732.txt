It&#x27;s extremely hard  to get tested. You pretty much need to have been in contact with someone confirmed infected or hospitalized to get a test. It&#x27;s a catch-22.<p>But even with the confirmed cases the trend in Japan is worrying, especially compared to other countries in Asia. They&#x27;re setting new records every day: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nhk.or.jp&#x2F;nhkworld&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;20201201_36&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nhk.or.jp&#x2F;nhkworld&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;20201201_36&#x2F;</a><p>With that said, I absolutely think the mask culture in Japan has dampened the surge a lot. In countries without this people just do the bare minimum to be compliant, so we have all these chin-wearers and nose-flashers. We&#x27;re simply hopeless at wearing masks even with the strictest of mask mandates. So even if masks could reduce the spread significantly we&#x27;re not likely to see the effect of that here.')
