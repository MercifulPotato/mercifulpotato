It’s not a good way to save money, really. Maybe a little but only if you are careful to avoid wasted produce, and that kinda ruins the fun. Industrial food supply chain is truly very efficient, probably thanks to scale.<p>You should still do it though, if you can (eg have access to real farmers and enough time). It’s very spiritually rewarding and helps to build communities. Farmers make more per pound at the farm stand and you pay less. It generates less landfill waste and, not sure how to explain it, but it’s very rewarding labor.<p>I’m headed to the farm stand right now to get some broccoli and brussels  sprouts, fresh from the field, to freeze and eat in the spring.')
