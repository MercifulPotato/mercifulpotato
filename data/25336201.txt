Usually though there&#x27;s some tradeoff (bad schools, long commute, house is really old). These tradeoffs don&#x27;t exist in the other regions where for a a lot less you can live basically anywhere you&#x27;d want in a nicer place.<p>The places I&#x27;ve been looking (Palo Alto, Cupertino, Mountain View) don&#x27;t really have anything in the price points you&#x27;re talking about.<p>I will admit that my general statement about Santa Clara was wrong though (I was thinking mostly about the cities I mentioned as part of Santa Clara county, not the city of Santa Clara).')
