As mentioned elsewhere, some languages (e.g. German) gender literally every noun, which makes it very complicated to adapt the language to these new conventions. English is comparatively lucky in that for the most part only pronouns are gendered. In English, gendered words for professions, like &quot;actress,&quot; went out of fashion some time ago.')
