I only brought them up because one of the common complaints is that the Snap server is not open source.  This is why it&#x27;s weird to me that FOSS supporters would push potential Debian users to Ubuntu where there is even a higher dependency on non-free software.<p>Regarding non-free support, assuming the firmware is in Debian&#x27;s non-free repository, Debian already provides support.  From their policy[1], distributed non-free software &quot;must not be so buggy that we refuse to support them.&quot;  That sounds to me like they already offer support (whatever that means for a volunteer-driven project).<p>So they already release unofficial installers with non-free binaries included, already have a repository that contains non-free binaries, and seemingly offer limited technical support for non-free binaries.  Yet they have opted to not readily present these options easily to a potential user.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;debian-policy&#x2F;ch-archive#s-non-free" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;debian-policy&#x2F;ch-archive#s-non-fr...</a>')
