And corporate&#x2F;enterprise environments should (not nearly enough do) do exactly that with devices owned and managed by the enterprise.<p>Sure! But the fact that they should (and many have been) already be doing just that does not change the fact that the technique imposes a third party listening into supposedly two party encrypted exchange. It&#x27;s allowed, but it is still MitM.<p>&gt; Any personal devices or those owned by contractors, clients and other external actors should not be allowed access to internal corporate networks. This is neither a particularly new or controversial idea either.<p>Whilst I agree, recent trend to push for more BYOD where the device is owned by the contrators, employee or an external actor, but still allowed access and controlled by the enterprise does tend to blur the lines quite a bit, especially as most tooling has been lacking decent isolation between &quot;enterprise&quot; and &quot;private&quot; on the same device. MDM tooling tends to want to administer the whole device and apply the stricter &quot;enterprise&quot; policies, with a pinky promise that private life is going to be respected.')
