From a more fundamental perspective GATs just lift a restriction.<p>Rust already has generics and Rust already has associated types. Previously you needed to know&#x2F;remember those features cannot interact for some reason, now they can. To me this is in a sense &#x27;less&#x27; and not &#x27;more&#x27;.<p>So, a matter of perspective I guess.')
