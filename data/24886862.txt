Where is the &quot;rewrite it in rust&quot; crowd when you need it? :)<p>The X11 protocol is the surface you need to maintain but swapping the internals should be do-able. Maybe we should have some call to action or reverse-auction or something. I&#x27;d love to support a viable path forward (I feel this effort would be a bit like neovim).<p>Personally I think it could start as a Xephyr or Xnest type project (to allow you to run rootless X) and then extend it with a from-scratch protocol that slowly replaces X (starting with support for simple but useful applications and going from there).<p>But clearly I only barely know what I&#x27;m talking about. Probably the reason things are the way they are is because of how the whole OpenGL &#x2F; Vulcan etc. thing is not resolved, so any potential replacement has no foundation to build on (but this is something I don&#x27;t know anything about).')
