There are places in the world run by unrecognized militia, who of course do censor free speech when they can. It&#x27;s still censorship, although they are not &quot;true governments&quot;.\nSo, if we have a monopoly (oligopoly) on the control over flow of information by big tech, this is effectively censorship. And if the laws don&#x27;t apply to them formally, then maybe there should be new laws for that.')
