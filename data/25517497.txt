This is an increasingly widely used technique: it is described in the WiscKey paper [1] and is also used in the PingCAP fork of RocksDB. It seems Chinese companies like forking RocksDB, I am not sure why, perhaps the combination of firewall+language barrier just makes it easier to fork and move fast than try to work regularly with upstream.<p>By separating out large values there&#x27;s less write amplification and things get faster because more of the SSTs fit in RAM cache. RocksDB wasn&#x27;t historically a great choice to hold things like file uploads - you&#x27;d use the traditional filesystem for that. But that&#x27;s quite constraining. When large values work better, it not only is a performance increase, but it enables new software designs too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;conference&#x2F;fast16&#x2F;fast16-papers-lu.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;conference&#x2F;fast16&#x2F;fast16...</a>')
