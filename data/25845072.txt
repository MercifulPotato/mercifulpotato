There was a big discussion on how he was doing job of an entire team and people were saying that they had 10 years or so of experience, but they were not familiar with all technologies listed in that article. But he wrote it in a very humble way, so he was not bragging or anything. Does anyone recall said article&#x2F;hn discussion? Is there a way for me to browse articles on hn from specific periods?')
