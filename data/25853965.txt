Magnetic will be more inefficient at higher power levels, because a particle you haven&#x27;t discovered yet will dampen the reaction if you use magnetic confinement.  Ultimately it&#x27;s because the string coupling parameters for the 3rd-dimension&#x2F;8th-dimension interaction are stronger than for the 5th-dimension&#x2F;7th-dimension interaction&quot;.
