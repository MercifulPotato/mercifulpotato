While it is possible to regain control after a single motor failure on a quadcopter, it&#x27;s extremely difficult and not something a human pilot could do, so you&#x27;d be relying on software. Also, if you don&#x27;t detect the failure instantly, the craft will flip over before the software can react because of the inherent instability.<p>Any solution where you have some kind of passive lift and inherent stability (eg. parachute, wing, etc.) is always going to be much safer.')
