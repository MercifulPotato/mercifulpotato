For graceful exit I recommend `trap cleanup EXIT` rather than specifically trapping SIGINT, mostly because the special exit signal is triggered no matter why the script is interrupted. I wouldn&#x27;t normally recommend pulling out variables into a separate files until those variables are used by more than one script. I&#x27;d be interested in the rationale for why that helps refactoring.')
