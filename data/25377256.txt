I&#x27;m just a part-time developer though, so my &quot;coding time&quot; is extremely limited and mainly just around scratching an itch as quickly as possible. I&#x27;m confident Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix would give me that speed and comfort too, but I already know Rails and the time I would spend learning Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix just to get access to LiveView would be better spent just learning Javascript and moving on.<p>I wish I had a use case where Elixir&#x27;s concurrency model makes the initial lift worth it, but my work doesn&#x27;t even require me to learn how to make Ruby scale past a $5 DigitalOcean droplet.')
