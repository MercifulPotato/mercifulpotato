This is extremely common, and like all of prehospital care is heavily protocol driven. Dead people encountered by EMS &#x2F; public safety are a much larger superset than those typically &quot;saved&quot; in a hospital setting, and those that meet the criteria to either stop, or not begin resuscitation really have no reason to be transported.<p>The link below is an example of EMS protocols that would cover this. Here&#x27;s a snippet.<p>&quot;Discontinuation of Prehospital Resuscitation&quot;<p>1. Discontinuation of CPR and ALS intervention may be implemented prior to contact with\nMedical Control if ALL of the following criteria have been met:\nPatient must be 18 years of age or older, or family of a minor is agreeable after\nconsultation with the APP or District Chief.\nAdequate CPR has been administered.\nAirway has been successfully managed with verification of device placement.\nAcceptable management techniques include orotracheal intubation, nasotracheal\nintubation, Blind Insertion Airway Device (BIAD) placement, or cricothyrotomy.\nIV or IO access has been achieved.\nRhythm appropriate medications and defibrillation have been administered according\nto protocol.\nPersistent asystole or agonal rhythm is present and no reversible causes are identified\nafter a minimum of 25 minutes of resuscitation.\nFailure to establish sustained palpable pulses or to establish persistent&#x2F;recurring\nventricular fibrillation&#x2F;tachycardia or lack of any continued neurological activity such as eye\nopening or motor responses\nAll EMS paramedic personnel involved in the patientâ€™s care agree that discontinuation\nof the resuscitation is appropriate\n2. If all of the above criteria are not met and discontinuation of pre-hospital resuscitation is\npossibly indicated or desired, contact Medical Control.\n3. The Deceased Subjects Policy should be followed.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wakegov.com&#x2F;ems&#x2F;medical&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;WCEMSS%20Standards%20Practice%202020%2012.11.20.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wakegov.com&#x2F;ems&#x2F;medical&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;WCEMSS%20Standa...</a>')
