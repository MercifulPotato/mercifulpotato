Because their entire architecture is built around new data being hot and old data not.<p>The tiny tin-pot hobby forum can keep every single post in memory and it&#x27;s not really a problem.  They can also do a full database scan pretty quickly.<p>But reddit can&#x27;t do that.  If it&#x27;s not in the cache, it takes a lot of work to pull the data from the database.  And there is no way to cache the entire dataset.  That&#x27;s why threads get locked at 6 months.  So they can be statically archived for quick access.<p>Economies of scale isn&#x27;t really part of it, it&#x27;s more about moore&#x27;s law.')
