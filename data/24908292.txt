Item(by='precsim', descendants=None, kids=[24920924], score=None, time=1603812241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907851, text='&gt; Seems like you are just comsol.<p>Maybe it isn&#x27;t too clear, but Comsol is just one solver (depending how to look at it I guess), while the idea of FEATool is to be a fully integrated platform for &quot;any&quot; solver, and in the extension to be able to mix and match and combine them (plug and play so to speak). At present I have just been able to implement the built-in MATLAB based multiphysics solver, with interfaces to FEniCS, OpenFOAM, and SU2.<p>&gt; Why FENICS and not DEAL.II or MOOSE (I don&#x27;t know, I am just curious. I used to use FENICs but got frustrated because their input syntax kept changing on me.<p>No particular reason really, I just started with FEniCS as it is quite popular and I found the FEATool PDE syntax easy to convert to FEniCS Python scripts. The plan is to add more and more external solver options.<p>&gt; As someone who does this 50+ hours a week in industry (although only structural modelling but frequently coupled with optics&#x2F;heat transfer&#x2F;) and is reasonably well versed in the up and coming research I have a couple of questions (or would have if I was a potential buyer).<p>Thank you, I really appreciate the interest and feedback. Unfortunately its kind of &quot;not implemented&#x2F;available yet&quot; to all your technical questions, although FEATool technically can solve any system of PDEs, I haven&#x27;t yet pre-defined and set up everything so it is easy for the end users. So as many things are possible to do by going down to the FEM matrix assembly syntax but from a users standpoint that is most often the same as it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; Also really cool. I have been thinking about writing software in this space but more nichy for about the past year and am beginning to get started, any interest in collaboration?<p>Thanks again for the feedback, I&#x27;m certainly open to all and any collaborations (email in my profile). Yes, looking back I think starting in a niche would have been a better approach.')
