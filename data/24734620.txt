Charges no commissions on options and you get automatic deposits. So it has the smallest barrier to entry. Very straightforward to use, it&#x27;s very simple and clean. Buy and trade stocks and puts and calls, no problem. Yes if you try more complex option strategies then RH starts to fall apart. But for the majority of people that are just tagging along from wallstreetbets or something like that, RH is the simplest way to get you in the stock market.')
