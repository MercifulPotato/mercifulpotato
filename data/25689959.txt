In an environment that espouses entrepreneurship to the max, we don&#x27;t spend enough time talking about if companies lie to us or not, how do they plan to monetize, etc.<p>There&#x27;s just no way that Facebook wasn&#x27;t planning to monetize this platform when they wrote this article. Frankly, situations like this should be treated like deceptive advertising practices.<p>Just like in the political arena, there are very few consequences to just flat out lie to people, and that&#x27;s unacceptable.')
