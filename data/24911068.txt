AMD margins aren&#x27;t great.  AMD is making phenomenal products lately but if they&#x27;re giving them away to gain market share then they may never be as profitable as investors would like.<p>If Intel gets their house in order in a couple years, AMD won&#x27;t have much time to gain market and raise prices.
