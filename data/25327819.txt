Nore does the semantic weight of Diem vs. Libra really present a significant difference.<p>The problem has always been that it&#x27;s an attempt to create an extra-governmental monetary system spearheaded by one of the largest tech companies in the world, in particular one that has a low level of social trust within both the political sphere and the libertarian-privacy-maximalist sphere that represents a cornerstone of crypto support.<p>For my own opinion, it doesn&#x27;t matter how independent the oversight group may be from Facebook, it is still a Facebook initiative. Web standards, ostensibly independent, can be subverted by corporate interests. I have no trust that something as foundational to the world economy as a global monetary system would not also be subject to such interests at a fundamental level. Give the ACLU a seat, give the EFF a seat, find a dozen other non-corporate NGO&#x27;s with a tangential interest in such a project, and I will still not be convinced that the system wouldn&#x27;t be coopted a plutocratic oligarchy, if not outright kleptocracy. There would simply be too much power and money that would acrue to the &quot;winners&quot;.<p>Whatever the future of crypto may be, it should be shoved forcefully away from such a direction, as well as any direction that makes it easy to facilitate criminal enterprise&#x2F;money laundering. I freely admit that I don&#x27;t have a solution that solves that range of problems though.')
