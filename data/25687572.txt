I&#x27;m not really sure what&#x27;s their problem; they clearly never traded the market or used it. Maybe it&#x27;s a butt-hurt feeling from missing out on this decade best performing assets?<p>I&#x27;ll give you a more sensible counter-argument: If you held USDT in the last 4 years (only) and actively generated yield (requires 1 hours work max per week), and periodically withdrew it (1-3 months) my reports show a 120% gain. This means if you bought $100k of USDT 4 years ago, you&#x27;d have withdrawn $120k into real dollars and still have $100k of USDT. In this situation, it&#x27;s impossible to lose even if Tether is worth 0 tomorrow.<p>Yield have gone considerably down. This means traders now trust USDT more than they did a few years ago. This would also mean that traders who are into risk would not hold USDT, they would rather hold something else to get better yield. If USDT was risky, its total market cap will decrease, as it doesn&#x27;t make sense to hold into it with low yield. That or the market will quickly collapse.<p>This can give you an idea (better than a stamped report from any AAA auditing firm) about how strong the USDT position in the market is.')
