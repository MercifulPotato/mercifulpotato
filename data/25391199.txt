This has been an inhibiting factor with regards to investment in research.<p>This design — cheap and transportable in a standard shipping container — significantly ups the ante on that risk, to put it mildly.<p>Deployed singly, small, low-power, short-lifespan reactors would increase the burden of maintaining regulatory control over those reactors — destined, by design, for catastrophic failure unless they are retired within a safety period — which in turn would the risk of a nuclear contamination incident. This could be mitigated by operating the reactors in banks at a containment&#x2F;maintenance site.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what parts of the reactor could be usefully recycled. All the metals would be embrittled by neutron bombardment.')
