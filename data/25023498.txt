Each faction will demand that <i>their</i> agenda be pursued <i>first</i> with the most <i>money, time and effort</i>. Unfortunately resources are limited (in particular time is limited to 4 and, in some cases, 2 years). Political infighting amongst these factions will increase to a level so intense that people may long for the return of Donald Trump.')
