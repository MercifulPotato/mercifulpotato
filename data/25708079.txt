It was 40k steps with 34.6km ran&#x2F;walked, so 60k steps would be around 47-48km, let&#x27;s round up to 50km. A 5km&#x2F;hour pace is actually more of a stroll (for me) so 10 hours would be the high end for me for walking 60k steps. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to bring it down to 5 hours without getting into a jogging or slow run pace (10km&#x2F;hour), though at the time I probably could&#x27;ve done that (I was running long distances regularly. So <i>for me</i> a 60k day suggests 7.5-10 hours of walking. I looked at some other high step count days (25-35k) days and they show similar numbers to that one.')
