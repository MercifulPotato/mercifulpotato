Things like inflation and changing consumer trends have led to what we see now -- don&#x27;t know about small towns but at least in major North American Cities.<p>What we have now is either people staying single longer  and eventually they end up with Simpsons&#x27; style living standard (while staying Single) or they eventually achieve it via DINK lifestyle.<p>I think a huge part that has played into making this transformation is due to people&#x27;s increased access to cheap loans (mortgage) and the idea that real-estate is the ultimate ROI game-in-the-town and the new pension fund.<p>What we see now (compared to say 1980s): almost no major corps offering pension, inflation to the point where both Husband and Wife need to work in order to just afford a property and perhaps a kid, creeping fees&#x2F;charges (cellphones, internet, netflix, disney+, etc.).<p>This all leads to people, in my opinion, to look for safety net in order to fend themselves in old age: buy house -- no, make it 2 or 3 houses so you can live off their rent income, delay (or forget about) having kid(s) to achieve that financial goals. Automation and globalization has also caused some pain points: IT jobs are much more competitive than say even 10 years ago and there is always threat of being left out in the cold due to outsourcing.<p>See, funny thing is, here in Canada, I would always see hardworking immigrant families where the Husband and the Wife would be working in multiple low-income jobs and even their teenage kids would be picking up retail&#x2F;factory job while studying to balance their family&#x27;s financial books. To me, it always seemed excessive or even mindboggling - but now, it makes perfect sense...it is the very future for the masses in North America.<p>And for folks in developing World: Don&#x27;t worry, your turn will come to experience all this (if you haven&#x27;t yet) soon enough in your lifetime. I guarantee it.')
