Apparently the WRT54G-L is <i>still</i> being being sold new from Amazon, but considering I have a 14-year-old one running DD-WRT, still going strong, I&#x27;m not surprised.<p>Anyway, back then, a lot of these devices had really bad security. Some where so bad that you could do an XSS attack that gains root access to someone&#x27;s router. Someone could definitely have intentionally added a backdoor, but I agree that it&#x27;s pretty likely that developers working on a router with the goal of being cheap were lazy, rushed, or just didn&#x27;t care, and left development backdoor open, allowed admin access on LAN and WAN, or something else.')
