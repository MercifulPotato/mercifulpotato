With so many movies in the epic, they&#x27;ll still be fun to watch 30 years from now.<p>Vision really disappointed in the penultimate. I think his character was hyped up a lot in Age of Ultron. Became disappointing seeing him go so easily.<p>Older Thanos was a really well-thought and played villain. One which many people got to identify with (based on his goals in the movie). Captain America delivered when he proved worthy. I think Captain Marvel was an arrogant addition that needed to fill in pieces to the story, like how Stark and Nebula get saved.<p>It&#x27;s going to be a classic series in the decades to come. Marvel delivered.')
