Is it regulation? Infrastructure cost? Lack of competition?<p>I don&#x27;t buy the lack of competition argument honestly. Cellular data is a commodity. Cell towers are not exactly a utility to the extent that optical fiber&#x2F;coax is. If there was margin to be exploited, capital would have flowed in to take advantage. But it&#x27;s likely that the risk adjusted return in the cellular business is already too low to attract more players and drive down costs without a significant technology moat.')
