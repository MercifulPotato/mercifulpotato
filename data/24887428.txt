And by people I mean developers, Linux users, people on usenet, etc. We all appreciated his contributions but at the end of the day just figured he was wearing a tin foil hat.</i><p>Yeah. Pretty much the only people who took him seriously were the folks who <i>wanted</i> to lock down computers, or were being paid to do so.<p>I remember going to a west coast science fiction convention in the early &#x27;90s (most likely a Westercon or LosCon, possibly a BayCon) that had a panel on &quot;computers and copyright&quot; or something similar.<p>I don&#x27;t recall the panel itself much, except that it was a fairly small room, but one bit stuck in my mind from the Q&amp;A: An audience member said something to the effect that the necessary restrictions on copying would just be implemented in hardware rather than software. I think a panelist dismissed his statement, but the audience member insisted that it was possible, and that he had X years industry experience to prove it. At which point the conversation started getting very loud with a substantial fraction of the room speaking over him (and each other) saying he was wrong.<p>And that was it. I&#x27;m pretty sure most of the folks in that room came away with the impression that &quot;information wants to be free&quot; and there was little that could be done to oppose that.<p>It was about a decade before that whole exchange came to mind again, when &quot;Trusted Computing&quot; started gaining traction and criticism.<p>I&#x27;ve occasionally wondered just who that audience member was, what their &quot;industry experience&quot; was at that point, and what they&#x27;ve worked on since.')
