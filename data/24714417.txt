We discussed the problem in my discrete math class and the professor had stated the problem without the constraint. Many in the class, being far too young to even know who Monty Hall is, were confused, and several had their &#x27;aha!&#x27; moment once that constraint was mentioned.<p>&gt;  According to Wikipedia, even Paul Erd≈ës remained unconvinced until he was shown a computer simulation.<p>Interestingly, coding up my own simulation took me from understanding the problem to grokking it. I&#x27;d definitely suggest anyone who has programming ability but doesn&#x27;t grok the problem to write up a simulation.')
