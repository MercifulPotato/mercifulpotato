If the alternative is the firmware is just built into the device somehow, the firmware is still just as non-free, despite that you can make a fully open driver.<p>If anything, letting the driver upload its own firmware is more open.<p>Edit: replies are misunderstanding what I&#x27;m saying: you can have a 100% free and open driver without binary blobs if the blob was instead embedded in the target device -- but I&#x27;m arguing this is not any more open than allowing a mostly free driver to upload a blob.')
