(Neither repetition and emotion are signals of truth; the inflammation and use of those things is a good signal that some manipulation is going on and that facts are lacking.)<p>* The &#x27;little guy&#x27; is powering this movement. We don&#x27;t know who is leading it and who is pushing it. We do know that social media is often used for mass manipulation, leading large numbers into highly delusional, angry territory.<p>* The intention is retribution: We don&#x27;t know who is pushing this or why.<p>* The &#x27;little guy&#x27; will benefit: Investment activities with no economic benefit will lose money, in a functioning market. The &#x27;little guys&#x27; are the ones who most need an increase in economic activity and suffer most from the economic loss, especially right now.<p>* Markets are gambling: Financial markets serve an economic benefit to the public; otherwise they have no purpose. Market activity that has no economic benefit wastes precious resources. It denies resources to the people who are most productive to them,and gives them to the unproductive and sometimes to the corrupt, empowering them.<p>* This angry mob is driving GameStop&#x27;s securities prices: Do we have evidence that it&#x27;s not others?<p>* Regulations are to control the &#x27;little guy&#x27;: Regulations protect everyone from fraud and stabilize our markets. Not all regulations are well-intended or perfect, but an unregulated market is not realistic or desirable.<p>* There is a &#x27;little guy&#x27; and &#x27;big guy&#x27;: These are just arbitrary divisions with no definition, and they may have nothing to so with the situation. Whenever something goes wrong, there are always people who will try to gain power buy inflaming a mob and pointing them toward a target. In the past, it was often religion that was used. We know this technique is often used on social media, to great effect.<p>What I see is an angry mob. I wouldn&#x27;t treat it as anything else. Edit: Looking at past angry mobs and financial bubbles, it&#x27;s the mob that suffers. Someone else will make money off of them.')
