(That&#x27;s the whole point of this, after all: we&#x27;re implementing an agreed-upon interface that application developers are using. Implementing an interface happens all the time outside of computers and is not a difficult concept to turn into shitty car metaphors if you really must).<p>So, the interface is published in every consuming application. If you look at an application which is missing a shared object and figure out how to implement the missing pieces in your own version of that shared object, you&#x27;ve re-implemented (part of) an API. So the question is, in doing so, have you infringed their copyright?')
