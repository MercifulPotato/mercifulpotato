That give an extra $1000 in gas per year for the large car, or an extra $83 per month if a large car is needed once a month, or $28&#x2F;hour saved for the inconvenience of the hours spent picking up and dropping off the rental.<p>Either way, the delta is much smaller than what I was expecting, in the range of a couple of hundred a month at the high end, depending on which way the numbers swing. It can be something that&#x27;s not worth worrying about, for someone who has a middle class income.')
