If you didn&#x27;t\nmanually tag all your bookmarks, ideally with a consistent\nnaming scheme, finding certain sites again can be quite a task.\nBut I know what tab group a certain website that I last used 2\nyears ago and can&#x27;t remember the name&#x2F;url of has to be in. It&#x27;s\nbasically the web version of a file manager. Why would I spend\ntime to organise bookmarks in some folder structure if the\nstructure already exists in the tab bar, always up to date?')
