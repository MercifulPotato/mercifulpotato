Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=[25176320, 25176211], score=None, time=1606034991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172057, text='&gt; I disagree with almost every single point of this article except that buying can be better than building<p>I agree, and I found the comment on how QAs somehow made quality worse to be specially absurd and detached from reality. I mean, the author went as far as presenting the brilliant solution to his problem by suggesting... Automating manual testing? Where did he came up with this stuff? I mean, for a couple of decades now, manual tests are only reserved to either tests that are not possible to automate, of exploratory testing. It&#x27;s a suggestion in line of &quot;let them eat cake&quot;, because it shows total detachment from the real world and specially how things are actually done in the industry.<p>And how exactly can QAs degrade quality if all they do is check if the work done by developers does indeed work and complies with requirements ? It&#x27;s mind boggling. QAs don&#x27;t change code. QAs see the mess you do before it hits the customer.<p>The absurdity of this mess reaches a point where the author complains that a failure by the developer to update tests to reflect his changes is somehow the fault of the guys tasked with running the tests? I mean, come on.<p>All in all I was left with the impression that the author is totally oblivious to how he has been introducing and living with abhorrent software development practices and, to further compound the problems he has been creating for him and for others, he&#x27;s shifting the blame away from himself to everyone around him.')
