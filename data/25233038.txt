I think this perception has the nicely ironic property that it exists because it&#x27;s false.<p>pg hasn&#x27;t changed. He can&#x27;t; he&#x27;s too weird (nonconformist, if you prefer). Traits at that level just are.<p>What&#x27;s changed is his status. Becoming rich and famous changes how people perceive you. What sounds scrappy and original coming from an underdog sounds inflated and self-congratulatory coming from a fatcat. The irony is that it&#x27;s because he hasn&#x27;t changed—in particular, to accommodate the expectations people have once they classify you as a fatcat—that people complain that he changed.<p>More ironically yet, this &#x27;change&#x27; is actually the invariant. pg never accommodated the expectations people had. His essays pissed people off 10 years ago, 15 years ago, coming up on 20 years ago. While the surface reasons have changed, the feelings are so similar that the deep structure of the off-pissage is surely the same.')
