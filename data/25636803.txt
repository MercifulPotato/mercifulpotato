I run 9 cheap chinese RGB fans (EZDIY-FAB) and two custom rgb strips at top and bottom, which emit light against two white radiators. [1] The white allows the light to reflect from basically every surface in the case. They come with a custom rf remote, and I setup everything so I can control the strips and the fans separately. Currently, the fans are all white, with the strips being red at top and bottom.<p>But if I want to, I can go all unicorn... - or turn everything off.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;7PqDhKo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;7PqDhKo</a>')
