Item(by='willcipriano', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611773725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25931190, text='I agree it isn&#x27;t inflation in the classic sense, I&#x27;m not sure of a great term for this effect.<p>A thought experiment, if I printed up a dollar for each one in circulation then put them in a vault that shouldn&#x27;t cause inflation even though the money supply has doubled, similarly if in a thousand years someone opens the vault and puts those dollars into circulation inflation happens even though the money supply has unchanged.<p>My thesis is dollars that go between hedge fund to hedge fund are &quot;in a vault&quot; compared to dollars that are buying food at the local Walmart. If some of those hedge fund dollars ends up in the hands of a individual (say a minimum wage increase causes firms to halt buybacks and direct that money toward payroll) that would cause inflation of consumer goods as now we have more dollars chasing the same output.')
