The path to billions in revenue is to control eyeballs, marketplaces, platforms, without ever strictly selling it away.<p>Rentierism is fundamentally unproductive. If you&#x27;re a keynesian, a rent is literally the excess that can be extracted due to some market inefficiency, and the flood gates should release a million competitors into the market.<p>Clearly this isn&#x27;t what is happening. I&#x27;m okay with taxing rentiers for the regulatory protection they rely on to protect their monopolies.<p>I completely agree with your other points.')
