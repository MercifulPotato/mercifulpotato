They were just too damn big, heavy, and expensive per amp hour for anything more than a commuter car.  Tesla struggled with batteries early on and ended up building their own factory in the end.<p>That said, there were definitely people excited about electric commuter cars and the big automakers were disdainful of them.  GM&#x27;s famous EV1 that they refused to sell (only lease) because they wanted the power to destroy them the instant the government got off their back about electric cars.<p>There was a missed market opportunity for a startup that did electric commuter cars in the 90s and 2000s.  Maybe not a huge userbase, but very loyal.  Of course a small company would face the same dealership franchise headwinds that Tesla had to fight and might not succeed, especially in a world with relatively little Internet connectivity and less comfort with shopping and buying online.')
