It requires additional explanation to differentiate &quot;no because I couldn&#x27;t understand it in time&quot; and &quot;no because I think it&#x27;s a bad idea.&quot; That&#x27;s a fair bit of nuance, which these days is... well often difficult to accurately and easily convey to others.<p>This is very true, but why, in the year 2020, is it still true?<p>Why does it seem like we can argue only about object level matters, and almost no one [1] can see that the framework we run politics on top of is <i>fundamentally flawed</i>?  Would it maybe help if we were to consciously force ourselves to conceptualize society&#x2F;humanity as a video game, that has parameters and behaviors, and the state of the system can be acted on, but our actions will only be effective if the game allows it?<p>[1] A rare exception to this in my opinion is Jimmy Dore&#x27;s initiative to force a floow vote on Medicare for All<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=%22Medicare+for+All%22+%22jimmy+dore%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=%22Medicare+for+All%22+%22ji...</a><p>What I like about this approach is that it kind of pulls the &quot;invisibility cloak&quot; off of political claims and rhetoric, exposing the truth that lies inside.  It appears that he&#x27;s going to lose this battle (a vote will not be held), but even so it has forced a new level of propaganda to be deployed into the memeplex <i>on very short notice</i>, making it much easier for the average Joe to see through it.  I think this is a good strategy: take away control of the playing field, so politicians can&#x27;t use pre-written and memorized rhetorical talking points to dismiss obvious desires like affordable healthcare, which has fairly bi-partisan support among voters.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;69-percent-americans-want-medicare-all-including-46-percent-republicans-new-poll-says-1500187" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;69-percent-americans-want-medicare-...</a><p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter if M4A is not achieved (that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at anyways) - the main strategic goal imho should be to bring awareness to the public mind of the notion that politicians are not being truthful (notice I am not saying they are lying) when they say that their goals and actions are to execute &quot;the will of the people&quot;, or do what is &quot;best&quot; for the American population.  Politics, as it is, is largely all theatre, although even the participants themselves may not actually be consciously aware of it.<p>&quot;<i>All the worldâ€™s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.</i>&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.poetryfoundation.org&#x2F;poems&#x2F;56966&#x2F;speech-all-the-worlds-a-stage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.poetryfoundation.org&#x2F;poems&#x2F;56966&#x2F;speech-all-the-...</a>')
