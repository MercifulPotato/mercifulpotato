I realized some years ago that when trying to figure out how much my time is worth to scale everything with respect to the amount of discretionary free time I will have. If a new job will cut that free time by half then I expect double the pay.<p>And then I realized there are second order effects. Double my pay actually means much more than double my savings per year as my costs are more or less fixed.<p>So then I changed the formula to scale with respect to the amount I am saving versus the discretionary free time. Maybe a 30% raise would actually double my savings.<p>And by discretionary free time I am subtracting time spent doing chores. I live very close to work and even getting a job that requires a 1 hour commute each way makes a huge difference in my discretionary free time and should be compensated accordingly.<p>And then I took it one step further. I decided to take an Excel sheet and map out all the discretionary free time I think I will have for the rest of my life. And then I evaluated job offers based on which one will maximize that free time. So maybe cutting short free time right now is okay if it is more than compensated by having me retire a lot earlier. Of course then you may want to factor that free time while young is perhaps worth more than free time when your body is not that healthy.<p>And of course you may not live long enough to retire and you do want to take that into account as well and not put all your joy off towards the end.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a rabbit hole.')
