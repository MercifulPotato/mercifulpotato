Things needed to work in Linux are not unusual for customizations needed for any large system, that we do routinely. If you think this is a problem, it can only be from lack of experience of large C++ systems.<p>When people complain about the complexity of C++, it is generally because they have no experience of large systems that demand all kinds of specializations. C++ can be used in a simple way to write simple programs, and then you get to ignore all the knobs and switches. It can also be used in all varieties of specialized environments, and then you find knob and switch settings to make it work for that environment.')
