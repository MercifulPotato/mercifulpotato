I keep reading it is, but I have never encountered it. (Edit: I just googled it, and Wikipedia claims there have been studies finding hidden Facebook groups about QAnon with millions of users. Seriously, I don&#x27;t think that is sufficient proof for the ubiquity of QAnon. Edit2: the article I read, German Wikipedia, pretty much seems to simply equate people who voted for Trump with QAnon believers. No wonder they estimate their number to be in the millions. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QAnon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;QAnon</a> ).')
