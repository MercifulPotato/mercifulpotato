I hate the cliffhangers; I hate the one-episode-a-week shit; I hate the split seasons; I hate the waits even when the series is probably coming back.  Best to wait for something like Breaking Bad to finish its entire run, and read how everyone liked it, including the ending, and then start watching the first episode.  There is an overwhelming amount of good content from the past, more than I will ever be able to watch.<p>ALTHOUGH.  Rick and Morty hooked me anyway.  Love that show, and so pissed at how long it took to finish out this past season when it was delayed.')
