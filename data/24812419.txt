This, singlehandedly damages more of democratic processes, which depend on healthy discourse, than any questionable content put into it.<p>&gt; now use the shield of &quot;free speech&quot; to push propaganda and lies in order to undermine truth<p>Is there a form of free speech, contents of which you disagree that <i>doesn’t</i> push propaganda or undermine some definition of your truth? In other words, in this version of narrative warfare, every opponent narrative is already “propaganda”, every disagreement is “destroying democracy”.<p>Except truth is hardly an out there objectivity to which propgandic words magically render our eyes blind. It is a <i>process</i> of dialectic; disagreements that can be integrated together and form a more comprehensive picture of our musings in an infinite problem space.<p>It is the false sense of certainty, including utopian ideas of its attainability with likes of “fact checks” and judicious restriction of speech that destroy this process, and with it any hope of integrating opposing worldviews without wanting to hurt those who hold them.')
