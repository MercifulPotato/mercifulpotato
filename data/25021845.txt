Item(by='barkingcat', descendants=None, kids=[25022327], score=None, time=1604798653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021562, text='I think for your application, you&#x27;ll just need to separate the concerns out a bit<p>You have the mic preamp, which can definitely be diy&#x27;able<p>Then you have the AD&#x2F;DA converter - this will convert the output from your diy&#x27;ed mic preamp into digital signals - this can&#x27;t be done easily DIY, but you can purchase chips that does this : the ESS Sabre is one of the most popular AD&#x2F;DA converters that you can probably source from aliexpress, etc - you might need to buy in bulk though otherwise the vendor might not talk to you.<p>Then you have the usb interface itself, which comes with all the issues about certification, interface types and properly engineering&#x2F;building a usb interface that works with consumer ports across different platforms is non-trivial for DIY&#x27;ers. You might be able to do something like &quot;make a usb work for my specific computer, with a specific motherboard&#x2F;platform&quot; but for example, making something that adheres to the usb2.0 or 3.0 spec for both mac + pc + anything else that uses usb (for example, your cell phone, etc) - that&#x27;s a totally different exercise that most diy&#x27;ers won&#x27;t be able to easily do.<p>Again, you can buy off-the-shelf chips to do this, but at that level, you&#x27;re doing digital circuitboard design, and I&#x27;m not sure how well bread boarding works with things like usb. You might be able to layout a PCB and have someone etch it for you, etc.<p>After that you&#x27;ll need to build the output portions of the interface (after coming out of the DA chip). That can be DIY&#x27;ed.<p>If you want to DIY an in-and-out audio interface you&#x27;ll need to take on all these different aspects all at the same time.<p>That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t see many DIY projects of this kind.<p>Rather, the DIY projects being talked about in this thread are one aspect of this chain: you want to drive some speakers, ok! we can build an amp diy. You want to do AD&#x2F;DA ok you can do that one thing with a homebuilt board, with a chip, etc.<p>But having all aspects being integrated together is non-trivial for a DIY. You might be able to use a Raspberry Pi zero or something like that for driving the AD&#x2F;DA - USB portions, etc and that could be a way to go.<p>In fact, I think using an RPi as a DAC would be a great way to DIY a usb audio interface, at least you&#x27;ve got all the chips integrated already, and you have an audio jack for getting inputs, etc, and you have the power source and usb OTG port[1] already designed, etc. And that&#x27;s where you start to see $100 isn&#x27;t all that bad for a usb audio interface.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;gbaman&#x2F;50b6cca61dd1c3f88f41" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;gbaman&#x2F;50b6cca61dd1c3f88f41</a>')
