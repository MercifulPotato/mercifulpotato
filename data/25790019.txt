So there is really no incentive NOT to illegally keep data like this.<p>Its also worth noting the UK had a distinction here between illegal (criminal and punishable) and unlawful (not permitted but not a crime either, like say trespassing or taking something that isn&#x27;t yours accidently). This act is (AFAIK) unlawful. So no police officer can be arrested and personally criminally charged for keeping this data. Its not something you don&#x27;t have a right to do...')
