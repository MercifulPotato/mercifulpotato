Colonies need to be well-prepared to successfully overwinter. They are amazingly robust when they are healthy, but anything that affects this preparation can easily be deadly over a period of time.<p>There can be many reasons. The Varroa Mite [0] is one that we have to constantly fight against, these days. The mites don&#x27;t kill the entire colony, but weakens it so much that the colony can&#x27;t overwinter. Or there viruses [1] that deform the bees&#x27; wings that can debilitate the colony. There are also other problems that we don&#x27;t see where I live, but other beekeepers have to fight, such as the Small Hive Beetle [2].<p>I suspect because of the ongoing wildfires and poor air quality in this region, one of my queens stopped laying eggs mid-summer, at a time when she normally lays 1,500-2,000 eggs every day. I had to replace her. I don&#x27;t know if that colony is going to survive the winter.<p>Some other colonies had similar problems. Yesterday a beekeeper friend told me she lost a colony and she has another one on the brink of collapsing.<p>Then, we also don&#x27;t know who is using what type of pesticides around here. Bees can forage anywhere in the 2-3 mile radius. It&#x27;s near impossible for me to know what&#x27;s going on in such a wide area.<p>It&#x27;s a constant uphill battle.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Varroa_destructor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Varroa_destructor</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deformed_wing_virus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deformed_wing_virus</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Small_hive_beetle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Small_hive_beetle</a>')
