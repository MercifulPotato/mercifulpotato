However, often b2b companies simply want to provide an auth experience to their client within a specific subdomain. They do not mind the auth data be stored in the same db tables as other clients. If this is the use case, then we do support it. If you want strict isolation of auth per tenant, then you will have to deploy multiple instances of the SuperTokens core (as of today).')
