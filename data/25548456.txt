I’ve had a pretty big share of bad, and there’s lots of folks who think I “haven’t lived up to my potential,” meaning that I didn’t give them what they wanted from me.<p>At this stage in my life, I am strangely satisfied. Never thought I’d be happy, the way I am, but it’s a funny old world.<p>It could have turned out <i>a lot</i> worse. I am truly blessed.<p>Reminds me of <i>Sliding Doors</i>. Interesting movie.')
