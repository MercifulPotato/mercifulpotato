You are forced to take all the &quot;mess&quot; that&#x27;s in your head and narrate it to someone else, in the process getting much simpler perspective on it.</i><p>On a related note: some people close to me like to unload the contents of their head at me. I couldn&#x27;t understand why - I initially assumed this was a kind of &quot;I need someone to emphasize with me and validate my feelings&quot; thing. Hearing roughly similar thoughts about the same issue for the fifth time in a month got particularly tiresome, and I struggled to understand why these people are doing it. Until one day I looked at the evening &quot;mind dumps&quot; I take in my .org mode file, and it hit me: <i>it&#x27;s the same thing</i>. It has the same cadence, and same tendency to jump back and forth between related topics. Much like I sort through my thoughts by writing them down in solitude, these people are sorting through their thoughts by talking at me. All that time, I&#x27;ve just been a rubber duck.<p>That is to say: I think not only this may be how therapy works, I think many (most?) people do this in social context - perhaps being afraid or unacustommed to talking to themselves, or to writing thoughts down (one needs to be a fast typist to write at the speed of thought, which is perhaps why this kind of sorting your thoughts through writing isn&#x27;t as popular as through talking).')
