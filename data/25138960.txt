Git was made by a man from Finland, I find it highly unlikely he had nefarious intentions in naming the default branch &#x27;master&#x27; and anybody who disagrees really needs to reevaluate everything we know about Linus. He doesn&#x27;t care about people&#x27;s attributes, he cares about code quality above all things, not to mention in the context of the project the word master can only fit under the simple context of a golden master. Context matters.<p>Will I lose any sleep over it? Probably not, because this changes absolutely nothing in the racism landscape. It just confuses some, maybe outrages others. They&#x27;ve made something that was never racist into something racist (at least in their heads).<p>Sidenote: I do wonder if the person who proposed the change wrote it up from their master bedroom.')
