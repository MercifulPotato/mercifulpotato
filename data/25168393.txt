I made enough about 15 years ago to never have to work again.  It didn&#x27;t take long to learn the following lessons:<p>1.  Not working gets boring fast.  In less than six months I was casting about for something to do.  I still work, not because I have to, but because it gives me a reason to get up in the morning.  It&#x27;s not working that sucks, it&#x27;s <i>having</i> to work that sucks.<p>2.  You can get used to anything, and hardly anything is as nice in reality as it is in your imagination.  The trappings commonly associated with money -- houses, cars, private jets -- the charm wears off shockingly quickly and it starts to feel like a burden and a PITA.  The houses all need to be furnished and maintained.  The cars get old and need to be maintained.  Even private jet travel is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Today we have one house, we drive old, boring, but incredibly reliable Japanese cars, and we fly commercial (though I have to admit that being able to go business class is awfully nice).<p>Money is just a lever.  If you focus all your mental energy into acquiring the leverage without ever giving any thought to where you want to pry, you can end up badly lost.')
