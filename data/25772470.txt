In that case proactive recall would make sense.<p>But that&#x27;s not the case here. Here if you&#x27;ve only used 0.5 of 8Gb, and Tesla is required to make a recall, all Tesla is doing is replacing your old unit with the exact same model but now 8Gb free space instead of 7.5Gb free.<p>Instead, if a new design is not developed, shouldn&#x27;t it be treated like a recurring maintenance? like when the memory is 6 or 7Gb full, the user gets a warning to take it to the repair to have the unit replaced, or something.<p>Also why isn&#x27;t the memory emptied from time to time? old data should be of no use and should be backed up to Tesla cloud, or user&#x27;s cloud storage outside the vehicle or something? In which case the whole exercise is moot.')
