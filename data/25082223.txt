They want their computer to show them pictures on Facebook, funny videos online and run some numbers for them. People don&#x27;t want to care about stuff like privacy, because thinking gets in the way of fun and ease.<p>Malware has already bypassed Apple&#x27;s signature mechanism and has been vetted to run by Apple as a result. The security and trust argument only works if Apple&#x27;s security mechanisms work.<p>The vetting Apple is doing here is a solution looking for a problem. People have been installing third party applications forever, the ability to do so is a feature, not a bug. Instead of fixing the lacking antivirus software built into macOS, Apple is branding third party code as dangerous and untrustworthy.<p>I don&#x27;t know anybody who cares about the problem this is solving, because it&#x27;s a theoretical problem only tech literate people care about; the same tech literate people are also the people who run into this stuff the most. The reason that no one is offering a better solution is that there isn&#x27;t a real problem that this solution is solving.')
