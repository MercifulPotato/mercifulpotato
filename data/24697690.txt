It&#x27;s harder to debug things or pair program when needed, it&#x27;s harder to grab someone&#x27;s attention, it&#x27;s easier to miscommunicate, and communication is a lot slower. You also don&#x27;t get the same camaraderie as you would face to face, but the upside is that you also don&#x27;t get distracted by attractive coworkers.<p>However, few offices are ideal. Traffic and commuting is one of the worst little things of daily life. It&#x27;s dangerous. It ruins the environment. Parking sucks.<p>Good offices are wide open spaces, with good air, good climate, and cheerful environments. Many offices are bad environments and overcrowded.<p>There&#x27;s a balance that COVID has tilted. Some will learn that they don&#x27;t need offices anymore, especially when people have decked out their home offices. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll see employers double down on home offices where they can. Some, like Airbnb or Apple might find that morale is better in their offices. Some smaller companies might set up theirs out of major cities, where lifestyle is cheaper and less crowded.')
