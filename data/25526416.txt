Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608805793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25515109, text='Nim is a huge language, but it is very well designed, and unlike e.g. C++, you can use and discover its feature gradually - including when using 3rd party libraries. It has lispy macros (except reader macros - you start with a parsed-to-ast text), closures, effect tracking, C&#x2F;C++ level performance &amp;interop and a lot more - but somehow, somewhat by language design and somewhat by community standards, you don&#x27;t need to fully understand these things (and hardly to be aware of them) when writing your own Nim code or when using 3rd party libraries.<p>(Whereas in C++, you can pick your own subset for your own code, but as soon as you pull in a 3rd party library, you HAVE to understand the preprocessor, templates, often template metaprogramming, lambda capture rules if that library is built for them, etc).')
