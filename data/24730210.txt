They are on the fringe even in the rural, comparatively religious society I grew up in.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that most people don&#x27;t really worry about this kind of ideological questions, like whether studying in university is incompatible with Quran. Hell, most people don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s in Quran. So at least in contemporary world, I think lack of Muslim progress is better explained by poverty and not through those ideological analyses.')
