It&#x27;s about putting yourself in a productive setting where you only focus on creating and you have minimal distractions.<p>Besides, a dedicated computer for music production has a low entry cost since you basically only need a decent amount of ram. My studio computer has an old i7, 32 GB ram and it doesn&#x27;t even have a GPU and the price was less than $500 a few years ago. It&#x27;s going to outlast my current gaming rig and probably my next one as well.')
