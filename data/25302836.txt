Do they eat a ton? Are they somewhat capable of managing money? Do they talk during movies? Are they inappropriately handsy when you don&#x27;t want them to?).<p>If afterwards it turns out you did not like it both of you at least had a good time due to the environment, so it is pretty unlikely to end as a huge disaster (and stick inside your head as such). Especially when you prefer low-stress personal interaction, it&#x27;s easy to see the appeal.')
