One class checks those things and knows that their post didn&#x27;t go through. (That doesn&#x27;t apply to voting, thoughâ€”that&#x27;s important.) A second class of user doesn&#x27;t check and doesn&#x27;t know. That second class tends to be more naive spammers or promoters, and shadowbanning works well in those cases.<p>It&#x27;s useful with the more sophisticated class too, though. If they have to start fresh with new accounts, it slows them down and makes what they&#x27;re doing more obvious to the community.')
