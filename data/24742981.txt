If it were, you would know that &quot;similar&quot; and &quot;identical&quot; are not synonyms.<p>&gt; Interpreting this as saying that natural gas infrastructure can be repurposed to work with hydrogen makes sense<p>It absolutely does not make sense.   It&#x27;s a bit of illogic you apparently are not capable of recognizing as a non sequitur.<p>BTW, the equipment we have for handling hydrogen is not necessarily in pipelines (although the US does have many miles of hydrogen pipeline even today).  It&#x27;s in ammonia synthesis plants.  It&#x27;s in oil refineries.  It&#x27;s in chlor-alkali cells.   The world economy makes many millions of tons of hydrogen each year, and that hydrogen is manipulated with equipment that exists.   Compressors, pipes, pumps, valves, sensors... all those exist in forms that work with hydrogen.')
