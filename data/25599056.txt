Item(by='mrslave', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609460810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597693, text='&gt; I think people in many white collar jobs highly underestimate their ability to set boundaries and make their work&#x2F;life balance healthier.<p>This is something that took me 1.5-2 decades to figure out. My first &quot;worst project&quot; was around 2007 and it was hell. It cost me a lot (health, it became a large factor in losing a good relationship). I couldn&#x27;t see the forest from the trees. I couldn&#x27;t say no to the sleazy sales manager who would ignore me all week only to become my best friend for a 60 second conversation every Thursday: &quot;Maaaate! Can you work Saturday?&quot;<p>The wounds were very expensive but after some time to heal became something to laugh at, lightly. When someone in a room full of developers at 9 PM snaps and says, &quot;This is the worst project I&#x27;ve ever been on!&quot; half the room will immediately agree, only for the the other half to grin politely and disagree. &quot;Really?!&quot; At best sharing these stories can be a bonding exercise. Some of the anecdotes are now quite funny jokes.<p>Then a decade past my worst ever project and it was happening all over again! Only this time I was cognisant of the machinations around me. While being older might mean more capable, it also means we can&#x27;t do the same long hours any more. The absolute worst thing was I saw it coming. I gave my manager (who had all the authority) unambiguous advice to avoid this project. After it went bad they needed me. I said no, but then they weren&#x27;t asking and suddenly I was involved. Deeply. Drinking after work was no longer 2 beers on a Friday, but 2-4 every day at our desks (but after 8 PM when the place was mostly abandoned). Other negatives I was putting up with for the $$$ also broke the threshold (mostly the insane daily travel, but the place was generally a crap client site all round).<p>I&#x27;d work hard to the deadline then be done with it. January became February, March, then April. I was burnt out. I quit before it was done and became the bad guy. I didn&#x27;t care. I never wanted to see any of these clowns ever again.<p>I went overseas for a year without working. Didn&#x27;t work for another year after returning, and very casually waited for the right, quite different, role to come through my jokingly tiny social network.')
