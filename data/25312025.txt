The fabric is made on traditional looms, sometimes the actual looms from 1950s and earlier (those are mostly wooden contraptions, which can be repaired and kept in working order indefinitely) and can be incredibly dense to the point when you can actually make new jeans stand on their own (only possible because jeans are starched during production, you are supposed to soak them before wearing). But even light-weight 10-12 oz selvedge denim is still on a different level from a department store jeans.<p>The problem with the most department store jeans, no matter the price, is that they use fabric made on high-speed wide looms. These looms use light and smooth thread so they can weave fast. The fabric comes out very light (because of the thin thread) and does not hold together quite well (because the fabric is held together by friction, reduced by the smoothness of the thread).<p>Of course, it makes no sense to buy expensive jeans for durability. $400 24oz jeans probably will last for 20-30 years but so will 10 pairs of $40 jeans from Target.')
