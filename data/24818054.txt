These tools are literally installed on every posix machine on the planet. The whole point here is that there are no dependencies this is the “system.” It’s like trying to explain how an engine works by only looking at the turbo, “Oh yeah, gotta have a turbo or your car won’t drive.” ... You mean I gotta have an engine or I can’t even use a turbo?<p>The whole point of my post is that running a container otecshstration system to accomplish any of this, for someone new, is insane. It is absolutely 100% only adding complexity and making things more confusing. How many people will not realize these utilities are on every computer they use? How long until someone poisons these repacked uselessly opaque versions? This makes things easier for no one and only furthers to complicate things by adding unnecessary complexity.<p>If someone is on a Mac, then they are now running a Linux VM, then running containers, then logging into said fucked up environment and then finallly... running... awk?<p>macOS -&gt; Linux -&gt; Container Runtime -&gt; SSH-&gt; finally use awk, sed, head, or anything else. Why stop there? We can probably then start up Qemu from a container, boot MacOS, and then simply repeat the process for maximum usefulness.')
