They are on the top of the food chain in NK. If they went to war they would lose instantly. Better to just sabrerattle and get some benefits rather than start a war for no reason. There is no ideology or religion behind NK unlike groups like ISIS. If Kim Jong Un tried to push for a war, he would be deposed in a second and replaced by someone who “gets it”.')
