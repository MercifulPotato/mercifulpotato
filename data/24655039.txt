Again, no clue why you keep bringing this up.<p>Racist speech and thought is often followed through with racist action, and this can be overt, but much of it is subversive throughout a society&#x2F;culture, especially one that openly tolerates racist expression.<p>Ignoring racism also doesn&#x27;t do anything positive, and in some cases encourages it. There&#x27;s also a view point that people speaking up about racism is &quot;cancel culture&quot;, and there are people who want to cancel that &quot;cancel culture&quot;. Sorry, but at some point there has to be some nuance and middle ground of tolerable&#x2F;intolerable and this is always going to be fuzzy, especially in a dynamic environment of social media.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really sound like you have a solution, other than &quot;ignore it&quot; or continuing the status quo, which includes &quot;cancel culture&quot;. You cannot prevent someone from saying racist crap on twitter, but then you also can&#x27;t ban the blow back that person gets. If nothing should be done, then you accept that social media has its positives and negatives, and allow the adults to be responsible for what they say and be willing to accept the blow back for any heinous crap spouted out on it, just like Dick Costolo will have to face, which you bringing it up seems to kinda be an attempt at cancel culture.')
