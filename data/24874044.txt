For example, many people are stumped why you can&#x27;t await inside of Array#map. I&#x27;ve always felt it&#x27;s a leaky abstraction and I personally prefer to just use promises most of the time. I do find async&#x2F;await a great fit for say puppeteer tests where the entire test is a long run of blocking async calls.')
