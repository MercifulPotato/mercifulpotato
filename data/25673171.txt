But I think you want...need... a winner.  The radio station and the advertiser want a picture in the newspaper with someone holding a $30,000 cheque, you want that person screaming on the radio when they win.  You want interviews with that person talking about how they will spend their winnings.  A contest without a winner would be a terrible thing for everyone involved, well I guess for the ad agency putting in $30,000, maybe they get their money back?<p>This all reminds me of the lengths I went to a few years ago.  An admin assistant in my office was really into these contests.  She would listen to all the various stations and call in.  There was a contest that was &quot;identify this song&quot; and everyday it went unguessed, they would add to the pot.  It was getting up to $20,000 or something and no one could guess.  I ended up downloading the clip and putting it through various Shazam like programs trying to help identify it.  Never did win, but it was exciting for a short time.  If after 30 days, they had just said, no one wins, I would have been pretty erked.')
