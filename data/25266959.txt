Item(by='isbjorn16', descendants=None, kids=[25268023], score=None, time=1606841791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261288, text='I don&#x27;t know that I agree that you&#x27;re doing an apples to apples comparison though.  There&#x27;s nothing to stop you from doing:<p><pre><code>  let x = doRiskyThing();\n  match x {\n    Ok(x) =&gt; x.doThing(),\n    Err(e) =&gt; ...\n  }\n  x.get().doThing();\n</code></pre>\nThat would be more comparable to the try catch from above, and a comparable try catch that actually is semantically approximate would be:<p><pre><code>  try {\n    MyType x = doRiskyThing();\n    x.doThing();\n  } catch(CheckedException e) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nPutting these two together, it makes the Result type seem worse than a try catch, right?  But that isn&#x27;t fair to result, because I&#x27;m using it like a jackass.<p>In other words, you can be a jackass using either of them, but you can also use them correctly, and when you use them correctly I don&#x27;t see how they&#x27;re any different.  I also don&#x27;t feel like the likelihood of using a Result correctly (edit: originally this said _incorrectly_) is substantially higher than a try&#x2F;catch, but it probably boils down to developer experience and comfort with a particular varietal and not the capabilities inherent in either.  Probably.  And if not, I&#x27;m looking forward to being shown why! :)')
