We&#x27;ve known for weeks that it was likely for several states to flip like this because these states were not allowed to count the mail-in ballots as they came in. In the states where it was allowed to count votes early, the vote tally was released last night, in similar speed to his example of Brazil.<p>What&#x27;s really dangerous is that the same people who said that mail-in votes couldn&#x27;t be counted early in states like PA are now saying they shouldn&#x27;t be counted after election day. It&#x27;s disenfranchisement, plain and simple.')
