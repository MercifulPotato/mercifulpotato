They were married before I was born and are still married now. That didn&#x27;t and doesn&#x27;t stop the abuse, the mistreatment, the violent rages, the substance abuse, the mental illness, or the cruelty. I wished every day State authorities would come take us away because the alternative couldn&#x27;t possibly be worse than this. They never came and I never had the courage to tell anyone. I just had to suffer.<p>The system failed me badly, but it would have failed me worse if the authorities did come and said &quot;well your parents are married and you have food to eat and a bed to sleep in. Looks good.&quot;')
