So my initial response was, &quot;why on earth would you need a whole OS for that&quot;, but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I&#x27;m really unclear about; I can&#x27;t tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I&#x27;m surprised that it&#x27;s not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I&#x27;m pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).<p>Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:)')
