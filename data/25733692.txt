That weak sauce isn&#x27;t going to go far in court.<p>P4 is speculation on Amazon&#x27;s motives. Parler would need some good evidence to show this claim is true.<p>P5 seems the strongest. If their contract really says 30-days notice (given the disingenuous p3, I wouldn&#x27;t assume that), Amazon could be forced to replatform them for a while and have some damages.')
