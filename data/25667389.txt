It&#x27;s not a good look to market Nano by trying to scare people into believing something like a 51% attack <i>could</i> happen tomorrow, when it&#x27;s extremely unlikely to happen. Nano should be able to stand on its own without these scare tactics.<p>You&#x27;re assuming a double-spend attack on a block mined by Chinese miners would destroy Bitcoin when everyone knows such an attach is a theoretical possibility. As mentioned in the article I posted and you conveniently didn&#x27;t respond to, there are many safeguards that would alert other miners.<p>Bitcoin is about to pass $700 billion market cap—that&#x27;s a lot of incentive to stop bitcoin from being destroyed. Even China knows it&#x27;s better for them to have a non-sovereign store of value that&#x27;s not the dollar.<p>It would be pretty easy for the rest of bitcoin to see that the block is not legitimate and ignore it. Don&#x27;t believe me? Bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos said the same thing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM</a>.<p>It would take a lot of coercing to convince these miners to destroy their lucrative businesses for what would essentially be a one-time stunt that only effected a block these particular miners cared about. I suspect many of them would choose to shutdown their mining rather than destroy their businesses… and since it&#x27;s not possible to do the attack without all of them onboard, it wouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>Now that billionaires are all-in on bitcoin, it&#x27;ll become in everyone&#x27;s best interest to increase mining in the United States by partnering will the oil and gas industry, which has already started.<p>&quot;Oil Companies Will Dominate BTC Mining in Five Years: Marty Bent&quot;—<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;oil-companies-will-dominate-btc-mining-in-five-years-marty-bent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;oil-companies-will-dominate-b...</a>')
