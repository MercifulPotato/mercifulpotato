Item(by='thewebcount', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608251906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461102, text='&gt; Target has some really confusing triple selection that is really off putting (choosing between In Store, Same Day, and Shipping).<p>Oh man, this is so aggravating. They can tell me that something is in-store by me and I can pick it up in 1 hour. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not able to go to the store. But &quot;delivery&quot; means someone else will go to the store for me and drop it off at my house for an extra $10. OK, fine, let&#x27;s do that. But some items, even ones that it says are in-stock at the store nearest me, can only be shipped from across the country, or picked up in-person at the store. WTF? If I can pick it up myself, why can&#x27;t my delivery person also pick it up for me?')
