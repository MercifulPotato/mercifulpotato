Being able to just start Jupyter, start coding some small experiment and not worry about imports would be useful. Further, it would help my colleagues in data science who require a step by step walkthrough whenever we need to generate requirements.txt.<p>In my personal case, I have loads of dead code directories for various half-remembered Python ideas. It&#x27;d be convenient to have a lighter-weight &quot;experiments&quot; dir using something like this.')
