First one need to borrow the stock, which may be difficult for some stocks. This creates a concrete imbalance between long and short holders and a limit for how much can be sold short. But that&#x27;s not the whole problem, every short stock needs to be covered by some margin. If the stock goes up too much, the short seller needs to buy it back no matter water, for lack of margin. In other words, it is NOT just the buyers who are forcing the price up, but the short sellers who are forced to cover their shorts. That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t matter that the price is insane, it will go up as long as the shorts are forced to buy back the stock at those ridiculous prices.')
