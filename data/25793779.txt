But if you&#x27;re already requiring a single client that it makes it <i>easier</i> to do decentralized messaging for exactly the same reason.<p>Another option that works pretty well is to do both. So try decentralized (DHT &#x2F; direct connection) first and fallback to a central server if that doesn&#x27;t work. Then you&#x27;re up as long as either one of them is working. And there is a lot less load on your central servers.')
