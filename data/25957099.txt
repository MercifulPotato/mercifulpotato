Some of those forces include competition, unionisation, labour mobility, fiduciary duty to shareholders, and the existence of boards of directors.<p>The view that a company&#x27;s sole duty is to provide value to shareholders (i.e. to grow) is blinkered and damaging. I&#x27;m tempted to heap blame for that way of thinking on the economics establishment and on anti-comunist sentiment from the 20th century but that&#x27;s probably naive.')
