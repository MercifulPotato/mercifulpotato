I regret smoking so much in my youth. I also regret drinking so much, and eating so much pizza and chocolate, and spending all day surfing (the web, sadly, not the waves). I was doing all those things before I became old enough to buy cannabis (although cannabis did exaggerate them somewhat).<p>It does seem like the cannabis had a negative effect on my memory and emotional stability (I was high basically the entire day for several years while my brain was still developing). And many of my worst paranoid delusions ever have been on uncomfortably high doses of cannabis. But so have some of the most beautiful and dare I say spiritual experiences of my life, and I wouldn&#x27;t take those back.<p>I do wish I&#x27;d waited until I was older though, and in a better place emotionally (I was using it as a painkiller, if you will.)<p>All things considered though, I&#x27;m a much bigger fan of psilocybin and LSD. Rather than worsening my addictions they made me quit a lot of unhealthy things I was doing. I also found microdosing to be very beneficial.<p>For comparison, you can conduct a business meeting on a small dose of LSD and find that it actually helps you pay attention and think clearly, while even small doses of cannabis will interfere with something as trivial as a trip to the corner store.')
