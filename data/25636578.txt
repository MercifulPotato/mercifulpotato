Item(by='drtillberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609788406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25633828, text='I read the earlier comment as making aggressive, common-sense inteferences from &#x27;facts&#x27; sprinkled through the original posting-- FB ended direct engagement with shared.com a long time ago, the shared.com ads were placed through 3d party contractors (maybe this is less exceptional than it sounds) and the OP says the reason he&#x27;s sure FB was ok with the whole thing was shared.com&#x27;s transparency about its business model ... which sounds like an admission it&#x27;s low quality, that FB initiated communications about quality in the past, and that the OP was aware the shared.com content had implications for FB business standards.  Those might be incorrect inferences, but they seem fair from the OP&#x27;s marketing release.<p>An alternate hypothesis is that most of the spend referenced by OP is ancient and relevant only for old-time sake.  Again. OP didn&#x27;t say that exactly, but it&#x27;s a fair thing to question based on how the OP wrote the posting and selected the relevant time period.')
