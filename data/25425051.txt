No. Does it drain me some days or in particular instances? Certainly! Are some people far less resilient than I, and are perhaps drained to a larger degree? It stands to reason so.<p>To be clear I&#x27;m not saying any one advertiser is directly attempting to demean any particular person into buying their particular product, because clearly this isn&#x27;t a winning strategy. It&#x27;s the dose that makes the poison, however.<p>If one person walks up to me on the street and says &quot;I&#x27;ve got some shirts that would make you look really slim&quot; I would shrug it off as a weird happening. When the second person say &quot;I used to look large, but this brand really made the pounds seem less obvious&quot;, I think it&#x27;s been an odd day. When this continues to happen over the course of the month, perhaps I begin to think I&#x27;m looking a bit large around the middle.<p>Taken in isolation, no one instance is going to break me. Taken together, over a lifetime? That could change my own perception of myself in ways I can&#x27;t even begin to estimate.')
