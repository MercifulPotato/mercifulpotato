They amplify biases and stupidity of any given group of people, and make biases and stupidity seem like the &quot;norm&quot; within the bubble, so not only it is imperceptible, it&#x27;s also socially damaging to speak up against it with those still in the bubble. So instead of tamping down stupidity by exposing you to negative feedback (usually stupidity of the opposite polarity), you&#x27;re only getting in-group positive feedback, so the system becomes unstable (EE&#x27;s here will understand what I&#x27;m talking about).<p>We have to deal with this somehow, because this is not going to end well.')
