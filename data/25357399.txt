I am not sure I see a lot of reason to eat it except to support the movement (“create demand”, “vote with my wallet”) and maybe to occasionally blend-in with non-vegans (“Look, I can do the same thing as you without most of the associated problems”). But the latter does not seem that attractive or important to me, to be honest. Now “nutritional” reasons can be: 1) protein, 2) vitamins&#x2F;minerals. 1st is quite ridiculous. Many plants and vegan foods have so much protein! Even broccoli or green peas. And I am not even starting about tofu, tempeh, etc. So vitamins&#x2F;minerals is actually a more relevant concern. Now I am not sure if the lab-grown meat is going to have as much of those as farm-grown one. Or still the multi-vitamin pill is a better (and cheaper and more convenient) option?')
