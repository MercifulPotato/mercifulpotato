Despite it being difficult, I think voter fraud is still very hard to do on a systemic scale that would swing an election.<p>Prior studies have only shown minor instances of voter fraud, I think something like 1000 documented instances of voter fraud amount 10s of millions of votes cast. With all the available information I have, I think it would be very difficult to fradulently product ballots on the order of 10s of thousands to actually swing an election.<p>Secondly, I think if we did have a widespread voter fraud problem I think it would also call into question past elections as well.')
