So it was just the same group they already had. The less the site actually explained and gave to the user the more successful it was. Pure local hype.<p>On the other hand it was just used to generate more twitter&#x2F;facebook traffic about how that pre-lauch was successful, but nothing ever launched. It was always just a tool to generate noise and traffic on other media.<p>For instance [beware, biased personal experience]: a friend announced a mysterious site&#x2F;service on topics he already was loud about on social media - personal trainer in IT area. Got 50 000 signups for a newsletter in a few days, actual organic traffic - this I&#x27;m certain about. Never launched anything new. He just took that site down when everyone forgot and started consulting more openly. The only new &quot;product&quot; was a newsletter that was sent for a year or so with the same content he already published regularly on twitter. Now he earns money on teaching others to get similar good PR (and other less soft IT stuff). Apparently this is called &quot;building community&quot;. Mostly IT people, btw..<p>I&#x27;m sure he achieved some goals and is successful personally, but if you are able to mobilize 50 000 people to get their emails spammed and none of them complains when you don&#x27;t create ANYTHING new it does rise questions. What is your significant community worth, if they don&#x27;t care at all? Is there anything you actually deliver when you are hired?')
