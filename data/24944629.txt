I think it was what allowed him to come up with his novel algorithms. Have we lost something of the real essence of logical thinking here? Perhaps the paper mentioned in the article; <i>Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs</i> which he was vehemently against, will give me the other side of the argument.')
