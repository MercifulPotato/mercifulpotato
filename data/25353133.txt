SoC manufacturers don&#x27;t want to open source their drivers, they prefer to ship blobs and they prefer not to support those blobs for a future kernel updates. Those facts means that you can&#x27;t upgrade your kernel. When you can&#x27;t upgrade your kernel, you can&#x27;t upgrade your userspace which depends on new kernel features. So basically your software is stuck and eventually obsolete.<p>There are two ways out of this situation. You can either replace Linux with another kernel with stable driver API or you can replace SoC manufacturers with those willing to upstream their drivers. Probably it&#x27;s easier to go to the first route.')
