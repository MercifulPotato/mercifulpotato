That trust is <i>frequently</i> unearned or betrayed in the modern era, but it remains nonetheless.<p>I don&#x27;t have a great definitive answer on why that&#x27;s the case, but I do have suspicions. One is around the (perceived?) strength of our democracy, driven by mandatory voting and a well designed parliamentary system. Also, we don&#x27;t have the American history of revolution - distrust for government just is not part of the thinking.<p>The other is that, for the most part of the last 50 years, our more public institutions <i>have</i> done a good job. The ABC (think the BBC, but Australian) is a trusted news source, Medicare largely &quot;just works&quot; for most people, our public&#x2F;private education system mostly works, etc.<p>When it comes to law enforcement, I think the general <i>perception</i> is that while they&#x27;re far from perfect, they tend to be well governed and as a result given a generous amount of power.<p>Again, whether this perception is justified or not is a different thing, especially if you&#x27;re not of Anglo descent.')
