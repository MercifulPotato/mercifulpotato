If they&#x27;re too busy to respond then they&#x27;ve forfeited any right to criticize, complain or block the proposal later on. If they provide feedback that I don&#x27;t implement then I need to have good reasons why I&#x27;m not and share that with them.<p>The &#x27;understand&#x27; group tends to be upper mgmt who trust me and, so long as I&#x27;ve gotten everyone in the &#x27;agree&#x27; group onboard, will support the decision&#x2F;proposal. This is typically done in a regular &#x27;check in&#x27; or via email.')
