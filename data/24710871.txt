When youâ€™re younger you can keep going nonstop, but even while young it can hit you every few months like it hit me.<p>My first thought for Saturdays with nothing to do is to build a casual social network that will compound over time and pay off in spades. Once people hit their 30s and 40s and their network is now in management positions, it can have huge benefits for your career or entrepreneurial endeavors.<p>So one idea is on your open Saturdays, yes spend half the day working out or swimming, but then take it easy the 2nd half, go spend 6 hours at the local beer garden with friends (or make friends), and build from there.')
