It&#x27;s small, the battery lasts for at least 5 hours, completely silent, and, while it certainly isn&#x27;t as fast as my Mac or the Dell (or the Xeon under my desk), it&#x27;s fast enough for my tests to run while I think about the next steps. And it did cost me about $200. It&#x27;s an expendable computer.<p>I assume a Pinebook Pro is a much nicer experience.')
