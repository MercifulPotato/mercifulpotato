As some sibling commenters say, there might be more to it. Either genetic, through selection, or chemical, through whatever they put in the soil for it to grow bigger &#x2F; quicker.<p>The issue I have with most store-bought produce is that it has practically no taste whatsoever. It tastes like water. Tomatoes taste like water. Peppers taste like water. I&#x27;ve never had store-bought berries (of any kind) taste anything.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that when you pick an unripe tomato, or cherry, or grape, or whatever, they actually have a taste. Not a very good taste, I wouldn&#x27;t like eating unripe cherries.<p>However, the same things from a supermarket have practically <i>no</i> taste. \nI&#x27;ve never had produce picked from my mother or grandparents&#x27; garden taste like water. If they&#x27;re unripe, they&#x27;ll taste bitter, sour, <i>something</i>. They will absolutely have some kind of actual taste.')
