I also think there should be a distinction between things leaked by a whistleblower and things leaked by a thief or a patsy.  However, since whistleblowers are often putting themselves at significant risk, we end up relying on the integrity of the journalists &#x2F; publications in terms of taking their word for the legitimacy of the source.<p>So yeah.  A publication that makes a significant effort to vet their source and the story deserves the benefit of the doubt while a publication that acts as a click-bait tabloid without any kind of investigative effort doesn&#x27;t.<p>That said, I think Twitter is grasping a bit and trying to use a policy that&#x27;s right or wrong when the reality is more subjective.<p>The other thing I don&#x27;t understand is how revisiting section 230 of the DMCA and turning Twitter into a publisher is going to improve things.  If the current publishers don&#x27;t suffer any repercussions for anything, how will it be different if Twitter is considered the publisher?  They&#x27;re looking for a whipping boy IMO.')
