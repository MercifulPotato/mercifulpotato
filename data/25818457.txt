A surgeon friend got her first dose and said she was planning to delay the second one for a while so that more first doses could go out to others, and that it would be just as effective for her if she got it later. She&#x27;s also relatively young (under 40), so she isn&#x27;t as concerned as some people might be.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t know how she can be that confident that timing of the second dose doesn&#x27;t matter, since this doesn&#x27;t seem to have been tested with COVID vaccines. Perhaps it is a feature of vaccines in general?')
