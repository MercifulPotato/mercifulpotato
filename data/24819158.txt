There&#x27;s no way the Republican party would ever win a fair, easy-to-vote, EU-style, election.<p>&gt; Americans donâ€™t have the same sense of solidarity Europeans have, and are much more individualistic.<p>But universal healthcare has been popular in polls throughout the population for a long time, even though I assume that in a class based society like the US it must feel regressive, as upper middle-class and up, to be threatened by having to wait in the same queue as the poor for healthcare.')
