There are some resemblances between OS&#x2F;2 1.x and Windows 3.x APIs, because many of those APIs were actually designed by the same Microsoft employees – for example, most OS&#x2F;2 API calls starting with Win* have a similarly named Windows 3.x API call, just without the Win* prefix. (Despite similarities like that, the APIs are incompatible; they probably would have been more compatible if it were not for IBM&#x27;s influence – for example, OS&#x2F;2 and Windows use different coordinate systems in their graphics API, because IBM insisted OS&#x2F;2 had to use the same coordinate system as IBM&#x27;s mainframe graphics software, GDDM.)<p>Microsoft and IBM have cross-licensing agreements allowing use of OS&#x2F;2 code in Windows and vice versa. Microsoft used this to include OS&#x2F;2 compatibility components in old versions of Windows NT (newer versions have removed it); likewise, IBM used it to include a copy of Windows 3.x in OS&#x2F;2 to enable running Windows 3.x applications. (The agreement did not include newer software they developed after their breakup, so IBM wasn&#x27;t allowed to use the Windows 95 or Windows NT code in OS&#x2F;2, nor was Microsoft allowed to use OS&#x2F;2 2.x and higher code in Windows.)<p>So, the odds of IBM trying to sue Microsoft over OS&#x2F;2 APIs in Windows is zero. It would be precluded by the licensing agreement between them.')
