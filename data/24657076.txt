And even if optimistically a popular device will not drop support until it&#x27;s too old, the blob is still not updated and the linux kernel is not usually mainlined. Many exploit on that. And let&#x27;s not talk about the blobs are not open source. That&#x27;s why there is a demand on Linux phone which the kernel is mainlined and up-to-date.<p>Again, ignore the fact that iPhone is closed source, it does provide a infinite software update until it&#x27;s broken, which is better service than most Android phone, even if considering installing ROM.')
