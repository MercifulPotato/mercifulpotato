If the end stage of that chick is an adult that costs more to feed than it&#x27;s worth, causes a price increase to consumers, and it still ends up killed and processed in some way, why not just humanely kill it instantly?  Industrial grinding is gross but not particularly cruel in practice.  It&#x27;s fast and effective and doesn&#x27;t cause undue stress before killing the animal.')
