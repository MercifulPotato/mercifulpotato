There are hundreds of things that could go wrong on Tesla&#x27;s path to converting the world to Autonomous EV transportation. No one knows which if any of those things will go wrong over the next 5-10 years. I&#x27;m not a day trader, so for me, saying that Tesla is overvalued today is like saying that people who buy flood insurance are stupid because there is no rain the 10 day forecast.<p>If TSLA was $100k&#x2F;share today then yes it would be overvalued. Just like if someone was paying $100k&#x2F;month for flood insurance on a 200k house in the desert that would be stupid.<p>For my analysis Tesla has a decent chance at building a 25k profitable EV and 5-6 other models at scale and succeeding in Autonomy within 5 years. So I&#x27;m comfortable buying today at anything below $1200.')
