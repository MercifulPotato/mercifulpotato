Be it Homejoy, uBiome, or many others. They seem to employ aggresive marketing tactics. They work under assumption that &quot;law does not apply to us&quot;. Although this is true for ultra rich people, why regular seed funded do it? Is growth focus this much necessary to the to do outright fraud or in engage in shady tactics? They are willing to kill other people&#x27;s business and livelihood for their growth. I would call this &quot;preying tactics&quot;<p>Paul is very successful person and I read about him a lot. Why companies going through YC do this? Or is this just Business-as-usual (BAU) in Americas? Kill or be killed?<p>Thanks for responding!')
