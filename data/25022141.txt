He didn&#x27;t fund historically black colleges.  He didn&#x27;t pass a crime reform bill. He didn&#x27;t denounce white supremacy. He just lied about these things and you believe him.<p>Where are these opportunity zones? Where are these educational opportunities, where was the crime reform, a fantasy. You are taking a known lier at face value. Why? I can just easily dismiss anything you say because Trump accomplished nothing all empty words.')
