Item(by='noneeeed', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608291950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459434, text='Amazon appears to be determined to make itself an untrustworthy place to buy stuff. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s actively trying to get itself lumped in with eBay as a &quot;tat-bazaa&quot; as The Register likes to call it.<p>I&#x27;ve become increasingly wary of buying things on Amazon for this very reason. I recently bought several pieces of electrical&#x2F;elecronic gear, and didn&#x27;t buy either from Amazon. I don&#x27;t trust that the named brand stuff will be genuine, and I don&#x27;t trust that the unknown-brand stuff will be any good, irrespective of the reviews. I&#x27;ve had too many cards with my orders promising freebies for positive reviews to trust anything I read there now.<p>I now pretty much only buy low-risk stuff on amazon.')
