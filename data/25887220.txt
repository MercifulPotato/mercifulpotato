Here&#x27;s why:<p>1. Socializing is the primary activity that happens at work for the vast majority of workers. The gal or guy coming by your desk to &quot;check in&quot; or &quot;see how your weekend was&quot; etc... is literally where they find their social outlets and personal connections.<p>2. Managers like to be able to watch their direct reports because it makes them feel more in control than they are<p>3. The commuting routine, even if it&#x27;s a nightmare, offers a sense of normalcy that most people have gotten used to and in a weird way rely on for grounding.<p>4. For a huge swath of Americans at least, work is an escape from the drudgery of the home.<p>To truly work from home 100% of the time you have to be a master at controlling yourself and your ability to be distracted. Most people don&#x27;t have this control and need a framework to insert themselves into. Add to that the contextual dimension of an &quot;other&quot; place that is a world apart from your home life and you have something that allows for a depressurization for most people.')
