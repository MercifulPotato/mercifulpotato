But now I have all the right gear and it feels very comfortable and natural. It&#x27;s interesting. Also when Spring arrive I really get to enjoy it, the connection to the nature around is strong.<p>The only issue is finding the right gloves for typing on the computer, I haven&#x27;t found any good ones yet.<p>Oh and in the morning I have to remember to quickly warm up my macbook pro otherwise the cold make it shut down. If it wasn&#x27;t the work laptop I would use something else, the metal case is not pleasant when it&#x27;s really cold.')
