You still need to copy data from the CPU&#x27;s segment to the GPU&#x27;s segment. While that might be faster than copying over PCIe it&#x27;s still a copy operation. With the M1&#x27;s GPU there&#x27;s no segmentation so no copying.<p>That&#x27;s how I understand it works but I might be completely wrong.')
