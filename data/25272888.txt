It&#x27;s a great app. I&#x27;m saying orgs that are not currently using slack will not want to pay to switch when they&#x27;ve got a free IM app that works fine. For slack to be worth this valuation they need about 10x as much revenue. I don&#x27;t see how they could possibly accomplish that when everyone has already picked an app at this point.')
