You don&#x27;t have a choice except to drive home from work.</i><p>And will it be easier to make those ends meet when you are dead, or paralysed, or locked up because you left someone else dead or paralysed?<p>The arguments that a few people are making here, as if not driving while so tired you might fall asleep would cause some devastating loss to society and herald the end of life as we know it, are just silly. Only a very small number of drivers would be affected, because fortunately most people aren&#x27;t so irresponsible in the first place. And given the extremely high likelihood of those few drivers getting themselves and, worse, possibly many other people injured or dead, with all the negative consequences that will imply, it still doesn&#x27;t make sense from a greater good perspective.')
