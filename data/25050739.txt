An application implements a GUI, including support for the platform accessibility API (hopefully with the help of the GUI framework), and it&#x27;s up to a separate assistive technology, such as Narrator (for screen reading) or Dragon NaturallySpeaking (for speech input), to use that generic accessibility support to adapt the UI for a specific need.<p>So if any assistive technologies are using .NET Framework, they might have a bit of difficulty converting to .NET Core. But that&#x27;s a small number of applications, and in my experience, most Windows ATs use native code anyway. And using SAPI via COM interop isn&#x27;t hard; you don&#x27;t have to get down and dirty with P&#x2F;Invoke or anything similarly low-level.')
