It&#x27;s probably the most reliable part of a Linux machine. Sure, getting the right graphics drivers can be a pain on Linux. Then again, I can say the same about the process on Windows too. And as far as gaming goes, I can play 85% of my Steam Library right out of the box with default settings. Steam has it&#x27;s own Winetricks built in. And default Winetricks has come a long way too. There really isn&#x27;t any Windows program I can&#x27;t get running with 30 minutes of tinkering.<p>As far as linux being niche and for techie people, you&#x27;re somwhat right but it&#x27;s still a frustrating misconception that an average Joe couldn&#x27;t figure out Linux. I mean, modern Ubuntu is no more complicated to use than Windows 98 was. I just plugged in a Canon printer&#x2F;scanner into my Lubuntu desktop tonight and fired up included SimpleScan and did some scanning. I didn&#x27;t need to open a terminal. It all just... worked. Most of the casual things I do just work. It&#x27;s me messing with stuff that makes things go haywire. But I&#x27;m one of those techie people and that&#x27;s what I enjoy doing.<p>Don&#x27;t think of Linux like a geeky alternative to mainstream. Think of it as the mainstream that Windows is trying to improve upon. In all reality, it is. Linux is to computers what the manual transmission (stick shift) is to automobiles. It takes some getting used too, but it&#x27;s easier than it looks. And if you can drive a stick, you can drive literally any vehicle with wheels. Same with linux. If you can use a linux PC you posses the knowledge use any PC.')
