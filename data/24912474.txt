While I don&#x27;t have the &quot;Puck&quot; style charger, I do have a 29w USB-C charger I&#x27;ve used for fast charging my iPad for some time.<p>While I agree with this guys article on a large part, I suspect the amount of extra waste here is over-stated. There will be fair number of people (like me) who saw the USB-C writing on the wall years ago. There are also a fair number of people who will just use the same cable they use on their current phone.<p>I do think they should have either shipped a USB-A cable in the box since it&#x27;s still the norm. Or at better, they should have switched to a USB-C brick a couple years ago then people would have them around.')
