Item(by='phaedrus', descendants=None, kids=[25359509], score=None, time=1607527026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359080, text='I could be projecting, but it sounds like your team member has ADHD.<p>My work set up an automated system that emails people between 9-10am if they forgot to log their time the day before.  You get dinged if and only if it gets to the second reminder at 11.  As someone with ADHD I only distinguish two times: now and not now.  Having a reminder that means &quot;do it now&quot; took me overnight from terrible timesheet compliance to near perfect.<p>It&#x27;s not an automated reminder that happens every day at that time like an alarm clock.  That would get tuned out &#x2F; filtered out very quickly.  The key is it&#x27;s a novel message that I only see if I screwed up by forgetting the day before.<p>And it&#x27;s easy to forget because the ADHD brain is like a CPU with only one register, and the register spill circuit for service interrupt &#x2F; return from interrupt is faulty.  In order to impersonate a functioning human being I tie certain things I need to do each day (like filling out my timesheet) to certain other events during the day.  But if the routine gets broken or I get interrupted in the midst of doing the thing - the mind state that held what I was supposed to be doing is just <i>gone</i>.')
