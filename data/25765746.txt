And everybody was always &quot;The RPi3 is cheaper&quot;.<p>The conversations always went like this:<p>&quot;Cheaper? So, did you count the SD card you need for the RPi?&quot;<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s cheaper.&quot;<p>&quot;And the special power supply because the RPi power systems suck?&quot;<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s cheaper.&quot;<p>&quot;And the keyboard and monitor because it doesn&#x27;t run headless over USB?&quot;<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s cheaper.&quot;<p>&quot;... Okay, boss, it&#x27;s cheaper.  Go have fun.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s before we even start talking about the lousy documentation of the RPi CPU chips.  And the fact that the Ethernet was installed over the USB.  etc.<p>But the RPi was cheaper.  Shrug.  The guys at TI learned their lesson.
