I failed to argue the point about responsibility correctly.<p>If you ever take time to read the &quot;community guidelines&quot; that facebook have, you&#x27;ll see that they are actually really good. I would quite like to live in an environment where they are applied ubiquitously, equally and quickly.<p>Which leads me on to your point about responsibility. Facebook has a set of rules, but is not willing to apply them (in the case of celebs and politicians) or unable to in the case of individuals. For individuals I have sympathy, thats a hard problem to crack. For politicians, there is no excuse.')
