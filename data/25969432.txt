It&#x27;s a rare environment where naming a fallacy actually contributes positively to the epistemic atmosphere. It&#x27;s rather analogous to giving someone access to an easy-to-use extremely-high-power energy source, with a small warning label saying &quot;caution: danger of death&quot;, and a wide array of cables and electrical components, and saying &quot;go forth&quot;. If you know what you&#x27;re doing, these components are useful and will allow you to construct safe things. If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, you kill yourself with them.')
