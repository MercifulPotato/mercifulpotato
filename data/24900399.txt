Now imagine two different scenarios:<p>Scenario A: Each one of these cameras is operated by a local business or property management company. The cameras record video that gets overwritten within a few days if there are no incidents or requests from law enforcement.<p>Scenario B: All of these cameras are on a network operated by a company with contracts for the city, law enforcement, and digital advertising networks. Facial recognition technology tracks you across all 50 locations, with an &quot;anonymized&quot; identifier attached to your biometrics. This identifier can be cross-referenced with other &quot;anonymized&quot; identifiers to build an advertising profile, while another contractor&#x27;s machine learning system builds a threat profile based on movements of these identifiers, flagging outliers for human review.<p>Both scenarios have the same number of cameras, but I don&#x27;t think many would consider the two comparable.')
