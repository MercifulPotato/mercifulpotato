If the media had ignored Y2K, I have no doubt that it would have been much worse as many companies, probably on the smaller end, weren&#x27;t aware random bits of software was susceptible, weren&#x27;t updated from vendors (who probably had little contact after the sale) about possible problems and updates, etc.<p>Sure, maybe IBM and Microsoft and the banks and Airlines would all be fine, but if a lot of small to mid-size accountancy firms all of a sudden couldn&#x27;t process payroll for companies or deal with day-to-day needs of their clients, that could very quickly have gotten really had and had knock-on effects, and that&#x27;s one industry.<p>The best case scenario for COVID-19 would have been everyone heeding the media and staying in for a few weeks early on and it petering out.  Everyone would have said it was just a media fed panic then, but obviously, it&#x27;s a bit more complicated in that case, because that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> happen (or at least didn&#x27;t happen enough for that outcome).')
