They implemented a 350:1 reverse share split, which in theory should have resulted in them having a stock price of $35, 1.1 million shares, and a market cap of around $35 million.<p>For some reason, it took longer for this to shake out than expected; in the immediate aftermath it was reported that enormous quantities of Global Links stock was still trading, and the share price had actually declined to a 8 cents.<p>Presumably, some systems were reporting &quot;old&quot; numbers (pre reverse split) and some &quot;new&quot; numbers (post reverse split), and I&#x27;m sure an enormous amount of confusion resulted. And it was at this point Simpson reckons he bought 1.2 million shares for a bit over $5,000.<p>That&#x27;s less than 1&#x2F;3 of a cent per share, which seems wildly off (the share price was 10 cents pre reverse split, and would have been expected to be $35 afterwards), but given that it seems a lot of computer systems were not handling this correctly, who knows what he was told by his broker?<p>So...obviously Simpson did not purchase 110% of a company, and he definitely didn&#x27;t do so for 0.01% of its market cap. I rather assume his broker had <i>told</i> him that he had done so, but that seems like fodder for a lawsuit between him and his broker over their buggy systems, but it doesn&#x27;t tell us much else. It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> he might have ended up owning 3.6k shares (about 1&#x2F;3 of a percent of the company), but even that seems doubtful if it actually only cost him $5k.<p>Anyhow:<p>&gt; I think the more interesting part of the story (if I&#x27;m reading it right) is he paid $5000 to completely own a company with millions in assets.<p>I think the better reading of that is some guy found a bug in a broker&#x27;s system that caused it to <i>tell</i> him he&#x27;d done that, but it would have been obvious to all concerned that whether he&#x27;d ended up with 0 shares, ~140 shares, or ~3.5k shares, he definitely didn&#x27;t have 1.2m shares, since they never even existed.')
