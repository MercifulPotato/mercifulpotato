Item(by='watermelon59', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1603671964, title='Ask HN: What is a good source to master Gradle?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Gradle seems to be much more popular for new projects than Maven these days.<p>I do like that the build files look smaller, but they also look like magic incantations. I can&#x27;t understand them the way I can understand POM files.<p>When I learned Maven, I could find properly structured material that explained what was going on, and taught it concept by concept, incrementally. There are lots of plugins, but they mostly follow a regular, predictable structure.<p>Gradle, on the other hand, has documentation all over the place. The official documentation is quite non-linear. Each plugin seems to define its own DSL, making discoverability a pain.<p>In summary, even though I can eventually find my way around Gradle builds on a case-by-case basis, I can&#x27;t form a coherent mental model of how it works. The syntax in particular seems to lend itself to way too much &quot;magic.&quot;<p>Is there a good, unofficial source that can help me master Gradle? A book, maybe? I hate using tech that I don&#x27;t understand.<p>I struggle with it every time I come across a Gradle project. It makes me feel like dealing with autotools again.')
