Their <i>combined</i> market cap is about 400B. Do those companies have high debt loads?<p>I agree competitors will be in trouble in the coming EV transition and some are discounted, but I do also think Tesla is now vastly overvalued by the market. They&#x27;ve only just started making a profit, and they are still burning huge amounts of cash. I wouldn&#x27;t be worried about solvency but I would worry that the future return promised by their valuation is extraordinary.<p>Tesla has risen 800% in the last year, that seems to be unjustified by their progress in the same time frame.')
