We already know that Intel&#x27;s offerings suck, and have sucked for a while. I get that Apple has exclusively put Intel into their MacBooks and hence that&#x27;s used for comparison almost everywhere, but Intel currently isn&#x27;t the real competition when it comes to ARM-vs-x86 - AMD is. And hadn&#x27;t it been Apple&#x27;s plan to take laptop CPU development into their own hands, they would have probably fixed their Intel problem by sourcing from AMD, so this Intel fixation in comparisons doesn&#x27;t make all that much sense.<p>Thus it would make much more sense comparing the M1 against AMDs Zen 3 CPUs, or, with regard to a better match in terms of TDP envelope, the 4800U. Anandtech&#x27;s early M1 benchmarks, which included the 4800U, hinted at much closer competition there, but IIRC they only benchmarked CineBench or something, so it was just one use case. I would love to see a broader comparison between the 4800U and the M1 in various application-oriented benchmark situations, including PostgreSQL.')
