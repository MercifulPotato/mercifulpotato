You&#x27;re accumulating statistics in an order dependent way without updating the parameters. You&#x27;re also doing k updates of the statistics with noisier estimates of the gradient. I&#x27;m not really a stats guy, but this doesn&#x27;t seem like it would provide better estimates of the adam statistics like you suggest. I&#x27;m sure this would have some impact, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be better than tuning the beta hyperparameters to incorporate gradient changes more quickly. But you probably just want to try it if you believe in it, not try to get traction with it in thw HN comments.')
