I don&#x27;t feel guilty because I&#x27;ve lucked into a career I enjoy and pays well. Luck in the sense that I picked a CS major in the 90&#x27;s before &quot;Tech&quot; companies existed and CS was an offshoot of Math departments.  I picked it because I liked computers and played computer games.<p>I am fine and I recognize there are others that are not doing fine.  My empathy means I do things within my means to help those, donate money, food, etc.<p>Regarding the US Federal government, tax dollars going to bailout corporations or tax cuts for corporations doesn&#x27;t help those who aren&#x27;t doing fine. Corporations always choose self-preservation (stock buy backs, debt pay down, etc.) vs. helping their employees. I read something a while ago that said for a corporation it makes economic sense to do those things.')
