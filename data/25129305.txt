That data is often not accurate and is definitely not standardized.<p>It&#x27;s a million times easier for, say, Patagonia or another single-brand retailer to accurately and robustly catalog their own merchandise.<p>The multi-brand retailers that do it well invest huge amounts in their buying and merchandising teams, which allows them to do independent ratings of, e.g. the clothing fit, etc. I&#x27;m thinking of Nordstrom.<p>When you are an Amazon or a Walmart, not only is the number of SKUs you are dealing with magnitudes larger, but often you are a few degrees separated from what those SKUs even are, when you open up your platform to third-party sellers.')
