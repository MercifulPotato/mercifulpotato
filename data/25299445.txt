Adding a column is easy enough, but enforcing that it means something and every one of your prior calculations are now meaningless without taking it into account is difficult.  Making such changes elegant and enforcing them to avoid future bugs is even harder.<p>Remember this example is  at it’s core a minor difference.  If you’re changing something like amounts being measured by volume instead of weight, then basic assumptions no longer hold making things much worse.')
