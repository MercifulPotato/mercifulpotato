I seem to recall it being common knowledge within the aviation community that there was a likely trim system fault that downed LNI610. With that backdrop, I&#x27;d expect anyone sitting in the front seats of a 737-Max to be aware of the recent crash of the type and reasonably fresh on the systems procedures&#x2F;memory items to remedy.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true today, but I suspect it was also true on 2019-03-10 and being primed wasn&#x27;t enough.')
