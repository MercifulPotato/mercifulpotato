The number of people I&#x27;ve met that can code like the blazes but can neither clearly communicate their ideas nor <i>persuade</i> people with the written word is kind of astounding. Many of them can be persuasive in person by relying on their passion and high rate of speech to carry them through, a strategy which does not work at all for the written word.<p>Engineering has the clear benefit of things either working or not, with the reasons why it failed being entirely explainable even if it&#x27;s not obvious at the time. Documentation is fundamentally a human to human operation, which means that all of the signals are messy and unclear. Writing is harder than speaking too, because you can&#x27;t adjust course mid-stream if it&#x27;s clear that your reader is confused or unmoved. Writing demands that you not only get your thoughts organized effectively, but that you reliably predict how people will read it and compensate appropriately. This is not a skill trivially learned.')
