Obviously their tech is pretty cool since I remember the control and feedback problem for bipedal bots being described as really hard when I was growing up. Obviously their consumer marketing is great since everyone looks at these things and loves them.<p>But they don&#x27;t have a product. What&#x27;s the problem? My guesses:<p>* No one really needs this shit<p>* They have a control&#x2F;feedback problem in interaction with moving objects i.e. this thing can&#x27;t high-five you without breaking your hand or open a can<p>We usually handwave this shit with &quot;But The Military&quot; but like what&#x27;s the use-case for the military? This fucker doesn&#x27;t know how to react to anything so it&#x27;s a bipedal trolley. But it&#x27;s too expensive a trolley. If you take this guy with you, your mission is going to end up being to protect this guy. Take an extra human and he&#x27;s way cheaper, way more versatile, and all that.<p>Not trying to be the usual HN negative because I actually think this is like the Newton or something. The tech is freaking cool, and it excites me as a glimpse to the future, but the product part is going to come some time in the future and it&#x27;s going to be awesome and in hindsight we&#x27;ll be like &quot;Damn! <i>That</i> was the missing part. It&#x27;s so obvious&quot;. Right now, though? I just hope someone will keep buying them and selling them like a hot potato so they live.')
