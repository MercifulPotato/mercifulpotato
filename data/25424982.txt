The goal was to eliminate dependence on the particular namespace prefixes in a document when testing for logical equivalence. However, there now exist a number of contexts in which namespace prefixes can impart information value in an XML document. For example, an XPath expression in an attribute value or element content can reference a namespace prefix. Thus, rewriting the namespace prefixes would damage such a document by changing its meaning (and it cannot be logically equivalent if its meaning has changed).”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;xml-c14n&#x2F;#NoNSPrefixRewriting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;xml-c14n&#x2F;#NoNSPrefixRewriting</a>')
