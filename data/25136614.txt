However, it did not make sense why Epic was paying the same amount of fees as an indie developer.<p>I said it before, but Epic went about this all wrong. They should have started this out as a grass roots campaign focused on their indie devs that licensed Unreal.<p>Epic should have advocated for Apple to reduce low revenue App Store royalty payments to these people.
