I promise you I don&#x27;t think every single GOP&#x2F;Republican is a nazi, but some of them are feeding you misinformation.<p>For example, there were no observers kicked out in PA. This claim famously went to court where the Trump&#x27;s lawyers were forced to admit that they had the same number of observers as democrats before having their case thrown out [1].<p>Likewise in GA, where you have a completely Republican controlled voter apparatus, you have come to believe that the governor, secretary of state and many of the republican workers for the state have decided to sloppily tilt the state in Biden&#x27;s favor, for seemingly no reason.<p>Also consider, that in many of these cases, they are being presided over by Republican judges (or judges appointed by Republican presidents), as is the case with the majority of our judicial system. McConnell famously prevented Obama from making many court appointments, while Trump has made hundreds. The further you look into this, the voter fraud story would have required co-ordination between not only the democratic party across the country, but also with several Republican staffers and judges. Voter Fraud of this magnitude would require an incredible grand conspiracy but somehow that is more believable to many than the fact Trump lost.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t believe every single GOP&#x2F;Republican is a Nazi, but the media wing seems to be working incredibly hard to make you believe that there is something nefarious going on in this election when there hasn&#x27;t been any credible proof there is. Maybe that&#x27;s not what a Nazi would do, but I implore that you take an unbaised look at what is being said, and what is actually happening on the ground.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kadhim&#x2F;status&#x2F;1324485343274557443" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kadhim&#x2F;status&#x2F;1324485343274557443</a>')
