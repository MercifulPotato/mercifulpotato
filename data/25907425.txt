Also this will make the legislative power, the most powerful one over the two others, going against the three power(separation of powers) concept of Montesquieu.<p>That&#x27;s why the impeachment proceeding cannot be only based in political grounds, but also need a clear legal basis on the government doing something wrong based on the current legal framework.<p>In the case of Dilma, only the political axis was at play, and a dirty one i must say, where they didn&#x27;t respect the  legal grounds and in the end there was no proof of her wrongdoing&#x27;s.')
