For example:<p>- If you&#x27;re just taking a photo and need to save it, why does the app need access to all your photos? Surely an append-only capability would be sufficient.<p>- This depends on the app, but if you&#x27;re just taking a photo why does the app need internet access? If the app is a typical camera app, it sure doesn&#x27;t - you might often want to pass the data to an app that does (via e.g. a share sheet) but in general the camera app itself has no need to reach out to the internet. (And if it does, does it really need to be <i>unrestricted</i> access to the internet?)<p>- Why is it so easy for apps to request access to everything and so hard for the user to say &quot;no, actually you only get to see this&quot;? (iOS has been improving this lately but it&#x27;s still a pretty rare feature.)<p>But yes also as you allude to, it&#x27;s not obvious to the user what access a program has after it&#x27;s been granted.')
