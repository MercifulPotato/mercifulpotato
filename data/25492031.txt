The upside is that they are not so massive that your job will mean more than just ladder climbing and working on menial projects that have zero business impact.<p>You may find pre-ipo companies (Robinhood, Instacart, Coursera) hit that sweet spot of comp and job satisfaction.<p>Also if SPACs continue to get more popular, there&#x27;s another option for the mid-stage startups.')
