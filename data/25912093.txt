Surely it&#x27;s from people higher to the top than the bottom and not at all the kind of people that would implement such a feature.<p>Actions speak louder than words and it would have been more meaningful to set some actual policy and protections for people bringing such privacy-violating product decisions to task rather then send the corporate equivalent of a &quot;like and share&quot; post.<p>I&#x27;ve never met an engineer that was anti-privacy or anti-security... Those traits are exclusively donned by product people trying to push a feature out on time or hit a kpi at the expense of bigger picture thinking.')
