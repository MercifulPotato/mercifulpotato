This discrepancy in the law is a very real one that defyes your logic here<p>The other problem with your argument is that your position that Person A that leaves there home is involuntarily subjecting &quot;everyone else&quot; is possible sickness.<p>However like person A &quot;everyone else&quot; also voluntary left their home thus assuming the risk. Thus there is no externalities in this equation at all.  If person A got sick then they assumed that risk like everyone else.<p>For example I did not attend any holiday gatherings, nor have I been physically into a store since like April,  all shopping is down online, and delivered or curbside pickup. I assessed the risks to myself and deemed curbside is my personal acceptable risk vector. For others they are fine with continuing to shop in the stores, everyone in that store has assumed that risk.<p>Likewise Family Gatherings where outside my comfort zone, however everyone that did have family gathers has assumed the risk for for them.')
