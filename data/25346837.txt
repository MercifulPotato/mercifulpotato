How can you even say that? There&#x27;s no way that you&#x27;ve tried these headphones so how can you possibly say that? Apple has gotten rave reviews with regard to audio quality in the Airpods Pro and the Homepod and Homepod Mini so why wouldn&#x27;t they take that expertise and put it into these?')
