Did Ulbrecht <i>actually</i> think he was hiring hitmen to commit murder? Was it just bravado? Because I can&#x27;t understand supporting Ulbrecht&#x27;s clemency if he really thought he was hiring assassins to kill 5 people.<p>Edit: To be clear, because I&#x27;ve already got what feel like knee jerk downvotes, I honestly don&#x27;t understand the hitman charges in the case and would like if someone has any more info. I mean, the chat logs looked pretty damning, but then all of those charges seem to have been thrown out, so I&#x27;d like to understand the reason for that. Were the chat logs forged in some way? Was it a technicality? Did the Feds just not care because they had enough in the drug charges?')
