The argument that Facebook has a moral right to do whatever the hell they like is mostly just a cudgel of an argument, though, to be picked up when it suits whichever of the two &quot;real&quot; arguments you support.<p>One refutation of this &quot;private property argument is instrumental&quot; position is the one the grandparent mentioned: That the people making the argument would &quot;support&quot; Facebook taking down speech that they deem &quot;just&quot;. If the private property argument only holds for taking down unpalatable speech, it&#x27;s not a position that&#x27;s held honestly.')
