Gavin Newsom isn&#x27;t the only one who couldn&#x27;t turn down an invitation to a birthday party at the French Laundry amid a global pandemic.<p>The San Francisco Chronicle broke the story Tuesday that Mayor London Breed attended a similar affair at the much-lauded restaurant in California&#x27;s Napa Valley the night after the governor.<p>Eight people, including the mayor, dined together at a small birthday party for a friend on Nov. 7, Andy Lynch, press director for the Office of the Mayor, told SFGATE.<p>The friend was socialite Gorretti Lo Lui, who was celebrating her 60th birthday, The Chronicle reported.[..]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;London-Breed-French-Laundry-apology-San-Francisco-15776946.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;London-Breed-French-Laun...</a><p>[..]&quot;As I said yesterday, it doesn&#x27;t matter if I was technically, if I wasn&#x27;t technically violating local health orders, because I know that as mayor, I should hold myself to a higher standard — I understand that,&quot; Breed said. &quot;My job just isn&#x27;t to lead by the letter of the law, but to lead in the spirit of it. I understand that and I&#x27;m committed to doing better.&quot;<p>&quot;This pandemic has been hard on all of us,&quot; Breed added. &quot;There&#x27;s no playbook for this. I know that none of us thought that in 2020, we&#x27;d be in the midst of a global pandemic. Who would have thought that this would have ever existed in our lifetimes? The impacts we&#x27;ve all experienced on our mental and emotional health have been tremendous, and that includes me. Every day, I do this job. I think about the people whose lives I&#x27;m responsible for, that the decisions I make impact people&#x27;s jobs and their families. And I&#x27;m doing my very best for this city. No one is perfect, and certainly not me.<p>&quot;As I&#x27;ve said, the criticism I&#x27;ve received is fair and I understand my responsibility, and I&#x27;ve learned from this moment,&quot; Breed continued. &quot;I want everyone to recognize that people all around you are trying. They are trying to follow the orders. They are trying to hold it together. We are all trying, and it is hard, people are losing it. But we can&#x27;t lose it on each other. We can&#x27;t turn on each other. This isn&#x27;t about me, I can take the criticism. I wouldn&#x27;t be in this job if I couldn&#x27;t.[..]<p>It takes ‘let them eat cake’ to a whole different level')
