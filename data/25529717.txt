For starters:  1) They know where you live.  Illogical is it may seem to some, there will be retaliation.   2) If they get it into a vehicle and it detonates, you could be liable for distracting the driver and causing potentially fatal accidents. 3) Unless you are instructing the thief to wear eye protection, you could be liable for vision loss.  Yes, they are thieves, but you are paying their medical bills.  Thieves are less likely to have medical insurance and your property liability insurance may not cover willful malicious intent.<p>As entertaining as this idea is, I would suggest instead putting GPS trackers into the item being stolen and not the package, as it will be discarded one block away.  In fact, have several of your neighbors do this as well.  Now you have the location the loot is moving to.  This opens up many options for both yourself, your neighbors and law enforcement.  If the cops know that all your neighbors are tracking this, they might actually do something, maybe.  At least you know where the criminals are originating from and most important, the drama is less likely to end up on your doorstep.')
