Locking down the Capitol is antithetical to the notion of open democracy.   Lawmakers and the law making process needs to be physically accessible by the People.  This was what the Founders intended.  Of course there is some risk here and Jefferson himself noted this.<p>That’s the price we pay for living in an open and transparent society.  While I don’t condone or support what happened this week, the building belongs to the People and not the government and the People have every right to enter the building and demand accountability.<p>The way the US Capitol is right now feels very police-state to me compared to how it used to be.  I have memories of running around the Capitol building with my Cub Scout pack including ending up in private areas.  There were no assault weapons and we weren’t met with police.  We were politely shooed away.<p>Today you cannot walk up the steps of the Capitol building.  It’s fenced off and manned by armed guard.  Last time I was there I stepped aside to let some people pass in a crowded area and crossed some arbitrary unmarked do not cross line but about 12 inches.  I was physically grabbed by Police.<p>To quote Donald Rumsfeld “freedom is untidy.”')
