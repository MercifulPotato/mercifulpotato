That is slightly different from &quot;write as you speak&quot; where the spelling of a word is literally speaking it slow enough so the individual sounds can be distinguished.<p>Not disagreeing with your overall point, most romance language have a much easier mapping from speaking -&gt; writing than does english, but the principle of &quot;write as you speak&quot; is probably the simplest you can get.<p>(ie, the letter &#x27;c&#x27; is used to represent different sounds in the word &#x27;calambre&#x27;, &#x27;chorrizo&#x27;, &#x27;proyeccion&#x27;. It&#x27;s not complicated to learn at all, but you still have a one -&gt; many mapping on the letter -&gt; sound. For languages like Serbian, it is straight up one to one.')
