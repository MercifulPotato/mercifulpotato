Instead of desperately fighting never ending hordes of increasingly horrifying creatures from hell so you can get out in one piece and save the world, you&#x27;re an unkillable demigod that&#x27;s basically dunking on armies of demons for lulz.<p>Doom was structured in such a way that when you started off playing it was practically survival horror, but when you &quot;got gud&quot; you were practically the unkillable demigod. That&#x27;s what I loved about it: it was so open-ended. It could be that way because its engine was so limited. There were only so many possible level layouts, and only a few different parameters that determined how enemies behaved. Using those, you could construct a combinatoric explosion of battle scenarios that ran the gamut from balls-out arena battle to hunting down enemies in dark narrow corridors and everything in between. Furthermore, the level data was small enough that the entire level, and all objects spawned within it, could live in memory at once. This made each level feel like a living world. Enemies from a faraway part of the level you haven&#x27;t reached yet can spot you and start chasing and attacking.<p>In Doom 3, Doom (2016), and Doom Eternal, the engine is so unlimited that the designers had to basically pick a playstyle in order to narrow down the solution space, just to get started. Doom 3 opted for a survival horror style while the latter two games opted for a Serious Sam&#x2F;Painkiller style combat game: move to area, sweep all enemies, move to next area, repeat. They feel more fun and more like Doom than Doom 3 did, but there&#x27;s still something missing. Not that I blame them for adopting a few modern shooter conventions. Had they made it a total &quot;boomer shooter&quot; I doubt it would have sold as well.')
