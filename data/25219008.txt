The many FLOSS projects on our list show that institutions around the world come to the same conclusion through a variety of open data sets and models.\nIt is true that, as everywhere else, there are black sheep (i.e. Climategate). But these are the exception.<p>We think that the discussion should include everyone interested in this development, we need an improved way to create &quot;open facts&quot;.\nTo keep the scientific discussion and discoveries as open and transparent as possible, we propose to built an &quot;open fact pipeline&quot;. As seen in the slides related to this list (slide 10, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protontypes.eu&#x2F;protontypes_open_sustainable_technology.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protontypes.eu&#x2F;protontypes_open_sustainable_technolo...</a>).<p>Proposed pipeline model:\nOpen Models and Data -&gt; Open Tools -&gt; Open Execution and Server -&gt; Open Results -&gt; Open Discussion -&gt; Open Science and Facts')
