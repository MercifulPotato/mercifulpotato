Seeing how my comment went from three upwards to four downwards I admit I was a little scared to look at the comments cuz I expected them to be a dumpster fire but the comments were actually really good here... Except for the person asking if i think I&#x27;m insane, haha. Just kidding, that was also a really good comment, but others didn&#x27;t like it, haha :) ;p xx c.<p>I think this indicates this idea is polarizing and that the people who found the statement outrageous downfloated while those who were able to engage with it in a critical manner posted some interesting content. I think that&#x27;s a very interesting signal about this kind of idea that it&#x27;s so polarizing. At least in this small sample size of hacker news readers. who knows how that compares to the general or larger or different population tho?')
