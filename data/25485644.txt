It&#x27;s still the least bad site for general programming that I know, and your experience will be much better if you understand the most important quirks of the site and the community there.<p>There&#x27;s two options here on what could have happened:<p>- the community deleted the question because it did not meet the quality criteria<p>- the user self-deleted after the answer was posted<p>To avoid the first case you need to understand roughly which kind of questions get closed and deleted on SO, and simply avoid answering them if you don&#x27;t want your effort to go to waste. The second case mostly happens with users posting homework (in an effort to remove the evidence), which are cases where answering is somewhat discouraged. But if the question is generally good, you can flag that case for moderator attention and it will likely get undeleted. Once your answer has an upvote, the asker cannot delete anymore.')
