Programming isn&#x27;t about artfully manipulating input devices while watching characters scroll fancifully across the screen.<p>It&#x27;s about understanding a problem in depth, and considering possible implementations&#x2F;problems&#x2F;edge cases.<p>If you spend more time typing than thinking - I will unequivocally call you a bad developer (or a developer who&#x27;s job is ripe for automation...).<p>---<p>Now - no knock on Vim.  I much prefer it to nano, and if you enjoy using it, more power to ya. I do agree there&#x27;s a certain sense of &quot;playing a musical instrument&quot; feeling to it.<p>But playing music and composing music are NOT the same.  In the same way that entering text and programming are NOT the same.')
