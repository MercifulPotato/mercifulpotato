A currency with a limited supply results in deflation as the economy grows.  Deflation gives an advantage to savers, the same way inflation gives an advantage to debtors.  A currency with an unlimited supply <i>which is supplied at the same pace as economic growth</i> results in zero inflation.  And that&#x27;s nice because then the government isn&#x27;t giving anybody an artificial advantage.  Zero inflation means a level playing field.')
