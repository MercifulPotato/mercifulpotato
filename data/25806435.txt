A few things you could add to make this more realistic to something that gets shipped:<p>-CORS support.  Deploy this to a non-local domain and try to reach it from a web browser and it will fail.  I like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rs&#x2F;cors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rs&#x2F;cors</a>.  I had rolled my own but then moved to that library.<p>- input validation.  I like go-playground&#x2F;validator.<p>The other big issue is the locking by hand around the task store.  In reality usually there would be a database to handle concurrent read&#x2F;writes.  I use SQLite in production.  I know this is just a demo and you want to use just stdlib, but serializing all data access is sort of unacceptable as a solution in a concurrent language like Go.  When I&#x27;m not handling concurrency with SQLite I like to implement The actor pattern, having a persistent goroutine listen and respond to &quot;taskstore&quot; requests via channels.')
