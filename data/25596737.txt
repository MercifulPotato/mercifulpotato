I feel very similarly.<p>You might get a kick out of this post by a man who works adjacent to Sante Fe Institute folks. This guy takes it to the next level and makes you almost start to think of &quot;non-living&quot; things as &quot;participating&quot; in this dance of living with us as non-passive structural actors.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowm.org&#x2F;thermodynamic-computing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowm.org&#x2F;thermodynamic-computing&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; For example, the [mud hut] structure’s inhabitant (also a volatile structure), may use the structure as a residence. If the structure succeeds in protecting the inhabitant from the degrading effects of the environment then the inhabitant will be better able to conserve energy, which may be directed toward the repair of the structure. On the other hand, if the structure fails to increase the inhabitant’s ability to dissipate energy, for example by requiring the inhabitant to spend more time on its repair than on obtaining food and resources (free energy), then the structure can be seen as participating in its own destruction (2nd Law). In the event of death or sickness of the inhabitant, the structure will decay back into the homogeneous state from where it came.')
