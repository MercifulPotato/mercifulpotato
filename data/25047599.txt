I sometimes find looking at the source is a faster way to answer a specific question about how something works vs reading through several pages of documentation, where the nuance I care about is noted in a &quot;Remarks&quot; section which is easily missed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.dot.net&#x2F;#System.Private.CoreLib&#x2F;ConcurrentQueue.cs,18bcbcbdddbcfdcb,references" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.dot.net&#x2F;#System.Private.CoreLib&#x2F;ConcurrentQue...</a>')
