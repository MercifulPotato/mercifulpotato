If the bare minimum for a position was &quot;no mistakes&quot; you&#x27;d never find a qualified candidate. I&#x27;ll go further and add that your attitude makes things worse in practice because since mistake can, and do happen, your wholesale rejection incentivizes effort spent hiding mistakes and scapegoating.
