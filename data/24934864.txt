Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=[24935307, 24934930, 24935330], score=None, time=1604001051, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917587, text='For firefox, you can disable IDN in the urlbar with:<p><pre><code>    user_pref(&quot;network.IDN_show_punycode&quot;, true);\n</code></pre>\nin your user.js. Then all URLs will appear in their punycode form, eg apple.com with the cyrillic glyphs will show as:<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com&#x2F;\n</code></pre>\nIs this good enough? Probably not in general.<p>- It relies on you to notice the URL bar after you&#x27;ve clicked a link. Worse, it relies on you to notice the URL bar after you&#x27;ve clicked a link <i>and</i> after the website has begun loading long enough so that firefox changes the URL to the target.<p>- If you&#x27;re someone who does actually visit websites with punycoded domains regularly, then this conversely makes it harder for you to know you&#x27;re on the right domain.<p>- Even if you notice the URL is wrong, you&#x27;ve already started loading the page. Best case your IP is now known to that server. Worst case it had a malicious payload for your browser &#x2F; OS &#x2F; hardware and your content blocker wasn&#x27;t configured &#x2F; able to block it.<p>It&#x27;s good enough for me, at any rate.')
