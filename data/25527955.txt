The internet was full of advice against learning clarinet without a teacher. So I took lessons. It surely helped but it did not feel like a great accelerator. Most gain came from practising almost every day for about three years. After the birth of my daughter I stopped taking lessons because I did no longer have the time to practice and to drive to the teacher&#x27;s home once a week. I wonder if anyone has experience with online teaching? Commuting to a teacher&#x27;s place won&#x27;t fit my schedule anymore. But I wonder whether a teacher can really be helpful via a standard webcam.')
