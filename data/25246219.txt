Still, it is hard to understand how this addresses relatively common use cases like providing intelligent load balancing for clients outside the cluster or secure multitenancy within it.<p>Solving this requires a step back to think through simplifying networking itself. I thought amazon did the world a favor by removing L2 networking from their model. We need a better set of primitives that abstracts out as much of the low level implementation as possible. The current situation feels like data management before the advent of the relational model.')
