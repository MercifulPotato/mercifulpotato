That was all his work. They took my office away and replaced it with a panopticon prison-style environment where everything was glass, with no curtains for the external windows, a black globe surveillence camera right above&#x2F;next to me. Every 2 minutes someone would walk by, distracting me. I couldn&#x27;t see my screens because of the windows behind me with no curtains, so I was being blinded by the sun. They didn&#x27;t even provide a bookshelf for my programming-related books. AND they never once asked me about my experience in that &quot;office.&quot; I found three (sorry, but OBESE&#x2F;UGLY) individuals constantly walking around and pointing at things - I followed them around and those were Ive&#x27;s employees examining the horrible workplace they were creating. That was all Ive&#x27;s fault. Then they forced us to be in the &quot;office&quot; every day instead of working remotely like I had for years. In his words, &quot;And I know how we work and you don&#x27;t!&quot; RIGHT. Well, I left that job after 15 years while in that crap environnment. That&#x27;s when I lost all respect for Jony Ive.')
