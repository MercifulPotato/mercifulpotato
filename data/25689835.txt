I worked an event where the President spoke so I got one of the pins once I cleared into the secure area. Iâ€™ve still got it in a mementos box somewhere.<p>Edit to clarify: a matching pin was not sufficient on its own to gain access to the secure area. But being in the secure area without a matching pin would certainly be sufficient to draw some official attention.')
