Async is <i>deceptively</i> simple in my opinion, because while it looks arguably even simpler than an explicit state machine, it makes your program flow nonlinear and I find that a lot harder to work with. With blocking code I can mentally step through the code follow causes and consequences easily, with async I feel like I&#x27;m watching a scifi movie involving time travel and parallel universes.<p>And the loss of control is also an issue for me. I write code for memory-constrained environments, with blocking code and OS threads I can usually bound my memory consumption fairly easily. If I surrender the control to a scheduler runtime I feel like it becomes a lot harder, although here I&#x27;m willing to concede that it might have more to do with my lack of experience with Tokio than an objective issue.')
