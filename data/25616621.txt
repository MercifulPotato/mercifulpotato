The average healthcare cost in the US is $7k&#x2F;year&#x2F;person for the working age population. Children are an additional $3k&#x2F;child&#x2F;year. Since insurance companies are private businesses they will be paid $7k&#x2F;year&#x2F;person on average. No loopholes, no ifs, no buts. As such, no matter what your plan says or what the tradeoffs are (deductible, monthly, etc.), on average you will be paying them $7k&#x2F;year&#x2F;person. If you&#x27;re paying for it yourself then that price will be paid by you. Now, you can avoid medical treatments to lower that price but I hope it&#x27;s obvious why that&#x27;s not a good social solution.<p>That price may come out of monthly premiums, deductibles, out of pockets or copays but it will be paid out on average.<p>In a universal healthcare system the government can use progressive taxes to subsidize this cost for the less well off. In a private system that isn&#x27;t the case.<p>So if you make $24k&#x2F;year that comes out to 30% of your income. Assuming you get the average standard of medical care in the US. You may get lucky and avoid this but lotteries aren&#x27;t good ways to live life.<p>edit: Please note I&#x27;m talking about the working age population. I don&#x27;t think the elderly make sense in this discussion given that there&#x27;s government health coverage for them.')
