Selectors still need to be specific enough `.button` is great until you add another button.<p>2. Selectors can be _too_ specific in weird ways. Recently, I encountered a bug where reformatting my markup broke a test that detected if an element was present by checking for its contained text. Turns out the newlines that I inserted between the opening and closing tags were significant for the test. Thankfully, it&#x27;s all JS, so one can appropriate work around.<p>3. For SPAs, it&#x27;s harder to convey that a page&#x2F;view load has completed. So, if I click a button and the entire viewport updates (potentially downloading a JS bundle in tandem), I either need to insert timeouts of arbitrary lengths, or explicitly call out to the the provided network API hooks. This can be annoying because now I not only need to worry about what I _can_ see when I navigate through my app, but also what I can&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s far better than what has come before, but it&#x27;s not a silver bullet.')
