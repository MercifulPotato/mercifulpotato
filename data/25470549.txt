However, that was largely because I had fully embraced that I would never graduate from a university and had to learn on my own, so the year prior I had read some books on proofs, probability, and statistics. I have notes and flashcards, I really studied, never expecting school credit. I had also encountered combinatorics and such in grade school and other math classes over the years. Discrete Math always seemed like &quot;programmer&#x27;s math&quot; to me, in contrast to Calculus, and being a programmer it felt easier.<p>We don&#x27;t know a lot about what the author was doing outside of school, but we know he was serious about self improvement - he wasn&#x27;t just putting in hours at work and collecting a paycheck. It sounds like he&#x27;s completed some impressive programming projects, he attends meetups, keeps a blog, uses Linux, hates Windows, learned to like Windows anyway, ported a Windows UI library to Android and iOS, speaks multiple languages, has attended multiple universities in the past, etc. I think there is a good chance that &quot;he already [knew] most of it&quot;.')
