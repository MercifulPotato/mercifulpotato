I also don&#x27;t get why it would take &quot;curing&quot; the president to know of a specific cocktail that works.<p>I kinda am losing all faith in all things medicine if we&#x27;ve had experience, as a whole, to try to treat 36 MILLION people with this issue and one specific treatment for one specific person, who happens to survive like 35 MILLION others so far.
