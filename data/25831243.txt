They want you to design the cable for the user to plug the car into the charge station.  Can you sketch some design ideas and point out the pros and cons of each?<p>It&#x27;s a great question because it&#x27;s almost impossible...   Any cable that can deliver the tens of megawatts needs a ton of copper and a ton of cooling, and usually ends up too heavy for grandma to move.  Then high voltages are investigated, leading to insulators which can&#x27;t do high temperatures, are stupidly thick themselves, or are non-flexible...   Sometimes candidates suggest superconductors, but then they need to come up with an answer to cooling, keeping it flexible, and stopping the user getting frostbite.<p>As an interviewer, it shows me how quickly a candidate can guess the magnitude of each parameter in their design and iterate designs to get everything reasonable.  That ability tends to match an engineer who can make a prototype of something in a few days.')
