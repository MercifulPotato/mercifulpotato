Since they have fewer viewers.<p>So unless those fewer viewers are willing to put up substantially more money, the people making the shows are going to keep looking for other options too.<p>(You also have big startup costs for this enterprise, if you&#x27;re trying to do it as a platform vs kickstarting a single show. Think Quibi-style user-acquisition-problems, but not your pitch tp users isn&#x27;t &quot;short episodes on the go&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;we pay creators with a different methodology.&quot;)')
