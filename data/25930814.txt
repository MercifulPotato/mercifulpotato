Item(by='kurtschiller', descendants=None, kids=[25940001], score=None, time=1611767794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25929975, text='I think the question the series most addresses is &quot;How do you manage a utopia?&quot; and not &quot;How do you get to a utopia for us, here, on Earth?&quot; For instance there is a lot of thought given to how they resolve differences, how they deal with people who don&#x27;t really like the utopia they live in, how do they deal with people&#x27;s autonomy and freedom without harming others around them, etc. And so from that POV I think it is an interesting exploration of how and if people can live up to their ideals - how does the Culture justify taking action against neighbors in light of this radical view of freedom and autonomy? Can you ever truly live and let live, or is there a point where you NEED someone willing to get their hands dirty, etc.? I think all of those are things explored in the series.<p>But so much of our own politics and ideology is about the question of allocating resources - and that does not come up, because they have essentially an infinite amount. Nobody has private property, sure, but they have as much public property as they want, and so much of it that there&#x27;s almost never any drive to compete for anything - attention, sure; favor, sure; but property, or money, or things, not really.<p>None of which is true in the real world, of course, and so yes I agree a lot of it does not really translate to &quot;well, what do we do here and now?&quot;. It&#x27;s more &quot;What would we do if we got there?&quot; I guess')
