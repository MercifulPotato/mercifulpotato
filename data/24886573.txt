It’s not configurable at all.<p>It was a sticking point for us when deploying the sequel to a game I was working on. Ultimately we determined that the benefits of using the provider outweighed the benefit to users since we weren’t shipping the game there officially anyway. (With one notable exception)<p>It still leaves a sour taste in my mouth.<p>It should be noted that it’s also Cuba and Crimea that are blocked. I was principally annoyed at the lack of usability in Crimea, as any way you slice it it’s part of a country that is not being sanctioned in the same way and the citizenry did nothing wrong.')
