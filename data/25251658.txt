Infact, most of the high ranking people in his cabinet are self-made men like him. The current Home Minister of India for example started his career as a polling-booth level canvasser in the party.<p>If a poor self-made man rising to the top in free and fair elections (results accepted by everyone) is a murder of democracy, then you need to find the correct definition of democracy.')
