My experience in academic computer science in France (though not in the author&#x27;s specific subfield) is that many many very good PhD students graduate with one or two conference papers published, and nobody minds, and they go on to good positions after that. I agree with the grandparent that the author might be overstating the problem a bit, in their very specific context. In other places, sure, students have some dumb quota to fulfill. But putting this front and center as the argument for leaving a tenured job in France... doesn&#x27;t agree with what I&#x27;ve seen.')
