They require some softmodding [1], but after that can natively play DS [2] and GBA [3] [4]. The New 3DS also has great emulators available for NES, SNES and Game Boy [5], and has native ports of a few Nintendo 64 games. Being mass market devices, their build quality and QA are much superior to cheap Chinese devices or DIY Korean ones, and they&#x27;re also widely and cheaply available on the second hand market in most western countries.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3ds.hacks.guide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3ds.hacks.guide</a><p>[2]: Directly from the cartridge slot or using Twilight Menu <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DS-Homebrew&#x2F;TWiLightMenu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DS-Homebrew&#x2F;TWiLightMenu</a><p>[3]: Using &quot;Virtual Console injects&quot;, see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3ds.eiphax.tech&#x2F;nsui" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3ds.eiphax.tech&#x2F;nsui</a> . Virtual Console injects for the other systems on your list will also work, they will then run in Nintendo&#x27;s own emulators for those systems.<p>[4]: Just be sure to hold start&#x2F;select when launching DS or GBA games to avoid bad quality upscaling and run them at pixel accurate native resolution.<p>[5]: bubble2k16&#x27;s emulators can play pretty much anything on &gt;New&lt; 3DS models, use mGBA for Game Boy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gbatemp.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_3DS_homebrew_emulators" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.gbatemp.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_3DS_homebrew_emulators</a>')
