Some have given me brief half assed counter answers that conveniently miss other harder questions like a good PR person does (and which you seem to have gotten in your reply).<p>I hope every web admin gives it serious second thought before adopting Cloudflare. Just like for cellphones OS&#x2F;operator the one thing I’d dream of is a tool that offers a limited set of what Cloudflare does (DDOS protection, hosting privacy layer) but is pro internet and pro privacy. They seem hostile to it in many ways likely because it directly affects their bottom line.<p>The bigger question is whether such a tool could be created without all the downsides. The two I listed I think yes. But their web app security system is overly strict and bad for the internet IMO.<p>And I say that knowing they protect some serious defenders of human rights and face a lot of abuse from the ‘bad guys’. I just wished there was a better middle ground.')
