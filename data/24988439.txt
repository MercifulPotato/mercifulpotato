But they still would have lousy power density.  ARC&#x27;s power density (total reactor volume, not just plasma volume) is 40x worse than a commercial PWR.<p>Fusion reactor power is ultimately limited by the need to radiate energy through the wall of the reactor, and the limit from that would apply even if plasma confinement were a nonissue.')
