Yes, for equal level of effort, 4x easier is probably a good introduction. But climbing that slowly is frustrating. And it’s dangerous in traffic.<p>I’ve definitely “learned to climb”, and I definitely don’t have that strength and endurance now, but next time I’m riding I will still definitely prefer a little extra effort over the slow crawl.')
