Item(by='Someone1234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611272045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865892, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think responding in less than five minutes was unreasonable.<p>This only further highlights how unnecessary the original low value reply was. Instead of responding with something of substance that took five additional minutes to write, you told us your qualifications instead of your views.<p>&gt; I also think this entire thread will be worth revisiting upon appeal.<p>I don&#x27;t really see why. None of the reasons you got downvoted have anything to do with this specific case (low effort comments, arguments to authority, complaining about the response to the forementioned, and then arguments that are poorly explored&#x2F;rely on erroneous facts).<p>Even if Parler ultimately won via an entirely new theory of US law as you have argued, it wouldn&#x27;t change that your comments here today could have been better and would have been received better if they were.')
