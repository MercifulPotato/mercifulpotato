But the histrionics frim the Tories and Momentum about the BBC is wildly misplaced.<p>In comparison I never really watched the US &quot;news&quot; until the recent US election, occasionally watching a bit of CNN&#x2F;ABC&#x2F;Fox News. But I&#x27;ve been watching it these last few months, a mix of CNN, Fox and CNBC.<p>I was shocked at how CNN and Fox both present their often extremely partisan and biased opinions as news. They &quot;report&quot; on a story, but just constantly throwing in their own slant, not reporting the facts, but spinning it. CNN is not quite as bad as Fox, but it&#x27;s still really, really bad.<p>That&#x27;s not news to me.<p>The BBC does not do that. They don&#x27;t have reporters sit their and rant about stuff, or label huge swathes of the population as X, Y or Z.<p>While there is bias by omission, or by the order in which they present the news, it&#x27;s nothing like the &#x27;news&#x27; I see coming from America.')
