I mean trying to make gasoline from the atmosphere would certainly require more energy than you get by burning it, a lot more.<p>But I thought sensible capture proposals ran on different chemistry, possibly relying on a wet&#x2F;dry cycle under which the affinity for carbon is different in the two halves. And letting evaporation (i.e. solar energy) move you from wet to dry. It&#x27;s not obvious that these must use more energy than you got by burning the coal in the first place.')
