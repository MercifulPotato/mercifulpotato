Item(by='ben_w', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603110793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824917, text='&gt; The number of times I&#x27;ve been downvoted to invisibility and flagged makes it completely not worth my time unless I&#x27;m talking to someone interesting who has an idea already.<p>I totally understand the sentiment; thing is, this isn’t a quant forum, it’s mostly tech, and even then more software than hardware — either you should take the downvotes as a hint to simplify, or as a hint to not bother with that topic here.<p>Again, I really do sympathise with your frustration: no matter how I try, I can’t get non-programmers to understand even the basics of cryptography and why police master-keys&#x2F;backdoors are a bad idea.')
