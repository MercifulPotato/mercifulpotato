Item(by='fbkr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602918871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806884, text='&gt; C language has some very limited implicit type conversions<p>What? C will happily compile this:<p><pre><code>    void g() {\n        float f = 3.14;\n        int* ip = &amp;f;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nC++ has no such _craziness_. Your strawman actually has pretty good uses:<p><pre><code>    complex c = 3i;\n    ... = c + 4;\n</code></pre>\nWould you rather have the last line not compile because 4 is not a complex number? Because one _could_ argue that 4 is a complex number, and C++ can represent this with an implicit constructor.<p>The issue with C++ is that implicit is the default, not that it exists.')
