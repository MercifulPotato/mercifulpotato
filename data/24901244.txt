However, especially with SDR, I find my need to write C++ and my brain is so grooved reading C code that I find it trips me up reading C++ code. Also I find I don&#x27;t have a good sense of &quot;clean&quot; C++ code. Since I learn best by exploring, I was wondering if there are some good code bases to read where I could get a feel for what &quot;good&quot; C++ code would look like.<p>Any suggestions? Pointers to repos would be appreciated. Thanks!')
