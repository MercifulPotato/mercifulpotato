GM&#x2F;DM are a rare resource, and as a forever-DM, I would love using such services to be actually able to play.<p>One thing I think would be a cool addition : play by post games.<p>I&#x27;m not a native speaker and I&#x27;m always more comfortable in written games rather than spoken ones, mainly because of the highly specialized vocabulary that I don&#x27;t recognize immediately when spoken. Of course, this could be roleplayed (playing an outlander character), but I bet it would quickly grow old :)<p>I suppose any non-native speaker would feel that way too - and then, there&#x27;s the timezone problem.<p>One thing I know from roll20 : localized games are not the answer. There is just not many enough players outside US to properly fit each timezone with enough diversity. That&#x27;s also why PbP has been what worked best for me.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad to see this happen, best of luck!')
