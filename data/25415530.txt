Item(by='adamlett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607942629, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410276, text='In Denmark motorists have reversed burden of proof when it comes to liability for damages. In other words, if a driver of a car is involved in an accident, they have to prove beyond reasonable doubt, that they were <i>not</i> the party at fault or be liable. If that sounds onerous, remember that motor vehicles are mandated to covered by a liability insurance, so it&#x27;s the insurance company that ends up paying. The insurance company will sometimes sue the driver after, if they think the accident was caused by gross negligence on the driver&#x27;s part, but this is irrelevant to the party not at fault.<p>I remember from my brief stint in law school that our professor told us, that there is a good case to be made for changing the law from reverse burden of proof to <i>objective liability</i>, ie. motorist&#x27; should <i>always</i> be liable, no ifs, ands, or buts. The reason, he explained, is in the cases where two motorists are in an accident, a lot of resources are wasted in determining liability. Since what always happens is that one insurance company must pay and another one doesn&#x27;t, and since each insurance company will on average win as many cases as they lose, it would save a lot of money and time to just declare that each driver is 50% liable and be done with it. I also seem to remember that this is how it works in New Zealand, but I could be misremembering.')
