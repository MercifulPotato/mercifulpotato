Movies that we are watching a lot live on Plex, but if we stop watching something, or it seems like a one-time thing, then they can be removed from the library.<p>The burned DVDs are really more of a personal archive. Those movies could get added back to Plex someday. I don&#x27;t need all of Lost or Breaking Bad on my Plex server, because I&#x27;ve recently watched them, so they&#x27;ll live in the DVD drawer for a few years.')
