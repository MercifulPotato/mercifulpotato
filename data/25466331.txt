Or 2018, when AlphaZero was announced? In the intervening time, an entire generation of chess players - and many generations of chess computers - has come and gone.<p>I understand the feeling that there&#x27;s nothing new to discover - but if you conflate the state of competitive chess in 1996 with that in 2018, you probably don&#x27;t know how much you don&#x27;t know. And if you could have hypothetically beaten Kasparov, you&#x27;d certainly have had a chance against Deep Blue.')
