Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610605998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772763, text='&gt; You have an anonymous comment that claims to have caused a data beach of unknown data from an unknown company. No users are even mentioned.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can even call it that, since he didn&#x27;t cause the breach.  It&#x27;s hard to even liken it any employee repeatedly and deliberately leaving the door to a store unlocked, which eventually gets robbed.  Since I get the impression the stuff he&#x27;s talking about would have probably been inside some kind of perimeter defense.<p>IANAL, the best I can make of it from a legal perspective is some kind of negligence, but that&#x27;s a tort, not a crime.  So he may not have to worry so much about the RMCP, but rather losing his car to pay damages to his employer.<p>I think there&#x27;s a compelling argument for an ethical violation, but I&#x27;m still not seeing a criminal one.')
