As a species, we kill other living beings for our sustenance. I don’t think empathy is a human universal.<p>Or is it?<p>Almost two decades ago, when AI was still conversational fun rather than raging startups on steroids harvesting data, discussions in forums I used to frequent always used to circle around empathy, humans and AI.<p>Some questions to ask:<p>1. Would artificial intelligence have empathy?<p>2. Why did we evolve to cultivate empathy?<p>3. If AI developed empathy, would they have to possess emotions as well?<p>4. If AI develops empathy and emotion, how far away from sentience are these artificial beings we have created?<p>5. And now we will have to look at the ethics of ‘owning’ AI. A being..artificial or otherwise..that is capable of showing empathy and has emotions, is it akin to enslaving them?<p>And just like that, we can catapult ourselves into P.K.Dick’s world.<p>Fun times ahead.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artificial_empathy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artificial_empathy</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;cognitiveworld&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;empathy-in-artificial-intelligence&#x2F;?sh=21a922dc6327" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;cognitiveworld&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;empat...</a>')
