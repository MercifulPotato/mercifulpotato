I do not remember, now, if it was carted to landfills or composted, but of course it <i>could</i> be composted.<p>Before using it for agriculture one would want to consider whether the medications and other contaminants are a problem.<p>One cool thing about that plant I remember is that the water it produced was well within drinking-water standards: it <i>could</i> be connected straight to the water system.')
