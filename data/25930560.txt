You may need social assistance if you&#x27;re in hard times (and that&#x27;s OK, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s there for), but there is. If you say otherwise, you&#x27;re just making things up.<p>I said this in another post, but I can guarantee you that even in places like North Korea, people are squirreling away the little they have, just as my grandmother did. It&#x27;s possible to save even under poverty and&#x2F;or extreme situations. And America isn&#x27;t North Korea.')
