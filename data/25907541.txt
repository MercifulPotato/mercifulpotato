I also don&#x27;t think any of these people are wrong about the culture war issue you&#x27;re talking about, and if that had been all you said, we wouldn&#x27;t be 2000 words deep into this thread. But that&#x27;s not what you said.<p>The article you posted is from a health policy &quot;take machine&quot; (check his Twitter, he&#x27;s like a JV Ezra Klein) who concludes that opposition to the ACA is mostly <i>not</i> racist, and is using the idea as a framing device for a post summarizing a journal article about racial disparities in health care, which are obvious and real. The use of the word &quot;racist&quot; to describe the status quo ante of the ACA is counterproductive and stupid (see: &quot;takes&quot;), but it&#x27;s also not part of the mainstream conversation.<p>You suggested otherwise. I suggest you concede the point, because, again: we&#x27;re being held hostage by stupid things people say. Even smart people will say some stupid things, and we can let whole debates be defined by stupidity.<p>(We have another big health policy debate coming up, and as a liberal Democrat who opposes single-payer, I&#x27;m dreading the amount of stupidity we&#x27;re all going to have to wade through to get to any kind of engagement with the real issues).')
