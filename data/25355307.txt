Taxes largely aren&#x27;t - unless you&#x27;re talking about sales taxes. Land prices definitely are not. And you are literally doing the opposite of buying something when you save, so that is also (obviously) not included in CPI.<p>What inflation &quot;feels like&quot; and the CPI are completely different things. This is becoming more problematic if you&#x27;re on the wrong side of the trade (i.e. saving cash instead of swimming in a mountain of mortgage debt).')
