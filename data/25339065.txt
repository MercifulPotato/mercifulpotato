None of the early cycles had any obvious place for carrying anything. Regular people didn&#x27;t have much reason to go anywhere by themselves. They lived at or near their workplace. Their social circles were small. Church happened once a week, if they attended that often. If you needed a vehicle, it wasn&#x27;t to transport yourself, but to transport stuff.<p>I just read a couple of novels by Jane Austen. She describes the activities of the upper class, I believe in the 18th century. Now those people did transport themselves to visit other people, but her text makes it sound like a mile was a long journey -- if a woman walked that far by herself, it was talked about. Of course that doesn&#x27;t tell us much about the lower classes.<p>Dickens sheds more light on the common people, at least in cities. Again, a person needed a reason to go further than their own neighborhood, and transportation in London seemed to have been seen as a service, rather than a product. If you rode in a cab, its technological drawbacks were someone else&#x27;s problem.<p>Perhaps a reason to own and ride a bike would be if you worked in a factory that was some distance from where you lived, or for recreation. I&#x27;ve seen pictures of workers coming and going from factories, from early 20th century, and it&#x27;s a sea of bikes.')
