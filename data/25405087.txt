Society collectively  draws the line somewhere and you don’t get to unilaterally decide everybody else is wrong. I’ve heard people saying “I was only going a little over 30!” called speedo pedos, because it’s exactly like saying “she was only a little underage!”.<p>Check out the sibling comments for examples of people who thought they knew better but didn’t.<p>The thing about Scotland is completely wrong, I have no idea why you would think that.')
