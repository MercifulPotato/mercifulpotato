The same goes for an ad network with only broad targeting capabilities, e.g. that the viewer is likely an adult in a particular candidate&#x27;s district.<p>Restricting political advertising using Facebook&#x27;s hyper-targeted advertising platform strikes me as a responsible decision. I&#x27;m not sure there <i>is</i> a bright line between persuasion and manipulation, but if Facebook is trying to prevent the latter, that&#x27;s more ethical behavior than I expected from them.')
