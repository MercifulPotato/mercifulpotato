Like how Angular strongly pushes you into a MVC&#x2F;MVVC architecture as compared perhaps to React. Or how Rails simplifies _everything_, so long as you want to do everything &quot;the Rails way&quot; - compared to less opinionated frameworks like Flask.<p>To push the analogy further (perhaps way to far)...<p>Blues is like Rails. If you want to stick to mostly pentatonic scales and 12 bar structure, you can deliver new blues tunes extremely quickly with a very small and often relatively new&#x2F;inexperienced team. You can break out of the norms for small parts of the song, but its usually best if it&#x27;s just one of the team, usually the guitar player, who does that, while everybody else just sticks to the groove. Great blues is possible, good-enough blues is relatively easy.<p>Jazz is like Flask. You can do whatever you like, the &quot;rules&quot; are no more than &quot;best practice&quot; guidelines which you&#x27;re free to ignore. Having everybody in a team choosing which guideline to follow and which to intentionally break requires much more fundamental knowledge of the underlying theory, a lot more &quot;teamwork&quot;, and often a much higher level of technical competency to get it all to end up coming out right. Great jazz is transcendent. Not so great jazz is often a complete mess.')
