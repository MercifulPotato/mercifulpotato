I&#x27;m a programmer, very happy making backends, setting up the infra, maintaining it, and so on. I often want to make web pages, but I just hate dealing the web front-end stack.<p>Is this product a good fit for me? I could visually design the website, avoid getting my hands dirty with HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS, then have an easy way to connect it with a backend I&#x27;d make?<p>If this isn&#x27;t a good fit, any suggestions?')
