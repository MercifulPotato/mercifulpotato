Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602867123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801813, text='1) in the 1960s, we saw the rise of &quot;operations research&quot;, a field of study specifically aimed at understanding and improving how (mostly large) human organizations operated. It was seen as part of the great hope of the future, but because it explicitly said that large organizations, including governments, could function better and do great things, it became seen as quite a problem for conservative&#x2F;libertarian philosophy which wanted more support for the view that government is, as you put it yourself &quot;always incompetent&quot;. OR is now fairly unfashionable field, and the continuing search for better ways to do things within human organizations has lost a lot of the urgency it had in the 60s and early 70s.<p>2) You have almost no idea how incompetent or wasteful most private organizations are, unless they are so bad that they go bankrupt and dissolve.')
