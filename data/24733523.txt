If you want that, go on the dark web and risk criminal sanctions. I&#x27;m sure there are some positive effects which would get thrown out with the enormous moral hazard, but I&#x27;d have to be convinced that it isn&#x27;t worth it: as it stands, keeping personal user data should be a cost center for most businesses, something which exposes them to liability with no means to monetize other than providing whatever service they nominally exist for.')
