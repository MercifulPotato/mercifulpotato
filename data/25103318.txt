This is not to claim I have first hand knowledge, but I am white and I recognize the many aspects of privilege I am afforded. I feel I have enough of that perspective.<p>Meanwhile, it seems glaringly obvious that many on the right are not even making attempts at understanding why BLM exists, and can&#x27;t seem to comprehend systemic racism, because they&#x27;ve never been a victim of it. FFS, when Bloomberg <i>admitted</i> to stop and and frisk, that I felt should have been a turning point. For <i>decades</i> people of color have been telling us about this, but they were commonly dismissed by white americans as imagining it.<p>To elaborate on why I am not willing to empathize further than I have, I have no wish to empathize with bigotry. One set of my grandparents were also homophobes, which was laid bare in their will when their estate left out my homosexual brother completely. I hope I don&#x27;t have to cite Popper&#x27;s paradox of tolerance.<p>&quot;Fred the farmboy&quot; wants understanding and compassion? I&#x27;m all for that, I even want to put policy in place to help! But I have zero tolerance for intolerance, and will call it as I see it.')
