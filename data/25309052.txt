The most uncomfortable one to talk about is basic social network effects. Two people meet at some prestigious college and get married - are we shocked they have children who are predisposed for success? Besides from having god-given IQ, they are likely some combination of ambitious, punctual, respectful of authority, long-term oriented, hard-working, etc. But would one of those parents have ever been interested in marrying and having kids with some high school dropout, someone from a vastly different social place and lacking those values? It&#x27;s pretty rare. Society organizes itself around this stuff and it&#x27;s extremely powerful. The two high school dropouts end up hooking up and having kids and it&#x27;s often times (though obviously not always) the opposite cycle. And yeah there are plenty of societal biases that are real, but I really don&#x27;t think anything will ever be as powerful as this self-organizing dynamic of how people marry and have kids. It&#x27;s cold and depressing and uncomfortable but it&#x27;s reality.')
