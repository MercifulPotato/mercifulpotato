I&#x27;d expect them to be able to restore a backup of the latest version of all pages in 10 minutes.  It&#x27;s 20GB of data, and I assume it&#x27;s sharded at least 10 ways.  That means each instance will have to grab 2GB from the backups.    Very do-able.<p>As a service gets bigger, you typically scale horizontally, so the problem doesn&#x27;t get harder.<p>Restoring all the old page versions and re enabling editing might take longer, but that&#x27;s less critical functionality.')
