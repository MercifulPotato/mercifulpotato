My dad came over here in an H1-B because his company needed a public health expert with experience in Bangladesh. There were probably a handful of people in the world with that background. The company wasn’t going to find an American with those skills.<p>I’m sympathetic to the idea that we should have a generic immigration mechanism for skilled workers. But we don’t have that. Congress hasn’t created one because the American people won’t support one.
