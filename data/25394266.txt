So, I&#x27;m coming to you lauded folks with my idea for a quick SaaS &#x2F;s<p>Now, we could do a single elimination tournament on a piece of paper with a pen and be done in ten minutes. But where&#x27;s the fun in that?<p>I recalled http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kittenwar.com&#x2F; from way back when and thought that 1v1 technique would be great for figuring out the name.<p>I&#x27;ve found a couple pairwise ranking tools that use spreadsheets, but that&#x27;s boring.<p>Then I found the PAPRIKA method and this style of decision making:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.1000minds.com&#x2F;conjoint-analysis&#x2F;pairwise-comparisons-method<p>But that&#x27;s waaaay overpowered for what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Isn&#x27;t there an app, that starting from an arbitrary list, that creates a recursive 1v1 series of choices resulting in a ranked order list. And free, online, somewhere... Heck, if there&#x27;s something on GitHub I&#x27;d run that just to stop searching for the optimal solution.<p>I bet I&#x27;m just not using the right terminology and there&#x27;s a whole ecosystem of solutions. But, maybe not.<p>Now, I could come up with a hand rolled solution, but to be honest, I don&#x27;t have time.')
