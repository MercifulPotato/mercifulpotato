The rationals (of which BigDecimal cannot represent the whole space) are a 0-measure part of the reals. I would not claim that BigDecimal is an exact representation, which is a fact that should be clear to anyone that tries to calculate 2 * PI in arbitrary-precision finite decimals. Even not considering irrational numbers, BigDecimal cannot handle 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 + 1&#x2F;3 = 1 correctly.<p>It might be fair to claim that floats are <i>more inexact</i> - certainly moreso than Rational, but probably moreso than BigDecimal for the numbers that programmers tend to care about.')
