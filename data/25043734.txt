Definitely the slowest, kernel-panicky, least functional device I&#x27;ve ever bought. It is worse than the worst android device ever made (I&#x27;ve played with $10 android devices from 2013, this is slower and less functional.) It is shockingly bad. While the software is frightening, the hardware is also not good. The USB C port is totally finicky.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with this device now... hopefully I can find some fun from it.')
