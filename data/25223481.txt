On the other hand, if you&#x27;re rich and give away most of your money, you&#x27;re not going to get that lifestyle back. And I think that&#x27;s where a stingy mindset begins to set in.<p>I also think more affluent people are often socialized to expect that generosity will be taken advantage of, which leads them to favor formalized charities where their responsibility is clearly and legally defined and limited.')
