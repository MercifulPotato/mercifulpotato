Given endemic seasonal viruses that already kill people in waves all year every year, one could argue masks should be required forever. However, I think there’s a real value to smiles in public, and the community and goodwill they engender.  The moralism that has defined the conversation to date gives me no hope we’ll ever find our way out. And it quickly begins to appear less about helping people in an extraordinary time of crisis and more about virtue signaling. That, I think, is what breeds the hostility to mask mandates. People want to help one another, but there is a wide range of individual risk profiles that are completely rational, that politicians routinely ignore. “Science” can’t tell you how much death is an OK amount of death. Life requires we impose non-zero risk of death on others.')
