The state can&#x27;t execute warrants to get at what&#x27;s inside people&#x27;s minds. Computers are extensions of people&#x27;s minds and I expect them to be equally inviolable.<p>Also, even if it <i>does</i> have lawful access to the system, the state is not entitled to finding usable evidence.<p>&gt; it is open about the fact that court authorisation is required to enforce a backdoor<p>There mere possibility of a court-mandated backdoor means the entire system is already compromised and it&#x27;s impossible to trust it.')
