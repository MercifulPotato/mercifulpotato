That&#x27;s way more than the company town ever did -- it&#x27;s hundreds of towns worth of sidewalks.<p>And you as a speaker can&#x27;t use the Facebook sidewalks <i>instead of</i> Twitter unless they had all the same people walking on them (e.g. were part of the same federated system), which they&#x27;re not. If you want to reach your entire audience, you have to use both at once. Twitter can evict you from an audience bigger than Texas with no other way to reach them, and your argument is that a monopoly on Texas is only 10% of the country.')
