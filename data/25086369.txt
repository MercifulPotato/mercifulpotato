They know that they may be rich now, but they can be cancelled on a moments notice with no recourse to due process.  This is a problem has with China internationalizing the yuan and getting rid of currency controls.  If they do, all the rich people will leave.<p>One solution to this is to make the whole world under China&#x27;s effective control, or make the whole rest of the world much less attractive to live in than China.  How do they do it?  Hmm...
