Same as other burns. If you were to burn retrograde of normal (but still tangent to the orbit’s radius), there’s an orientation where the retrograde component of your thrust matches the component in the component that’s...prograde in a new orbit. Which now sounds to me like it would just be 45° from retrograde, tangent to the radius')
