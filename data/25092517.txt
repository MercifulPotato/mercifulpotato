Nintendo for a while ran their own manufacturing. Judging from the data structures I would expect this at minimum had a Nintendo Project Manager in charge.<p>Flip side: you are going to be techincally correct. Nintendo has deep relationships with local companies even when those local companies are not fully Nintendo owned. Deepest example might be Intelligent Systems which programmed and manufactured Nintendo&#x27;s devkits up until the Switch era.<p>Game Freak in theory is independent. They used Sega to publish their pet project platformer game. Yet somehow Nintendo just a few months ago moved them to an amalgamated office tower along with all other 100% Nintendo owned Tokyo studios. The message being that Nintendo keeps strong control through their project managers.<p>Source: my uncle works at Nintendo. &#x2F;s')
