You can google those arguments; it&#x27;s something like they don&#x27;t make enough money and etc.<p>In reality, I tip only 15%. For delivery, I don&#x27;t tip if there&#x27;s already a service fee. I only tip because I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll be assaulted. Yes, some people got assaulted (or verbally assaulted) because the tip less.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t tip if I won&#x27;t see that person in real life.<p>That&#x27;s how tipping percentage is determined. The person who screams the loudest win. It&#x27;s stupid.')
