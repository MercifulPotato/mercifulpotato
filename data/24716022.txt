Commercial real estate (which includes apartment buildings with 5+ units) is valued strictly by the amount of income it can produce, <i>i.e.</i> what the monthly rents are.  If you drop the rent from X to 0.67X, you&#x27;ve basically cut your property value by 1&#x2F;3.  If you give a rebate of 4 months free rent, the effect on the property value is basically 0.')
