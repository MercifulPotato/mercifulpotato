If the police want it, they are very welcome to obtain a warranty and I&#x27;ll be more than happy to give them copies of everything. No problem at all.<p>But with something like Ring, you don&#x27;t control the data. Police will have special arrangements where they can view recordings whenever they like, sometimes without a warrant, based on &quot;suspicion&quot; or some other nonsense like that. I&#x27;m also guessing that Ring doesn&#x27;t tell you when this happens. That is a system prone to abuse.<p>As to your last point - of course you should be able to volunteer the data if you want to. That was never in question.')
