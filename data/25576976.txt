Everything else is incidental complexity (and we mostly write incidental complexity).<p>The big thing that I don&#x27;t hear often is about <i>where complexity lives</i>.  Complexity is like a pile of receipts you need to hunt down to do your tax - you can have it distributed all over your house, you can sweep up into a pile, or you could file it.  The first is by far the most complex, and I&#x27;ve worked on codebases that looked like that.  Even the most trivial of changes takes a long time.')
