Even though no dirty read or data loss happened, the integrity of data is lost because there are two people assigned to be oncall.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to have a separate table&#x2F;single row to store it so the earlier mentioned row versioning checks could be used? Plus one could instead store the history of how the on call operator has changed instead of just having an &quot;oncall now&quot; boolean field against each operator.')
