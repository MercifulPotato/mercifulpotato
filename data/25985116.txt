In order to to be fooled, we just have to read the entire top-level form from the outside in.<p>Well, that&#x27;s what language is. For instance, if I&#x27;m saying &quot;Bob believes that the Earth is flat&quot;, but you only catch my speech starting on at word &quot;the&quot;, it looks like I&#x27;m saying that the Earth is flat. To get the real meaning (the belief is attributed to Bob), you need the whole sentence.<p>Or, until you hear the &quot;nai&quot; at the end of a long Japanese sentence, you have no idea that it&#x27;s going to be negated.')
