The reason is exchange of workbooks with less skilled individuals. Or cross platform incompatibilities like URLENCODE not working on MacOS since many years now. And many use cases that once required Excel can now be solved by other tools with better documentation. The nature of Excel is in-auditability, intransparency and error proneness. Trust me - Iâ€˜ve been using it for too many years now.')
