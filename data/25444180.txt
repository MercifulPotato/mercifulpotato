Obviously we have made lots of mistakes and bad decisions -- nobody can deny that -- but I think we get a hard time on HN because the core demographic group here (young affluent american males) is one who sees basically no benefit to the product, so they&#x27;re weighing those harms against nothing. If you talk to some people who genuinely use and love the product (who do exist!), you&#x27;ll get a different perspective.')
