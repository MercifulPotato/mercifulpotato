More and more news sites are behind paywalls.  A lot of the articles posted on HN are behind paywalls, and half the time I&#x27;m too lazy to try archive.is or one of the other paywall workarounds, so I end up doing without.<p>On the other hand, if I&#x27;m reading an aggregator like Google News, the interesting thing is that the top article for a particular sub-topic might be from the NYT or another site with a paywall, but if you look down the list you can get a similar article from a non-paywalled site.  The cool thing about this is I get exposed to a bunch of random sources, and often they are local news sites.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into subscribing to some sites, but most want north of $10 per month, some in the $20-$30 per month range, and I just don&#x27;t get that much value out of them to justify paying, especially when I&#x27;d end up having to pay for several of them, which would add up to several hundred dollars a month.  It&#x27;s still a real shame that micropayments isn&#x27;t a thing; I wouldn&#x27;t have an issue reading the first paragraph or two of an article, and then having to spend something like 5c to 25c to read more.  I fully understand <i>why</i> micropayments haven&#x27;t taken off, but it&#x27;s a shame nonetheless.')
