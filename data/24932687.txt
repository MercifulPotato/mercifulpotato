Item(by='HowardStark', descendants=None, kids=[24934920], score=None, time=1603991319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930404, text='&gt; In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.<p>This undermines my confidence in the entire rating system. At the very least, the drivers focus should be its own rating distinct from the performance of the piloting.<p>The serious selling point of any of these systems is greater-than-human reactions in emergency situations, and so a buyer going off these ratings could be mistakenly lead to believe that they are getting a better system in a Cadillac when they flat out aren’t.')
