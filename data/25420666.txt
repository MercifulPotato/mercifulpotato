Just read the post.<p>&gt; as in we need to take professionally trained philosophy graduates more seriously and bring them into the software industry so they can help us make better software.<p>Really? Where does it say that, or anything like it? You&#x27;re reacting to something you made up - not something that the post actually said.<p>It doesn&#x27;t demand professional philosophers anywhere. It demands &quot;great thinkers&quot; and five of the eight people listed as examples <i>aren&#x27;t</i> professional philosophers.<p>It is directed at telling the audience &quot;<i>you</i> might be&quot; a great thinker, so go to it.<p>This whole thread you&#x27;re reacting to your own imagined picture of a resentful philosopher instead of taking the time to comprehend the post on its own terms.')
