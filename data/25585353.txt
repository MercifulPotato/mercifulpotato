Nothing of substance here.<p>Though I am curious: Compared to other companies that are considered pro-employee (e.g. Costco), what does Chobani do for employees that&#x27;s so pro-employee? Hamdi may be for a $15&#x2F;he min. wage, but does he pay at least that without laws in place? That would be pro-employee.<p>I haven&#x27;t read anything beyond this article, so if you have any insight, I&#x27;m listening.')
