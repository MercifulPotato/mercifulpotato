FTC returns are predictable. The returns to taking an unbeaten path is anything but. Further, how will your peers and the world view you as CEO of New Idea Inc vs. L4 at Google?\n2. Prestige is a cheap correlate, and thus substitute, for aptitude. Outside of Tech, verifying aptitude and fit is like trying to pay with physical gold whereas prestige is like paying with Amex Platinum.\n3. Consulting and Finance offer exposure to a swath of otherwise opaque industries and opportunities. This appears to be especially true in industries driven by culture fit and trust. Why do many e.g. biotech companies eschew an MD&#x2F;PhD CEO for an ex-MBB &#x27;professional CEO&#x27;? Because the CEO exists raise money and that requires immense trust and penetrating opaque networks.<p>Perhaps returns to prestige are overrated, but I&#x27;ll take the prestige 10&#x2F;10. In my experience, the previously closed doors suddenly open themselves for you.')
