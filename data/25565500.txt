For a good part of it she was confined to her room. It appears that they&#x27;ve relaxed the restrictions after Coronavirus ripped through the place and everyone that didn&#x27;t die is now immune. She is at least allowed to go sit in the lobby area now and talk with the other residents.<p>Nothing quite like watching a 98 year old woman break down in tears every time someone reminds her that she can&#x27;t actually come outside and give us a hug or talk to us in person.')
