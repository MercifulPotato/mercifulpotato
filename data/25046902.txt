But seeing as we&#x27;ve had <i>zero</i> reports of any real-world consequences that could only have come about by Zoom spying, combined with the fact that &quot;spying on your customers&quot; is anathema to your business model and therefore a risk no sane and rational board of directors would ever approve (moderate upside, enormous possibly business-ending downside if ever discovered)... Occam&#x27;s Razor says no spying ever occurred.')
