Our geographic region has many tech employers so we aren&#x27;t the only option for job seekers. We probably aren&#x27;t even in the top 25% of employers for salary in our area.<p>Where is that?<p>&gt; We are not a software company so we do not use deep algorithm testing as part of our evaluation process [...] My experience has been that of that candidate pool, we will have 3-6 candidates with well documented programming projects or job experience. These tend to be the candidates we interview - we use a simple rubric with yes&#x2F;no for 5-10 categories we evaluate<p>You should try it. Right now it seems you are skewing toward hiring folks who already have experience vs fresh grads for entry level positions.<p>Whiteboard, if done right, gives a chance to college hires to prove themselves.

The pool of candidates that have one year of experience and are already looking to jump ship is very different than fresh grads (where everyone is looking for a job).')
