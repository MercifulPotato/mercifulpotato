Facebook is one of the companies doing this the right way. Facebook interviews H1-B candidates in exactly the same way it interviews American citizens, and they pay the same to H1-Bs and American citizens in the same role. When they reject an American candidate, it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t think that candidate is sufficiently skilled, not because they want to hire a foreigner with the same skills for cheaper.')
