I get it, I&#x27;m a techie who has taken a course and designed my site. I maintained a blog for a while, kept chickens, and grew some of my own food.<p>But what permaculture really needs is the economics to line up and the wider culture to change. The main permaculture profession seems to be teaching. There just doesn&#x27;t seem to be a plethora of jobs that are directly related to permaculture.<p>I love it as a design system and it definitely has opened up my eyes, but permaculture doesn&#x27;t need yet another website.')
