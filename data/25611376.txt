Both are related but subtly different and this is a common source for confusion when learning Rust.&quot;<p>&#x27;static means <i>different things</i> for references and trait objects.<p>ie.<p>&#x27;a: &#x27;static --&gt; reference with lifetime &#x27;a lives forever and can never be dropped.<p>T: &#x27;static --&gt; Type T has no references in it; it is effectively &#x27;entirely owned&#x27; by the owner of an instance of T.<p>These are totally different things with the same name.<p>(I believe technically there are actually three; `&lt;T: &#x27;static &gt;` is a type constraint and `T + &#x27;static` is a trait bound, but that both mean the same thing as far as I know)<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;rust-by-example&#x2F;scope&#x2F;lifetime&#x2F;static_lifetime.html#static" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;rust-by-example&#x2F;scope&#x2F;lifetime&#x2F;sta...</a>')
