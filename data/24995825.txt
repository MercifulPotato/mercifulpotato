You got it for a <i>fire-sale bargain</i> at only $50M, even including the turbine and cooling tower. It produces, what, 100kW? (Plus 100kW of waste heat you might be able find a use for.) Or is that too optimistic?<p>How many MW of solar panels can you buy for that $50M? Let&#x27;s even figure in plenty of battery backup. (Hint: lots.) How many MW of wind turbines? (Hint: lots.)<p>Where would such a garage-sized fusion reactor be useful? And how long before it is a radioactive slag heap? (It was good planning to bury it up-front.) How many GW-years does the fleet need to produce before it pays off the tens of $billions already sunk, to date?<p>The only guaranteed product of all nuclear power schemes is monstrous exaggeration of cost effectiveness.<p>&quot;Outputs net energy&quot; is very, very far short of useful.')
