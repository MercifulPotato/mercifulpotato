Item(by='wazoox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610549826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761091, text='&gt; That screencast is suggesting you need to click the activities button in the top left corner to be able to reveal a nav panel that&#x27;s all the way at the bottom.<p>That&#x27;s already the default way it works, and it&#x27;s perfectly insufferable. AFAIK almost everyone uses an extension or another that makes the panel a permanent or auto-hiding dock, like any other reasonable desktop OS.<p>I can&#x27;t see any drastic change, actually. Apparently the main difference is that the panel is visible at login, instead of being hidden (therefore stumping new users that can only see an empty desktop and nothing else).')
