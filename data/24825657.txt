My point being IKEA isn&#x27;t much cheaper when you account for materials and you usually get better flexibility elsewhere.<p>IKEA is like McDonald&#x27;s of furniture, there&#x27;s a place for it, but like the McDonald&#x27;s fancy burger options if you&#x27;re going for that you&#x27;ll have significantly better options for a bit more money')
