Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=[25361873], score=None, time=1607529396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359636, text='&gt;I guess the difference between 2016 and 2020 outcomes is that democrats at least didn&#x27;t create any ruckus during the power transfer from Obama to Trump<p>Crossfire Hurricane wasn&#x27;t enough of a ruckus?<p>It came out recently that Eric Swalwell was targeted by a Chinese spy, but cut ties after a &#x27;defensive briefing&#x27; by the FBI. Hillary&#x27;s campaign also received a &#x27;defensive briefing&#x27; in 2015 when a foreign government tried to influence her campaign through a campaign associate. Trump&#x27;s campaign never got one, instead FBI ordered an investigation on the flimsies grounds and outright lies to the FISA courts (and what turned out to be opo-research funded by the Hillary campaign and promulgating <i>actual</i> Russian disinformation)..<p>And then the next four years had Hillary going around saying explicitly that Trump is not a legitimate president - a claim not challenged by media and echoed by the Democrats. The media itself kept pushing the discredit Steele dossier throughout that time. So I do roll my eyes when political activists in the Democratic party and media are now all about &#x27;election integrity&#x27; after what they did to the trust in the system over the last 4 years. And I&#x27;m not really worried about Trump bitching on Twitter and putting out lawsuits (as is his right), as some threat to Democracy.')
