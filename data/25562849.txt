Namely, a scientific study. I imagine an environment like repl.it, with just a simple text editor, and some problem description and a set of compressive tests that serve as a spec. Then we measure time to produce a solution and number times the solution makes the tests fail (bugs). With enough people doing this, and in enough languages, we might be able to reach some conclusions. Until then, we will be stuck in the dark.')
