I would guess I would have to go into my profile and find it there, but I&#x27;ve never seen it mentioned by youtube.<p>Edit: Also, I think many are jaded by cable where you pay and still get ads. Hulu has an ad-free tier, but I forget the history and if that&#x27;s existed from the start. I do remember there being a lot of outrage about paying and still getting ads at some point.')
