Creativity blooms when you don’t have little nitpicks stealing your time. Winter snow takes a huge toll on productivity. Not to mention the time suck of travel time, salted roads, leaking roofs, heating costs.<p>And I can tell you exactly how it works..because I farm, this is my religion. 8 months of three glorious seasons without a single drop of rain AND no drought. It’s a miracle. In the farming universe, this is heaven. This is why CA is the golden state.<p>While many do complain about the cost of living in California, it is high only because we subsidize a very fat chunk of people who can’t afford to live in the golden state. Our population is 40 million. (For comparison Canada is 20..NZ is 5, Sweden is 10, India is 1300 China is 1400)<p>A very small percentage of California takes care of almost most of the service sector and public sector and pensions and public school system through property taxes. It is the high cost of living here that ploughs money back into the economy to create capital and more businesses and more building and new roads.<p>A city prospers when it has economic churn. We did it for the region and to a less impressive extent, for the whole state. When everything is still and stable, there will be no economic prosperity. This is the basis for why capitalism works to rise millions out of poverty. Even in quasi non capitalistic economies.it is the difference between Russia and China.<p>Winter freezes all churn. We all know how much sunlight has an effect on humans and productivity. With both physical and mental activities. This is nothing to sneeze at..<p>Back to California, when the supported 99% has been encouraged to be spiteful and ungrateful to the golden goose of tech SV that was the 1%, the downside of this is going to be painful to watch. All the public school socialism taught by unionized teachers to weaponise entire generations is going to backfire.<p>The majority of the creme de la creme of SV were mostly educated OUTSIDE of California public education system. What does that tell us? I wish someone would do a study of that at UC. California SV benefitted from reverse brain drain. What does it say about our public school system? When kids are talking about privilege and colonization, that’s fine. I guess that’s an education too. But that is not going to pay the unfunded pension liabilities of their teachers’  Union.<p>California has been conspired against and murdered. This demise will be longer lasting than most.')
