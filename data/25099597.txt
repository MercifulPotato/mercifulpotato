I think the difference is compassion.<p>- it takes me hours to get out of bed but that&#x27;s ok, I have loads of time during lockdown.<p>- I spend hours daily scrolling through HN and reddit but that&#x27;s ok, it&#x27;s good to switch off for a bit.<p>- I can only productively work 1-2 hours per day but that&#x27;s ok, most people I ask is doing the same and that&#x27;s probably all I ever achieved with the distractions of the office.<p>I hope this can help reframe things for others.')
