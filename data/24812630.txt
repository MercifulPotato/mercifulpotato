There&#x27;s no guarantee that AMD&#x27;s and NVidia&#x27;s power-draw functions are calibrated against each other.<p>With that being said, its cool to see that MI50 is competitive against A100 in scientific compute. Both A100 and MI50 are on TSMC&#x27;s 7nm node, so that is a pure architecture vs architecture competition.')
