There&#x27;s no guarantee that AMD&#x27;s and NVidia&#x27;s power-draw functions are calibrated against each other.<p>With that being said, its cool to see that MI50 is competitive against A100 in scientific compute. Both A100 and MI50 are on TSMC&#x27;s 7nm node, so that is a pure architecture vs architecture competition.<p>-------<p>ROCm is definitely less stable and has fewer features than CUDA. However, since so much code is in CUDA, its good for AMD to provide a porting framework to their GPUs.<p>In my experience, the hardest thing about ROCm is the lowered expectation compared to NVidia GPUs. In particular, AMD only supports a select number of chips on ROCm, mostly coinciding with AMD&#x27;s &quot;MI&quot; line of cards.<p>Fiji, Polaris, Vega, and Vega 7nm (aka: Rx Fury, Rx 580, and Vega64 &#x2F; Radeon VII). As soon as you deviate from these cards and use say a 5700 XT, ROCm compatibility plummets and you start seeing issues.<p>In contrast, NVidia supports even a low-end 1660 pretty well. Fortunately, the RX 580 has dropped down to nearly the price of a 1660, but if you make the mistake of buying a 550 instead (or a 5500 XT), things suddenly suck.<p>With enough research, a computer builder can get an RX 580 and build out a cheap dev-box for ROCm. But this &quot;trap&quot; of not supporting all hardware has probably made AMD lose a few customers.<p>------<p>With that being said, it seems like Flops-for-flop, the AMD cards offer superior price&#x2F;performance. MI50 is very similar to Radeon VII (MI50 simply has the card-to-card communications as well as full-speed double-precision). As such, you can get an MI50-like performance with a $700 Radeon VII (so long as you don&#x27;t care about double-precision).<p>AMD is upfront about which GPUs they support (&quot;The MI-line&quot;). They however need to be more clear on the consumer-cards that match the MI-line, and show sample computer builds for the hobbyist community.')
