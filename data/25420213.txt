However, as the article mentions, today it is not available at low cost.<p>None of this technology is exotic (as in requiring exotic materials or manufacturing processes).  It doesn&#x27;t need to be expensive.  Even the labor for installing it in isn&#x27;t uncommon - air sealing is a DIY project if one is OK with a bit of hard work.<p>In the US at least, many industries providing these building measures have however reached a kind of equilibrium where they mostly sell it to people of higher means, which makes the global impact of home energy efficiency minimal.  Other developed countries - mostly in N Europe - have started putting these into their building codes.<p>To have any impact, home energy efficiency needs to reach critical mass in the public consciousness, and for that, the public need to start looking at their homes the way that many have started to look at their low MPG ICE vehicles, and demanding higher efficiency both from the private home building market and from regulatory institutions.')
