I guess if you activate the subscription when it runs low, it will send a new cartridge straight away. This probably also works with a real card number if you just cancel the subscription before it starts charging.<p>I&#x27;d assume that only works once per printer - or at least it&#x27;s enough of a pain to repeat it that most people would rather pay. The smallest subscription plans are pretty cheap.')
