At 20% annual amortization, $0.15&#x2F;kWh and 10k different validators (people), the total cost of running eth2 is... $1.3M. That&#x27;s a mind-boggling difference of 4700x.<p>Real costs may be a bit larger as some individual stakers can be less efficient (like running on a 150W average power pc) but compared to what bitcoin consumes - still a rounding error.')
