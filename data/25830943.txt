Including the option to deny anything happened everywhere. To avoid and&#x2F;or dealing with counceling (or God forbid, CPS. There&#x27;s plenty of children and adults who are terrified of dealing with any official at all because of their experiences with CPS. They, frankly, have good reason). That&#x27;s the requirement that I think this private rape kit does better than the official one.')
