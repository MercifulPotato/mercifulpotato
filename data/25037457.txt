If someone tells you from birth that Group X is inherently pure evil and that anyone who denies or doubts this is either woefully na√Øve or in the pay of Group X, you have no chance to survive without becoming Anti-Group X, regardless of what the real evidence about Group X is: You&#x27;ll reject all evidence, destroy all relationships which might lead you to that evidence, and count yourself lucky that no Group X members can get close enough to you to infect you with their lies and various forms of evil.<p>&gt; In fact, we should be very suspicious when all Scientist agree (you know, when the Science has been &quot;settled&quot;).<p>OK, all scientists agree that the Earth isn&#x27;t a flat disk being carried on the back of a tortiose.<p>&gt; As for motives and integrity, the word of a Scientist has become too much of a powerful political force these days.<p>Who?
