The US was left intact.<p>For many years, the US was #1 in exports, #1 in manufacturing, and most importantly, the Bretton Woods system was in place.<p>Under Bretton Woods, the US was effectively able to create money from thin air. The premise was that each dollar was backed with gold, and you could at any time redeem the gold equivalent to your dollars. However, because that right was never exercised and nobody could audit the gold reserves, the US abused the system and by 1971 it became clear that   it was a fraud.<p>By 1971, Europe and Japan were done rebuilding their economies and now their manufacturing capabilities surpassed the that of the US. So countries like France take the initiative and challenge the US to give them their gold, and when the US fails to meet these obligations, the Bretton Woods system ends, also putting an end to the American economic golden age.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exorbitant_privilege" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exorbitant_privilege</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nixon_shock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nixon_shock</a><p>Since the Nixon shock, US living standards have started becoming similar to that of other countries, the cost of living has been raising and the US has been accumulating an enormous amount of debt.<p>Think about it: during the 1940s to the 1970s, the Interstate highway system was built, there were expensive Space exploration programs, millions of Americans had affordable housing, higher education... everything was affordable. And suddenly nothing is affordable anymore. And that is the reason.')
