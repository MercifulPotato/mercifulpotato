Claiming to run my ads on the New York Times and instead running them small blogs would fraud.<p>On the other hand, if I chose to run my ads for wedding dresses on ESPN.com, they would be very effective (they&#x27;d have a lot of waste), but that&#x27;s not really fraud.  <i>I</i> made a bad decision.<p>I read the Uber comments as 2&#x2F;3rds of their spend was waste, not fraud.  That still seems a surprisingly high number, although I wonder how much of it was upper- or mid-funnel, which is notoriously harder to measure.')
