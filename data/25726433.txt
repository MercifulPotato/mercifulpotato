The <i>connector</i>, on the other hand, has two CC pins (one of which is connected to the CC wire, and the other is not) and two pairs of power&#x2F;ground. It also has a few other things - a pair of wires for weird low speed uses (SBU) and an additional pin for supplying power to the cable in case the cable itself has a chip in it.')
