Item(by='arendtio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610216137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='new-hacker-tab.com<p>Motivation: I wanted to have a new-tab page for my browser that show things that are actually useful for me like a few links, a weather forecast, best-HN and a notepad to dump some information.<p>So I built a website, which lets you edit its own code <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new-hacker-tab.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new-hacker-tab.com</a><p>How-To: In the <i>bottom-right side is a button</i> which opens an editor, to edit the page. The result is stored in the localStorage of the browser. I use that page every day and have different versions for work and spare time. If you messed up, just delete the localStorage of that domain.<p>Half-Baked: I would like to add sharing features, so when I have built a very nice widget&#x2F;page, others can use it too, but so far the import&#x2F;export functionality is all there is.')
