Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602824878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24797605, text='That&#x27;s a great idea, and I think if private individuals (either businesses or open-source hackers or whoever) want to do that, they should!<p>But I think if private individuals (again, including business) don&#x27;t want to do that, they shouldn&#x27;t be compelled to! No law makes an email provider use SMTP; they do it because the industry &#x2F; the market has settled on it.<p>(Imagine if nobody could use STARTTLS until it got approved by the government!)<p>Twitter is running a <i>product</i>, which includes broadcast communication as a component, yes, but also includes lots of other components: the idea that the product is structured as short messages with &quot;retweets&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; (distinct from Facebook, Tumblr, Reddit, email, etc.), limitations on message size, the idea of &quot;Verified&quot; and the choice of whom to verify, the discovery page and curation, showing &quot;Who to follow&quot; and curation of that, the data model of threading, the whole concept of hashtags, a &quot;Home&quot; view where the timeline goes sideways, images and video and audio and alt text and link previews, encrypting traffic to their site, not encrypting DMs, etc. And part of their product is determining what their rules are about what&#x27;s on-topic and what&#x27;s off-topic (whether you count it as spam or as harassment or as whatever else).<p>Absent a compelling reason otherwise, I don&#x27;t think the government should be in charge of any of those decisions. I don&#x27;t agree with all of those, and I certainly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible for them to make better-in-my-opinion decisions. But that&#x27;s not for me to decide, nor is it for the FCC to decide.<p>Come to think of it, that&#x27;s probably the underlying principle behind the US (and many other countries&#x27;) political philosophy: the default is that choices are in the hands of individuals, including groups of individuals who make a company, and the government overriding that is an exceptional case that requires a strong justification. It&#x27;s not the only model - monarchies and authoritarian states follow the approach that everything is in the hands of the ruler &#x2F; the party, and liberty is granted as an exception when there&#x27;s an argument for it.')
