That&#x27;s the energy from 0V to 1V.  Each incremental volt stores more power than the last.  0V-3V is 9x that amount, and 0V-4V is 16x that amount, so 3V-4V is 7x that amount, and you&#x27;ll need 140mF.<p>But also it shouldn&#x27;t be connected directly in parallel to the battery; so I&#x27;d think of it more as 4.2V to 2V of supply.  That would mean you need 74mF.<p>So put in two and you&#x27;ll more than hit the target.<p>Even better, if you expect the battery to contribute <i>some</i>, you only need the one.')
