That product (which also supports Wireguard, yay!) is available worldwide for €5&#x2F;month. You can even pay by &quot;anonymized identifier string and cash in an envelope&quot; if you are so inclined.<p>Come on, Mozilla – just keep on making the world&#x27;s best browser (and the world&#x27;s last <i>free</i> browser). Stop paying your CEO millions. Stop making bookmarking services. Stop reselling VPN services. Just act as a shovel for money to go into the pockets of talented browser developers!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mullvad.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>')
