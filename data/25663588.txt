Just a high-five.<p>I use IP geolocation and display the country of your co-high-fiver as a minimal kind of framing that it is indeed another person that is interacting with you.<p>I actually managed to get it to around 100k unique visitors in around 10h and a constant ~800 concurrent users, with very positive feedback on reddit.<p>It&#x27;s implemented with websockets using Crystal + Kemal as a backend.<p>I will not be monetizing this in any way, and I will not be adding any new features.<p>I think it turned out pretty great, so I&#x27;m showing it off here - for some light-hearted fun.<p>Oh, and sound on for optimal experience!')
