Shouldn&#x27;t the advise be to meet without microphones of any kind, if you&#x27;re really that paranoid? And of course, I would expect that online conferences are right out - especially useful advice in the times of Covid19.<p>Unless this is advice for state-level institutions discussing state secrets, this seems like completely useless advice, the kind that gives security people a bad name.
