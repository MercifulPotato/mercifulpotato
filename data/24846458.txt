On the other hand, you can usually infer the result types of expressions by a simple forward process.</i><p>Possibly unpopular opinion: I am wary of relying on type inference for return types, other than for a function defined locally where you can easily see the implementation at the same time as the code calling it. Code like<p><pre><code>    auto x = calculate_some_complicated_thing()\n    ...\n    do_something_with(x)\n</code></pre>\nhas a similar obscurity problem to code like<p><pre><code>    do_something_impressive(true, false, false, true)\n</code></pre>\nin that to understand what the code is doing at this level, you have to read the interface documentation for the function you’re calling anyway, and then you’re hoping that you get everything in the right place because your tools might not be able to warn you if you don’t.')
