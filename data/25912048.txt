Mostly they are being watched so much because people find them entertaining. But they are danger to society and democracy. The lies they spew are the reason they been banned both from Murdoch home Australia, and Great Britain. I find it especially funny to watch Sean Insanity, Fucker Calrson, Lara Inbreed and Mark Lenin; they all just opinion-makers, its just happen to be extremely shitty but funny opinion.')
