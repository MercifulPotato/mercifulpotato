You have faith in elections, good. We need to demonstrate election security to people who do not share your faith.<p>&gt; Even so, the peaceful transition of power is more important than any particular mechanism.<p>I think that making sure anyone in power is actually legitimate is probably more important than that.<p>&gt; If any of the parties involved would like to raise a court case actually alleging fraud (which is why the cases have been dismissed<p>Many were dismissed for procedural grounds or lack of standing; additionally proving fraud requires proving intent, which is not easy.<p>&gt; because they failed to do so, and anything short of this would have no remedy<p>Thats another problem, one shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the state of mind of a hostile party in order to demonstrate that an election was corrupted.<p>&gt; an investigation would be in order.<p>There are open investigations. Despite this, some people insist that we coronate their preferred candidate without seeing what law enforcement is able to discover.<p>&gt; So what, exactly, is the problem here? It seems like you&#x27;re raising concerns of things that could have happened, without any actual weight behind them that they did happen. It&#x27;s meaningless.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re asking. There&#x27;s a video of poll workers counting ballots that had been hidden under a table until all the R observers had left. No one has presented a chain of custody for those ballots. The people who may have stuffed the ballot box with questionable ballots say they didn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s an open investigation, so they won&#x27;t release any evidence that would show that these ballots are legitimate (assuming they would even be able to prove that); but that doesn&#x27;t stop the investigator from making a sworn statement that nothing happened; naturally there was no supporting evidence.<p>&gt; without any actual weight behind them that they did happen<p>I&#x27;m saying it happened and its on video. I don&#x27;t think the excuse &quot;ballot stuffing is how we normally win elections&quot; is going to de-escalate the situation.')
