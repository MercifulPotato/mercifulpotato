After some of my wife&#x27;s customers directly experienced some serious WTF behaviour on Yelp&#x27;s part, our trust in it was, as you said, completely broken.<p>I&#x27;m not at all surprised that Glassdoor is playing similar games.<p>The following isn&#x27;t necessarily meant to disagree with you.<p>A common thread is that Yelp and Glassdoor directly make money based on their reviews.  That&#x27;s their core product.  Other comments about how trust should be a core product are relevant, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be what&#x27;s happening.<p>My wife and I started using Google reviews.  To be clear: we are by no means starry-eyed Google fans.  We&#x27;re quite aware of many their problems and WTFisms.<p>In this case, though, unless I&#x27;m mistaken, Google reviews are at most very indirectly a product for them.<p>This is important, because in my mind, that makes it far less likely for them to meaningfully&#x2F;substantively fuck around with the results.<p>It would be easy (and perhaps fun!) for me and anyone else reading this to inject doubt into this assertion.<p>I&#x27;m happily open to additional illumination here, particularly as far as a practical daily use review system.')
