I mostly wrote this article as a way to get an idea out of my head rather than present it as a thesis on the topic. I am not a philosopher, but a physicist by profession, so I apologize for my lack of correct terminology to explain the topic correctly.<p>I do enjoy reading philosophy but there is very little in terms of &quot;philosophy of programming&quot; in order to have a common language to talk about. I could either go full mathematical and most people will not know what I am talking about, or go full example based, but then lose the essence of the problem.<p>What I wanted to say is that ownership semantics can only deal with &quot;linear&quot; problems whilst most problems are &quot;non-linear&quot; in nature. And that designing an entire language around this idea to ensure &quot;safety&quot;, especially without it being &quot;proven&quot; in a smaller language, is&#x2F;was very risky and dodgy.<p>I also wanted to explain the mentality that many (not all) people have with regards to ownership semantics and how it regards to a certain concept of &quot;agency&quot;, and how it is related (not the same) as the OOP mentality.<p>P.S. The original commenter is confused about my views, and made mistakes about what I stated. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24999902" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24999902</a>')
