Item(by='cycloptic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608225532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25456854, text='&gt;Lets say my time is billed at about $50&#x2F;month, which is low for a software engineer. Now lets say a Linux desktop&#x2F;laptop requires 5 hours of system admin time per month to troubleshoot drivers, upgrades, etc. That means a Linux desktop&#x2F;laptop costs $250&#x2F;month. For that price I could buy a new Mac every 10-12 months. I have a Mac right now and spend less than 30 minutes per month futzing around with it, so it&#x27;s far cheaper.<p>Or you can just buy from a GNU and&#x2F;or Linux vendor that supports their own hardware and distro and get the same benefits. (System76, Purism, etc)<p>&gt;Telling busier, poorer, or older people with families they should set up their own servers or run their own Linux systems is sort of a &quot;why do they not eat cake?&quot; attitude.<p>Why? When it comes to servers the actual alternative there is either telling them to buy a Windows server, or start paying cloud providers, neither of which really have a lower money&#x2F;time investment in all cases when you get into it. This is assuming that the reason someone wants to have their own server is to have a home business. (And if you&#x27;re on the cloud there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll end up running Linux there anyway)')
