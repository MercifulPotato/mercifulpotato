Since Thursday morning I&#x27;ve been averaging about 4 hours of moderating a day just going through the moderation queue. I&#x27;ve personally banned hundreds of brand new&#x2F;never before used accounts that only have post histories in subs related to this &#x27;movement&#x27; and then come over to us to spam crap.<p>This morning I woke up and approved&#x2F;removed posts in the queue for 39 minutes to empty it out. Went to the toilet and came back to 70 something new ones.<p>The sheer amount of blatant bot&#x2F;disingenuous accounts spamming our sub for this &#x27;movement&#x27; is insane. You&#x27;d think if they were going to spam the crap out of our sub with their nonsense, they&#x27;d at least buy me a cup of diet coke.<p><i>sigh</i> I hope this ends soon.')
