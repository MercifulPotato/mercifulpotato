I don&#x27;t think anyone is advocating using LiDAR for detection. It is used to accurately model depth and then localize the vehicle and surrounding objects&#x2F;vehicles. The &quot;floating&quot; phenomenon you&#x27;re talking about is noise from the computation method(s) Tesla uses to build a composite 3D model. You can fix that with LiDAR. I&#x27;d wager this noise gets worse in some circumstances. You can try to fix it by piling on noise reduction methods, but at a certain point, one has to wonder when it becomes obvious that an extra $X&#x2F;vehicle to make the problem go away forever makes sense, where X is a monotonically decreasing value that&#x27;ll probably get down to ~$200 with scale&#x2F;R&amp;D.')
