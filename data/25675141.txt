No secret Big Tech has been spending Billions trying to influence this election.<p>With that said.<p>DCPD failed to inform FPS\\SS of the protesters breaking through 5 barricades and into a building designed to withstand seige until the protesters were almost in the chambers forcing them to flee.  The factual narrative here is there was a compromise of congressional security and trust in DCPD.<p>How we end up, instead, getting the hyper-critical over-the-top insurrection narrative from every MSM company and all the heavy-handed fallout of that narrative without even evidence of busted doors I just don&#x27;t know, but 4 dead and a handfull injured doesn&#x27;t even amount to a weekend in Chicago.<p>Nobody is buying this narrative.')
