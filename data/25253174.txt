Any software build has to consider dev-time vs software-size, but I think the reason NPM is so popular for apps is <i>not</i> because it truly saves time, but because it uses existing web-dev technology, which ultimately means the technology is used in a context it wasn&#x27;t designed for (and a lot of it was janky design-by-committee stuff even then) and various tricks&#x2F;hacks&#x2F;magic&#x2F;shims are used to make it work.<p>Hopefully there are moves towards more WebASM in the future? But that still requires sane frameworks, or even better - libraries.')
