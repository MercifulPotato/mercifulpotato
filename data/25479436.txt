Wearing a mask or not is a binary decision, when people ask if they should wear masks of someone in that role they reasonably expect a binary answer of what they should do and at any given time he took his best shot at answering that question.<p>What he said in March was that he didn&#x27;t believe there was any reason for most fo the public to wear a mask, that&#x27;s because he didn&#x27;t have any evidence that it was effective at that time. Evidence is a reason, absence of evidence is not a reason for action. This is very simple. I happen to have thought even at the time that we should be wearing masks, but that was just an opinion and at that time the opposite opinion was also reasonable. We were still working things out.<p>Accusing him of lying in service of some conspiracy theory really is going too far.')
