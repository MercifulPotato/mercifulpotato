You can install e.g. Ubuntu or Mint without knowing what a disk partition is.  You need to have at least some vague idea of what a disk partition is to install NixOS.<p>It&#x27;s much easier than most manually-configured installs (e.g. gentoo) though, because pretty much everything other than partitioning the disks has a default, so you need to make fewer decisions at install time.')
