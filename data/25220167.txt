You can be as good and as thorough as you want, but if the root of the problem is that software is seen as a cost not as an integral part of the solution, you get bad results.<p>This often starts with unclear&#x2F;vague requirements that change every other day as new information and understanding is gained.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t stop there - unrealistic deadlines, lack of defined processes and quality control as well as disregard (and refusal to budget and schedule) for background tasks (documentation, refactoring, ...) are also contributing factors that can turn even the best and most diligent software developer into a messy code cowboy.<p>If gaming the system is rewarded more or actually doing a good job is even penalised, why do a good job?')
