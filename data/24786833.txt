Item(by='skinkestek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602756413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782127, text='I do the same:<p>In my tax report I think my house is valued at 400 000 NOK.<p>When I talk to the bank it will probably be worth 4 200 000 NOK.<p>Tax authorities here know as banks update them every year.<p>Also in accounting it is common. I remember asking my teacher about it when we had basic accounting and it is simple:  if you depreciate (?) an item to less than it is worth you just have to report a profit when you sell a &quot;worthless&quot; asset. (I&#x27;m not an accountant and English is not my first language but I think it should be possible to understand.)')
