I know that the G++ developers are trying to keep things compatible but i&#x27;m not sure of the C++ designers care that much.<p>The Itanium C++ ABI is the stable ABI on Linux, and the C++ standards committee (along with those who maintain the Itanium ABI) cares <i>very</i> much about not breaking the ABI. For example, the C++ committee is not able to make any ABI-breaking changes to the standard library, even where it would be advisable.')
