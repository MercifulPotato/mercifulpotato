I thought...crap, is there evidence what we are doing is harmful? We&#x27;re consulting with neurologists, so I would have been surprised, as they have brought up some potential issues we need to test for with what we are doing.<p>Here&#x27;s very early evidence of the positive effect our technology is having. This is early evidence of auditory stimulation having positive effect on sleep. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;z4vqS3w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;z4vqS3w</a> This is from my Oura tracker (so we have a 3rd party monitoring) and over 8 nights. Yes, there is potential placebo effect here, and the first 4 nights I slept better than I usually do. We are preparing for a more robust study.<p>If you&#x27;re keen to find out more about what we&#x27;re building, check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundmind.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundmind.co</a> and sign-up to get on the waitlist.<p>I&#x27;ll be writing a blog post of our early findings shortly.')
