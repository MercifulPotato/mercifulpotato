I&#x27;ve been programming for over 20 years now and in that time I&#x27;ve explored a lot of corners of software development and computers in general.<p>I started with C&#x2F;C++ and wrote games and played around with game engines. I learned PHP and SQL to generate basic &quot;dynamic&quot; sites. I learned Python and wrote commandline tools and Qt applications. Moved to Flask&#x2F;Django to create websites and extended my knowledge with JS, React, and learned how to set up servers. I played around with security, reverse engineering, exploit development, web hacking, and malware analysis. I&#x27;m learning Elixir now. I&#x27;ve dicked around with arduinos, raspis, and simple circuitry. I&#x27;ve put in place devops processes and tools where I work. I dabbled with image processing, VR, and interactive experiences. Yet I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself particularly knowledgeable in any one of those things.<p>There&#x27;s people who find their niche and they learn more about it each day and never tire of it, but I can&#x27;t seem to find that thing myself. At work I often do a number of different things, so again, I&#x27;m not solely focused on one thing.<p>The biggest issue is that it makes looking for work difficult as I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m an expert in say micro services, or I&#x27;m a React pro, nor that I am an expert Python developer.<p>Apart from saying you&#x27;re a &quot;generalist&quot;, how do you best sell yourself when you don&#x27;t have a specialisation or a specific area you are focused on?')
