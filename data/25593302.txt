Absolutely. Are there an equal number?  Not even close. Is the ratio of tech to non tech in the ATX area the same as the bay area?  Probably not but it&#x27;s growing. More and more of the people I&#x27;ve met here are in tech. This has continued to go up as more subdivisions are completed. The new tax laws that screwed over CA residents have definitely increased the number of CA migrants, as has the the increase in remote work from COVID. We have fast internet, no state tax and cheaper property. (What you get for half million here vs CA is amazing and it&#x27;s nowhere near as nice as it was just five years ago).<p>Added bonus and what nobody here will tell you (and TX natives don&#x27;t see) is that the Hill Country is absolutely beautiful. I was shocked when I moves here. I didn&#x27;t know it but it&#x27;s a huge wedding destination because it&#x27;s so pretty. (Being in CA leaves an ignorant taste in your mouth about TX).<p>So no, it&#x27;s not the bay area and we don&#x27;t have parity right noq. As a bay area native, I would never go back. (Full disclosure: TX will get better than it is now but not that I&#x27;m a parent of a toddler, we&#x27;re probably leaving and headed to New England. That&#x27;s a discussion for a different topic though.)')
