And that even though we could have better tools, we&#x27;re constantly hitting local Nash equilibrium where it doesn&#x27;t make sense to adopt them. Which means that your &quot;cartel&quot; is just the real world itself.<p>We might not like it, it may suck, but it is what it is - you don&#x27;t wanna fight things like gravity, you have to build ugly and bulky flying machines until one day you have a teleport which will be so far ahead that you can throw away all your planes and airports on a whim. But until then the planes is your best bet.<p>&gt; Agriculture is an &quot;anti-productivity cartel&quot;<p>This is a very good example, and again it&#x27;s in line with the headline article. Modern agriculture is the product of the same pressure to the system: there is no way you can scrape existing process and rebuild it with better technologies from the ground-up, because you&#x27;ll starve billions to death in the process. Also in this case nobody is optimizing for the parameters those solutions are better at than existing methods, so there we have it.<p>&gt; How is it possible that millions of refrigerators have doors rather than drawers<p>Mine has drawers in the freezer [1] - it&#x27;s very neat indeed, and it&#x27;s also an incremental thing because the main fridge area (don&#x27;t know the English word for it) is still a single door. But again, there are real world reasons it&#x27;s done this way, most of all being it&#x27;s just more convenient this way and your regular household doesn&#x27;t care for extra $5 it&#x27;ll spend on the extra cooling. Meaning, it lies in the nature of the system consumer - the humans.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcgrp.ru&#x2F;images&#x2F;1199961&#x2F;2329042.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcgrp.ru&#x2F;images&#x2F;1199961&#x2F;2329042.jpg</a>')
