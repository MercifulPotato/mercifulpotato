Global warming could just be rhetoric to convince those people who can see the injustice of what&#x27;s happening to justify why it needs to happen in this unjust way.<p>It&#x27;s a way to justify why we should all be playing the game of musical chairs instead of the game of &#x27;make more chairs&#x27; or even &#x27;make more chairs, but each person should only have one chair&#x27;.<p>It all stinks like corruption. If you really wanted to solve global warming, the best solution would be to limit population growth, you could just give people tax incentives to have fewer children. Could be implemented as UBI: You get less basic income if you have more children. That is a much simpler and fairer solution and doesn&#x27;t require deceiving billions of people with an epic global monetary ponzi scheme. Also we could get rid of useless bureaucratic jobs which are making the lives of billions of people miserable.')
