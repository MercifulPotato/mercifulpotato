That makes the motivations seem like they are economic in nature, not driven by medical motivations.<p>2) It isn&#x27;t clear to me that these doctors are experts on coronavirus. Only one is mentioned as currently practicing. As I understand it, death isn&#x27;t the only negative consequence associated with coronavirus. Their declaration seems to ignore this and only seems to be based on a meta-analysis of death rates.<p>3) We do not currently have a lockdown. We have some restrictions in place. Their declaration is not just against lockdowns, it&#x27;s against gathering restrictions, masks, etc.')
