Deploying a Mac EC2 instance is just adding another target. Whereas deploying to another provider is an unknown amount of work to integrate with their API (if they even have one). The wall-time cost of people&#x27;s time and effort vastly outweighs the marginal savings you&#x27;d get by going with a low-cost provider.')
