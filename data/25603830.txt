Item(by='sumthinprofound', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609514526, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602155, text='This happened to a friend of mine who is a restaurant owner.  One day he gets a call for take out, for &quot;Jeff&quot; lets say $60.  A DoorDash courier shows up (nothing indicating they are from DoorDash, restaurant assumes this is the customer) and attempts to pay with a credit card.  Credit card comes back declined.  Courier mentions he&#x27;s going to step outside to get the issue resolved and will be right back.  Half an hour goes by, another call comes in for the exact same order, $60.  Another courier comes in, acts like he placed the order, tries to pay with a similar looking credit card, gets declined. 2nd courier leaves without the food. The owner thinks its some time of scam.  When the <i>third</i> exact same order comes in via phone, the owner starts asking questions.  All three were for the same DoorDash customer, all called in on the phone by DoorDash assuming the identity of the customer who placed the order via the DoorDash website using a menu that DoorDash just found online and posted on their website.  It was an outdated menu with outdated prices.  Apparently DoorDash would load their credit cards with the exact amount for the purchase (based on outdated prices) so both couriers cards were declined for the purchases.  Meanwhile, the actual customer is waiting over an hour and a half for their order to be delivered and the restaurant owner has to eat 2 $60 sales because the food is no longer presentable.  Owner was never contacted in advance by DoorDash regarding any business relationship, they just found a menu and included it on their site.  Ultimately I believe they covered the cost of their screwup, and the restaurant owner required they pay over the phone when calling in the order before any food was made.  I would absolutely consider this exploiting the restaurant brand and reputation without consent.')
