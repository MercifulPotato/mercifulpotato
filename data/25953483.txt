Item(by='jcrawfordor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611891026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950592, text='There&#x27;s a bit of a cult classic book, &quot;Pocket Ref&quot; by Thomas Glover, and its big brother &quot;Desk Ref.&quot; They&#x27;re just books that attempt to provide reference tables for most of the things you&#x27;d need to look up throughout a wide variety of technical fields, but especially mechanical trades. A random selection of the contents includes &quot;Densities of Gases,&quot; &quot;Plywood &amp; Panel Grading,&quot; &quot;Canada &amp; Mexico Postal Abbreviations &amp; Capitals,&quot; &quot;Solid Figure Formulas,&quot; &quot;Commonly Available Pumps,&quot; &quot;Welding Electrode Amperages,&quot; etc. Sort of a monument to what&#x27;s possible in a reference work, and cheap insurance to throw in your toolkit or vehicle if you do any kind of field work for when there&#x27;s no cell coverage.<p>I also have a book of mathematical tables, mostly for historic interest, but I think there&#x27;s also some value in working from trig or log tables as I find looking at the table a few times helps you develop an intuition for estimating the function a lot faster than the attempts some textbooks make.')
