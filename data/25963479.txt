A DHTs can perform this without a centralized discovery service.  Bit torrent for instance uses this, and clients can trade peers <i>without</i> being on the DHT.<p>Additionally there&#x27;s so many bittorrent clients that there&#x27;s millions of machines in the DHT and even a brute force search of IPv4 is&#x27;t going to take long to find one of the millions, which will happily give you dozens of other peers.<p>So sure many clients include a bootstrap server for the DHT, but that&#x27;s needed once and you can skip that if you are willing scan a few 1000 hosts for a client.<p>I&#x27;ve pondered writing a DHT based client for signal like functionality (sync messages, async messages, and resistance to traffic analysis), I don&#x27;t see any technical blockers.  I get why signal is centralized and does have some attractive features that would be hard to match with a p2p setup.  In particular quick startups, low message latency, and battery&#x2F;network efficiency.  With that said I think a p2p e2e chat client is quite feasible.<p>What would make it MUCH more feasible is people started buying wallwart arm systems (more common years ago), or raspberry Pis and ran a p2p client as a service so that clients in the home could leverage the service for email, chat, file transfers, etc.')
