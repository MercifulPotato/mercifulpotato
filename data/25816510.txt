I’m a bit of an ignoramus when it comes to what makes people get upset, but given the current climate of fear, I’ll just chalk it up to that.<p>Would greatly appreciate a moderator taking a moment to explain to me the nuances, but again, given the current climate, I’ll avoid posting anything security related.')
