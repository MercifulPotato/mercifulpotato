A user-mode cache with direct I&#x2F;O can outperform <i>any</i> kernel-mode design several-fold. That&#x27;s empirical fact, and the reason all high-performance database engines do it. I&#x27;ve designed systems both ways and it isn&#x27;t particularly close; the technical reasons why are well-understood. Typical direct I&#x2F;O designs enable macro-optimizations that are either not practical or not possible with mmap().<p>The main advantage of mmap() is portability.')
