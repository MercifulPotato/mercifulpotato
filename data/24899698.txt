Does this put most US citizens on par with Nazis who gassed and experimented on Jewish people? No. It does not. Americans did it out of fear, not out of evil.<p>There is a huge difference here. When you say genocide, it is equivalent to holocaust. When you say concentration camp it&#x27;s equivalent to gitmo at worst or the japanese concentration camps. Both could be happening but one is drastically worse than the other and genocide needs confirmation.')
