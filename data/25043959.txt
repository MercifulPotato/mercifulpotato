I think another angle, is to first create a virtual analog of a workplace, but then since it&#x27;s virtual, it&#x27;s super flexible and easy to experiment with. I think there&#x27;s only so far you can get with these questions, off reasoning alone.<p>Another example of a project I worked on, which was similar, was this VR office: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siemprecollective.com&#x2F;vr.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siemprecollective.com&#x2F;vr.html</a> . We basically made a one-to-one mapping of our physical office in VR, and the idea was after we had that, we could play around and tweak things very easily. And actually being able to TRY these new experiments was the whole point.')
