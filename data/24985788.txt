It&#x27;s significantly harder to dismiss the other two categories of people. Whether a right or usage of that right is &quot;worth it&quot; seems to be a personal value judgement of what an individual wants society to optimize for, whereas the philosophy of freedom of speech is a complicated matter sensetive to political factors and the purported function (and actual function in the real world) of speech.')
