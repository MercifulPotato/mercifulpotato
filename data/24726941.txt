It&#x27;s informative enough to end users when a glyph is missing, and stands out for developer eyes when a web font subset doesn&#x27;t include particular characters.<p>I am a native Sinhalese (that à¶š is from it), and there aren&#x27;t enough web fonts that cover those glyphs. If the system fonts don&#x27;t cover those glyphs (Windows, Linux, and MacOS versions do, but many feature phones, treadmill browsers, etc don&#x27;t). I&#x27;d love to see this font (which appears to be only sub 500kb) instead of those ugly boxes that don&#x27;t convey any information whatsoever.')
