I&#x27;m fine with that personally, I don&#x27;t expect them to operate a totally &quot;free&quot; speech service and somehow weather all the lawsuits that brings.<p>I think this is a nice case study in how free speech inevitably conflicts with keeping majority opinions happy. The fact that they folded on freedom to get&#x2F;keep people with such thin skin so sort of tells you what their business model really is imho.<p>Cest la vie.')
