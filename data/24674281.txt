So I created an essentially empty _rebuild-trigger.tsx file and imported that in my main page template.<p>Now, to change the page content and trigger a hot-reload:<p>- I have an observable subscribed in createPagesStateful that calls deletePage and createPage\n- Then write to the file _rebuild-trigger.tsx file<p>I need to make a blog post because it works great (and I could tie it to any change source - like file system watcher - during development).')
