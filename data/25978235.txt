It&#x27;s the same with Signal and the initially poor user experience.<p>&gt; It makes <i>NO</i> sense to end-to-end encrypt a public chatroom which by definition is intended to be indexed and visible and smeared all over the wider world.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t want encryption, authentication is still good to have, so quick question: who authenticates messages when you deactivate E2EE in Matrix? In the case of a public room hosted on server S, A sends a message M1, then sends another M2. Assuming that S is not actively MITM until after the first message (so any initial key exchange can happen), can I be sure that the second message will not be tampered with?<p>IIUC a Signal group where a client would then broadcast all messages to the world would still provide such a guarantee. Is that the case as well for Matrix?')
