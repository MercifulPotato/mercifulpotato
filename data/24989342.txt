If you&#x27;re doing heroin or meth, you definitely don&#x27;t have $100 lying around for a fine, and not paying it would just land you in jail anyway. This gives people who don&#x27;t have or want to pay the fine a way to stay legal without doing so, and <i>also</i> gives someone a chance to talk to them and potentially help.<p>This seems really well thought out, however with sale still being as illegal as it was, I&#x27;m not sure crime&#x2F;danger on that side of the transaction will decrease at all.')
