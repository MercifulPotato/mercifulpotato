But to advertisers, that is the number that matters.<p>Apple customers are extra-valuable to pitch to, because they have already demonstrated that (1) price doesn&#x27;t matter to them (or they would have a different phone), (2) they are easily satisfied (or they would have a different phone), (3) they are readily manipulated (or they...), and (4) they are especially status-conscious (...).<p>All those qualities make them what business schools like to call &quot;cash cows&quot; (yes, really) that can be milked indefinitely. Apple is renting them out to Google at a high rate. Google knows that practically all iphone users would never change the search engine on their own initiative, because iphone users have been very carefully trained, over the years, to take exactly what Apple dishes out and learn to like it.<p>Apple knows that renting out their customers doesn&#x27;t cost Apple direct income, because they have already spent on everything Apple has.<p>Knowing that somebody is an Apple user, you can offer them top-drawer prices and they will pay, provided a high-status logo is attached, and feel smug about having paid it. They are buying &quot;price-signaling&quot; mojo, so they don&#x27;t demand commensurate value, and are cheap to cater to.')
