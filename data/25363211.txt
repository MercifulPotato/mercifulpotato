An early example was when Google&#x27;s search interface answered unit conversion queries using GNU Units.  They fixed a bug internally and didn&#x27;t flow the bug back upstream.  Since they weren&#x27;t distributing Units, but were only executing it as a service, their behavior was strictly conforming to the letter of the GPL.  The failure to respect the spirit of the GPL was a factor in AGPL&#x27;s development.<p>AGPL code is strictly forbidden for use inside the company now, partially because they consider private modifications to open-source software to be a competitive advantage.')
