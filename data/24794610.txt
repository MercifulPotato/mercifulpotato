Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602799120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793601, text='I think a better argument is that being on the side of forcing people to do things is being on the wrong side of history no matter the issue. People should be free to decide, of their own volition, that they want to choose to not amplify something. That&#x27;s different from being compelled to not amplify it, which is generally bad.<p>But I can think of a number of examples of censorship that history has not judged poorly:<p>- Libel and slander. If I say &quot;I used to work with &#x27;hartator and they brought in KKK flags every morning and broke the build every evening, you don&#x27;t want to hire them,&quot; it&#x27;s generally considered reasonable for you to get the government to force me to stop and also force other people not to repeat what I said.<p>- Planning crimes. If I say &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s get together tomorrow evening and murder some strangers for fun,&quot; and we start talking about how to do it, it&#x27;s generally considered reasonable for the government to consider that a crime.<p>- Trademark infringement and other fair competition laws. If I say &quot;These headphones are recommended by Apple&quot; and they&#x27;re not, or I say &quot;These apples are organic&quot; and they&#x27;re not, or I say &quot;This is an all-beef sausage&quot; and it contains pork, it&#x27;s generally considered reasonable for the government to say that I can&#x27;t keep saying that if I want to keep selling the things I&#x27;m saying them about.<p>- Employment agreements. If I say &quot;Hey, new employer, here&#x27;s a list of my old employer&#x27;s customers and here&#x27;s some of their source code,&quot; it&#x27;s generally considered reasonable for the old employer to object.<p>(There are a number of cases of compelled action that are currently not considered unreasonable - prison labor, military drafts, etc. - but I think those stand a much higher chance of being on the wrong side of history, in the long term, than any of the above.)')
