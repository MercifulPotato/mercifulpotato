Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610316351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25718443, text='&gt; I think the trouble here is that the people who best understand cast iron are probably also the least likely to care about the science of it.<p>Hmm. Perhaps. I said <i>science-based information</i> because while I find the science (chemistry, polymerization, etc) of cast iron interesting, I primarily care about the results. For example, knowing that flax oil gives the non-stickiest finish but is prone to flaking and thus high maintenance. Perhaps <i>empirical</i> would have been a better word than <i>science-based</i>. I suspect there are a fair number of people like me, who would like to know more about the trade-offs involved in different oils and maintenance procedures. But perhaps these aren&#x27;t the people who <i>best</i> understand cast iron, as you say.<p>Two things of note:<p>- The best answer in the FAQ in the top comment of this thread, <i>by FAR</i>, is #2, about heat spreading. It gives numbers and additional information (about radiating the heat) that I didn&#x27;t know before.<p>- Flax is the only oil that I understand even some of the trade-offs of using. That is a direct result of the post linked in this thread publicly making a hypothesis and providing detailed-enough steps for (some people) to reproduce its results.<p>Speaking of, as a cast iron enthusiast, would you be willing to share your experiences and&#x2F;or do some experiments to help test my hypothesis on cleaning methods, here? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25716850" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25716850</a>')
