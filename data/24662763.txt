What are they suing them for? Under what law or legal principle?<p>A maker of extensions never agrees to Facebook&#x27;s ToS in the first place, so there&#x27;s no breach of contract.<p>It would seem that only individual users could in theory be sued, though obviously Facebook would never do that because of the PR nightmare.<p>IANAL, so I&#x27;m really curious if anyone thinks Facebook could win this in court? (Regardless of whether it works by threatening to drown the extension maker in legal costs.)')
