On facebook, most of the people know each other in real life, so it seems like those sorts of feuds don&#x27;t really happen there as much.<p>There is a groups of people I can think of who occupy dramatically different idealogical spaces, and they do argue with one another, but it&#x27;s usually more in the form of giant walls of text back and forth.<p>The most &quot;dramatic&quot; thing happening in my facebook space right now is that a bunch of my friends worked on building a drive through Christmas light show (many of my friends are artists and fabricators), and then the person they built it for didn&#x27;t pay them, so they&#x27;re organizing protests.<p>Just going through my feed right now it&#x27;s:<p>Somebody posting pictures about her adventure van build.<p>Somebody posting a &quot;shop local&quot; guide for Arizona.<p>A person posting a bunch of selfies of herself.<p>Somebody asking questions about a soft egg that one of their chickens laid (in a backyard chickens group)<p>Somebody posting that she just graduated with her masters degree<p>A post in a group called &quot;let&#x27;s really argue about film&#x2F;tv&quot; about christmas movies.<p>A solicitation for donations to a charity for the homeless (its&#x27; getting cold here in Phoenix right now.  It was in the 30s last night)<p>Solicitations in a &quot;buy nothing Tempe&quot; group.<p>Ah, the first political post: the headline is: &quot;even with three Trump appointed justices on the Bench, SCOTUS Declines to Roll Back Marriage equality&quot;<p>Picture of a clock tower<p>A news article about NZ lifting covid restrictions<p>A motivational picture&#x2F;meme about self care<p>Somebody talking about fasting<p>Somebody selling their tiedyes<p>Somebody graduating nursing school<p>More backyard chickens<p>I&#x27;m trying to find something inflammatory here but honestly my entire feed is basically just this forever and ever.  People I know and am acquainted with in real life just posting about what they&#x27;re doing.  A few political posts here and there, and generally those don&#x27;t get any comments.')
