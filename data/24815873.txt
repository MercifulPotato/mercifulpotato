The solution can be reached by thinking of a synonym for &quot;plot&quot; and for something that relates to the court idea. Then you get a first reading which is still in the same context, and you can lift it to the second one[0].<p>For the &quot;meta&quot; ones, I am afraid I am not good enough to come up with an english example,  but one in italian would be\n&quot;CARIE&quot; which gets a first read talking about itself and then reinterpreting the resulting sentence[1].<p>As senkora pointed out in the sibling comment Cryptic Crosswords seem to be close enough.<p>[0] &quot;queen&#x27;s gambit&quot;<p>[1] &quot;CARI carpendo l&#x27;E&quot;, (&quot;&lt;you obtain&gt; CARI, removing E&quot;) which gets reinterpreted as &quot;CARI-car pendo-l-E&quot; (&quot;to wind-up pendulum clocks&quot;)')
