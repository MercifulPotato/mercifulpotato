One of them, in what context I forget, referred to me as the &quot;tech guy&quot;.  I thought to myself, &quot;I&#x27;m in a room full of scientists who work on gene sequencing, and I&#x27;m the tech guy?  I thought I was the least technical person in this room.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve had similar experiences with people who know the magazine industry, the custom steel door industry, the ad agency business, and several others.  They all have their own language, and they all think that I&#x27;m the tech guy, and I know I&#x27;m the only one in the room who doesn&#x27;t understand what we&#x27;re talking about. :)')
