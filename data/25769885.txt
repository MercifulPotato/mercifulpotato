From what I recall, all network filesystems have this problem, so I avoid them all.<p>The essential problem is trying to do something with an interface that it wasn&#x27;t designed for. It&#x27;s the same problem network protocols have. They can&#x27;t communicate metadata about each layer across the layers, so your HTTP protocol has no idea that it&#x27;s actually being tunneled in another HTTP protocol and that that protocol&#x27;s TCP connection just got a <i>PSH,FIN,RST</i> packet. Your file i&#x2F;o app also has no idea that you just lost a quorum, or that one section of the network just crapped out (and even if it did know, what would it do?)')
