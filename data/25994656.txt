It&#x27;s amazing how little things can make such a big difference. In your case, the index-card default size of the note subtly, but powerfully, encourages <i>smaller</i> notes. Typical new-age zettelkasten apps are still A4 sized pages, so this is a welcome change.<p>I&#x27;ll add some more pointless two cents. I use, and love, Obsidian for the following reasons. I&#x27;m a research engineer, and it supports latex equations, markdown formatting, pasting images from the clipboard, and syntax highlighting. It is also beautiful from the get go (as is your app); the line spacing is just-right, the colour scheme is pleasant, the editor and preview mode typefaces are both delightful. But, I do use it as a full-fledged note taking app.<p>In your shoes (and contrary to the spirit of the thread, I admit), I would definitely spend time getting to know to whom you&#x27;re targetting this app. Perhaps yourself, which is fair. But, for instance, it wouldn&#x27;t work for someone like me. Still, I like what you&#x27;ve done here and I wish you all the best!!')
