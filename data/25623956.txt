It could just be that during my learning stage I learned (based on example bias maybe?) that dyn is for owned values, and not just any reference. I&#x27;m sure this was never stated explicitly, but somehow that idea got lodged in my brain<p>For the String thing (really, the Deref thing), further down others weigh in with a case where it doesn&#x27;t work as expected, and then the workaround &amp;*. The latter is something that feels like it should be a non-op, yet it&#x27;s required in certain cases like this one to trigger something in the compiler. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some internal reason for this, but from the user&#x27;s perspective it&#x27;s, &quot;What does dereferencing and then re-referencing this value have to do with performing what amounts to a cast?&quot;<p>I want to emphasize that I&#x27;m not complaining just to complain, nor placing blame on any specific party. I&#x27;m just &quot;reporting a bug&quot; in my learning experience with the language, and trying to provide as much info as possible :)')
