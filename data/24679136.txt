A lot of the risk is down to extremely irresponsible use... many steps removed from the high level of medical supervision you laid out.<p>The basics are some mental preparation, a trip sitter, correct dosage and a proper set. I don&#x27;t consider psychologists the only or necessarily best guides.<p>Like all drugs (including alcohol), they can interact with preexisting susceptibilities to mental illness. Being an experience, it can also cause trauma. So can non drug experiences, like rock climbing. Dosage, set, setting &amp; preparation mitigate these a lot.<p>Psychedelics are not a danger free activity, but like most dangerous activities most of the irl dangers are from ignoring safety entirety. FWIW, I think the more normalised, discussed and non judgemental psychodelic drug culture becomes, the more responsible users tend to be.<p>..And for comparison, it&#x27;s a lot safer than many sports and hobbies.')
