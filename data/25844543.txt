In theory you could sell a $60 copy of Grand Theft Auto and then just pass that around to every person in the world. In this scenario Rockstar makes less than &lt;$60 and Gamestop would take a constant % cut of every license exchange. This obviously is an extreme example but my point is to point out the disproportional economics.')
