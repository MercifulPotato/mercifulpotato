A Google account is like a costco membership. You sign up for it but just the membership alone doesn&#x27;t do much. To benefit you have to go to costco and explicitly choose which products you want to buy and use. If you want to use Google search you&#x27;re not forced to use Google Docs.<p>A Facebook account is a product in its own right. It is essentially what would be sitting on costco&#x27;s shelves. Imagine if you buy a console and then during account signup you were asked to buy a bag of doritos and enter the code inside the dorito bag. That&#x27;s what Facebook is doing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tying_(commerce)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tying_(commerce)</a>')
