I can run 1500-2000W during the day if I care, but there&#x27;s no way I can run a 2kW load, 24&#x2F;7, without massive generator use.  My battery bank is way, way too small for that.  I typically idle around 75W overnight in the winter, can run a bit higher in the summer, but 2kW would drain my battery bank stone, stone dead about 5h after sunset.')
