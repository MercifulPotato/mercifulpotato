Most if not all gene therapies do not eliminate the heritable trait. In this case, The the gene therapy would alter the DNA causing the <i>disease</i> in the bone marrow, not the reproductive DNA in the testes or ovaries. It doesn&#x27;t help that articles and speakers use sickle cell to refer to both the disease and gene.<p>To me, social controls on who can marry and who can breed with who are much less humane than offering experiential gene editing to sick and willing people. This would be followed by offering tested and proven gene editing to sick and willing people.<p>&gt;that was my policy after I was diagnosed and was getting a divorce.<p>I think that is a reasonable and cost effective solution, but there are other options. For those with the means, embryonic screening is an option. In the future, it may be possible to remove all negative symptoms from the homozygous carrier.<p>There is also the topic of dominant genetic disorders like huntington&#x27;s disease, which can not be prevented in children by screening partners. Without medical solutions, these people can not have children without risk. With genetic medical intervention, the carriers as well as their children can be spared from an awful degenerative disease.')
