I often find that these sorts of observational studies with weak methods that provide evidence for something the unblinded study participants would want to support (e.g., this study, observational studies of the effect of reduced workweek hours on productivity, many of the observational basic income studies) are really hard to evaluate fairly. It becomes easy to latch onto the conclusions when the intervention is one you&#x27;re predisposed to believe in and to latch onto the methodological weaknesses when it&#x27;s one you start of opposed towards, and so I feel like they don&#x27;t really advance science forward at all.')
