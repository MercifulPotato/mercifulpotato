I&#x27;m happy for its success, but I too find it a step backward.<p>On the positive side, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d have gotten rebar3 without hex guiding the way.<p>That being said, I wish hex.pm did a better job at distinguishing between elixir packages and erlang packages. It&#x27;s always super disappointing when I try and stay pure Erlang to have to sift through Elixir packages for what I am looking for.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how far Elixir has come in 10 years. I&#x27;ve always hoped it can become a gateway drug for Erlang. I don&#x27;t think it will, and I guess that&#x27;s okay, as it pushes Erlang forward in its own way.')
