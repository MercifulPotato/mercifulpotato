It&#x27;s only in the past thirty years that most Americans stopped living&#x2F;working in rural&#x2F;agrarian settings and began living in cities.<p>We have more sedentary work, so that&#x27;s a factor.<p>I also wonder a lot about other things that have changed and how that impacts our bodies, including weight.
