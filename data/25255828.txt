Realistically, all the indications we have so far are that there is some correlation between how much you experience symptoms and how likely you are to infect others. It appears that people who <i>never</i> get symptoms (true asymptomatic carriers) are fairly rare and also really not very likely to infect others. Most of the asymptomatic &quot;super-spreaders&quot; which have been reported were actually pre-symptomatic. It&#x27;s theoretically possible that people who are vaccinated and become infected (which looks like only a fairly small percentage) will still be able to spread the virus, but in all likelihood that ability will be greatly diminished.')
