Many of those things are non-standard, and some are quite unsafe. Postgres not only prioritizes safety, it keeps the application developer honest.<p>This is incredibly important: if you use MySQL, unless you are extremely pedantic about using safe defaults and a safe-by-default ORM you will almost certainly end up in the position where migrating will be hard because you are going to need to rigorously test &amp; remediate all of the areas where your code was relying on MySQL allowing erroneous code to run without errors and nobody ever looked at the warnings.<p>I&#x27;ve even seen a few cases where people had data loss which had either gone unnoticed or been sporadic enough that they assumed it was user error or random corruption.')
