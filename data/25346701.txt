You don&#x27;t have to use both. So it&#x27;s helpful to think in terms of each one being its own thing, even though they&#x27;re paired.<p>Not the case here.<p>I&#x27;d imagine Schiller would say that AirPods Max is both singular and plural, given this tweet on iPad Pro: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;pschiller&#x2F;status&#x2F;725791354769399808" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;pschiller&#x2F;status&#x2F;725791354769399808</a><p>I&#x27;d add that over-the-ear (so, one item) &quot;headphones&quot; have a similar issue as AirPods Max. I&#x27;d probably call two of these products &quot;two pairs of AirPods Max.&quot; (Well, actually I&#x27;d probably just say &#x27;two pairs of headphones&#x27; but that&#x27;s a dodge.)')
