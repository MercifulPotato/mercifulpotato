The way to think of it is &quot;the government cannot prosecute you without also providing you with those things&quot;.  In theory, the part that costs society is the prosecution, not the fair trial.  Of course, politicians these days don&#x27;t couch it in those terms, so who knows anymore.  Even the US does not protect any of the rights guaranteed in the first 10 amendments anyways (nope, not even the 3rd).<p>Nonetheless, the way that we practice enforcing the fair trial and legal counsel rights follows the theoretical structure:  You can be acquitted of a crime <i>if</i> the state has failed to provide you with those guarantees, and that is when that &quot;right&quot; kicks in.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;right to an education is&quot;.  I sure would like for everyone to get a good, free education (and I put my money where my mouth is), but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a right.')
