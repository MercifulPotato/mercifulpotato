Protected origin status is protectionism plain and simple. That&#x27;s not to say whether it&#x27;s bad or good, just to call it what it is.<p>Such as brands, there&#x27;s no real difference in intent between a protected origin and a company brand. And I never heard people complaining why they can&#x27;t distribute their own Coca Cola either, even if it&#x27;s up to the standards.<p>In fact the similarities are even stronger when you realise that some protected origins are very small in size and that you have bigger Coke factories than some protected origins.')
