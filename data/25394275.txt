None have such a checkout by default, but it would fit both quite naturally.<p>I don&#x27;t have much experience with the zooming stuff, but I did use Nautilus heavily then (see also Siracusa&#x27;s Mac-focused discussion here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.arstechnica.com&#x2F;paedia&#x2F;f&#x2F;finder&#x2F;finder-1.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.arstechnica.com&#x2F;paedia&#x2F;f&#x2F;finder&#x2F;finder-1.htm</a>). As soon as you got used to it, it was amazing -- accessing files felt natural in a way it just doesn&#x27;t in other systems. It was both digital and leveraged our natural understanding that things are at particular places. It&#x27;s no surprise people still miss it.<p>A few people, of course.
