I think that&#x27;s Facebook&#x2F;Twitter now. I know fairly few really top people at Amazon -- the one-sided employment agreement, and harsh work conditions don&#x27;t quite have the same appeal as work-life balance, fancy perks, and all the other stuff that comes with Facebook&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Twitter.<p>Compensation&#x27;s similar, though, and about double what one would get outside of FAANG.')
