Also, visibility is a lot lower for the smaller developers and the costs might add up real quick without giving enough in return. With what I&#x27;m building, All JS developers will be able to make their APIs and MicroServices accessible to the strong user base Slack has without the need for the worry and hassle currently required. No other expertise required. In most cases, your microservice or API will already be compatible thanks to the way the app is being built')
