This is an expensive hobby anyway, people who are not blessed with a relatively wealthy life do not have time for retro computing. People love retro computing because they feel passionate about it and find it intellectually or aesthetically stimulating. Nobody sets out to make a game for the Amiga, the C64 or the Speccy thinking &quot;I know, this is where the money is!&quot;. They do it primarily out of love.<p>I believe the issue here is a cultural thing, really. Like someone else mentioned, the Amiga community, much like the Apple community, is used to paying for things that would be free or even libre in other tech communities. (edit: this is supported by this thread from 8 months ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22888726" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22888726</a>, let me quote: &quot;In my observations (also as a relative outsider), it has been like this at least from the early 1990s. Every little itty-bitty program for the Amiga cost money.&quot;)<p>Back when I was a kid, Amigas were pretty expensive and few people could afford them (none of my friends could). Kids without wealthy parents didn&#x27;t own Amigas.<p><i>Regardless</i> of their motivations, my overall point still stands: pricey gadgets&#x2F;software for a tiny niche hobbyist platform puts up a wall, raises the barrier to entry, and discourages newcomers -- surely not the best way to &quot;save&quot; it!')
