Retaliatory is an interesting word to apply to this behaviour, I hadn&#x27;t thought of it like that but it&#x27;s kind of true: I am struggling with the bounds of my weekend (or spare time in general) and trying to make the most of it while the clock ticks down. I&#x27;m not scrolling a feed exactly, but I logically know that I should be sleeping so it&#x27;s also not good use of my time. Thanks for sharing this.')
