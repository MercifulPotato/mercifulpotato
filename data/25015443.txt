FreeBSD looks like it has most of the pieces to get containers going but it&#x27;s not their priority to get that going. The people at Joyend did that, reimplementing the docker server APIs to manage underlying zones. I wonder why don&#x27;t FreeBSD do something similar.<p>- Reference documentation<p>I like to use RHEL and derivatives (CentOS) when I can, and the reference documentation its so, so, so <i>good</i>, ample and complete. The FreeBSD reference guide is good, but not as thorough and&#x2F;or up to date as the RHEL documentation.<p>- systemd &amp; NetworkManager<p>They&#x27;re rock solid, battle tested and well-thought. systemd is much more than init and does a lot of system management, stuff that previously was simply not being done by anything else. BSDs lack that completely -- see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=o_AIw9bGogo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=o_AIw9bGogo</a>')
