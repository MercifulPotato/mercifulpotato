It might be better for the service (or subsystem in NT microkernel terminology) to have a driver so that the client can reference it with a proper, dedicated handle, but that&#x27;s a bit beyond my wheelhouse as to which approach is better.<p>Edit: Completely forgot about ws2ifsl.sys which is a driver that exists just to give Non-IFS providers a kernel handle with the WPUCreateSocketHandle() call !')
