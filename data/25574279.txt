So don&#x27;t think survivor bias applies here. Also, what exactly are those catastrophic side effects? All the cases of &quot;vaccine gone wrong&quot; are pretty mild and most of them don&#x27;t apply to BionTech&#x2F;Moderna vaccines (since it doesn&#x27;t include virus) or related to product problems, which don&#x27;t depend on trials. If vaccines were started to be used after phase 2, thousands and thousand of lives could be saved. I think it&#x27;s worth discussing. Especially with these new mRNA vaccines, where new one can be created within a month, it could be a new way to battle upcoming pandemics.')
