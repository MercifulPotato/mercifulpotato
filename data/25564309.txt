The underlying storage engine of most databases stores all data necessary for an &quot;as of&quot; query.  Simply ignore all data pages newer than the timestamp cutoff, and prevent the garbage collection of any page that could be part of such a query.<p>In fact thats the way [eg. postgres] can do a long-running query on a table that someone else is modifying.  You in effect are looking at a snapshot of the table at the moment you started the query, even if it takes an hour to produce all the results.')
