The nice thing is that most of Numpy and Octave functionality is already builtin to Julia (multidimensional matrices are first class as they are in Matlab&#x2F;Octave). Julia performance is quite good and multiple dispatch is great for composing packages (once you get used to it).<p>Check out SciML, Julia&#x27;s answer to scipy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciml.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sciml.ai&#x2F;</a>) and Flux Julia&#x27;s answer to PyTorch&#x2F;Tensorflow (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluxml.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluxml.ai&#x2F;</a>). Are these projects as mature as their Python counterparts? To be honest, no they&#x27;re not, but they are making pretty rapid progress.')
