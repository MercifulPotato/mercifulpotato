The government has almost all of the power. Corporations only have power if people choose to engage with them or if the government forces you to engage with them (lets them engage with you - eg pollution).<p>The reason enterprises don&#x27;t want the government to interfere is that often the government is used maliciously to deal with competing enterprises. It&#x27;s still the government doing it though, whether a corporation influences the politicians or not. And if this is on the table then corporations will fight over getting politicians on their side rather than improving their product. After all, if you can outlaw your competition then that&#x27;s a better investment than marginally outperforming your competitors with a slightly better product.')
