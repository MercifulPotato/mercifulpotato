It&#x27;s for every-person.  Those who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> into photography, and just want to have pictures to remember things.<p>There are two points here.  Who initiated the trend, and what the trend is now.<p>If initiate the trend is to be discussed, that is, who started the social change, Blackberry was a <i>behemoth</i> in the smart phone market, before the iphone ever even existed.  And they had cameras, messaging apps, their own ecosystem, and people shared photos with one another lavishly and often.<p>If one is to discuss now, then Android phones are far more numerous than Apple devices, and frankly, more used by people just needing a cheap phone.  And the brownie was cheap, quick and easy to use, and even very cheap Android phones today have &quot;good enough&quot; cameras.<p>Just like the Brownie.  &quot;Good enough&quot;.<p>Not sure why the author ties this to iphones.  I can only assume it is like Kleenex.')
