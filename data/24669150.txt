In other words, even if I did nothing else with the watch, I’d still miss it if it was gone.<p>For instance, Apple Pay on a watch seems magical (and even better with COVID): you double-click, move your wrist closer and you’ve paid, after a pleasing confirmation “bzzz” on your wrist.  As amazing as paying with your phone was, that just seems <i>clunky</i> once you use the watch.<p>Now Apple just needs to make watch faces easily customizable.  The rush to customize phone screens in iOS 14 should show them, people <i>want</i> to personalize their stuff!!  Having the same OK-ish face gallery for years is easily the main downside of the Apple Watch.')
