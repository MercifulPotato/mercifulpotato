I know that the MarkDown stance is that you should just embed HTML but I know HTML well so I might as well write the whole document that way.  I experimented with reStructured text and AsciiDoc and found the latter better.  Combined with PanDoc ... it&#x27;s amazing.<p>I should also note that I&#x27;m happily using AsciiDoc with Hugo instead of MarkDown so I was hoping it was available here.')
