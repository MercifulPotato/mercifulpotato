The use of contextual controls means that you&#x27;re never quite sure what action is going to result.  For example, Mass Effect 2 had quite a lot bound to &#x27;E&#x27; as &quot;interact&quot;, which could be anything from calling an elevator, talking to someone, crouching behind a wall, or picking up an item.  Try to talk to someone near a wall, and you might hide behind it instead.  Similarly for the tabbed menus, they hide information several clicks deep, rather than showing you what you want right away.')
