The implication being we shouldn&#x27;t care so much because someone died only a year earlier?<p>It seems reasonable to create a statistical analysis based on years of expected life lost -- but that still doesn&#x27;t mean people aren&#x27;t dying from Covid19.<p>Aside, slightly tangential: Back in Feb&#x2F;March BMJ had some controversy about UK government hiding excess Winter deaths in flu statistics. The implication being that the gov were taking more deaths over Winter and saying it was flu when in fact the deaths were more related to poverty (no heating, little food). Next thing we know people are saying Covid19 want a problem because it wasn&#x27;t even as bad as flu (though at the time is was killing far more people as a proportion of those infected). Lies and statistics, and all that.')
