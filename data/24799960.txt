Especially since so many template licenses exist that address this exact problem.<p><i>&gt; I don&#x27;t like this idea that you have no right to complain about something if you haven&#x27;t specifically banned it in a legally enforceable license.</i><p>I think it&#x27;s unfair to imply that the post you respond to represents that idea, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing. Although worded frankly, it&#x27;s a constructive suggestion for what proprietors can do to prevent this. It&#x27;s not a new problem.')
