People just aren&#x27;t trained to think critically - and doing so for everything is exhausting however increasing the focus of education on how to think, not what to think would help immensely.<p>In the interim i would like to see some level of moderation, maybe citizens or states able to exact some kind of consequences against people who via any sort of media spread information which either they know to be or should know to be false (or alternative facts as some people call them). i.e. some kind of process where i as a person or an independent body have standing to sue breitbart for knowingly&#x2F;negligently distributing false information.<p>I know we have to be careful with this but at the moment there is simply no way of holding organisations to account if i am not being directly libeled despite the fact that the misinformation harms me directly.')
