Item(by='deergomoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606390317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218438, text='&gt; to charge outrageous prices for their keyboards (175€-331€ in Germany)<p>Those damn iPad keyboards are the thing I understand the least about anything Apple sells, pricing-wise. I accept that Apple charges higher than average prices for stuff, sometimes to an almost offensive degree.<p>But why is the regular keyboard case so expensive? It&#x27;s a regular keyboard that&#x27;s attached to a bit of plastic and fabric. Yet it&#x27;s more expensive than the Apple Pencil, more expensive than the HomePod Mini, I mean christ if you&#x27;re buying the entry-level iPad the keyboard adds 48% to the cost! Ridiculous.')
