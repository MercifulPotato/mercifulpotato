I&#x27;ve had machines with similar states, though never with <i>both</i> Anaconda and Homebrew.<p>Instead, I often had (in addition to the rest of the system-level snarl) isolated per-app Python interpreters  that were specified &amp; constructed with Buildout for development testing &amp; deployment.<p>Though I don&#x27;t quite get the arrow from Homebrew 2.7 to Python.org 2.6.
