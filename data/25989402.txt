Are all these people seriously so deluded that they have expected that a company will provide them free service out of the goodness of their heart? Again, Robinhood outright lied, and they must not get away with this. But we have to educate people that there are very few (if any) &quot;free&quot; services that won&#x27;t have to resort to these antics. They have to make money somehow, and if it&#x27;s not obvious how, that should be an immediate red flag.')
