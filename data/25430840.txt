I remember for the last year or two. The murmurs here, twitter and reddit has been &quot;Why don&#x27;t these companies understand that their work can all be remote&quot;, &quot;why does X company insist on having on-site employees&quot;. Meanwhile on the other side of the spectrum you had the higher ups all murmuring &quot;well if we let people work from home, then our company will be doomed&quot;.<p>Then COVID hit and we had no other option. Everyone went WFH and tech CEO&#x27;s realized a few weeks&#x2F;months in that no, their org isn&#x27;t imploding, it&#x27;s actually doing pretty damn well.<p>Now all these tech CEO&#x27;s are starting to look around and wonder, if my companies productivity didn&#x27;t drop off a cliff, why should I be paying for this super expensive office space?<p>Tech CEO&#x27;s were told this lie that WFH will lead to a catastrophe in their company, all these office closures and moves seem to be a reflection of leadership calling the bluff on this.')
