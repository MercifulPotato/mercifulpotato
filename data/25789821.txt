I didn&#x27;t spend <i>that</i> long fiddling with speaker position, because I just don&#x27;t have that many degrees of freedom in my living room without rearranging the whole room around the speakers[0], but after two or three hours spread over a couple of days or so I did get to what I think is the best compromise in terms of sound quality vs. the speakers being in the way. A few weeks later I added a subwoofer into the setup and, again, probably spent another 3 or 4 hours spread over several days fiddling and listening to get that to sound the best I could at my typical listening volumes (what I wanted was to support the low end without overwhelming it).<p>I haven&#x27;t even got to the room that I use as an office&#x2F;studio, which is a small spare bedroom. The room works well as an office now that I&#x27;ve redecorated it and put in new floor and shelves, but I need to finish off power routing and suchlike before I start on speaker placement.<p><i>[0] Many serious audiophiles would argue that you should do just this for the best results but I don&#x27;t have the space and I want a room that&#x27;s usable for things other than just listening to music. I often think this is one of those situations where the perfect really can end up as the enemy of the good.</i>')
