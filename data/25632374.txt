In no way have the US been through the same pile of shit that Iraq has been through, and neither have any of those problems suddenly walked over the ocean home to the US. Sure, the US has their nose wet in Iraqi and Afghan blood, but let&#x27;s not pretend and say that US takes any sort of responsibility for the bloodshed they&#x27;ve caused.<p>Otherwise I agree with your comment.')
