The same program refactored into a quarter of a million functions of 5-8 LOC each is jarring in a very different way. At the end of day we are talking of a million LOC, and no level of granularity is going to protect your brain against that amount of information.<p>What you need at those levels is modules. Dozens of short functions (though 5 LOC is overkill IMHO) that work together to solve a single, well constrained problem. Whatever its other shortcomings, Object Oriented Programming gives you that out of the box, though you have to design your classes instead of just banging out code as you go.<p>And then you can create packages, - modules that use number of tightly coupled classes to solve a single, well constrained problem.')
