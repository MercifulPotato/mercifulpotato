You can be a really good driver, expertly trained in maneuvering, stunts, tons of track time. First time in a video game, you are still going to crash the car 100 times, because you have no feel, and no depth perception. The more of a simulator the game is, the harder it will be to master.<p>I&#x27;ve driven probably 50 laps around Sonoma Raceway with 100+ other cars on the track without hitting anybody. I am fucking lucky to make that happen in a simulator.')
