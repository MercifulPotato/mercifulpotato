While very Catholic herself she never pushes me or any of her ((great)grand)kids towards it. My wife and I never had our son baptized, never even entertained the idea and I have not heard her complain about it. When she came to visit me in the US in the early 2000s and asked to go to church, I found and took her to a local Catholic church; all went well. She even noted how &#x27;comfortable&#x27; the church itself was. I get that; the church from her town was built in the 15th century and it reflects that. It&#x27;s cold and dark and when you step out, it&#x27;s probably cold and rainy. The one here was bright, warm and in warm and sunny California.\nThe most interesting part, in the process of looking up a church for her, I showed her a brochure (it was the early 2000s) for an evangelical megachurch (by California standard); she was not into it at all. She seemed to have seen right through it with the flashy local pastors. Commented about how it was just tricking people. I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her.')
