Everything seems to be based on CalDAV &amp; CardDAV which I think forces you to sync them with a server in plaintext. Email is mostly a lost cause, the closest you could approach it is something like protonmail AFAIK.<p>Totally agree. I think the natural progression of things to replace would be contacts and then calendaring. For the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out what should&#x2F;how to replace email. Or simply make it more secure for the masses.')
