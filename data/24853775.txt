There&#x27;s no concept of avoiding double buffering, immediate mode re-renders everything every frame while vdom avoids as much work as possible and updates are only triggered by actions.<p>But there&#x27;s more interesting to them than just being declarative. A pure render function, a standardized prop boundary, top down data flow, and lifecycles (further improved by hooks, which are basically algebraic effects, which make real hot reloading work), are just as important, and all of those fall under &quot;components&quot;.<p>Enyo, the WebOS framework, actually had a great declarative component model without vdom many years before React.')
