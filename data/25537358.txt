Item(by='wayneftw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608914054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535992, text='I actually switched to XFCE a couple years ago because I think it&#x27;s a much better desktop environment than Windows with regards to activities that I do for work like running lots of Docker images.<p>XFCE has features that you need 7+ Taskbar Tweaker for on Windows, like being able to middle-click a taskbar button to close it&#x27;s window. Any feature XFCE didn&#x27;t have such as &quot;move a window to another monitor with a hotkey&quot; were easy to script with xdotools or other similar utilities. With the recent release of XFCE (4.16 I think?) we got fractional scaling as well.<p>I also found it easier to add custom commands to Thunar&#x27;s context menu than Windows Explorer. Thunar also has tabs and so does the XFCE terminal emulator.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;m no longer constantly fighting with Windows Updates, Windows Firewall or Windows Defender or navigating the fragmented landscape of shells (PowerShell, Cmd, Git-Bash, Cygwin, etc.) just to get my job done.<p>When I setup a Linux workstation (Manjaro is my preferred distro), it stays the way I configured it without Microsoft constantly changing things out from under me - so I feel like I actually own the system.')
