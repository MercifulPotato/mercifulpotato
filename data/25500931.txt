There actually can be a lot of advantage to being the second mover. Nissan had already sold 100000 units of the Leaf between 2010-2014, while Tesla had sold up to that point only 16k cars. Clearly, Tesla wasn&#x27;t the first mass-market EV. Indeed, it seems obvious in hindsight that Tesla&#x27;s success owed mainly to ignoring the mass market and selling very expensive cars at first.')
