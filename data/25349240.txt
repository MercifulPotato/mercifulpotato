I don&#x27;t see why the cost of new features must be borne by existing applications that don&#x27;t necessarily benefit from it. Just imagine a product that is largely in maintenance mode, that QT license is just sucking money without value.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to argue QT saves more time than its license costs, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case. Also cmake sucks, no bazel support, lame. I have found the QT value proposition questionable at best and have largely abandoned it. YMMV.')
