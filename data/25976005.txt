It&#x27;s a real-time experiment that optimizes for the best messaging to convince casual Redditors to put their money into stocks in ways that benefit earlier WSB members.<p>At this point, they&#x27;ve convinced a lot of people that buying $GME at obviously inflated prices and never selling it is somehow an altruistic move to take down all of Wall Street that might also make them so rich they can retire early. Of course, it should be obvious that no one is going to get rich by never selling the stock, but that message gets buried among the memes.<p>It was fun to watch at first, but now it&#x27;s just sad to watch so many people pour real money into something that won&#x27;t generate the outcome they&#x27;ve been promised.')
