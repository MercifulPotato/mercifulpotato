Item(by='Const-me', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603543196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878648, text='&gt; Complaints about Rust&#x27;s learning curve is something I really do not get.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming C++ for living since 2000, recently it&#x27;s C++&#x2F;17. I think I have good understanding how software works in general, including heap and ownership. Tried to use Rust a couple times for hobby project, failed for various reasons. I don&#x27;t have issues picking other languages: VBScript, C#, Objective C, Python, Go had little to no learning curve.<p>Another evidence in this thread: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24878434" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24878434</a><p>&gt; while not being in a walled closed ecosystem.<p>Wasn&#x27;t always the case, but .NET is open, thanks to competition. Python always was.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s very easy to interop with C<p>It&#x27;s equally easy and almost as efficient in C#. The issue with both, someone has to write and then support the bindings. This ain&#x27;t hard but has costs, while languages like C++ or Objective-C can directly consume C libraries.')
