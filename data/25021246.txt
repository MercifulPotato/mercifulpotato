Maybe they don&#x27;t want to remove democracy, but not exactly trying to uphold it over everything else either.<p>Maybe seeing your cult of personality hero in office, or your religion or your flavour of boogieman (=not losing the country to commies kind of thinking) has ultimately higher priority than keeping the democracy alive.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what is happening, I&#x27;m just saying I can see how masses can smother democracy without specifically having the intention to kill it.<p>disclaimer: non-US, my opinion on anything US would be at best inaccurate.')
