Detecting the car is not even needed, just scan the driver license at a terminal and get going.<p>DMV does not need to have direct access to your bank account, but can simply hand off the total to your banking app (say),  which in turn can then offer the easy payment plan. Some credit cards already offer this option today.<p>In general, life can be made quite simple with technology without also having to give up choices or privacy. The hard part is convincing the tech companies&#x2F;govt IT bureaucracy to go this way :)')
