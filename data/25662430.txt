During that time he was already telling whoppers, and the media sort of humoured it. You can see now four year&#x27;s later that his version of reality is deeply embedded in a way that is nearly impossible to correct for - this make take a generation now to pass. Simply calmly stating that his words are &quot;without evidence&quot; or &quot;unsupported by facts&quot; etc etc isn&#x27;t enough. When figures of authority depart from objective reality you have to stop it right there. He should never have been given another interview question other than to question his lies.
