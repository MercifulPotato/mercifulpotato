That&#x27;s where this analogy breaks down. The original suggestion that APIs are less UX than UIs is based on the idea that developers make APIs and thus will easily understand other APIs, so that less investment in the experience is needed. Which is... nonsense? First of all, not all developers are API developers. Those in other disciplines will welcome the assistance provided by good design and documentation. Secondly, as much as I don&#x27;t appreciate diving into someone else&#x27;s spaghetti code, do I also not appreciate integrating with someone else&#x27;s clunky API, even though I build APIs for a living.')
