Anecdotally, I and a few of my friends who are fully into Fitbit are wearing them dutifully. I was also somewhat skeptical but I figured it&#x27;s not that much money to try. It completely changed my view on Fibit after trying it, and I&#x27;ve been very consistently wearing it.<p>&gt; However, you could probably determine that yourself.<p>Not really. There&#x27;s nothing like honest data and clear metrics to show how behind someone is. It also very successfully turned &quot;fitness&quot; into a game for me - clear, achievable goals and a way of tracking it easily did wonders to keep me motivated.<p>&gt; The heart rate monitoring is good enough for monitoring the intensity of your own exercise but not good enough for anything diagnostic.<p>It&#x27;s not meant to be a short-term diagnostics tool, and if you expect that, I think your expectation is completely misplaced. But it very clearly would be a useful data for the long-term baseline.<p>They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure - Fitbit is doing enough &quot;nudge&quot; to improve that prevention department for me, for a dirt cheap price. It&#x27;s been an extremely useful and valuable tool and a service for me. I&#x27;ve never consistently tracked my weight, nor exercised consistently - and I have no doubt majority of people fall into a similar bucket. Not everyone would benefit as much, but clearly there&#x27;s sizable population that would, and Fitbit, for that price, is doing a lot more to keep me motivated and exercise than gym memberships or private trainer or group exercise classes or most such things I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I actually wish Fitbit would allow us to share the exercise records with my primary care doctor - that would keep me even more honest, and would provide better insights and long-term trend data for my doctor.')
