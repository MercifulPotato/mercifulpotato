Nowadays there&#x27;s barely any reason to stop development after the GM is being burned on disks.<p>I do wonder what&#x27;s gonna happen with long term use though. My game boy cartridges still work, but what will happen with current gen games? Even those bought phisically usually depend on patches from a server that won&#x27;t be available in the long term future.')
