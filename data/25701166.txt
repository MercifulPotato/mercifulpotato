Effective gun control as it is implemented in many countries aims to exclude stupid people from owning guns as much as possible by requiring that you have real, strong, certified need to carry a gun.<p>People who own a gun in such countries know exactly why they own a gun. In any of those countries you would very unlikely be allowed a permit.<p>For example, here in Poland there are only two reasons for getting firearms permit: constant, hightened danger to your own life or when your actual job is to protect other people. In both cases the reason must be proven and documented.')
