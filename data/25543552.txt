(The common green-light pointers convert infrared to green, but that works because the input is a laser beam with high intensity, so that optical media can behave non-linearly, and it still has a low efficiency).<p>So no, wavelength conversion would not work.<p>The only thing that would work would be to replace their semiconductor crystal with one having a much lower bandgap, like the silicon, gallium arsenide or cadmium telluride that are used in photovoltaic devices.<p>However any such non-oxide semiconductors would be chemically unstable in contact with the nascent oxygen, so that would still not work.')
