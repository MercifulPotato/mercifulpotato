I will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid them - I want to get to the point where my deployment is controlled entirely from scripts in source control as quickly as possible, because that I can trust - I know that web interfaces will change in the future.<p>But unfortunately this means that most tutorials leave me frustrated. At this point I think this is more of a personal failure - I need to get over this hangup so I can actually follow the documentation that exists out there and learn to use the tools!')
