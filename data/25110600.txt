I think it&#x27;s a mix of the historical quirkiness of it being a pre-roman western European language, and the bragging potential for language learners due to how niche and unrelated to other languages it is.<p>If you ever need to make some money on the side, there are sites where you can book conversations with native speakers to practice, and basque is really in demand, so an euskaldun can make good money :)')
