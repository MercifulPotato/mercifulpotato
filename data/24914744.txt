Item(by='Fr0styMatt88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603855191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24909135, text='Since I have a vision impairment, I&#x27;m sure the effect is amplified very much for me, but using the mouse is such a massive break in flow:<p>- First you have to lift one hand up off the keyboard and put it down on the mouse.  This may or may not mean taking your eyes off the screen.<p>- Then you need to find the mouse pointer on the screen<p>- Then you need to aim for what is usually a relatively small target and move the pointer there.<p>- If you&#x27;re right-clicking, the right-click menu usually presents more small targets you need to aim for.<p>- If you need to use the keyboard, again you have to move your hand over to the keyboard from the mouse.<p>For finding the pointer, I developed this unconscious habit of slamming the mouse pointer to the very top-left of the screen.  It&#x27;s difficult though when on someone else&#x27;s machine, where your brain isn&#x27;t used to the pointer velocity or where multi-monitor means that slamming the mouse to the top-left actually puts the pointer on another monitor.<p>People look at me in awe when I&#x27;m using a two-pane file manager but honestly not having to take your hands off the keyboard and not having to move your eyes off the screen gives so much better flow.  It&#x27;s also why I like the UI of Blender - one hand on the keyboard and one hand on the mouse at most times.')
