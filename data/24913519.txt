Some people have audio recall. The recall events can contain imagery, moving imagery, sounds, speech, thoughts during event. They may be historic recordings&#x2F;memory, creative &quot;visualizations&quot; or a hybrid. Some people can insert objects into their version of reality. Dots on walls. Boxes on tables.<p>Your internally perceived reality is a &quot;visualized+ object&quot; that is similar to a visual and auditory recall of a historic event, or a future event &quot;imagined&quot;. That object includes body impressions, smell, taste, etc. Hunger. Pain. Impatience in understanding the nature of consciousness.  Etc. All of that is built from sense impressions. Buddhists call these &quot;aggregates&quot;.<p>The internal model of reality is an aggregate object which is refreshed from senses. While it looks very close to what everyone else sees inside, it is very individualistic to the person experiencing it and distinctly different from the various wavelengths of light and sound bouncing around in various material configurations which are then sampled by imperfect sensors.<p>Would it be surprising to learn that not everyone&#x27;s world model is complete, especially when attention is not being held on it? See &quot;basketball gorilla attention&quot; on Google. Yet, we all take it for granted so much that we forget we do it, sort of like the fact most people take for granted they can see their parents in their mind&#x27;s eye but don&#x27;t ever bother wondering how it is they can actually see an image representation of something without it being processed through a sense organ.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t come to anyone&#x27;s surprise that reality <i>is</i> hallucinated into being and we experience that hallucination inside alone <i>and</i> outside together. If you stop hallucinating it, you lose consciousness. Dreams.')
