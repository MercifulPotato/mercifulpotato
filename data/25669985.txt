As others have said, it&#x27;s not impossible that things have changed since I left or will change in the future. But I doubt it — e2e encryption is a big selling point for WA and something that is dear to the company&#x27;s heart.<p>&gt; And how about received messages?<p>It&#x27;s the same deal — the sender encrypts the message with the the recipient&#x27;s public key, and the recipient decrypts it with their private key (which was generated locally and never goes over the network).<p>&gt; How can you retrieve all your old messages&#x2F;conversations when you install the app on a new device? Don&#x27;t they come from WhatsApp servers?<p>No, you can only get old messages from your old device or from a backup that went to the cloud somewhere (e.g. iCloud or Google backup). The messages on your phone are stored locally in a DB, so if you copy that DB to a new phone it&#x27;ll have the new messages. WhatsApp doesn&#x27;t store messages — they are only present on WA infra until acknowledged as received by the destination.')
