Those are usually subjective and super-vague as well, e.g. “approx. $$$” or “minimum of $$$” and they never give you an actual number so it’s extra scary for someone coming from a country where their current monthly wage could sustain them for a year.<p>Temporary working visas like H1B(US) or 457(Australia) or L(Swiss) are all terrible in their own little ways, sigh.<p>The main issue is if you make a wrong career move your situation could quickly turn into an absolute nightmare, e.g. consistent abuse at work which you cannot escape.')
