That&#x27;s if they even consciously observed anything at all. You yourself said those could have a dozen other root causes. I for one have not actually observed <i>a bitflip</i> (so something that I can actually consciously detect as an issue) in a decade. No unexpected reboots, no unexpected file corruption, etc., nothing that made me say &quot;weird, must be some memory corruption&quot;.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m all for ECC memory, I practically showed the value of ECC after intentionally running the same multi-day Matlab job several times on a non-ECC machine with different results just to prove this very point. But you use your deeper knowledge to assume what someone with shallow knowledge and interest wants or needs, and that will almost always be off mark. Your car does not have a roll cage. Normal computers do not have ECC memory.')
