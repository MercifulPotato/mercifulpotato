EDIT: not Fred.<p>I work for a large hosp. operations company and serve as the Dir. Engineering for our clinical operations group. Hacking Healthcare is required reading for new members of my team. It serves as an excellent introduction (with a healthy amount of critique) to the dynamics in the hc technology ecosystem. Thank you for providing this perspective on the industry and its challenges with tech.<p>We&#x27;ve been successful developing using open source technology internally. In fact, I take a fairly hard stance on disallowing proprietary healthcare specific &quot;solutions&quot; from working their way into our stack (aside from the EHR itself, it has staying power). We&#x27;re lucky in that we are positioned as somewhat of a startup within a larger org, and are able to take that approach.<p>To avoid some of the issues you raise, we generally are working to reduce the surface area of the EHR to become simply the transactional backend which is then mirrored to a larger ecosystem of custom apps. This has the effect of boxing in the regulated entity. We focus on data integration (by spending $$$$ on custom HL7 interfaces, unfortunately not everyone can afford) to get outside of the walled garden. This means we can use the information&#x2F;data for new and interesting purposes without worrying about the EHR vendor&#x27;s roadblocks&#x2F;tolls. More importantly to some people, we don&#x27;t disrupt the billing cycle that originates from the EHR.<p>Do you notice any trends where healthcare operations&#x2F;providers are starting to develop internal technology that integrates with the EHR to compliment vs. replace the core transactional system?')
