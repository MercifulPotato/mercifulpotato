Which organisations do you trust more to be more competent than the Japanese (Fukushima) and Germans (who ditched unknown, unrecorded, probably large quantities of nuclear waste in an incompletely built facility)?<p>We have better, anyway. The combination of wind, power, burning things that have grown in our lifetime and time-shifting power usage seems to be good enough AFAICT.<p>By the latter I mean that a lot of big power users don&#x27;t really need to run all the time. A company like BMW needs a lot of electricity to produce a car, but the factories are built with capacity to spare (building extra capacity while building is cheaper than adding if a car sells well) and most the power-hungry bits can be shut down for a while if the power grid really needs it. Unless a car model is really, really popular and the factory runs at full capacity, but in the case competing factories don&#x27;t.')
