It&#x27;s impossible to stop the spread of disinformation completely, no matter what we do. Instead, what we need, is better education on how to parse and digest information we receive from others.<p>True, but you&#x27;re being too black and white.  While it may not be possible to stop disinformation completely, it is possible to <i>reduce</i> it significantly.  What you&#x27;re advocating for is akin to admitting that lead will never be completely eliminated from drinking water, so instead of doing anything to reduce it from toxic levels, we should (unrealistically) work on making people who are immune to lead poisoning.<p>Your solution is a chimera.  It is not possible (or at least wildly impractical given current constraints) to teach most people to be so knowledgeable and wise that they can find the truth in a haystack of seductive lies.  And even if that wasn&#x27;t true, the people who&#x27;ve bought into the lies would label your education program as biased and fight it.')
