I don&#x27;t much like them when they&#x27;re ignorant and irresponsible commentary on Covid-19 (something he knows less about than even most ordinary but interested people, seeing as he wouldn&#x27;t have the time to follow much expert commentary), or when he&#x27;s sharing his puerile taste in humour or music or literature etc (although, to be fair, it&#x27;s his personal account so he can share what he likes).')
