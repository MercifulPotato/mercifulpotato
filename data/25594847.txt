A colleague would argue for what felt like hours against SQS because it was “random” ordering, and kept demanding we use something that had strict FIFO. Despite the clients who placed the jobs not being affected by or caring about execution order. The worst part was that we had paid a shit ton of money for many globally distributed executors to increase throughout - I simply didn’t have the vocabulary to explain how asking for strict FIFO would mean only one executor would be running at a time, wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars.')
