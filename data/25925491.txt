And the problem with beliefs about climate change is that we have no way to act on them â€” by which I mean there are no actions we can take whose payoffs (for us as individuals) depend on whether our beliefs are true or false.<p>Completely and totally wrong. We can vote for politicians who will implement policies, or even implement some changes via initiative that are liable to be disadvantageous to us personally in terms of higher taxes or a slower growing economy for a longer term payoff even if the perceived payoff is for our progeny. We can incur costs in exchange for benefits. It MAY be a crony belief but it isn&#x27;t categorically so.')
