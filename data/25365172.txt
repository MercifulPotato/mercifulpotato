Youtube right now downloads 1MB of mostly json packed data for client side rendering. Irony of this is old Youtube layout (pre Polymer, their client side YT rendering engine) downloaded ~30KB of pre rendered html. The difference to users is Youtube website visibly slowly appearing in front of your eyes (while one CPU core is pegged at 100%) instead of Old YT just loading instantly and working.')
