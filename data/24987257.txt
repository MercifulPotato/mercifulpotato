We saw the Falklands, South Georgia, and Antarctica.<p>Going in Antarctica was what I was most excited about but South Georgia proved to be the surprise favorite of the trip.<p>If you have the time and the means I would highly recommend it. Especially because due to increased tour volumes the tour companies are starting to limit their activities to limit environmental damage. Starting this year they are limiting daily landings from 2 to 1 (or that was the plan at least).')
