If you can&#x27;t code, or don&#x27;t understand concepts your communication skills will not help you that much.  Maybe become a PM, or some kind of manager, but not an engineer.<p>P.s I know communication is not core, as i have worked with many &#x27;brilliant&#x27; engineers that they had poor communication skills due to be foreigners, or just personality quirks. While that will hamper their ability to get promoted to managers, or architects, they all were respected and did well as engineers.')
