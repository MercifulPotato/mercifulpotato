Team Blue is working to stop future riots of that style.<p>2. Team Red doesn&#x27;t even have a plan, and is fully paralyzed by their decision making framework.<p>------<p>I CANNOT assume team red is &quot;not evil&quot;, as you put it. Why? Because they&#x27;re still trying to side with the rioters in this circumstance. They&#x27;re still trying to claim that the election was stolen.<p>So lets put return the ball to your court. What is your plan to prevent riots of 1&#x2F;6th from breaking out again? Call me a cynic, but I am fully convinced that you have no plan.<p>So prove me wrong. Show me what you&#x27;ve got. We know what got us here to begin with: literally months of lying about stolen election results.<p>We cannot accept &quot;protests&quot; (if you want to whitewash the 1&#x2F;6th riot with such a word) of that nature. The events that transpired on January 6th should never happen again. Period.<p>-------<p>Team Red has millions of voters who believe the election was stolen and are acting upon those assumptions. Yes, this is a tragedy, because I believe they have been brainwashed with such lies. Given the circumstances, killing the propaganda that has been feeding their brains seems like a good step 1 for me.<p>Maybe it won&#x27;t work. Maybe there&#x27;s a better solution out there. But I&#x27;m not hearing anything from team red. So screw it, lets give this deplatforming thing a shot. It&#x27;s never really been tried at this level. If it doesn&#x27;t work, we&#x27;ll try something else later.<p>-------<p>We tried elections. We tried the courts. We tried publicly discussing the court results. And what did it get us? A deadly riot (which is still the most whitewashed set of words I can use to describe the events of 1&#x2F;6th).<p>So yes. I&#x27;m cynical.')
