Item(by='borepop', descendants=None, kids=[25751270, 25752070], score=None, time=1610475204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747159, text='It&#x27;s interesting to me how frequently on HN I read about people using their formidable technical expertise to pursue projects with really impractical and anachronistic technology, whether it&#x27;s this project, or retrofitting some really old laptop with scarcely any processing power, or whatever. I understand the impulse to reject practicality and not let &quot;the market&quot; or merely pragmatic considerations dictate one&#x27;s creative&#x2F;intellectual impulses.  But there is also something perverse about devoting so much brainpower and energy to these kinds of niche projects, which seem almost like a sort of performance art or a thought experiment made real.  I find it kind of appealing, but also kind of odd.')
