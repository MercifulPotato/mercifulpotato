And they still prove the point don&#x27;t they? The constraints got tightened, but it&#x27;s still a bell curve with most people at the lowest level that makes it past the constraint.<p>And while I shudder at the thought of Facebook not being able to man its critical ad targeting development, this is all about growth and taking over every major new booming product category as they emerge. The more people they can funnel into the game of leveraging of their current products to take over others, the more they can take over. Then the economics of paying more makes sense. Also the need for people productive immediately without training. Though according to the complaint, the pay for PERM positions is 156k, not that crazy. And that&#x27;s the average. For a company in Menlo Park. This isn&#x27;t the &quot;super-capable&quot; people of the field.')
