But regardless, it&#x27;s not 33kWh per gallon of energy to the wheels. Most of the energy is wasted. So of course a battery electric truck wouldn&#x27;t require that much energy to do the same work.<p>I&#x27;ve seen that trucks and buses just use multiple charging cables. But yeah, you&#x27;ll never charge a large truck from 0 to 100% in 1 minute. Overnight charging will be the norm.')
