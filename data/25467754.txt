Because VC funded startups are forced to grow fast or die a lot of good, profitable, user focused ideas are trashed because they won&#x27;t lead to rapid enough expansion.<p>Virtually every VC startup I&#x27;ve worked closely with or learned about in detail is doing something nearly everyone would agree is unethical, and a fairly large amount are doing things that are down right illegal spared only by the fact that they aren&#x27;t big enough to warrant prosecution or even investigation.<p>Perpetual lip service is always paid to the notion that &quot;we&#x27;re a user focused company&quot;. While the mental gymnastics performed to convince everyone onboard that this is the case are fun to watch, it tragic to see nearly all good projects slowly devolving into ways of tricking the users... and in most cases still <i>losing</i> money.<p>All of the private money companies with no plans of acquisition I&#x27;ve worked for are all amazingly sane by contrast, and create genuinely good products. They have to, because they need to make more money then they spend to survive and are fine if the happy place for that to happen is 30 employees.<p>In some cases, if that product is really amazing, they become companies like Jetbrains.')
