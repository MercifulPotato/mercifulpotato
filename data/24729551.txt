If someone damages or dirties the car, they&#x27;re going to be liable and probably kicked off the platform. All the car needs is a camera and a way for riders to complain about past transgressions that are leftover in the car and it&#x27;ll probably sort itself out.<p>You could also pay people to manually remote into car cameras for a brief quality check after every ride. Wouldn&#x27;t be that expensive. An interesting problem to solve though.')
