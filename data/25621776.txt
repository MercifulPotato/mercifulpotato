Do you believe it to be a good strategy?<p>I have never bought an Apple device, but have been forced by circumstances to use them in the past. But as I said, people make mistakes, and circumstances change. As is perhaps more relevant to me, Android isn&#x27;t looking all that much better these days.<p>You do need to eat. And it looks like soon rotten food will be all that is available.<p>&gt; What do you think about BankID being mandatory?<p>I hate it, but I can&#x27;t really do much about it. Uninstalling it would mean losing access to:<p>1. All bank accounts\n2. All insurance accounts\n3. Filing my tax returns\n4. Union account\n5. Bostadsrättsförening account (think: home owners&#x27; association for appartment)\n6. Mobile plan management\n7. ...<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a reasonable ask for the &quot;privilege&quot; of being able to use whatever damn phone you please.<p>There is finally some talk of building alternatives for it, but most of it seems to go in the direction of OAuth: they all fundamentally verify you the same way, and it&#x27;s up to each service provider to support each of them separately. Expected end result for the citizen.. instead of needing a device that runs BankID, you need one in the intersection of BankID, Freja eID+, and whatever else crops up.')
