Intel has a &gt;80% share in laptop and &gt;97% share in server chips. The only place AMD is competitive is high-end desktops, and there too Intel has 60%. The only big blow to Intel so far is the loss of Macs, but Apple&#x27;s overall market share in that space is under 10%. Sure other vendors (including cloud providers) are starting to roll out ARM offerings, but it&#x27;s very early to say whether they will be successful, let alone dominant. Remember that Microsoft already tried and failed once with Windows RT many years ago.')
