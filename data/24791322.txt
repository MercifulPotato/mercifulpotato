(I mean, if another alternative gave better results that would be better, of course. I just mean that what it is isn&#x27;t bad.)<p>I don&#x27;t think navigation is the best example for this topic though. Navigation seems like a fairly solid&#x2F;well-defined problem, not like more of the more fuzzy questions, like &quot;does this picture include a face?&quot; .')
