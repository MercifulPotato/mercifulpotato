Because someone at MS was drinking the DI kool-aid you have to add a minimum of 5 lines of code to any class you want to access config values in<p>I&#x27;m not sure if maybe you&#x27;re referring to the Options&lt;T&gt; stuff?<p>The way I do it is pretty simple.<p>1. Create a POCO that represents your config. You can have properties for bested configs if you want, e.g. SecurityConfig, MessageBusConfig\n2. When the app starts, use a ConfigurationBuilder to build an IConfiguration from whatever Co fig sources you want - typically JSON files and env vars\n3. Bind the IConfiguration to your POCO\n4. Configure both IConfiguration and the POCO as singletons<p>Now you can inject the POCO config object wherever you want it, or the IConfiguration should you need it. I feel like this is simple, and works well for dev, test and prod.')
