Composers and audio engineers would probably prefer to keep that part of their brain free to focus on other things.<p>Sliders can also be laid out in an array (as on a mixing console) to give at a glance a graphical representation of relative levels. Another example is on the classic &quot;two turntable&quot; DJ mixing setup where a horizontally-oriented slider is used to control the balance between left and right.<p>Knobs&#x27; advantage is they are particularly space-efficient.<p>So you tend to see sliders used for the primary controls in situations where its useful to compare them side-by-side, and everything else as a knob.')
