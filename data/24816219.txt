There are tools and systems that you can use, especially from high frequency trading which has somewhat similar challenges. KDB+ and co. would be my first stop to check if there is something that I could use. The question is the financial structure and scaling of the problem, to determine if these tools are in game. There are other interesting projects in the space:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;real-logic&#x2F;aeron" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;real-logic&#x2F;aeron</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmax-exchange.github.io&#x2F;disruptor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmax-exchange.github.io&#x2F;disruptor&#x2F;</a><p>Of course these are not exactly what you need, long term storage and querying (like KDB) is largely unsolved.<p>The other tools that you might be referring to by &quot;most of the opensource platforms&quot; indeed are not capable doing this. I spent the last 10 years on optimizing such platforms but it is not even remotely close to what you need, you (or anybody who thinks these could be optimized) are wasting your time.')
