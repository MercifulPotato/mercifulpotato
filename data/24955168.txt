Item(by='chasd00', descendants=None, kids=[24958076, 24958202], score=None, time=1604178078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24952761, text='&quot;24 60-ton Trident missiles&quot;. wow, so let&#x27;s say each has a MIRV with 5 W88 warheads at 500KT each. That&#x27;s about 120 independently targetable warheads (each 6-7x more powerful than the Fatman nuclear weapon dropped on Nagasaki) per submarine. Wikipedia says they are on 14 Ohio class subs operated by the US. That&#x27;s 1,680 total but let&#x27;s say only 75% are operational at a time. So the US Trident II SLBM cocked-locked-ready-to-rock capability is around 1.3K 500KT warheads alone. That&#x27;s... a lot.')
