Item(by='NathanKP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606696870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25249409, text='Well I&#x27;m not very effective at convincing people because I&#x27;m not getting paid to do PR here (well actually I do get paid as a developer advocate to convince people to use AWS... but that&#x27;s a totally different subject).<p>But I agree with you, my original comment was not helpful because it got muddied by the broader topic of anti intellectualism, which I have been thinking about a lot recently.<p>I do think there is a serious societal problem, leading to an almost religious fervor against some modern applications of science. I think that GMO&#x27;s are one target of it, right alongside vaccines and masks, to the detriment of society. That might be an industry PR talking point, but I don&#x27;t think that makes it any less true.<p>I think another aspect of my original comment that upset people is that I expressed anti-religious sentiment in it. I know there are plenty of religious folks in tech, and no doubt many were offended by that. Personally I feel that there are two forces at work here: one is religious leaders de-educating people and the other is higher education failing to educate people well enough because colleges and universities are trying to milk money from folks.<p>The end result is a society where anti-intellectualism is on the rise: people don&#x27;t have access to the education to understand masks, vaccines, or GMO&#x27;s but they do have access to plenty of religious indoctrination that tells them that they&#x27;ll be alright as long as they do things &quot;the old fashioned &#x2F; traditional way&quot;.<p>This manifests in so many ways, from benign things like the &quot;Paleolithic diet&quot; based on the idea that it is healthy to eat a diet like that of ancient humans, to harmful stuff like anti-vaxxers. I think it is all stemming from a fear of the future, which makes people want to go back to how things were done in the past.<p>But it is too late to go back to how things were done in the past. I see us on a tipping point that could go either way: a backslide into conservatism and decline, or a leap forward into higher tech that can help us survive looming climate change. Personally I hope it&#x27;s the latter.')
