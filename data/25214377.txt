Item(by='ProAm', descendants=None, kids=[25214973], score=None, time=1606338921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25214004, text='Let me see if I can find the podcast I listened to (or I can read this transcript) because it went into detail about the auction (the science behind it), how they knew about the flaws before but had spent too much time and money to not use it, it talked about how the private equity ultimately gamed it and made a bucketful of money.  And ultimately how the public who owns the spectrum at the end of the day did not make any money off of it.  I&#x27;ll update here if I can find it.  It was very interesting.<p>Edit: you could probably also read the publications on two-sided simultaneous incentive auction and the associated nobel prize that was awarded for this.')
