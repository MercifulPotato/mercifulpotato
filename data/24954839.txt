I don&#x27;t think that the hard drive&#x27;s genesis story is all that out of bounds for this article - the story is absolutely wacky and served as grounds for some highly qualified people to call this a disinformation campaign.<p>From there, Greenwald could have taken the other editor&#x27;s suggestion and included coverage on how few media outlets have the hard drive and how they are using that to justify not covering the story.<p>At that point, you&#x27;ve got some interesting conclusions:<p>1.) The Biden family has never denied much of anything.<p>2.) Hunter Biden does not look very good and his future business dealings should face much more scrutiny, particularly if his father wins the election.<p>3.) If this is a Russian disinformation campaign, it&#x27;s not a very good one (back to point #1).<p>4.) What does all of this say about the state of the media? 1 - 3 are a story yet all we hear are crickets. Is that because the career of journalism is so fucked up that it&#x27;s hard to get good writers to cover a subject unless they can find an exclusive angle? Is this because the business model of journalism is such that if you can&#x27;t guarantee millions and millions of page views, you can&#x27;t justify allocating resources towards actual investigative journalism?? Or is this pure bias???')
