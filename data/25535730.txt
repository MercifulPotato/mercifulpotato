Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608893940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534822, text='&gt; How is a $4.18 price increase worthy of millions of HN readersâ€™ attention on Christmas?<p>Because, personally, I was already bit in the ass by these price hikes from a gTLD. I started a personal website with a gTLD (.site) that I registered for about $1, and when it was close to expire suddenly the registrar demanded about $30 for it. I decided to jump ship to another gTLD and let the old one expire, to not support this kind of extorsion.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve been monitoring the state of the old domain name. Oddly enough my old domain name was parked as a premium domain, being on the market for close to $22, while other domain names from the same gTLD are sold for about $1.55.<p>In my opinion these gTLDs have been managed through extortion tactics, and I welcome any chance of discussing the subject.')
