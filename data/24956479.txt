Never mind whether the economies of Japan and Germany were &quot;planned&quot; or not, it was the stated policy of the US and other victors of WWII that they would not be allowed to fail economically.<p>Russia was more or less devastated, having lost more soldiers and civilians than everyone else except China combined.
