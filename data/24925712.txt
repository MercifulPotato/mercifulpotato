AWS console, on the other hand, is mostly non SPA and responds super fast. It didnâ€™t feel jarring and loaded very quickly. It had a questionable UI, but I feel that AWS might have noticed that SPA would ruin the UX of navigating consoles. It is a small thing, but a big reason why I prefer developing with AWS. GCP comes close second in terms of performance with a SPA. Azure just shits the bed and seems like a pile of mess. What has your experience been like?')
