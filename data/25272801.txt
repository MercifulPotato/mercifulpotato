The first was when I was brought onto a team that was looking to build a distributed solar power management system built with Raspberry Pi&#x27;s. The second and most recent was when I worked at my startup which built a service that used AI to help writer, authors, and students get past writer&#x27;s block.<p>In both instances I was in a collaborative team environment that tested a lot of my assumptions about engineering and project management. As a result I have a good understanding of what goes into time management, people management, and how to strike the balance between timely delivery and project scope.<p>I have a particular interest in AI, so anything that touches on that would be ideal, but I&#x27;m always eager to learn a new field or solve a new problem.')
