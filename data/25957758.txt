That probably prompts the question: &quot;how on Earth could you possibly hold both of these stances simultaneously without being a big, fat phony?&quot;.<p>Yeah... okay, admittedly it probably <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> prompt that question because you have better things to be doing, <i>but</i> I have nothing better to do, so I&#x27;ll explain myself anyway!<p>The comparison to 7&#x2F;Vista&#x2F;XP was not accidental. As you may know, there is an 8 year time gap between the release of 7 and XP. Moreover, Vista was a <i>huge</i> transitional change. Under the hood, 7 and XP are different animals, even if they do share common ancestry and deliver the same baseline functions.<p>Taking these things into consideration, it&#x27;s <i>not</i> terribly pedantic to insist that Windows 7 is, in fact, built on top of Vista and not XP. It&#x27;s still a <i>hair</i> pedantic, but only in the context of this fact being used to correct someone with a less strictly correct (although, I insist, still true) interpretation. That&#x27;s the feeling I was trying (and failing) to convey with my comparison, which happens to actually be in agreement with your counterpoints.')
