You&#x27;re right, the argument above doesn&#x27;t apply to Stripe.<p>Instead, I would respond that freedom of association is considerably more limited than other rights. Soldiers, students, jurors, prisoners, etc are often forced into association with people they would rather not associate with, and businesses are legally forced into association to protect the rights of other people. When there is a conflict between freedom of association and other rights or government interests, freedom of association rarely prevails.<p>So forcing businesses to associate with someone in order to protect fair elections or free speech rights wouldn&#x27;t be incongruous.')
