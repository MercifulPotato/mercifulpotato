So it has its theory of value right there, built in. Stating that &quot;X without Y is just a Z&quot; isn&#x27;t very insightful. A brush without bristles is just a stick. Ok, So what?<p>Furthermore, the &quot;and why&quot; part of the statement implies that there exist universally acceptable reasons why anything should be worthwhile which is arguably nonsense. I&#x27;d say it is an &quot;empty and useless game&quot; regardless of any theory of value, but we choose to play it anyway.')
