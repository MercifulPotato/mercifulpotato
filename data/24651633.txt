If you want anything that actually works and is reliable, you pretty much cannot buy it on Amazon, you need to buy it directly from the company that makes it.  I have a Henge Dock for my older 13&quot; MBP and it&#x27;s worked perfectly for years over USB-C, and on my newer Touchbar 13&quot; I havea a 2-port USB-C microdock from HyperDrive.  I use Anker PD&#x2F;IQ3 chargers and cables, and I have no issues whatsoever.<p>There are companies making good products, but you have to be willing to pay for them and you have to buy them directly from that company usually.  Even if you find that product on Amazon, due to SKU commingling you can assume most of the inventory is counterfeit.<p>Too many people go to Amazon, type some generic keywords in, and pick &quot;Amazon&#x27;s Choice&quot;, which is some &quot;brand&quot; off AliExpress with no QC.  It&#x27;s not just electronics, this is true for things like car parts and tools as well.  It&#x27;s somewhat shocking how much Chinesium-grade products have infected every aspect of American life due to the ubiquity of people buying through Amazon and Amazon&#x27;s complete lack of inventory QC.<p>Friends are amazed that so much of my stuff works, and it seems the only way people find out about good stuff now is via word of mouth because you can&#x27;t trust online review sites which are mostly just reformatting Amazon star rankings with affiliate links.  The state of ecommerce in 2020 is appalling.')
