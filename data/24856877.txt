I couldn&#x27;t disagree more!<p>My response would be, don&#x27;t you think you can judge for yourself what is ok, and to not watch things that are nonsense?  Also, aren&#x27;t you concerned that you could be manipulated as you may be trusting authorities who - out of self-interest - could fail to disclose information to you; ie that you will be unable to reach an informed opinion as you will be in ignorance?<p>Personally, I have zero trust in any other parties judging what is ok or not for me to know about.  I am happy to judge for myself, without parental guidance.')
