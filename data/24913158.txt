But we don&#x27;t actually have a clue why that might be the case, or how it happens, or why a pile of atoms banging against their neighbors should be considered a larger whole which thus has complexity and therefore consciousness.<p>People think qualia must just show up this way because if you&#x27;re committed to materialism, it seems there&#x27;s no other option. But that&#x27;s not an argument, it&#x27;s just faith in materialism.<p>And it&#x27;s not true that there are no options besides simple materialism and crazy woo. E.g. it&#x27;s possible that all matter has some level of conscious experience; you can believe that without believing anything contrary to physics. There are all sorts of possibilities being explored by people who grapple with these questions, instead of just assuming an answer.')
