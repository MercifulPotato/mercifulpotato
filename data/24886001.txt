There are multiple implementations including:<p>1) Weston (the reference implementation)<p>2) Mutter (Gnome)<p>3) Kwin (KDE, also implements X11)<p>It&#x27;s important to draw the distinction as many&#x2F;most of the limitations people come across are in the implementation not with the protocol. People using different implementations will come across different issues too.')
