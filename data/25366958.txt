I believe in the value of startups and their role in disrupting business to provide old services in a better way or to provide entirely new services. However, I also want startups to facilitate virtuous cycles so that all stakeholders move forward [1].<p>DoorDash fulfills the former but not the latter. DoorDash&#x27;s business involves 3 stakeholders: restaurants, drivers, and end customers. DoorDash hasn&#x27;t done well by drivers given the tip stealing scandal. DoorDash initially benefited restaurants by expanding their addressable markets, but as DoorDash now extracts substantial commissions and any modern restaurant is required to have a presence on DoorDash, they&#x27;re essentially just rent-seeking. Regarding customers, this comment thread demonstrates how controversial DoorDash is. Yes, DoorDash provides a delivery service that didn&#x27;t exist before, but they&#x27;re also engaging in shady business practices (e.g. claiming free delivery with DashPass, the Chicago and Philadelphia fees designed to look like government taxes rather than additional DoorDash fees, and other dark patterns). In my opinion, DoorDash&#x27;s net effect on the restaurant-driver-customer relationship is negative.<p>I think DoorDash has found a way to make a ton of money without actually creating a net good for the restaurant-driver-customer relationship. Kudos to DoorDash for finding a way to make tons of money, but I personally can&#x27;t support any company that doesn&#x27;t actually create a net positive value on society. I accept that I&#x27;m in the minority here as evidenced by DoorDash&#x27;s market cap, but I hope my thoughts on this at least prompt a discussion about the value and role of startups in society.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_ci...</a>')
