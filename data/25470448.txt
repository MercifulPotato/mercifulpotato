One of them just got back from her third shift in a week in the covid unit, and has had a grand total of one reused N95 mask to use, in flagrant violation of what is considered acceptable barrier practice.  And this is at one of the biggest hospitals in California.  The way the staff are being treated is despicable, and I 100% support any striking action by the Nurses&#x27; union.')
