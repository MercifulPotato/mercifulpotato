There are so many small things you need to do in an office hob that are super hard to do with ADHD, there is no way you can do a significant fraction of them with serious ADHD. It isn&#x27;t about performing your job function which can be fun, but doing all the tiny bits you need to do just to function in an office, like answering emails, updating issue trackers, filling out forms, sitting still and look like you &quot;work&quot; etc. Many jobs will not fire you for being slow, but very few jobs will keep you around if you can&#x27;t even pretend to do the work.<p>Most likely you will not even get the job though, since you will get stuck trying to apply for jobs, or maybe even earlier you will get stuck trying to do boring assignments in college and therefore wont even graduate.')
