I don&#x27;t disagree with what he is saying here. The way I see it, corporations are much like countries. They are living entities run by people, and they have a goal to extend their reach and survive. They have their own challenges too (they need to pay bills and their army of employees). They see the law as some sort of constraint rather than a moral contract.<p>Corporations are not evil. They are a byproduct of this environment we live in. If I have an issue with the OP, is that he thinks his ideals as some sort of divine atheistic moral code we should follow. Morals are subjective and relative. It&#x27;s dangerous to try shaming people because you think your ideas have some kind of &quot;higher morality&quot;. That&#x27;s basically what religion is, and it ended up killing (and still is) lots of people.')
