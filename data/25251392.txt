Then they provided grocery stores with free freezers so that they could sell their products.<p>Then you have potatoes, tomatoes and corn. These crops were also developed by Native Americans. Without that effort, what you would be eating today would be similar to the teosinte, corn&#x27;s wild ancestor.<p>Potatoes are responsible for a massive population boost in Europe. The reason is because wheat uses more land, requires more work and has fewer calories than potatoes.<p>Andean peoples had many techniques for dehidrating food... The word &quot;jerky&quot; comes from the Quechua &quot;charqui&quot;, which means dried meat. They also employed freeze drying techniques to preserve food, such as chu√±o (freeze dried potatoes).<p>In addition to that, you have many varieties berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries), cacao (used for chocolate), vanilla, pineapples, etc.')
