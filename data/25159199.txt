The copy process made my CPU&#x27;s fan runs like a jetplane, and it stop copying when at 95%, then I opened up Task Manager and saw this.<p>even after it finish copying, <i>Vmmem process still hold 13GB RAM and not release any</i>. Why? I have to shutdown WSL after copy a big file?<p>Answer:<p><i>Very normal</i> but annoying issue. ... The only solutions are:<p>a) a kernel change by MS to limit the amount WSL2 can cache b) disable to caching ( nocache ) c) Put a limit on the WSL hyper-v VM<p>Not sure what or how MS will try to solve this issue... WSL1 did not have this issue, because it shared the main system memory, because it was just a layer around the NT kernel.&quot;')
