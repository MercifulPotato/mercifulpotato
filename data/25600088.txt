It was a terrible experience. The build quality was worse than cars half the price and the driving experience was terrible.<p>I want electric vehicles to become mainstream and think Tesla is an important driver to that goal. I also have no direct position in their share price.<p>But to suggest that the cars themselves are transformative experiences is just wrong.')
