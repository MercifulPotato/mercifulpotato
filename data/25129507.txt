If I moved to Eldora, Iowa and voted for the most progressive, liberal, all-blue policies, up and down the ticket... it&#x27;s still not going to turn Eldora into San Fransisco. There&#x27;s not going to suddenly be a drug problem where there wasn&#x27;t before. There&#x27;s not going to be massive traffic problems blocking my commute. There&#x27;s not going to be people commuting hours to work because they couldn&#x27;t afford a million-dollar house in town. Even if you doubled the voting population with people specifically chosen so you could enact the most SF-like policies, you still only have... 5,000 people in the entire town. There&#x27;s just not enough people to encounter those kinds of problems.<p>Cities with poor quality of life and high cost of living are that way because their laws and policies aren&#x27;t effectively managing the high population. If you move to a low population area, the problems you encounter are wildly different (and yes small towns still have big problems to solve). And if you move to a city that has a large enough population that SF&#x27;s poor city planning actually matters, you&#x27;re going to have to move a <i>lot</i> of people to overwhelm the status quo. And if a small number of new people dramatically changes the feel of a city, well that sounds like you had 51% of the people who wanted it one way overriding the 49% who absolutely hate the city they live in.<p>This fear feels like a socially conservative &quot;I don&#x27;t want <i>them</i> folk coming here and <i>changing</i> things&quot;. If new people move in and things start changing, they were always going to change and a lot of people have been waiting for that change for a long time. Embrace it.')
