The only issue is that it only charges with the provided cable and nothing else I&#x27;ve tried so far. I don&#x27;t think this justifies invoking my warranty on it. It isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, I&#x27;ve paid enough for it and I&#x27;m already starting to use it daily. But there seems to have been no way to know it was &quot;broken&quot; in this specific manner, maybe because nobody really felt the need to test with a different cable in their reviews. They probably just declared, &quot;hey, it charges, so no problems there.&quot;')
