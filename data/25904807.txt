Item(by='izietto', descendants=None, kids=[25904959], score=None, time=1611590996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904712, text='Yeah, it is bad, but let me be the devil&#x27;s advocate: Italy&#x27;s justice has three levels, and it&#x27;s very easy to be judged guilty during the first step, the judge needs only a small evidence and he&#x2F;she defers to the next level. Frankly, I don&#x27;t feel the Italy&#x27;s justice system to be worse than other countries, it&#x27;s pretty fair IMHO (disclosure: I&#x27;m Italian but in no way related to Italian justice)')
