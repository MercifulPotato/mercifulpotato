We keep adding features on features to software without a second thought, because it&#x27;s invisible and you can&#x27;t immediately tell from looking at it how insane it is, in a way that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to ignore if these were mechanical systems.<p>Also, not that it would have prevented this attack, but as a community we desperately need a fully open source FPGA-based ultra simple firewall appliance. The absolute minimum set of configuration options, the simplest possible hardware architecture; something you could actually trust with your life. Right now I have zero confidence that <i>any</i> of the commercially available security appliances are actually secure against nation-states.')
