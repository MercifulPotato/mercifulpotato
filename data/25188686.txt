Eventually in 2-5 years, but who needs that. Mostly not at all, or with huge cost overruns.<p>Additionally many developers are costing more than they gain, the 1&#x2F;10 developer, but more like the negative developer. The ones you need to get rid of, but mostly gather around senior management, CEO and blocking progress and playing politics. They usually are promoted to managers, and that&#x27;s where the big trouble starts.<p>Most complicated work is too hard for any normal developer (the 95%), you need to get the developers who can get it done.<p>It&#x27;s simply binary, not 10x or rockstar. Either it works or not.')
