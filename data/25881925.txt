Whatever your political viewpoint, I hope most fair-minded people would acknowledge that there&#x27;s something pretty unsavoury going on at the minute with the &#x27;cancel culture&#x27; which seems to be pervading Silicon Valley and various other virtue signalling arenas. I don&#x27;t particularly consider anything that I&#x27;m likely to <i>&lt;insert Telegram equivalent of &#x27;tweet&#x27;&gt;</i> on my Telegram channel to be outrageously controversial, criminal or provocative. But, as we&#x27;ve seen of late, some people seem capable of finding almost anything offensive, and over-reacting. So I prefer to use an outlet where I don&#x27;t feel the need to pre-emptively censor my thoughts, for fear of being cancelled or forced into grovelling apologies.')
