I’m a little looser than your absolute in practice, but I apply the same principles. Where I’m looser is basically an allowance for closures as a simple expression (and where languages with more expressiveness may not require a closure). If any local logic becomes more complex than that, I’m quick to parameterize it and move it out to its own function.')
