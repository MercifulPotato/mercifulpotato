It&#x27;s very readable and clear - I found it super useful in understanding DSP and the maths surrounding it.<p>Most of the time the actual stuff happening is quite simple, but if you&#x27;re not living and breathing mathematical notation the conventional explanations can be quite impenetrable. This book puts everything out in code, so you can follow the steps and truly understand what&#x27;s happening.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dspguide.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dspguide.com&#x2F;</a>')
