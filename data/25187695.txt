Xcode produces fat mach-o&#x27;s? Maybe I&#x27;m an idiot here, but all those third party apps are also made with xcode. Where is the correlation with the app store? Sure, apple has been pushing the app store, but how does &quot;apple silicon&quot; specifically push devs there?<p>App Store has smart deploy features so it only sends you what you need. So maybe that&#x27;s it. But still.. it&#x27;s a pretty weak argument.')
