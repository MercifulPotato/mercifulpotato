Item(by='kitsunesoba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606597451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25239990, text='&gt; iOS apps on the Mac are a game changer for me. The UX isn&#x27;t 100% perfect, but it sure is better than web apps, which are very often slow, resource intensive and kill your battery. I haven&#x27;t touched the Twitter web app since I&#x27;ve installed the iOS&#x2F;Catalyst app on my Mac. Even with its iOS-optimized user interface, the better performance of the iOS app makes it so much more enjoyable than the web version.<p>Totally agree, particularly for small utility apps and the like. Most good iOS apps launch instantly and sip power even on comparatively limited iPhone and iPad batteries, so the impact they have on a Macbook battery should be close to nothing. Night and day compared to electron stuff.')
