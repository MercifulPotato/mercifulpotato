When I was a child, home video recording seemed so novel, even to my parents, that there was an excitement and enthusiasm in a lot of the videos just based on the sheer fact that we were recording a home video. Nowadays, I don&#x27;t think people are as excited to record these kind of &quot;slice of life&quot; videos, even my friends with children.<p>The digitization company did provide a report, but it wasn&#x27;t very detailed. They just listed which tapes seemed to have physical degradation or imperfections. I don&#x27;t know what their methodology was, but I didn&#x27;t get the impression that it was anything especially advanced. I imagine that they just trained some technicians to use their equipment and then run through a standard process for each tape.')
