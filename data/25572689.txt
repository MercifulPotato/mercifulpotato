As they gained more skills and upper level positions, again it expanded the skilled labor pool and decreased wages.<p>It&#x27;s not women&#x27;s fault collectively though.

But unlike non-americans, unions couldn&#x27;t be anti-women because they&#x27;d look bad, and they couldn&#x27;t be anti-women in the workforce because it&#x27;d also be anti American since they&#x27;re citizens.')
