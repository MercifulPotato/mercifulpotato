Why is this something that needs to be software-driven? Why increase automation? What is the evidence that policing and criminal investigation is more effective (and by what standards!) when using Palantir&#x27;s tech?<p>I question the assumption that increased automation and digitization of every process is necessarily an improvement, or useful, and I feel like this line of argument takes that as an assumption.<p>&gt; Their view is that they don&#x27;t see or pick any sides, but the morality of that is up for everyone to decide, I believe if you don&#x27;t pick a side, one is often picked for you.<p>&quot;Not seeing sides&quot;, or not picking them, is taking a position though. Declaring neutrality doesn&#x27;t remove the concrete effect of your actions, or change the fact of your material support for a given model of policing or government. As Can Duruk argues convincingly in his latest newsletter[1] one of the best examples of that is low voter turnout in US elections: that benefits one side pretty clearly, so to declare you won&#x27;t take sides and won&#x27;t vote is a practical and real show of support for the status quo (to take just one example).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themargins.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;all-politics-is-bad-says-coinbase" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themargins.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;all-politics-is-bad-says-c...</a>')
