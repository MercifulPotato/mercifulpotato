So, when I installed a new Spotify update, it has now removed the Spotify &quot;Complication&quot; from my Apple Watch.<p>With iOS 12.0, you can only install WatchOS 5.0 on your Apple Watch.  You have to upgrade iOS to install a newer WatchOS.<p>Spotify iOS app requires iOS 12.0, but the Watch Complication requires WatchOS 5.2.  I have no choice to install an older version of the Complication, and I cannot install an older version of the Spotify app, so I simply no longer have the Spotify Complication on my watch.<p>The only way for me to resolve this problem is to update to a newer version of iOS.  And because Apple only &quot;signs&quot; certain versions of iOS, I&#x27;m forced to &quot;upgrade&quot; all the way to iOS 14.  This will mean losing access to iOS apps that are no longer supported by the developer, including ones I enjoy and don&#x27;t want to lose access to.<p>I mean, all Spotify had to do was align their app requirements and it wouldn&#x27;t  be a problem.  I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other iOS app thus far.')
