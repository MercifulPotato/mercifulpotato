Item(by='lentil_soup', descendants=None, kids=[24798974], score=None, time=1602836955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24789866, text='&gt;&gt; “Hmm, I wonder if I could … … … no, never mind, I’ll just do this instead.”<p>I can either think OR talk, I can&#x27;t do both at the same time. I can happily think and THEN talk but when I&#x27;ve interviewed with companies that have this interview culture (i.e. Google) they don&#x27;t let you do this. They start telling you they want to hear what you&#x27;re thinking. Also, most of the time thinking is disjointed and nonsensical and is way faster than what you can express so it&#x27;s actually disrupting the problem solving. I really don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s wrong with letting people think for a few minutes.<p>Additionally I am perfectly fluent in English and talk code everyday in English but it&#x27;s not my mother tongue so having me chit-chat my thinking away while I think (potentially in another language) hinders me since I focus more on what I am saying than actually solving the problem.<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;My typical work process in a technical challenge like this is to spend a minute or two thinking quietly about the problem and writing down notes, I’ll share those thoughts with you in a moment to get your input&quot;<p>That&#x27;s great, but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience. Interviewers constantly tell you to talk and it&#x27;s specially bad during a phone interview. I&#x27;d be fine if the interview was really setup as a collaboration between two people, but it&#x27;s not, you&#x27;re given a problem and a whiteboard.')
