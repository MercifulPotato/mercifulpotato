He would be free until he was proven guilty in a court. And yet here he argues against that most basic liberty for people who do not have as much material wealth as he does.<p>I disagree with Sacks in that I think we should have a single system of justice. But I applaud him for arguing stridently that rich people should have different rules. We take too many of our Constitutional protections for granted, so it&#x27;s good in a way to have people like Sacks argue against those protections. Hopefully it will generate discussion around where things are now and how our laws should be applied in the future.')
