You can&#x27;t deny this. There&#x27;s thousands of hours of video footage. I fled Seattle a few months ago due to your party&#x27;s nightly violence. The right is sitting at home and doing absolutely nothing. Even after obvious election tampering the right is STILL doing nothing. Only the left can point at the people doing literally nothing, as you spit in their face and torch American cities, and accuse them of violence.')
