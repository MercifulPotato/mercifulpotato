You respond, &quot;You must be very sad. What are you doing this weekend?&quot;<p>Your friend gets upset. Why? You understood what they were saying and acknowledged how they were feeling. What more is there to do?<p>Does that hit home? If not, switch roles, so that your friend is the insensitive person who does understand how you feel, but doesn&#x27;t feel the same way, because it&#x27;s not their mother. Being able to be sad for a friend, for their loss, not yours, is a basic human capability, and refusing to exercise it when it is called for is indeed callous and insensitive.')
