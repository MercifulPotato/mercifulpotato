Item(by='hodgesrm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607800373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399822, text='&gt; Do we really believe it’s not possible for a politician to be addressing the problem of “improving people’s lives” via the intermediate aim of “gaining political power”?<p>In my limited understanding the writers of the US Constitution held exactly this belief: that the government would be run by imperfect and self-interested actors. They introduced mechanisms like separation of powers to play them off against each other to the benefit of the governed. It seems as we&#x27;ve moved from that focus on outcomes to judging people based on the purity of their motives.')
