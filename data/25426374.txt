I expect a few other remaining extremely small (in surface or in width) new tissues to remain undiscovered. \nWhich ask the question: would it be possible to cut an organ incrementally (ideally one cell width at a time (e.g with a powerful laser like for transistors)) it would enable an exhaustive search!')
