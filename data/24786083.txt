And why would they, it&#x27;s the job of the WHO to understand the science for us.<p>(If anything, Trump was initially harder on COVID than most by pushing for travel restrictions. At that time it was the Democratic NYC establishment that put individual freedom over safety [1], the two positions only flipped later on.)<p>The initial response, especially by the WHO, was an absolutely disaster.
