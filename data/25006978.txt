To large extend, people don&#x27;t even know what Nazi ideology and goals actually were except that they killed most Jews. But first here, you would have to show they were overall like Nazi.<p>&gt; Adressing your first point, I really think that human (including children) sacrifice is quite unique and not present in the cultures you mentioned.<p>Soldiers working for colonial Britain would cut kids hands if parents did not worked fast enough. Columbus did cut peoples hands too, I think that including children hands if locals did not produced as much as he wanted. He also took kids as sexual slaves for his men.  Cortes behavior was not normal either. Hunting witches and torturing old people assumed is not generally normal either.<p>American slavery routinely involved kids being sold away from parents before age of 10 .. and quite a lot of them died.<p>None of it is exactly same as human sacrifice, but not much better either.')
