We only use the constructs that are fast and efficient, and we avoid all the garbage<p>&gt; The only problem with low latency Java is that most experience Java programmers struggle with the new paradigm.  &quot;A lot of people who program in Java are used to working in an environment where latency isn&#x27;t a criteria,&quot; says Lawrey.<p>So, the best Java developers would be former C&#x2F;C++ developers. That&#x27;s hardly a ringing endorsement for the language. Look at LMAX&#x27;s Disruptor, for example.
