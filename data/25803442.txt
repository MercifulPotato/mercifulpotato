And then updates from a client are synchronous in terms of setting all data and having that bundled and sent as a single request which is executed as a single dB transaction (we only send the specific fields that were updated).<p>If two people do something at the same moment, then it’s last request wins. We have dB constraints to keep the data consistent.<p>It’s not a perfect model, but it’s pragmatic and works well for our use.')
