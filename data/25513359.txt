Legal and social structures that make that possible on the scale I’m thinking aren’t in common use. You’d need some more mature form of an intentional community structured as a corporation with joint ownership and voting rights. These orgs do exist but they’re all bespoke and only beginning to organize. We need a tried and true system that any group of people can incorporate under, buy land and set up shop. The mind reels at the obstacles currently in place for such an undertaking. But if something like that does become common then there will be a market for hyper local infrastructure e.g. solar, well field, septic, networking, recycling and waste disposal, small theatres, communal kitchens, gardens, walking and biking paths, schools, workshops and motor pools. What you’d want would essentially be a self sufficient university campus in a box, available in whole or in part.')
