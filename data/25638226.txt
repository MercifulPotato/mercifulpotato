Structures like linked-lists are fiendishly hard to implement in safe Rust too, but people are able to stay productive by (mostly) not implementing things like that themselves. In Rust&#x27;s case the difficulty comes from ownership: anything involving complex reference graphs for the sake of traversal is going to be really gnarly to establish a single-ownership story for. I don&#x27;t know about F*.')
