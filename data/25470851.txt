Freelance IMO is closer to real life for most of the devs I’ve talked to. You are not committed to bullshit, often excluded from company brainwash meetings and actually getting paid by the hour, so you can manage the amount of “life you sell”.<p>Mentioning corona here, I think the society is desperate to find more IT folks around and loosing someone because of shitty interview process ( which I mostly skip because I’m a freelancer ) is quite sad.')
