Item(by='jsmith45', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606921611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274121, text='The most common trick to parsing grammars with a few context sensitive bits is to create some grammar that accepts too much. It allows things that are not valid in those context sensitive places, but gets the grammar correct in all the other places. It generally will be an overly permissive form of one of the possible parses. Then a second pass over the tree can collect context, and when it reaches these spots it determines if the current parse is correct, and validates it against a more restrictive version if so. If some other parse was needed, it transforms the tree into said other parse.<p>An alternative is to skip a parser generator entirely and so something like a recursive descent parser, which can easily collect any needed context as it goes, and use that in deciding how to parse anything context sensitive.')
