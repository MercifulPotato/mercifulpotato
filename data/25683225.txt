There are other YT videos with close-ups showing this, like this one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G48ywNxVSfM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G48ywNxVSfM</a><p>So here&#x27;s how the fraud works:<p>1. Take a pile of ballots that you are very sure are voting for Biden.<p>2. Hide them so they don&#x27;t get counted.<p>3. Get rid of the monitors by telling them everyone is going home for the night.<p>4. Start passing the opened ballots through the counting machines multiple times.<p>This would result in the number of ballots not matching the number of voters, but, there are lots of allegations of that happening.')
