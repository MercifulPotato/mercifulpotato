On the practical level, we were even tasked to fill out tax returns for a fictional company and we learned how to start freelancing &amp; start a company. It was a high school in a rather small town on the south of Czech Republic, nothing special. I don&#x27;t know how common this is in the rest of the country, but I remember that I and some of my classmates were leaving high school with income from freelancing already. There are very few people I know that didn&#x27;t have a source of income when they finished high school.')
