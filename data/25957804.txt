But let&#x27;s be fair about the WSB mob, they&#x27;re going straight after an oligarchy that has done some fucked up shit to the general masses. As one tweet put it, they&#x27;re going to force a lot of people to sell their second yacht to afford the payments for the first one. I also love how many other big CEOs of real companies that produce real things are backing the WSB folks.<p>Dont get me wrong about short sellers too. The act of short selling is technically good. There are some good firms that pay for investigations into large public companies to expose complex crimes, then short sell to recoup and profit. Melvin isnt one of them.')
