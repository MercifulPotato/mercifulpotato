Moreover, I navigate the parent comments first, as they are a good indicator of what the child comments will be about and look at each top level parent, closing the ones I find uninteresting. At some point, you get to uninteresting top level parents, and then I stop my search. This is usually about 25% to 50% through, though in rare cases, I reach the bottom of a HN submission. Then I go back to the most interesting parents and do a similar process on their child comments.<p>Reading like that is something I&#x27;ve developed over time as I&#x27;m active on this site for more than 5 years now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing it, unless you think you might want to try it for fun. That&#x27;s always a good excuse :)<p>For commenting myself on heavy contested topics, I comment on a parent if it&#x27;s popular and my comment to it is related. When the parent isn&#x27;t popular, I sometimes comment on it, depending on how relevant my comment is and how low it is.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plibither8&#x2F;refined-hacker-news" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plibither8&#x2F;refined-hacker-news</a>')
