My understanding was that they did but were hesitant, which considering the nature of opioids seems entirely reasonable.<p>When I had routine surgery a few years back the doctor insisted I take a prescription for Oxy, even though I told him I was fine. I filled it at his insistence and within a couple days could feel my body building dependence and craving more. I switched to ibuprofen as it freaked me out to feel how strong it was. It seemed very irresponsible to prescribe Oxy for something as mild as my case.<p>For debilitating chronic pain? For sure, these need to available. If anything Purdue pharma made this situation worse for those that actually need these drugs.')
