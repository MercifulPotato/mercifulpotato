While anything is possible in this pandemic, I am not that certain of it.<p>&gt; The number of people in intense care has reached April levels.<p>Per the graph, we are not there. April had as it peak 49 new person in a single day. November has its current peak at 20. It could get above 49, but again, time will show if that is the case. It is more alarming than the death graph, but less so than the positive graph.<p>For the number of tests, it has been increased from around 160k to 250k per week in the span of 5 weeks.

In comparison, April had around 20k tests per week.<p>Interpretation of data is naturally up for debate but personally I am bit of a middle line person. I don&#x27;t think we will see over 1k deaths per day any time soon, but we are going to see an quick increase in the near time. A lot will depend if the government decided again to lock up the elderly, something which worked but was quite controversial last time.')
