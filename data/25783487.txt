Obvious examples would be: no-till practices that keep soil carbon sequestered, forest farming methods that mix woodlands into agricultural land improving soil and vegetation carbon retention, capturing agricultural waste carbon in biochar, and reducing wide area cattle grazing methods which adversely effect soil carbon in prairie lands by preventing deep grass root structures.')
