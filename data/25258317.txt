Not only that but the ROB is something like 3x larger. You can basically hold 3x as many instructions. No other mainstream chip maker has that many decoders in their CPUs.<p>Does this mean I&#x27;d expect to see better IPC (instructions per cycle) on these chips vs an x86, due to better memory parallelism?')
