Apps can also <i>declare</i> sets of permissions that the users will be able to override as they like, and that would be really helpful.<p>My point is that the security <i>must not</i> be enforced by the package distributors.  This is what happens when they ship containers, as snap and the like, and it is a disgustingly wrong policy.  Security must be enforced by the OS, under the total control of the user, and with reasonable defaults.')
