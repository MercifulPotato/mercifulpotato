Item(by='netcan', descendants=None, kids=[24680190], score=None, time=1601821459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679146, text='&gt;&gt;most industries aren&#x27;t run by monopolies<p>Mineral exploration &amp; refining, media, technology, finance &amp; banking, military industry, online retail... what % of the economy are we at with just these?<p>Market discipline, creative destruction and such work to full effect for restaurants, hairdressers, landscaping... It&#x27;s a small part of the economy, but good. Pretty unbureaucratic and efficient. Well functioning markets are great when you have them, they just aren&#x27;t most of the economy.<p>Some industries (eg FMCGs, shipping) are concentrated, but a degree of market discipline still operates. Not like hairdressing, but there is at least price competition within a limited frame. Some private industries are just impossible to pick apart from government: Health and pharmaceuticals, all government contracting, real estate, etc. Most market mechanisms don&#x27;t apply here either. They certainly don&#x27;t apply in &quot;systemic&quot; situations.<p>It is a fact that a lot (arguably most) of the economy is very far from the market ideal that restaurants operate within. It&#x27;s not totally black and white, but thinking of these issues in a 1970s frame is silly.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean private and public are identical, but a Smithian pin factory is as bad a model for most of the economy as a local fire department.')
