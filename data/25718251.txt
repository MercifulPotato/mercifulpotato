And that&#x27;s not counting on any improvements in longevity over the next 30 years. You&#x27;ll also have to deal with very high inflation rates in health care costs, which will dominate larger and larger chunks of your spending over the years in many countries - even those with free public healthcare.<p>3% of 1M is $30,000, before taxes on any investment gains. That&#x27;s basically a little less or a little more than a minimum wage job, depending on where you live. Most likely both you and your spouse will need to live off of that.<p>I don&#x27;t think 1M is enough to retire in any manner of comfort. 2-3M would be a lot safer. And that&#x27;s if you move to a cheaper locale and avoid any of the first-tier cities.')
