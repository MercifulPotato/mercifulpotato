The perpetrators were never caught [0]. Authorities thought it could be the dry-run for a larger attack. It took weeks to repair the damage to this one substation. The reserve inventory of high-voltage transformers is not large, and it takes time to build replacements from scratch [1].<p>There is a series of memes and greentexts on sites like 4chan [2][3] which describe how to disrupt, destroy, and damage critical infrastructure in the event of (or in order to provoke) civil conflict. One meme describes how to sabotage phone and fiber lines in ways that are the most difficult to detect and costly to repair. This knowledge has circulated for years.<p>I&#x27;m honestly surprised that we haven&#x27;t seen more attacks until now, especially during this summer&#x27;s unrest. I take the absence of attacks as a positive indicator of basic human decency, or maybe general technical ignorance.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metcalf_sniper_attack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metcalf_sniper_attack</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;prod&#x2F;files&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;f34&#x2F;Strategic%20Transformer%20Reserve%20Report%20-%20FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;prod&#x2F;files&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;f34&#x2F;Strategi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;1837689-4chan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowyourmeme.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;1837689-4chan</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;FfjVlRX.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;FfjVlRX.jpeg</a>')
