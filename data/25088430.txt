Someone came in and tried to rob us once. It was on a Saturday only one of my coworkers was there, he was in the back in the programming room where we a few computers and stuff. He had forgotten to lock the front door. Somebody came into the programming room and said he was robbing the place. Apparently, my coworker just started laughing at him and said &#x27;There&#x27;s no money, only stone take what you want.&#x27; I guess the guy just got confused and left.<p>There was things he could have probably stolen, tools and stuff, but I can&#x27;t really see it being worth it.')
