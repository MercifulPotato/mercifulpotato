That&#x27;s quite reasonable because an employer keeps track of employees&#x27; absence for health reasons and will come to know some details in case of serious health problems&#x2F;long absences.<p>In this case they collected data after sick leaves, but (a) it seems they collected quite a bit of information regarding private life, perhaps more than could be deemed reasonable and (b) the data leaked because they did not secure it properly.<p>This sort of files on employees used to be very common. Regulations have made them &#x27;tricky&#x27; especially if managed &quot;as it&#x27;s always been done&quot; without expert, up-to-date, input on what&#x27;s allowed and acceptable, and how to keep it secure, which seems to have happened at H&amp;M... So definitely a failure of the company management and I&#x27;m sure that all managers have been put through compulsory training since with a very clear message that ignoring it means instant dismissal.')
