Item(by='moate', descendants=None, kids=[25734720], score=None, time=1610391432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733588, text='I feel like the AWS lawyer is going to make the following claims:<p>1- This action (dropping Parler) is within the actions established in our ToS.\n2- Parler&#x27;s very goal is to attract  these sort of demographics and similar actions have been taken in the past (Stormfront comes to mind)<p>The only chance this has is if Parler has language in their contract requiring that 30-day notice of service termination. My guess is that they don&#x27;t. They also spend a LOT of time in this filing pointing out that AWS is a very big share of the market (the court won&#x27;t care) and that they host Twitter (the court will again, not care) in an effort to say that AWS was worried the shift to Parler from Twitter would financially hurt Twitter and then AWS (which doesn&#x27;t make sense, since AWS is hosting both so 6 million people shifting just means one check gets smaller and the other larger).<p>This is the quality of legal filings I&#x27;ve begun to expect surrounding these issues. &quot;They&#x27;re bad, and it&#x27;s pretty obvious to everyone, duh!&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually hold up in court though...')
