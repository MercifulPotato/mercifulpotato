Item(by='kemitchell', descendants=None, kids=[25772458], score=None, time=1610600455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770022, text='&gt; Amazon&#x27;s response to Parler&#x27;s lawsuit is damning<p>If there&#x27;s any damnation to come, it&#x27;s from the court, not from the parties.<p>I read both the original complaint and Amazon&#x27;s opposition, front to back. Both are pleadings---one side&#x27;s statement of events and how the law should apply to their version. Not established fact. Not neutral determinations.<p>I do commend Amazon&#x27;s counsel, at least at surface level. Doran and Wickers left a strong impression.')
