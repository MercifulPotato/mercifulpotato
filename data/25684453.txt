There would be a good number of people who use incognito mode or private browsing mode. I don&#x27;t know the stats, but I imagine a good chunk of people use incognito mode for NSFW surfing sessions. And whilst cookie banners are annoying, they are a small price to pay if it means you have the choice to wipe cookies after a browsing session.<p>For me personally I use different browsers for different things, and if I don&#x27;t want to be tracked and have browsing artifacts like cookies correlating data together and tracking me, I just go incognito and call it a day. Google&#x27;s attempt to re-design how browsers work at this fundamental level is welcomed, but that means other browsers have to do the same, which I don&#x27;t see happening. Firefox rarely copies Chrome features (or Chrome&#x27;s anti-features).')
