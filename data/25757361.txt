They just sweep it under the rug and move on. Meanwhile, whenever the NYT gets something wrong, they come out publicly with a redaction, and people use that as proof that NYT is &quot;fake news&quot;. I&#x27;ve never seen right wing news ever write a redaction for the countless lies they&#x27;ve posted.<p>Just last week, all of right wing media was full of posts about those 3 people at the capitol being antifa. Their proof? A cropped image of Q Shaman at a BLM protest (coincidentally cropping his Q sign), and a Google Image Search finding a photo of the other two guys on phillyantifa.com, even though clicking on the page showed that it was an article about white supremacists.<p>Feel free to come back and post here once the hunter biden &quot;fiasco&quot; gets resolved, but the fact that Tucker Carlson suddenly decided that he no longer cared right after receiving his &quot;highly incriminating secret papers&quot; tells me everything I need to know about the drama.')
