I started woodworking mostly by hand (due to space constraints really), and while I do a lot more power tool stuff these days, I still try to spend time practicing my dovetails and other precision joints. I still do most of my mortises and tenons by hand, unless they&#x27;re large, in which case I route the initial hole in the mortise and finish it by chisel. Good luck, dovetails are fantastic!')
