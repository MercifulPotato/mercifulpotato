Most likely not.<p>It&#x27;s possible it will evolve to make our antibodies slightly less effective, likely as a trade off for infectiousness, but incredibly unlikely the spike protein would evolve to be unrecognizable to our immune systems. Historically, this doesn&#x27;t happen all that often, except for viruses with chronic infections over years that can do a deeper search over the gradient, but even then it generally takes years to decades.')
