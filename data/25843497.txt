I doubt the only focus was to prevent discrimination by sex or race,<p>For example, there&#x27;s also prevention of mass manipulation (AI learns human psychology, $BAD_ACTOR uses that to manipulates masses) and AI based profile generation of individuals with the goal of creating leverage for blackmail&#x2F;extortion&#x2F;whatever. Or, how would one form a controlling body of unethical usage in AI in such areas. There are quite a few aspects never mentioned in these discussions, and a search via google scholar turns up lots of the sex&#x2F;gender&#x2F;race papers, but none of the others (at least on the first few pages)-')
