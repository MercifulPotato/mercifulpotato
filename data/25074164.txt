I worked there for a bit back in the mid-90s when they acquired a startup who&#x27;s merchant server software was written in Python 1.12 or something.  After Microsoft acquired, it became the engine for running ecommerce on MSN, and eventually became part of the SiteServer suite.  The first port to run the software at Microsoft involved wrapping the Python code with a shim that exposed it as COM interfaces.  I think it was eventually rewritten in C++ with ATL or something, but that was after I was no longer there.<p>I still remember the first O&#x27;Reily pink Python book waiting on my desk back then when I joined.')
