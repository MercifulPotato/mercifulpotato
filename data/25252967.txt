Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606738183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252707, text='I believe some studies have found members of certain groups to be just as, if not more, inclined to make disparate judgments against members of their own group.  (I&#x27;m thinking of one that involved male and female professors evaluating male and female applicants for something like PhD or postdoc positions.)  When disparate outcomes continued to happen, there would be further accusations (possibly &quot;internalized x-ism&quot; or &quot;the &#x27;non-diverse&#x27; members of the group must be intimidating the others&quot;) and further calls for intervention.<p>Making it obviously impossible for the judges to pick up the signals on which to discriminate, if it can be done, is much better.')
