As a bug bounty hunter, I&#x27;d not worry about being screwed by them. It&#x27;s by far one of the best paying bounty programs.<p>I don&#x27;t think the middle sentence is related to the other two. Every company I triaged for had deep pockets. I routinely saw payouts in excess of $1,000 and not uncommonly several thousand. I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing one that hit $10,000. But what I&#x27;m describing above are ways for the company to screw the researcher without really being motivated by stinginess. Fairness is not a concern.')
