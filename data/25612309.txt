If you move ownership of a to b, you cannot use a anymore as it no longer has ownership of the value.<p>The only exception to the above is if a type &quot;is Copy&quot;. This means that values of this type can be copied very cheaply, and in this case the compiler will allow you to use it multiple times, which is implemented by it being duplicated on each use.<p>As for macros, they are nothing like C macros.')
