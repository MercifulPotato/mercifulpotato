Four of my closest friends lost their jobs in the last ~6 months; and have been struggling to find a new one. What pains me the most is that none of them ever thought they&#x27;d lose their job and were totally unprepared for job loss financially.<p>I decided to launch https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layoff.wtf network to support those who have lost jobs. If you are searching for a job or can help in any way; I request you to join our waitlist. We currently have ~1300 people and are on-boarding users every day.<p>If you have questions, comments; I&#x27;ll be happy to answer.')
