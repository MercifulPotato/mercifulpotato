India and Pakistan, for example. They both depend on water from Himalayan glaciers.<p>If they get in a war over dwindling water and it goes nuclear, the effects could be felt globally. Ironically, a big effect could be global cooling, which would set crop yields around the world plummeting. That would only last for a few years, maybe 10 tops, and then we&#x27;d be back to warming, but a hell of a lot of people would have died due to widespread famine during that time.<p>China also makes heavy use of Himalayan glacier water, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d nuke anyone over it. A few other countries also depend on the glaciers, but India, Pakistan, and China are the only ones with nukes.')
