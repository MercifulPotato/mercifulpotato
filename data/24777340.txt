Item(by='xixixao', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602687997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775500, text='I was moving recently and needed to plan out the furniture stacking in a U-Haul truck, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vectary.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vectary.com&#x2F;</a> was perfect for this, given I grew up on Blender I appreciate how much simpler the UX is (similar to this app).')
