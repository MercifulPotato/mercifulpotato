It made bold claims.  Like: the original Levi&#x27;s jeans were made of hemp.  Cash bills were made of hemp paper.  You could make clothing of hemp in qualities comparable to cotton, even silky ones.  It would grow extremely well, in many climates and would need little to no fertilizers or herbicides.  As an oil seed it would have a higher yield than canola&#x2F;rapeseed or sunflower.  It would be amongst the fastest&#x2F; highest yield biomass producers.  It would improve soil quality in traditional crop rotation.  And it had been used by Elisabeth of England as a pain medication against period cramps, and would be helpful to chemo patients against nausea and pain, and benfitial for other long term pain patients, like some quadriplegics, also because of its few side effects and being free from habituation effects.<p>But, the book furthermore claimed, it&#x27;s a direct competitor to wood, cotton, petrochemicals --- and: despite, so the claims, having no lethal dose and being non-addictive to psychologically stable adults, it was convenient to declare it a criminal drug.<p>I couldn&#x27;t believe what I read, but the book presented itself as scientific, with tons of quotes.<p>So as a curious student I went to my universities library, and randomly checked out quoted articles and books, three or four from each chapter.  Dozens of them.  Old stuff, from the 1910s, 1920s, 1930s.  Some even 18xx.  And few recent ones, for the medical section.  Mind you: we were talking about a &quot;dangerous substance&quot;, a horrible entry level drug.  Contemporary papers about canabis were hard to find in the 1990s.<p>And every single quote I picked was correctly quoted.  Every. Single. One.<p>There sure are some who benefit from having canabis sativa prohibited.  If I was running a private prison, for example.  Or if I wanted to suppress cheap workers and keep them down, low and cheap.  Or, as the hypothesis of the book goes, if I was in a competing industry, wood for paper, fire wood, cotton for clothing, plant oils.  Or pain relievers or other medical synthetic drugs with overlapping use.<p>But whoever benefits from prohibiting canabis sativa, it&#x27;s not us, the people.<p>The book in Germany is in 43rd revised print now:<p>Die Wiederentdeckung der Nutzpflanze Hanf, Jack Herer, Mathias [Bröckers]<p>I found an English title by one of the authors, but I don&#x27;t know to which extend they are comparable: The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack [Herer]<p>The German one, [Bröckers], is quoting tons of German publications, it&#x27;s for sure not just a translation.<p>[Bröckers] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Die_Wiederentdeckung_der_Nutzpflanze_Han.html?id=qe13DwAAQBAJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Die_Wiederentdeckung_de...</a><p>[Herer] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.co&#x2F;kgs&#x2F;rwZE5w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.co&#x2F;kgs&#x2F;rwZE5w</a>')
