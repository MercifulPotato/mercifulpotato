Imagine a bomb is set off in an indoor mall. Lets say for the sake of argument that no legitimate evidence exists.<p>The bomb maker wore gloves, walked up, wore a mask, didn&#x27;t bring his phone. Even so the more tech we deploy the greater the number of hits we are going to get.<p>GPS on everyone else&#x27;s phones will tell you the name of hundreds to thousands of people that passed by within a plausible scenario, license plat readers can get you even more, facial recognition more yet!  We can pull in even more if we look for people that looked up anything vaguely related to bombs and the mall within the last month.<p>Spurious info from eyewitnesses and traditional police work certainly happen but technology can trivially produce 100x the volume regardless of whether that data includes the guilty party or not.<p>Furthermore once you have your mark guilty or not our present system is designed to trivially secure the convictions of the innocent by punishing them 10 times over if they insist on the actual process they are owed. Here have 10 years 5 years with good behavior or how about a life sentence and in order to have competent representation I hope you have 20-50k to pay or we will shovel you someone who will themselves pressure you to take the deal because they don&#x27;t have the time to deal with the caseload they have now.<p>Wrongful conviction is a fact of life not a hypothetical. Some estimates are as high as 10%<p>In that context normalizing tech that shovels loads of low quality evidence that governments can use to increase their clearance rates by intimidating anyone who might be good for the crime into copping would seem to have predictable results.')
