UNIX is great in that it offers a choice, and we should not lock ourselves into a shell monoculture (similarly to how a web browser monoculture is bad for everyone in the end).<p>Some of us believe rather strongly that tcsh is way better, some of us prefer zsh, and that&#x27;s fine!<p>It&#x27;s a good idea to take a look at other shells, at least to know what&#x27;s out there and to make an educated choice, rather than use &quot;what most people use&quot;.<p>So, next time you write a script or instructions, please remember that not everyone uses &#x27;export&#x27;, and also that not every &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh is a bash.')
