If they aren&#x27;t under the governor&#x27;s authority, they are not militias. They might be a gun club if non-violent. If violent, they&#x27;re an armed gang or a crime syndicate. And certainly they aren&#x27;t &quot;well regulated&quot; militias if they don&#x27;t have the sanction of a state&#x27;s governor. It&#x27;s also sedition to attempt a violent overthrow of a state government or the federal government.<p>The U.S. doesn&#x27;t have a domestic terrorism statute, so they can&#x27;t be called terrorists in the legal sense, but domestic violent extremists, which is the term DHS and FBI use.')
