It&#x27;s just mechanically following what the language says. So of course what you can do is limited by what the language can express, because that&#x27;s all there is.<p>Human minds don&#x27;t seem to be the same. They can have ideas without necessarily needing to start with language to build the idea on.<p>For one thing, we&#x27;ve all experienced having a thought but being unable to think of the word for it. Despite being unable to articulate it, you can look in the dictionary at possible words and tell from their definitions whether they match.<p>You could say that this is just our brains thinking in terms of that word without being able to recall its concrete form. (The essential meaning of a word and the spelling&#x2F;sound of it might be handled separately by the brain.) Maybe that&#x27;s why sometimes, but it&#x27;s also possible to have a thought and not know that there is a word for it. You might tell a friend about someone who has an annoying habit of rigidly following and enforcing the rules even when that serves no constructive purpose, and your friend might tell you that&#x27;s called being legalistic.<p>Still, you could argue that&#x27;s still language-based thought because all you did was compose together several pieces of language (&quot;rigidly following&quot;, &quot;constructive purpose&quot;, etc.), and that your new vocabulary word is really just a shorthand for that composition. Maybe that is true for some words, but it can&#x27;t be true for all of them. If words can only be introduced by reference to language, then there&#x27;s no way language could have formed in the first place. There must have been a first word.<p>Another approach is a thought experiment: does a feral child (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feral_child" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feral_child</a>) have thoughts? If a human grows up with no exposure to language, that will have profound effects on them, but I don&#x27;t think those effects go as far as making it impossible to have thoughts.<p>Having said all that, do I think that language heavily influences thinking? Definitely. For one thing, exposure (and non-exposure) to certain ideas has a big influence on thinking. Words convey ideas, and when you learn a word, you learn its idea. It may also be true that ideas are easier to think about (internally) if they have a corresponding word. And it&#x27;s certainly easier to discuss ideas if there are words for them, so those ideas will be discussed more often.')
