Boeing&#x27;s faulty Starliner test demonstrated how that goes [1].<p>The true value in unit testing is in revealing the bugs it will find early in the process. One benefit of this is there will likely be fewer to be found in the end-to-end testing (or on deployment.)<p>There is no value in debating which is better. The important issue is how to allocate your testing budget effectively, because there is never even close to enough time to exhaustively test.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2020-02-29-boeing-starliner-failed-first-flight-report.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2020-02-29-boeing-starliner-failed-...</a>')
