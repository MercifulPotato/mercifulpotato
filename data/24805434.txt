This week I wrote few lines of code. I am solving business problems and that interests me. I am starting a business to do just that. Go into a company with outdated software, deliver some custom solutions for them or help them migrate to a new software. Explain possibilities and improve efficiency of their workers. Nothing ground breaking really, many smaller or medium companies do not have the staff to help them navigate all the options. Plus, I&#x27;m not scared of reading an app where most of the code is in main and applying basic programming principles to improve and move it to a newer language&#x2F;framework. lol.<p>There is a lot of odd jobs that you can do as a CS major. As programmers often can solve inefficiency if they can study a process.')
