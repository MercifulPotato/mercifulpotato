The result is very visible here: The only decent application we have are from North Africa.<p>That&#x27;s a bold statement.<p>French-born engineers are some of the best I&#x27;ve worked with, definitely not lazy by any means. But the local market in France is truly disconnected, salary-wise, when compared to the rest of the world.<p>If you advertise French wages on the French market, you simply won&#x27;t get any of that french-born talent. They are either working remotely or already in the Bay Area!')
