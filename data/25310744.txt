However, it&#x27;s important to ask yourself why they&#x27;re common. They&#x27;re usually chosen because of cheap real estate and car buying being a destination event. i.e. we buy cars infrequently enough that we value ability to choose among more options more highly than the time it takes us to arrive at a destination. This is the opposite of how we consume fuel. How often do you drive out of your way for a lower gas price? I almost never do.')
