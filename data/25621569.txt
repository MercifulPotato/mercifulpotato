If I had to describe it, I&#x27;d say &quot;50ms of the sound your computer makes when it hangs while playing an audio file&quot;.<p>No such problems with Azure. Zero artefacts and nice, crisp, natural enunciation, though unfortunately it is still quite unreliable when synthesizing single words (as compared with full sentences).  You can actually test it out by using the &quot;Read Aloud&quot; feature inside Edge.<p>I don&#x27;t know how well this translates to English, though. I definitely enjoy the benefit of working with a gender&#x2F;language combination (female&#x2F;Chinese) that&#x27;s received the largest total investment of effort and resources. Many well-resourced Chinese companies (banks, tech services, gaming, etc) all use similar synthesized female voices in their phone&#x2F;online&#x2F;B&amp;M services.')
