For example, a while ago Google stopped the ability to download full quality originals from the Google Photos service. Since then I have to plug in my phone every once in a while to download the originals to my computer and back them up manually.<p>I also remember when I left Facebook and asked for an archive of my photos, I got 800x600 images when I had uploaded much higher resolution ones.
