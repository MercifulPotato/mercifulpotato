When did that become a thing? Perhaps those earning mere pennies per view don&#x27;t make enough to support themselves. In that sense, it feels similar to any of the gig companies that pay below minimum wage -- it&#x27;s not good for anyone, but at the same time no one is forcing you to work with them. If making content doesn&#x27;t pay the bills, maybe you should leave it to the luckier&#x2F;more apt creators.')
