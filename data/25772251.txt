A small scratch and they were coming after me with 2k euros in damages. I had their CDW, but they refused to acknowledge it stating some TOS nonsense. Took me several months of constantly calling their office (they never reply to emails) to settle for a tenth of the cost. Took me another month to get a the receipt and written confirmation that the case is now closed &amp; settled.<p>The lesson I learned here is to use my Credit Cards CDW and deny the rentals insurance always.<p>Tbh, I feel that most car rental agencies make their profits through these crazy insurance schemes.')
