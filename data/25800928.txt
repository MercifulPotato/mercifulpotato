The standard library and the package ecosystem use asynchronous IO for nearly everything, which makes multithreading almost irrelevant, and the V8 JavaScript engine is extremely fast.<p>.NET makes it harder to do asynchronous IO, but easier to do traditional multithreading. I&#x27;m hesitant to say whether I think the average server running on .NET performs better than the average server running on Node.js, but I&#x27;m confident the performance difference isn&#x27;t as wide as you might believe, and Node.js might even have the advantage.')
