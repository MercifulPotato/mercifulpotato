Good to see that that is what you\nhad in mind!!!<p>I count such statements as personality\ncharacteristics, unpolished, maybe\n<i>gauche</i> behavior, not welcome in country\nclub society unless are worth &gt; $5\nbillion!<p>I&#x27;m really sensitive to lying, but such\nstatements don&#x27;t even start to raise my\nfur.<p>Gee, I was worried that you&#x27;d found some\nactual lies, e.g., like we have heard\nnearly daily (I won&#x27;t say hourly) from the\nFBI about Page, Flynn, and Manafort and\nfrom Pelosi and Schiff about Trump.  For\nthe mainstream media, I gave up on them\nafter the gang up, pile, party talking\npoint collection in<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f1ab6uxg908&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f1ab6uxg908&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><p>That is from 1-2 years ago and fun to\nwatch now.<p>For what the next few weeks holds, I&#x27;m\nfinding some interesting reading in<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;DocketPDF&#x2F;22&#x2F;22O155&#x2F;163215&#x2F;20201209144840609_2020-12-09%20-%20Texas%20v.%20Pennsylvania%20-%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20Missouri%20et%20al.%20-%20Final%20with%20Tables.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;DocketPDF&#x2F;22&#x2F;22O155&#x2F;163215&#x2F;2020...</a><p>with<p><pre><code>     In the Supreme Court of the United\n     States\n\n     STATE OF TEXAS,\n\n     Plaintiff,\n\n     v.\n\n     COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, STATE\n     OF GEORGIA, STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND\n     STATE OF WISCONSIN,\n\n     Defendants.\n\n     On Motion for Leave to File Bill of\n     Complaint\n\n     BRIEF OF STATE OF MISSOURI AND\n\n     16 OTHER STATES AS AMICI CURIAE IN\n     SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR\n     LEAVE TO FILE BILL OF COMPLAINT\n</code></pre>\nwith<p><pre><code>     Article II requires that each State\n     “shall appoint” its Presidential\n     electors “in such Manner as the\n     Legislature thereof may direct.” U.S.\n     CONST. art.

I&#x27;d missed that last part about the\nSenators and Representatives -- it did\noccur to me that the argument for the\nPOTUS should also apply to other elected\nnational offices.  Good to see that part!\nSooooo, the state legislatures ALSO get to\nput their hands, fingers, fingernails,\nhammers, crowbars, etc., on the when,\nwhere, and how of elections of Senators\nand Representatives in their own states\nand on fair dealing in the other states.\nSome smart founding fathers or amendment\nwriters.<p>Both you and Youtube might be circumspect\nabout betting the farm on Biden taking\noffice on 1&#x2F;20&#x2F;2021.<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t over until ...&quot; whatever that\nsaying was!')
