The only way that anyone noticed them is that the lead author, Nikole Hannah-Jones (NHJ), started claiming that conservatives were misrepresenting the project. She specifically said that the project did not claim 1619 as America&#x27;s true founding date.<p>People then went back and found all of NHJ&#x27;s tweets explicitly stating that this was the purpose of the project (NHJ deleted her entire Twitter history shortly thereafter). When people went to look at the 1619 Project website, however, they noticed that the intro paragraphs that explicitly stated that 1619 is America&#x27;s true founding had been edited to no longer state that.<p>&gt; In fact your complaint seems to be that the NYT corrects its articles on its website, <i>which is a good thing</i>.<p>The claim about 1619 being America&#x27;s true founding was the central claim of the project, the thing that it had heavily publicized and used to gain attention. The NY Times spent months defending the project and attacking critics, only to edit out the central claim of the project without so much as a notice. The lead author then started going around denying that the project had ever made the claim, and calling the whole idea a conservative conspiracy theory.<p>Whatever problems the NY Times has had, this is not how people expect the newspaper of record to behave. If this were The Daily Beast, then it wouldn&#x27;t be that surprising, but its the NY Times, the Gray Lady')
