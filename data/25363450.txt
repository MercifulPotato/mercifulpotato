Clueless want to be higher level managers, but lack the ability to act like a high level manager and only imitate. These people are generally picked out for promotions by Sociopaths because of their willingness to do what they want, but also because they are promoted to their level of incompetence. Losers on the other hand know the gig or don&#x27;t care, so are passed on by and stay where they are, basically &quot;losing&quot; the corporate game.<p>That&#x27;s basically the gist of it.')
