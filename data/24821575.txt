Item(by='hilbert42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603059645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819813, text='I feel extremely uneasy about this on privacy grounds and for other reasons I&#x27;ve not time to explain here.<p>Tragically, damn fucking idiots who&#x27;ve either ignored common sense or never had any in the first place have given the Forces of Darkness just the excuse they need to get access to their information. Their irresponsible actions gave <i>The State</i> just the excuse it needed to set a precedent.<p>Anyone who reads my posts will be aware that I&#x27;m far from being enamored with authority (as too many of those who are entrusted with it have repeatedly shown themselves to be disingenuous and untrustworthy).  Moreover, I believe democracy has seen much better days and that our freedoms are being eaten away bit by bit and what&#x27;s happened here is but another instance.<p>That said, if ever <i>The State</i> had a job that ought <i>not</i> to be controversial then it is protecting the health of its citizens from disease. Politics shouldn&#x27;t enter into the debate except perhaps around the edges, for disease is the common enemy of everyone no matter what their beliefs or what side of politics they&#x27;re on.  This notion goes back two half thousand years or even earlier to Pericles—the great ruler of Athens—who came under attack from the citizens of Athens when they considered he hadn&#x27;t done sufficient to protect them from a serious epidemic that had engulfed the city and of which he subsequently died.  That has a ring of familiarity about it, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that protecting citizens from a life threatening enemy takes priority over all other politics and matters of state—even if those other matters have negative consequences.<p>What&#x27;s so damn annoying here is that the idiotic actions of a few damn stupid fuckwits will, over the longer term, have contributed to a further reduction of our ever-diminishing freedoms.<p><i>(You know what I&#x27;m thinking but I&#x27;ll only allude to it—criticism of Pericles achieved nothing and natural selection quickly sorted out most of those who had criticized him!)</i>')
