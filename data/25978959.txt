I take no pleasure in offending people and will change my language accordingly.</i><p>This point doesn&#x27;t make sense. There&#x27;s 7 billion people in the world. Everything you said will offend someone, somewhere, somewhen. Offence is truly taken, not given. The point others are trying to make is that, if you get in this spiral of changing words and meanings, you&#x27;re already defeated, as there will be an endless supply of offended people, thus an endless supply of <i>needed changes</i>.<p><i>If people could be polite and patient instead of overreacting that would genuinely improve culture instead of turning language into a battleground</i><p>That battleground is precisely what postmodernists desire, and is fought with words. And that&#x27;s why the only logical answer is to not give an inch, and ignore them.')
