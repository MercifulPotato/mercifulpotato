But when you get stuck in a caravan of cars behind someone driving well below the speed limit, you end up having to pay more attention to the driving. As soon as there are other cars around you, you need to be paying attention to them. If the road isn&#x27;t flat and straight, you have to deal with speeding up and slowing down. You gotta keep an eye out for someone coming up behind you not paying attention, or the guy in front of you maybe not braking in time..etc.<p>Once the density of traffic is high enough, you no longer have the luxury of &#x27;observing the scene&#x27; -- you need to be paying attention to the driving and the other drivers. This is the situation that tends to happen on Hwy 1. People bunch up, and so everyone is just driving in these clumps of 10-20 cars doing 5-10 below the speed limit.')
