Maybe not on everyone&#x27;s wishlist, but as the world move toward flow everything&#x2F;everywhere[1], I personally find this to be a problem.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1BAiJR026ih1U8HoRw__nzbCSFnnHicWrjxpW5l6-O3w&#x2F;edit#gid=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1BAiJR026ih1U8HoRw__n...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Flow-Architectures-Streaming-Event-Driven-Integration&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1492075892&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Flow-Architectures-Streaming-Event-Dr...</a>')
