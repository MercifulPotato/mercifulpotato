Even an &quot;early preview&quot; didn&#x27;t come out until May 2018.<p>Combine that with the lack of 64-bit Intel emulation support (which is coming out...any day now), and it&#x27;s clear this is just a hobby for Microsoft. And Qualcomm too, since they have nothing to offer besides phone SoCs that are barely competitive even in phones.<p>Oh, you want a desktop machine to develop on, or use for CI or tests? Sorry, only laptops.')
