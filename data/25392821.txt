It&#x27;s a common framework that everything in the robotics universe can speak to, has some amazing tooling, and handles many tedious things that robotics experts shouldn&#x27;t have to care about. It does broadly achieve this.<p>But from my perspective as a generalist software engineer who isn&#x27;t a low-level robotics expert – as an ecosystem, it seems to have adopted every bad practice available and invented some more of its own. My experience working with it has been an exercise in trying to isolate it as much as possible so that the blast radius can be restricted. Many of the architectural design decisions are frankly baffling, although I appreciate that this is in part down to age, legacy, and the open nature of the platform.<p>ROS2 definitely feels like it rounds off some of the sharper edges and I&#x27;m very happy to see this project push forward in some useful areas!')
