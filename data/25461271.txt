I was using Dual Link DVI for my 2560x1600 because if you use DisplayPort in Windows and turn your monitor off, Microsoft for whatever reason resets your desktop - utterly re-arranging your windows and icons on your desktop.  Windows only does this with DisplayPort, not with HDMI or DVI.<p>So a few months back after an update - not sure if it was Windows or nVidia - my graphic card drive starts crashing.  And even though in the event log it shows the driver recovered, the display would never come back and I’d have to reboot the machine.  Swapping cards solved the issue so I figured it might be my 1080ti or perhaps my power supply was starting to fail and not supplying enough power (others with the error I was getting reporting replacing their power supply fixed it).<p>I was all set to get a new power supply when for whatever reason I decided to test Display Port.  It worked!  Well, with the annoying behavior for why I didn’t want to use Display Port under Windows in the first place.<p>Sigh.<p>Bottom line - no vendor or platform is perfect.  They all have their issues.  In general I find I have far fewer problems with Apple; as it should be - they have far more control over all the variables at play.<p>Also if we ever had 100% trouble free computing what would people on the Internet have to complain about?')
