Such person probably does not have enough freedom to change employer.<p>Contractor on the other hand should be able to refuse to work for someone if he does not like it and find another customer. So it should be more of a partnership relation.<p>In reality of course it is not so clear cut, but personal freedom element is more important for me than &quot;emotional well-being&quot; or &quot;social nicety&quot;. Especially because I would expect &quot;social nicety&quot; from any contractor I hire and if I would have to deal with obnoxious contractor I would not hire them again. But of course I would not expect them to know my children names.')
