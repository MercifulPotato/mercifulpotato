It says that inequality is the highest it has been in 50 years, yet the graph it uses to show this doesn&#x27;t support that claim. It shows that the top 1% of families held more wealth in prior years until approximately the 1940s. Now I&#x27;m not arguing that inequality is not a problem, nor am I saying that it isn&#x27;t higher now than in the past, but what I am wondering is why they would use a graph that seemingly contradicts their claim? It might be that the top 10% have gained a larger share over time, but if that were the case, then why not use a graphic that illustrates that?')
