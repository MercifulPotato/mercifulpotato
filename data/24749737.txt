Though I suspect one of the big reasons that nobody tries too hard to eat Google Play&#x27;s lunch is that they&#x27;re backstopped by Google&#x27;s resources, so if you actually started to succeed, Google would just pour money into crushing you until you were suitably crushed.<p>If they were separated from unlimited resources, it would no longer be a Sisyphean task to reimplement everything they do, and then others may sense weakness and make the attempt.<p>Though really that could be the best thing to happen. Let Android Corporation fail, we don&#x27;t need it anyway, meanwhile everybody else reimplements Google Play Services as part of the open source project, and then Google Play evaporates and there are multiple competing stores from Samsung and Valve and Amazon and Debian that anybody can use on any Android device. And Android gets developed in the same way as the Linux kernel.')
