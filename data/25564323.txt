I don&#x27;t know about film, but I do have visibility into the game artist market.<p>The pay is OK but not fantastic: generally in the 60-80k range, depending on experience. Many of the very low paying jobs ($15&#x2F;hr types) have disappeared. And I do know decent artists that frequently get recruiter calls, albeit usually for a couple large poorly managed studios that have trouble filling positions.<p>I think it depends a lot on the exact nature of the work being done as an artist. If it&#x27;s more technical, it seems to demand better wages, but in games there are still some fairly nontechnical roles that are either paid poorly or farmed out to offshore agencies.<p>Work conditions still aren&#x27;t great, but this is mostly at bigger studios.')
