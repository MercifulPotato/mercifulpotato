Facebook&#x27;s internal security team and it&#x27;s external contractors have internal tools that use Facebooks App on people&#x27;s phones to locate, block and alert if marked individuals are near company premises or high ranking executives.<p>Let&#x27;s say you protest against Facebook outside their offices, they could look you up on Facebook, find your account and if you enter a zone near their office it will send them an alert. Similarly someone with access to the system can ping your phone anywhere in the world to find a location with only the very basic controls present to prevent it from happening. No doubt the internal teams expand that to include key executives, suppliers etc.<p>In theory they should be logged in to their own account to do this and not able to ping people in their immediate circles, in reality no doubt they could probably have a false account to bypass this. If you think about the power of this. Hundreds of people with limited oversight free to ping whomever they want as long as they can create a loose reason to do it. Remember when the Saudis were paying people with insider access at Twitter, you could imagine how much the ability of people to ping a FB user anywhere in the world is worth. Two billion users...The NSA can only dream of such access. From intelligence targets to lovers to competitors, hundreds of people have access to this data because of FB policies and tech.<p>At least with FB you don&#x27;t have to have the app on the phone. WhatsApp is however essentially the new SMS, it&#x27;s impossible not to avoid it...and now slowly slowly FB is retaking control.<p>No wonder Brian Acton has gone to Signal. The original vision of WhatsApp is rapidly being eroded by FB. Yes WhatsApp has e2e but slowly FB is being FB and looking for return on its investment.')
