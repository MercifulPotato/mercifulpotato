I raised a defect with my MS Partner support dude and normal MS support. All they managed was a registry fix shipped out to turn an old flag on that was removed from the UI but was still in the code inside IE. I did the diagnostic work to get that far.<p>After arguing for months with various support people at Microsoft I managed to get hold of people on both the IE and CLR teams and they both pointed at each other and refused to fix anything blaming the other team.<p>They called me every 6 months to ask me to close the ticket and I denied it because it wasn&#x27;t fucking fixed. Eventually they stopped calling when Microsoft Connect was shut down. I wonder how many millions of issues they solved at that time!<p>Oh no wait, the issue still exists in IE11. They fixed it in old Edge.<p>This was a manual registry fix we had to deploy to 20,000 users at over 500 companies for 10 years.<p>Eventually we rewrote the software so it didn&#x27;t use ClickOnce, instead passing context to the application via a shell protocol handler (much like Slack does).<p>Incidentally we&#x27;re no longer an MS Gold partner and have no certified staff any more. This is not a coincidence. They did a shitty job and like hell we were paying any further. Amazon got our business in the end.<p>The issue?<p>You can&#x27;t set window.location.href=&quot;&quot;; to a clickonce activation link because of a race condition in the download bar in IE.')
