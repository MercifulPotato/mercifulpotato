They consume their savings, increase debt, or are a tax burden on others (or all of the above). If they consume savings mainly, they may even show up as a positive influence on GDP. But it&#x27;s not very sustainable, because for most people&#x27;s savings are quite limited, and consuming them because they&#x27;re forced to by circumstances is not really good for them.')
