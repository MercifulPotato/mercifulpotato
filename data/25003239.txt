You can easily pull allnighters and 40 hour hacking weekends and 80 hour weeks - and you do it because it&#x27;s exciting and fun, and it has only very minor opportunity costs - you might miss a school or college assignment deadline, or a few shifts at your minimum wage part time job. Your bedroom at your parents house or you college dorm is paid for already (even if just by usurious student loans).<p>Once you get to the &quot;disillusioned with the damned tech industry&quot; stage of your life though, you have responsibilities and rent&#x2F;loans&#x2F;bills to pay and probably family you need&#x2F;want to spend time with and a circle of friends who&#x27;re in the same stage of life who can&#x27;t on zero notice order in pizza and mountain dew and hack from 6pm on Friday thru to midnight Sunday catching only naps on the couch as needed.<p>I reckon there&#x27;s almost as much of a hill to climb for a &quot;woodworker since junior high&quot; looking at programming as a way out of a woodworking career they&#x27;ve become jaded with - as there is for a thirty-something software engineer dreaming of building timber boats for a living instead of being part of &quot;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.&quot; -- Jeff Hammerbacher<p>(But yeah, you don&#x27;t need to buy new timber when you accidentally &quot;move fast and break things&quot; as a programmer. On the other hand, at least the tools you buy as a woodworker will still work and be useful in a decade or century&#x27;s time...)')
