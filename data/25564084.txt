Too much would need to change in the company for that to happen.<p>From a macOS developer&#x27;s standpoint, it&#x27;s really a huge PITA there is no LTS.  But, we adjust.  Because we have a low-level product (compiler), we sometimes get into a situation where we need to sunset a product before we would normally do that, just because the older product doesn&#x27;t run on the supported macOS versions.  Doesn&#x27;t happen often, but it does happen.')
