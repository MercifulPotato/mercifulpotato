Each year, it just gets more political and more authoritarian. Even if you find a good subreddit, its only a matter of time before it gets usurped by the usual powermods that each control 300+ subreddits and bans anyone who disagrees. The admins will never do anything about them since it&#x27;s hundreds of people willing to perform free labor for them.')
