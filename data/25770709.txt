Your comment about votes is also against their guidelines (I feel for you I&#x27;ve broken this from time to time myself).<p>If you&#x27;d commented on the substance of the person&#x27;s argument instead of attacking them personally based on ideology, I think your comment would have done much better.  You could have even presented evidence from the persons twitter feed on this topic and used that to further clarify their opinion and how you felt their opinion in more context was wrong.')
