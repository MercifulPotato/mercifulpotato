That&#x27;s an entirely valid thing to say and&#x2F;or goal to have.<p>However ... having established that as the goal for this particular story, we can ask how well it does that, compared to other stories that might also have this as their only goal. We probably should ask this, because there almost innumerable stories whose primary purpose is to create a smile, and we may as well not waste our time on the less good ones given that we have (individually and as a culture) only a finite time to tell and&#x2F;or listen to stories.<p>The ranking is necessarily personal (subjective), and incomplete (given the scope of possible stories). Even so, if I was looking for a story to just smile at, I&#x27;d rank this one fairly low (mostly because it butts right against the more difficult questions you&#x27;ve asked us to put aside (for a while, at least)).')
