You just let your personal feelings decide which identical half of the coin looks better. Don&#x27;t fall prey to emotion just because the facts make you angry or don&#x27;t fit the narrative you learned to love.<p>All superpowers act from the same playbook. The more &quot;super&quot; the power, the worse they&#x27;re willing to do to hang on to it. Look at history for a confirmation. Not accepting reality doesn&#x27;t make you right. The US isn&#x27;t inherently better or worse, more or less immoral than other superpowers but it does have the military, economic, and political power to do whatever they need to do to grow it or at least not lose any of it. If it means bombing a hospital, imposing sanctions on an enemy, or strongarming an ally they&#x27;ll do it because not doing it means giving up an inch. One here, one there, pretty soon they&#x27;re a mile behind. So no quarter given.')
