Sure, you may be able to sprint a little longer from time to time. But sustained performance eventually suffers and most people will tend to be less productive (per hour at first, eventually overall as burnout sinks in) when working longer hours for a long stretch.<p>I’ve had three or four extended periods of overwork in my career, several months of 60-100 hour weeks, and it’s caused me severe mental health distress.<p>It’s really a shame that burnout culture is so common in the tech industry. In so many ways we’re very privileged, but this culture is a very high cost for workers who can be pressured by it.')
