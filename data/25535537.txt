So if you&#x27;re feeling like you&#x27;re re-iterating &quot;common sense&quot; ideas (like: implement things orthogonally if possible; write tests; try out concepts before implementing them completely…) without them seeming to stick, this book is a great resource to point people to.<p>It&#x27;s great to know that someone actually described those ideas and wrote down the thought process behind them. If only so you yourself don&#x27;t have to argue for them over and over again…')
