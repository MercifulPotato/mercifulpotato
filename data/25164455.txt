Item(by='CogentHedgehog', descendants=None, kids=[25164811], score=None, time=1605903398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162244, text='The reactors being built today are Gen III&#x2F;Gen III+ designs:  AP-1000, the EPR, VVER-1200&#x2F; AES-2006, APR1400, etc. These include all the design and engineering refinements we&#x27;ve been able to cram in.  They&#x27;re a far cry from 30-60 year old tech.<p>Unfortunately most of the new reactors built in the US and Europe have run massively over time and over budget, despite new technology.  Vogtle 3&amp;4 in Georgia drove Westinghouse bankrupt. These were modern AP-1000 models.  Flamanville 3 in France (an EPR) is running nearly triple its cost estimate and the delivery time ballooned to 15 years.  Olkiluoto in Finland (the first EPR) went massively over time and budget as well. These reactors were specifically designed to be more cost-effective and promised much lower prices, but failed to deliver.<p>The problem in the nuclear industry isn&#x27;t the technology itself, but the fact that they consistently fail to deliver projects within their allotted time and budget.  Unfortunately this shows no signs of changing, and renewable energy industry looks poised to completely out-compete them in the energy market.<p>I say this all as someone that used to have high hopes for nuclear tech, after working in nuclear physics research all throughout university.')
