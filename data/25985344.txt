I am a Burmese and Aung San Suu Kyi has never been racist. In fact, her former advisor, Ko Ni, who was a Muslim as well spoke out against the Myanmar nationality law drafted by the militay junta that prevented Rohingya of Burmese citizenship and he got assassinated. This isn&#x27;t the only one, there have been other bombings, death threats, kidnapping and assassinations by the military since Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s party won. If you were to visit Myanmar and ask anyone, be it from a racial minority group or literally anyone, they will speak in favor of her.')
