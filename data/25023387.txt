You can get some truly impressive results at the cost of maintaining really intricate commands. There&#x27;s also added value when onboarding a new teammate and seeing their eyes open when they find some of the commands you maintain...<p>Once you grok filter_complex, it becomes a lot easier to understand how people get very complex results out of ffmpeg.<p>Of less renown but worthy of a mention is the tee[1] muxer. It lets you take the same resulting input and pass it to different destinations. Incredibly handy, ie, for outputting DASH, HLS, and a regular ol mp4 from the same command WITHOUT having to redo the scaling or anything else that was in the filter_complex.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ffmpeg.org&#x2F;ffmpeg-filters.html#Filtergraph-syntax-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ffmpeg.org&#x2F;ffmpeg-filters.html#Filtergraph-syntax-1</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ffmpeg.org&#x2F;ffmpeg-formats.html#Examples-12" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ffmpeg.org&#x2F;ffmpeg-formats.html#Examples-12</a> (links to examples which is where you should start, scroll up to see docs)')
