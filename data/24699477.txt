I&#x27;ve always found Bose sound quality to be objectively bad compared to other brands at similar prices.<p>They&#x27;re not absolutely bad, just bad in terms of sound-quality-for-dollar. By a lot. Compared to e.g. Edifier or Klipsch (for speakers) or Beyerdynamic (for headphones) which fall around the same price ballpark as many popular Bose products but IMO sound way better.')
