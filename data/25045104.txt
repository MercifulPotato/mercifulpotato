I don’t think it’s deliberately obscurantist, just people writing as they talk.  I’m happy with people letting having some flavour or colour to their speech rather than aiming for germanic recidivism as an ideal of purity. (Though yeah clear simple plain writing can be good to aim for, what that means depends on who yer talkin to).')
