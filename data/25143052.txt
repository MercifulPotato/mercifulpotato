Anima converts design (Figma&#x2F;Sketch&#x2F;XD) into code automatically. Up until today, we only produced HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS. With our latest release, we can now also generate developer-friendly React code.<p>We’re here to replace image-based handoff, which involves a lot of grunt work for the engineers who have to translate all those images into code that does the same thing. For designers, the pain we solve is the ping-pong, and their vision getting lost in translation. The bottom line is that teams can deliver faster.<p>With our latest release, developers can now cherry-pick any design element and get code. The generated code is clean, dependency-free, and runnable. We produce HTML or React, and soon Vue.js and Angular.<p>Over the past few months, we&#x27;ve been iterating with our community (now 300,000 users) to find out what still bothers developers when getting generated code, and have been tackling these issues one by one. For examples, we recently added an automatic flex layout, our software now extracts repeating UI components automatically as React components, and it also now can detect CSS patterns and extract common behavior.<p>Our goal is to produce human-level UI code, leaving only business logic to humans. The code we generate is clean and developer-friendly and gets better every day.<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this. Check it out and let us know your questions and ideas. \nCriticism is welcome! Thank you!')
