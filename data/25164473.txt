But ultimately it&#x27;s a decision taken with no long term data for either the status quo or the intervention.<p>You can extrapolate long term data from SARS and MERS for tail risks of contracting COVID; but there&#x27;s no other similar immunizations to extrapolate from.<p>By the time a vaccine is available for me (not in any risk categories; fairly poor access to COVID testing in my county, which I assume would mean poor access to vaccines, too), I&#x27;d guess we would have a lot more data on any immediate negative effects, so there&#x27;s some confidence building; but it&#x27;s still a choice between an unknowable risk and an unknowable risk.')
