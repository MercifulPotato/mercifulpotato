I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d kill it but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they started charging on par with Auth0.<p>And if they&#x27;re not charging for it, then what is the product? I mean, I know that they charge for other parts of the Firebase stack, but why offer a best-in-class authentication solution mostly for free?')
