Well we can&#x27;t do that because X, or we don&#x27;t need that because Y. Oh, okay. Is that why I have to come tow you out of the proverbial mud every couple of months?<p>Could you humor me and try a few of these things out? I think it&#x27;ll help.<p>What people fear most is automated systems that are constructed on wishful thinking, not healthy skepticism. A lot of our processes are about proving to ourselves what we think we already know. There is <i>plenty</i> of code under the AI umbrella for which very conventional unit tests could be written.  If you can&#x27;t use our practices for ML, you&#x27;d better drop what you&#x27;re doing and start developing parity, instead of bullshitting yourselves and everyone else about your exceptionalism.<p>Code that makes decisions for or about people needs <i>more</i> ceremony and sobriety around it, not less. If you can&#x27;t do at least as well as a startup (which is a pretty low bar), then we are really in some deep doodoo. But not to worry. The good news is that when the machines take over and we have to hide underground, you&#x27;ll be the first ones we eat, so you won&#x27;t suffer long.')
