If the driver got out to fight, they&#x27;d beat him up obviously. If he just got out to &quot;clear things up&quot;, they&#x27;d insult him and maybe slap him around a bit.<p>The driver&#x27;s problem is he&#x27;s in his own little bubble and was infuriated by <i>bicyclists</i> inconveniencing his <i>drive</i> (oh dear). I bet he&#x27;ll tell people how scary NYC is, like commenter `goldenkey` above, and hopefully won&#x27;t return to be so inconvenienced by kids on bicycles. His conundrum was 100% avoidable by not being a tool.<p>Anyway I hate selectively edited videos like that, making the driver look like some victim. It&#x27;s Andy Ngo-quality material.')
