If they try to raise prices to neutral or profitable levels it is likely that the market will shrink and competitors will charge in.<p>It may be that the equilibrium market is restaurants and food outlets do their own delivery for free or at cost. Then there isn&#x27;t much of a market for a service like DoorDash to make a profit in.<p>It is possible that there is a market there and DoorDash will one day, somehow, make more money than they spend. But having a high market share is not much compensation when it requires constant losses to maintain.')
