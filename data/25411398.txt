Silver street has medians in its major cross streets so that cars can&#x27;t continue straight, but bikes can. This, along with the facts that its speed limit is 18 mph and it parallels larger streets the reasons it&#x27;s not used much by cars, despite not having the excessive stop signs that most gridded neighborhood streets possess.')
