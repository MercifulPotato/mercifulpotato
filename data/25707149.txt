That seems to be all Apple is asking for here - just moderate out the illegal content and you can come back.<p>That only seems hard to do for conservative groups - everyone else seems to at least try to moderate, even if they do it unevenly or not quickly enough, they try. These deplatformed companies and actors don&#x27;t ever seem to even try to moderate.<p>I don&#x27;t feel bad for them, personally.')
