It&#x27;s simple, good for synchronization, backing and searching, good for regular text with minimal formatting, but not good for code snippets unfortunately. I&#x27;m open to alternatives (but don&#x27;t want to bother with versioning).<p>Overall, taking notes isn&#x27;t a solved issue for me. I mostly like pen and paper as a thinking tool, but I&#x27;m not able to archive and search them, and it&#x27; slower when writing pure text.<p>Maybe a &quot;Remarkable&quot; would be a good tool, but I&#x27;m not sure I want even more screens and devices I already have.')
