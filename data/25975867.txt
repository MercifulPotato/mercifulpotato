The problems were different. When you are living them in the moment, they are every bit as large as your problems are now.<p>And fwiw, people in the 90s looked back on the 50s and thought “oh what a simpler, happier time.”<p>It’s a filtered lens you’re using and you are deluding yourself if you think that any time before you had it simpler and happier simply because they did not have “X” or “Y” that you do today.<p>How about date rape epidemics in the 90s? And women’s right and outlook for careers and equal pay?<p>LGBTQ rights? Hahahahahah<p>I mean, I can go on if you want?<p>I’m guessing you were a kid in 90s so things were simpler and happier for YOU because you did not have to worry about adult problems?')
