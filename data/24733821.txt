But isn&#x27;t this a TOS violation? I&#x27;ve thought about using GH actions as a generalized cron for online stuff and that feels like it walks the line (e.g. re-generating my static site via a Netlify webhook so it can update comments or whatnot). I feel okay about it because the static site is what&#x27;s contained in the repo.')
