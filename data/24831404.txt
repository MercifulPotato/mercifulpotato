I learned to read when I was a kid because I saw my parents doing it, and engaging in it taught me to love it. A lot of math I learned early on just as I was growing up (I figured out multiplication on my own, for instance). But by the time school started &#x27;teaching&#x27; me things, I chafed at it. I hated being told what to learn, hated having to follow the classroom&#x27;s pace, etc.<p>The same has held true in my adult life too; given a problem to solve or an interesting thing to explore I&#x27;ll learn. Even things I -hated- in high school and college (such as foreign languages), I am engaging in learning on my own as an adult because I -want- to.<p>Given a better environment, most kids will want to learn. The problem is school forces it on kids, without investing in showing the kid why they would want to learn it in the first place (i.e., the reason &quot;when will we ever use this?!&quot; is so stereotypical)')
