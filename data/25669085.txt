You could export your address book and move to a client&#x2F;server you trust more and notify all your contacts from the new location.<p>This is the same story on Matrix and what I mean when I say it is a freedom respecting decentralized service.<p>You are also free to run your own DNS to a dedicated EMS instance then later point to your own self hosted server later much like the freedom you have using your own domain and MX records on Google Apps allowing you to later move to a new email provider without having to update your social graph to change your address.<p>On Signal, there is no such option. You use their clients and servers forever, or GTFO.')
