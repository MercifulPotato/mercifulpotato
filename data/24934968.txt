Like I get that legally they have the right to protect their IP, but realistically, what are they worried about? That this game is a threat to sales of their actual game? Or that people would think this is a legitimate Mario game and get a bad impression of Mario and never buy any of their other games? Both scenarios seem hilarious.')
