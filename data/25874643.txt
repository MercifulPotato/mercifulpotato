Item(by='simongray', descendants=None, kids=[25898732], score=None, time=1611340858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874334, text='My comment was basically (paraphrasing here) &quot;given that my understanding of the problem is it that it can be pulled off using simple constructs X and Y, seems like most people wouldn&#x27;t need to pull in framework Z&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s puzzling to me why you _wouldn&#x27;t_ want to &quot;pull rank&quot;, as you say. I did not pretend to be an expert in this domain. I&#x27;m really just exposing my knowledge and speculating about why people apparently aren&#x27;t using this framework, which is what the damn submission is about. Did you even read it?<p>It seems like I managed to piss off a bunch users of the framework, who - rather than simply explain in clear terms why I&#x27;m supposedly wrong - instead just downvote away and make passive-aggressive comments that assume I&#x27;m some sort of troll.<p>Remind me to never engage with the Rust community again. Jfc.<p>Edit: Oh, so you&#x27;re the creator of the framework? If you go straight to calling people toxic when they have questions about it, I think I understand why no one wants to use it.')
