As it&#x27;s too cold and slippery for them to workout outside, and they arent fit enough to do other exercises<p>I was wondering what equipment do you folks consistently use that is fun to use or helped you build a habit to use regularly that got you back in shape<p>Im using the rogue echo bike i love it, and i never had any issues with it nor with the delivery. It doesnt seem to be a good equipment for some people like my mother that is below 5&#x27;4<p>Im thinking of canceling my peloton as i ordered it nov 1 and was suppose to be delivered dec 20. but this is the second time they told me that it would be delayed again and  they cant give me an estimate. It was suppose to be  one of my best option that i had with better nutrition to help my parents exercise and lose weight')
