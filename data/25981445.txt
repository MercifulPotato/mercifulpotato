If that&#x27;s the value you bring, then I don&#x27;t need your company. What value do you bring that I can&#x27;t get somewhere else?<p>Also, red flag: mis-use of the term DevOps for marketing purposes.<p><i>&quot;There are a few ways of thinking about these files named ‘Layerfile’:&quot;</i><p><pre><code>  - Auto-discovered Dockerfiles that build entire virtual machines instead of containers, just as quickly.\n  - Define a tree of virtual machines. Each subsequent layer can inherit all the running processes in its parents.\n  - Trigger specific actions like build, push, test, and deploy in parallel every time you push new code.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not explained well what benefit there is to using VMs rather than containers. Later on it briefly mentions possibly better caching than Docker containers. If it&#x27;s actually better than Docker, you are <i>severely</i> burying the lede. &quot;Better than Docker&quot; should be on the front page. It&#x27;s also not explaining whether I need to throw away all the time and money I might have already invested in containers, or what this is and isn&#x27;t compatible with.<p>A lot of this solution is really built around optimizing one specific problem, which is caching during re-running whole CI pipelines. This limits the viability of your business. As soon as your customers figure out a new way to solve this problem, they don&#x27;t need your custom platform anymore. I would consider LayerCI more of a specific feature of a much larger offering.<p>(In particular, the &#x27;correc&#x27;t way to solve this problem is to stand up an environment for your PR and structure your CI so you only re-run the parts that affect the particular change you want to make, rather than re-running the entire pipeline. It involves putting more thought into running your pipeline but often means the only tasks that get executed are copying a file and restarting your app)<p>P.S. You&#x27;re installing the yarn GPG key and then not doing anything with it. Your node setup script isn&#x27;t installing the yarn repo or yarn itself, so this is a throwaway command.')
