No arguments there. However, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve <i>seen</i> any sort of marketing push for mechanical watches. I just don&#x27;t see any marketing for them whatsoever.<p>The question for me is, is it because the marketing situation has changed? Or is it because watches are kind of an &quot;old guy&quot; thing and we&#x27;re all five years older than we were five years ago? Personally I feel it&#x27;s the latter.<p>But, I can think of two indirect possibilities from the marketing side of things.<p>1. There has been kind of a marketing push from newcomers like Daniel Wellington and MVMT on Instagram. That&#x27;s all overpriced trashy quartz stuff. But, I suppose it gets people thinking about watches.<p>2. Much like the rise of Starbucks got a lot of new people thinking about coffee 20 years ago, I think the success of smart watches got a lot of new people thinking about watches.')
