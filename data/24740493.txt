I didn&#x27;t feel the need to do any calculations.  You can just eyeball it and see one went from roughly $600 to $900 and that is obviously a 50% increase and one went from a little above $1000 to a little above $1800 and that is obviously around a 80% increase.  Those are all nice and easy to process numbers even if they aren&#x27;t exact.  There is a big enough gap in the results to be confident that whatever margin of error existed in my estimates it is clear that the developer salaries grew at a faster rate.')
