I think I might start a petition that is free to sign up on though, thank you for the inspiration!<p>It is possible to analyze those files on the pc, it just takes a much longer time. The analysis is an iterative process and so the faster the computers the faster the iterations and process go. I was analyzing them on my pc with python for the first year until it got too slow and my I am using an aws server with some rust and that is going much better. I also need to increase the number of files analyzed by about two orders of magnitude soon as well.<p>Great idea, very cool. That’s going on the todo list!<p>And I am going to be reaching out to and speaking with whoever is interested. One of the fun things about this is that it is an international dynamic, with some jurisdictions having abilities that others don’t. For example, the UK CMA has subpoena powers that the US Congress lacks and got a ton of information out of Google and Bing that shocked me. The US has the ability to get the CEO’s to show up to hearings while the UK does not in the same way. Why limit ourselves to one government when there are so many to mix and match from here?')
