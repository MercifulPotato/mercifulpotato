I haven&#x27;t been following closely. But Why? They should have made at least some profits. And use those for R&amp;D.<p>And if it was done for Non-Profits, why did it take the EU another 3 Months to put a stamp on it?<p>And honestly it is very common to have Supply from different site for different region for all sort of reason. Transportation cost, safety, Time to Delivery etc. If everything you said were true ( and I dont have time to Fact Check everything ), then EU has only themselves to blame.')
