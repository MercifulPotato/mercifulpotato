It was (here also) a problem with timers. Once the problem was identified, correcting it took 15 seconds.<p>I sometimes worry that in healthcare it&#x27;s the other way around: doctors do an immediate diagnosis and then months (or years) are spent trying to fix what they think needs fixing. Isn&#x27;t it possible that we are doing it wrong and are not actually getting to the bottom of things?')
