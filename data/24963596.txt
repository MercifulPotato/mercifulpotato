But like reference types in Clojure, it’s how you express “the world is stateful, my program usually is not, but for this exceptional case my program interfaces with the world.” I <i>don’t</i> think React hooks are a good way to signal that, but they’re one of the ways people who prefer FP in real world use do it. I think Redux type solutions are a better signal in some cases, and the rare stateful class component has is better in others. I hope hooks don’t take over the React ecosystem, but if they do I’ll be looking for other solutions similar to earlier React with regular functions and stateful escape hatches.')
