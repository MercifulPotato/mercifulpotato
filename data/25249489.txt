It was essentially a set of OBJ mesh keyframes that get linearly interpolated between, for the smoother animation you see in Quake 2 character models when compared to Quake 1. MD2 was what it was called. One of the first things I wrote as a 3D game developer was an OBJ loader, and then an MD2 loader.<p>Carmack&#x27;s code is something I&#x27;ve always admired.
