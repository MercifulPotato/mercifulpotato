Adopting a terminal based workflow requires to tinker with your system (systemd, sh scripts, building certain repo for a tool you want etc.).<p>Pros of GUI-max:\n- You don&#x27;t have to spend hours learning and configuring things.\n- Certain tools are just better when they are built out in a GUI for you. I think here in particular of C&#x2F;C++ debuggers, it&#x27;s hard to get a nice experience in the terminal.<p>As for objectively &quot;scoring&quot; it&#x27;s hard to assign real values.\nYou could eventually measure speed. I have worked in production support solving a lot of benign problems on a day to day basis. This is when I adopted my terminal based workflow. It was way faster than my other teammates using desktop apps.')
