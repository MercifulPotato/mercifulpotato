Some points:<p>You only note negative things, not positive things. This colors the whole post.<p>You use italics and &quot;Oh,&quot;, which makes it more conversational, and it sounds exasperated to me.<p>Your questions at the end could be construed as rhetorical, rather than constructive, partly because you suppose an answer.<p>Suggesting that the games that are there exist because they are &quot;easy to program&quot; could be seen as a negative comment on the creator&#x27;s programming ability or drive.<p>As the poster of this link and someone who enjoys the games a lot, I think your criticism about lack of variety is valid (if out of place for a collection of free games) and your phrasing wasn&#x27;t aggressive or anything, but the above are some points that I watch out for in my own writing, particularly the first one - even if I don&#x27;t like something, I find it useful to point out positive aspects to make it clear I&#x27;m trying to be constructive.')
