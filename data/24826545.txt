Remember, we&#x27;re not even talking about user-serviceable. Just, you know, serviceable.<p>&gt; This is a borderline physically impossible problem that&#x27;s just not worth it to solve.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t you not have said the same about any aspect of AirPods before? No wire between them? Smooth hand-off?<p>I mean, think about it, they were able to miniaturize all those parts, solve all the difficult electrical engineering and software challenges, but somehow they&#x27;re just physically incapable of finding a non-permanent battery attachment mechanism? Do they not have access to all the world&#x27;s best mechanical engineers?<p>&gt; No, seriously. Let us sit down and compute this:<p>We agree creating tons and tons of waste, well that&#x27;s bad. Where we apparently disagree is that because this is a &quot;small&quot; amount of waste it doesn&#x27;t matter. As though a lot of small amounts of waste together do not form big waste? If we let Apple get away with building thoroughly unrepairable devices, why would we stop anyone? And suddenly we&#x27;re right back where we started.<p><i>Everyone</i> needs to engineer with reparability in mind, and yes, the biggest tech company in the world is a great place to start. Especially one with 50%+ margins, as thus, could very easily afford to try.<p>As a final note, to be clear, I didn&#x27;t suggest adding a screw. I suggested threading the base. However, I am not a mechanical engineer, those are the folks who I would trust to come up with a solution to this problem.<p>I&#x27;m not even arguing about this per se, I reject the theory that anyone who believes in reparability is a luddite and that there&#x27;s no way to increase the wealth of nations without being as aggressively wasteful as possible.')
