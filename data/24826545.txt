Do they not have access to all the world&#x27;s best mechanical engineers?<p>&gt; No, seriously. Let us sit down and compute this:<p>We agree creating tons and tons of waste, well that&#x27;s bad. Where we apparently disagree is that because this is a &quot;small&quot; amount of waste it doesn&#x27;t matter. As though a lot of small amounts of waste together do not form big waste? If we let Apple get away with building thoroughly unrepairable devices, why would we stop anyone? And suddenly we&#x27;re right back where we started. <i>Everyone</i> needs to engineer with reparability in mind, and yes, the biggest tech company in the world is a great place to start.<p>As a final note, to be clear, I didn&#x27;t suggest adding a screw. I suggested threading the base. However, I am not a mechanical engineer, those are the folks who I would trust to come up with a solution to this problem.')
