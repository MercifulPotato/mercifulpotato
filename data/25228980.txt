My rote memory has always been fairly poor, to the extent that I believe my relative academic success compared to my peers has come from being forced to attain a deeper understanding of topics just so I can derive test answers from base principles. I find going through the Anki decks to be seriously draining, especially when encountering the same words I&#x27;ve seen a dozen times and still can&#x27;t readily recall what the hell they mean. However I&#x27;ve yet to discover a better method for me, since I am not enthusiastic about the idea of immersing myself in Japanese media for large amounts of my free time.')
