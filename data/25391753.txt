So good in every way.<p>This game actually helped kickstart my foray into digital music recording, because I loved the music from Ares and wanted to extract the music files from the game so I could listen to them.  Turned out the songs were stored as &quot;MADH&quot; resources and I saved them out to individual files -- and it turns out these MADH files were a &quot;tracker music&quot; format created by and playable with the software &quot;PlayerPRO&quot;.  Thus all the first songs I ever created on the computer sounded a lot like Ares&#x27; music because I ripped all my samples from the game&#x27;s songs!  hahah :)   Wasn&#x27;t long before I realized I can use any audio file though, and recorded all kinds of stuff to create new sounds with.<p>Either way, I forever can credit Nathan Lamont and Ares for being the reason I discovered the world of computer-made music.  (yes, I still remember his name today lol)')
