I.e., it has proven to be a satisfactory &quot;store of value&quot;.<p>Gold is a poor medium of exchange, too, but that has not prevented it from being a satisfactory store of value.<p>(Yes, I know that gold actually was a common medium of exchange at one time; it was displaced centuries ago by the greater convenience of paper money.)<p>Some visionary types hoped Bitcoin would disrupt government-issued (paper) money and governments and banks generally. The fact that these hopes were dashed does not mean Bitcoin will not remain an OK place for to park money.')
