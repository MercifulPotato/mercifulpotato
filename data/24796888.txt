Children are not tried for crimes as adults (most of the time), because we understand their lack of capability, but that also means they cannot drive, drink, vote, sign certain contracts without an adult, etc., and small children can be coerced by their parents to an even large degree.<p>Either you are an adult and can participate in society, but then you have to take responsibility for your actions, including going to jail, mental illness or not.<p>Or, mental illness excuses you from responsibility due to limited capability, but then your rights can also be restricted accordingly.<p>The choice for someone committing a crime and claiming mental illness should be jail, or involuntary treatment.')
