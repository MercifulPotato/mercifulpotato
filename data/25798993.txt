Even after decades of programming, I would scroll right past this line in JS without noticing the off-by-1 error here. The only saving grace is that this error will occur consistently.<p>But yes, I&#x27;d take Rust&#x27;s xs.last() in a heartbeat. Especially because you can assign through it with last_mut().<p>That said, I agree with others in this thread. People fixate on the 1 based indexing of lua but you get used to it pretty quickly once you spend time with the language. Lua&#x27;s real problem is its sparse standard library and its weak package ecosystem. If history had run its course slightly differently, I could easily see lua ending up inside web browsers instead of javascript. And becoming much more popular as a result. Lua and javascript are <i>remarkably</i> similar languages semantically.')
