They installed pipes reaching down into the water layers that contain lots of carbon dioxide and used a pump to move water up. As the pressure decreased, less gas could be dissolved and created bubbles which rise and take water with it[1]. After an initial powered pumping, the process is self-sustaining and continuously transports unproblematic amounts of carbon dioxide to the surface. This prevents built-up of dangerous amounts of carbon dioxide dissolved in the water and a disaster as it happened in 1986.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lake_Nyos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lake_Nyos</a><p>[1] similiar to an air-lift pump in a pond')
