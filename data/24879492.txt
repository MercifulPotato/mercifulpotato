That’s why people use them</i><p>Now try the same line but with heroin, or fast food, or whatever people use to their detriment...<p>Besides, anything that has value also has an opportunity cost, which can be much more important than the value inherent in the thing...<p>&gt;<i>Here’s an example: I want to take public transport to a grocery store. I walk out the door. I don’t have my phone. First of all, if I don’t check the opening hours of the store before leaving, I now have no idea.
