The salary is great (paid similar to non-bayarea west coast), but the job interview was the same process as with the coasts and there were a lot of good and experienced applicants per position since this is one of the best-paying opportunities here.<p>Personally, I strongly prefer this to the hustle and bustle of the big and expensive cities - that&#x27;s my preference though, and I know that it&#x27;s not for everyone.')
