Sure, there are factors beyond an airline&#x27;s control; but an airline, far better than random passengers, is in a financial position to model the risks and hedge against them appropriately.<p>Automatic full ticket refund if the passenger doesn&#x27;t receive a published amount of legroom and width. Oh, the airline would rather sell the same spaces to 2 people, hoping they will work it out and fit? Sure, but then only collect money from one of them, not both.<p>Automatic partial ticket refund if the luggage isn&#x27;t at the carousel within N minutes of arrival. Thus an incentive to keep a few more baggage handlers on shift, making their work more better also.')
