(Instead, it’s probably 1. the fact that you’re using the same credentials for physical missile access as you are for missile launch, and 2. the fact that your regular janitor is expected to clean the missile silo.)<p>In this case, the security model of Wayland is the same kind that Windows and Android already have: preventing “low-integrity” apps from screen-scraping “high-integrity” apps. In other words, preventing a random webpage running in Chrome from stealing your credit card details sitting visibly in a sibling text-editor window.<p>(Or, of course, preventing you from Twitch-streaming your playback of DRMed Netflix video. That’s a use-case that “needs supporting” too, given that the alternative is that type of video not playing back on the platform at all.)')
