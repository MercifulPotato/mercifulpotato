The Qualcomm SoCs in devices like the Surface Pro X are more efficient than Intel chips, but they are much slower for everyday tasks even on native ARM-compiled code. Emulated x86 code is even worse, as the slow cores are further held back by Microsoft&#x27;s emulator implementation. Users may like better battery life, but they also despise waiting for their computer.<p>Apple Silicon does not make any of these tradeoffs. ARM code screams on the M1, and even emulated x86 code runs with comparable performance to the Intel Macbooks. Battery life is better across every workload. To the user, selecting the M1 over the Intel chip is a no-brainer (except for some edge cases like 32GB+ of RAM, where Apple has largely left the older products in place). This is the same playbook that made the PPC -&gt; x86 transition successful as well.')
