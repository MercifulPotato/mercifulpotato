Item(by='simonebrunozzi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608890217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531009, text='I personally like Keith Rabois&#x27; and Ben Horowitz&#x27; material, in the list provided here. Those two individuals have built stuff, have suffered through painful moments in their entrepreneurial life, and have helped several startups do the same (with money and advice).<p>I am less of a fan of the rest of the material, but that might be just my preference.<p>I keep seeing lots of &quot;bashing&quot; when Sam Altman writes or says anything, and I&#x27;m not sure why. Agreed that he has his own way of interacting with the world, which sometimes suggests (at least to me) that he&#x27;s living in a very thick bubble, and&#x2F;or that he&#x27;s not really able to be empathic with &quot;normal&quot; people. But besides that, I think he&#x27;s a decent human being and his intentions are good, which in my book is more than enough to cut some slack and appreciate what he can offer.<p>I am also sometimes a critic of YC&#x27;s material and &quot;cool aid&quot; approach, but again, I just try to take what works for me and simply ignore the rest. YC has the great merit of having democratized part of the process.<p>I think that right now founders have usually a decent deal; VCs are the top of the food chain; and early employees, and then mid-stage employees, got the shorter stick. But it&#x27;s overall much better than it was twenty years ago. Again, IMHO.<p>On &quot;how to start a startup&quot;, it&#x27;s almost the year 2021, and I think that while some principles apply, we might need new ones; and that large corporations are making it harder for startups to succeed. E.g. try to build and &quot;enterprise IT&quot; startup, and you&#x27;ll quickly see some sort of competition from AWS, Azure and GCP (in descending order), way earlier that what it would have been 10 years ago.<p>Or try to build b2c stuff, and wait for the big guys to show up at your door with a competing product or service very quickly.<p>I still admire the ones that start a startup these days. There&#x27;s a huge difference of &quot;opportunity cost&quot; between white guys with a Stanford&#x2F;MIT&#x2F;etc background and a wealthy family behind them, versus a &quot;normal&quot; set of founders from a non-US background and very little money as a backup plan. I root for the latter, perhaps unfairly. I want to see more &quot;rags to riches&quot; stories, I want to hope that inequality and unfairness are going down in the world.<p>And finally, I also hope that instead of simply building &quot;something that people want&quot; (YC&#x27;s motto), we see more and more people building something that is good for the world.')
