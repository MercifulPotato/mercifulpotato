I grew up in one of the most deprived areas of the UK. My own parents and my friends&#x27; parents were all earning barely above minimum wage. But nobody really even struggled to own essential items like pots and pans, bedsheets, shoes etc. Most can even afford their own car if they want to. Even the poorest are well beyond material necessity. I think maybe you just set the bar between necessity and luxury a bit too high.')
