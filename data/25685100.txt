Space is used very efficiently and you can live quite far from central Shibuya &#x2F; Shinjuku &#x2F; Chuo while maintaining a 20-30 minute commute by train.<p>Another factor is that in Tokyo, most people do not own a car.  Commuting by train is significantly cheaper than owning a car, and many companies will even pay for your train pass.')
