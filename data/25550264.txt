Boomer independent sole-proprietor businessmen such as this electrician &#x2F; internet IT guy trend heavily right-wing.  His social isolation is evidenced by the gift of houses to an unaware single mom.<p>When the MSM loses credibility, people such as the bomber are set adrift to seek truth in hostile seas swarming with clickbait.  Success in small business does not translate to epistemological accuracy.  His failure to obtain a family to sublimate his death drive is a sign of societal breakdown.  When sufficient numbers of combat-capable men fail to reproduce, they initiate violence, regardless of the proximate trigger.  He reminds me of a less-intelligent, less-alienated Unabomber.<p>Given those facts, I&#x27;m comfortable deprecating the much weaker Dominion-AT&amp;T angle.')
