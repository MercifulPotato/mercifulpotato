However it made creating those estimates take an order of magnitude longer - developers needed much much more time to absorb all the details.<p>At that point I decided I only ever want to work with senior developers who have good imagination and can give reasonable triplets (solution, # of devs to do it, approximate time) for requested pair (idea, quality level).')
