But it doesn&#x27;t always mean that.  Sometimes it can mean excited agreement.  But when it doesn&#x27;t, it can be really painful, since it feels like you don&#x27;t want to have an argument every time you open your mouth, or get cut off mid-sentence every time.<p>I think in the end what it really comes down to is do you feel respected?  A lot of this gets back to imposter syndrome as the root (not communication style, although they may be correlated), and toxic people.<p>On the other hand, I can also not be interrupted and still be disrespected.  Just because someone waits until you are finished doesn&#x27;t mean they are listening.<p>(And yes, I am a woman, and I do feel that it&#x27;s harder to feel respected than it should, but it&#x27;s not always about interruptions)')
