We have laws for good reason. If I really wanted to get even, he’d be dead (capital punishment). He deserves it. He fought hard against the well-being of his employees just save some money and boost his own compensation.<p>Now I’m against capital punishment, so I don’t want him dead, nor do I want treatment withheld for the disease he’s suffering, even if he did the same for many others. But I’ll be damned if I see him get a penny of that money before he spends his own first. That’s justice enough, and I think that’s downright generous, far more generous than he deserves. And that, my friend, is what makes me the better man.')
