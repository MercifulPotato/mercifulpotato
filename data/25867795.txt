For good or ill, &quot;antifa&quot; is a just a label for a wide variety of groups that aim to fight &quot;fascists&quot; in the streets. These range from random leftists to the somewhat unhinged, who indeed get regularly banned for overt calls to violence. Which is to say there are no &quot;top Antifa accounts&quot;. Twitter bans all sorts of people regularly for all sorts of things.')
