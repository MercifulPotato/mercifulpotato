Maybe it WAS found on the front page of some infinite scroll through crap but the desired image is nowhere to be found when you click through and get whatever new crap replaced it on the front page.<p>- Alternatively you get served a smaller sized version of the image.<p>- Not only are the filters not shown by default in google image search vs bing in mobile firefox google opted to disable that functionality meaning you had to load the slower desktop version of google for the tools to filter by date or other details to show up. This wasn&#x27;t a bug it was a deliberate design decision to attack a competitor that they ultimately reversed later.<p>- Google image search seems to deliver subjectively worse image search results. I realize this is hard to quantify.<p>- On the broader google search issues you actually need an extension to be able to right click on a link and copy the url to share it because otherwise you get something like this<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ24eN86HuAhWlGjQIHY9pAmwQFjANegQIHRAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThis_is_a_test&amp;usg=AOvVaw1KpiL1SKMGAZK2BW1z-C9V" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;c...</a><p>instead of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;This_is_a_test" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;This_is_a_test</a><p>It&#x27;s pretty amazing to break sharing a damn link. The addon to fix this requires worrisome permissions to the data for google.com<p>Also the search &quot;this is a test&quot; without adblock doesn&#x27;t show any of the textual results on the entire screen on a 24&quot; 1080p monitor. Screen 1 and 2 are a video, exhortations to buy the song, people also search for videos and finally some actual results on screen 3.<p>Google is basically 90s Lycos with lots of extra money and reach. Everything google does other than ads and chrome ranges from acceptable to just canceled. They do lots of things OK but nothing excellent.')
