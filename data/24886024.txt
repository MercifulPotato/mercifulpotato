I am using xdg-desktop-portal-wlr and it works quite good. I was able to present my desktop to others without significant hiccups. Once Electron enables Ozone (and builds with PIPEWIRE on) we will be able to use screen sharing also on teams and other electron-packaged apps. This obviously works for my workflow and I understand it won&#x27;t work for everyone. I don&#x27;t know about Zoom, but I heard (and thus not entirely sure) it works only on specific distros with some specific GNOME versions.<p>EDIT. I misread Slack for Zoom.')
