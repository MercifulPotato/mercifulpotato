For those who understand the mechanism, it&#x27;s clear that 2020 is going to be a bad year for people in terms of chronic pain. It doesn&#x27;t need to be.<p>I like Dr. Sarno&#x27;s work but his thinking around TMS is IMO the weakest part.<p>The main insight is really just the fact that a lot of pain doesn&#x27;t reliably map to any physical conditions. Beyond that we don&#x27;t know too much. We can infer the brain is involved but not necessarily how. Dr. Sarno takes a psychoanalytic approach focusing on repressed emotions and so forth. But one can come up with many other explanations. One&#x27;s ideas about pain itself may be a factor.<p>If deep seated psychological problems were to blame it wouldn&#x27;t explain how so many people get tremendous relief by simply reading the book.')
