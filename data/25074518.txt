Many people have chosen to promote the lie that the vast majority of COVID deaths can be dismissed using this reasoning, rather than a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction.<p>They ignore the overwhelming &quot;excess deaths&quot; number and pretend that unless a person had COVID and COVID alone listed, with no co-morbidity, it doesn&#x27;t count, and therefore 99+% of COVID deaths aren&#x27;t COVID at all.<p>This is, of course, not true, as the excess deaths numbers clearly demonstrate. If anything, we&#x27;re <i>under-counting</i> COVID.')
