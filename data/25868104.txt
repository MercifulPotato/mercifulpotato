Amazon is being a good actor by all accounts. On top of that Elastic is like a 15 billion dollar company, if that&#x27;s not working, i need to get going on a business venture that doesnt work.<p>Anyways what makes you think they would be succesful if they used the license from day 1. Having your cake and eating it too only works if you switch halfway through.')
