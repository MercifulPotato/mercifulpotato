I always assumed the term describes a category of software engineering practices.<p>In all of the software things I&#x27;ve participated in, the main driver for any tool, application, library etc. was always data and data flow. Data comes from some place and then gets processed and displayed or consumed. And from these requirements a higher level view, an architecture so to speak, emerges.<p>As someone who works in small teams, I have never even heard of most of the tools mentioned in this document. The business focused language is very repelling as well. I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;m too simple minded and incompetent or just live in a completely different world.')
