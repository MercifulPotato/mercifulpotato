Often this is accompanied by shaming&#x2F;annoyance if you&#x27;re not interested in joining in.<p>I don&#x27;t mind people trying to make friends at work, and often I don&#x27;t even dislike the people who annoy me like this, I just don&#x27;t like them as much as they seem to like the idea of spending time with me. There&#x27;s a gap between people I like making smalltalk with before a meeting or while I&#x27;m taking a break to get coffee, and people I want to have a dedicated social time with.<p>If you want to make friends at work, don&#x27;t use the mechanisms of my employment to coerce me into spending time with you.')
