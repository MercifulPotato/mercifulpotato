This, coupled with highly inefficient ways of delivering results, appointment dates&#x2F;locations, or inefficient locations in general (e.g. you reside in city X yet you have to appear in person in city Y that is 200km away just to submit a form).<p>This can be especially heartbreaking when one has to take a time off just to appear in city Y, spend money on transport, and then find out that the only person that can accept the application has not arrived to the office, and so the whole trip was for nothing (personal experience).<p>Countries seem to have a hard time explaining spending money on efficient dealing with immigration.
