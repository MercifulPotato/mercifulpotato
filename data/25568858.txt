I was always under the impression that &quot;paved&quot; (or similar) streets were pretty easy to get right (and can possibly be obtained from a governmental agency?). For smaller footpaths I always assumed that they were using movement data (the same they use for traffic forecasting) to detect where they are.<p>They also resumed Streetview in parts of Germany this year, and I&#x27;m not sure they ever fully stopped running them for private data collection.')
