With the end of the Cold War,  with no enemy to unite to two half’s of the country it’s back to where we were 100 years ago.<p>I also live in Trump country and I hear all this nonsense, the “Trumpism”, and slogans etc, are nothing more than racist White people feeling empowered.<p>It’s the explosion of the repressed racism held in by some white people.   That’s why they complain about Politically Correct, they can be openly prejudiced and it kills them.<p>These people know Trump didn’t win, they know there was no cheating, but it’s all they can say to support their hate, if they say anything else they know they be outed for who and what they are.')
