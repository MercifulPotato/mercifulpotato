It&#x27;s the approach we use too - everything is downloaded via a Service Worker for offline support, and it&#x27;s very responsive as nothing needs to wait on the network, unless the user chooses to (e.g. saving their work to Google Drive).<p>Chrome 86 also introduces the File System Access API [2] which is the icing on the cake - you can get read&#x2F;write access to actual local files and folders, bypassing any issues about IndexedDB limits or persistence. I think this is one of the last pieces of the puzzle to make tools like Electron and NW.js more or less redundant, as now you can just do it directly in the browser and not have to ship the whole runtime around to everyone as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.construct.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.construct.net</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;file-system-access&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;file-system-access&#x2F;</a>')
