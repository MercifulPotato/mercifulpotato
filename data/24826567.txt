Item(by='theandrewbailey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603117106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822920, text='&gt; A dollar is not backed by the government, gold, army, or anything else. It is simply backed by public trust.<p>Trust in what, exactly? That people will accept it? What if they don&#x27;t? Like someone that has a stick up their ass such that they want money from you, but won&#x27;t accept your dollars? Ever read the part of bills that says &quot;This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.&quot;? That&#x27;s because money is ultimately backed by government force. You can take your debtor to court and they will force him to accept your dollars. Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have that luxury.')
