Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=[25841285], score=None, time=1611102344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839582, text='&gt;&gt; why should society care that Taylor Swift gets more views on TikTok vs her personal website?<p>Because I know what the motive of TaylorSwift.com is. Its to promote Taylor Swift. I don&#x27;t have to question it, I don&#x27;t have to ask myself, &quot;Are they promoting Taylor Swift because they like her political ideology, or because she makes a lot of money for TaylorSwift.com, or &lt;insert a million other questions that I haven&#x27;t asked and a million more I&#x27;m not smart enough to think of&gt;?&quot;<p>Sure, an argument could be made that visitors of root_axis.com aren&#x27;t being exposed solely to what root_axis has to say, that in fact, root_axis.com is a Latvian honeypot designed to capture users information for the express purpose of Latvian national security interests. But that&#x27;s a crackpot argument that is far less likely than say, TikTok&#x27;s purpose is not just to generate money but to gather data about users for the CCP. You&#x27;d be <i>more</i> insane not to see that as a byproduct of TikTok, given ByteDance literally has CCP ties through and through.<p>&gt;&gt; what about all the people that get essentially zero engagement despite having access to those platforms and having something worthwhile to share?<p>This actually makes my case against the dominance of a platform or monopoly. Why are these people getting zero engagement? Are they bad at SEO? Did they not pay the Google tax? Are they being unfairly targeted because of &lt;insert any potential reason&gt;? Hard to say, nowadays.<p>&gt;&gt; Is this something we should care about though?<p>To answer your last question, I don&#x27;t know. Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t. I think these are serious problems though, and they&#x27;re going to require serious thought. Or hey, maybe VisageTome, Honker, PopTalk, DingDong, and Immediapost overtake FaceBook, Twitter, SnapChat, TikTok, and Instagram and it all sorts itself out... who knows?')
