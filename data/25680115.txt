It is extremely difficult to tease things apart and find the truth in this environment. By exposing yourself to a source you are opening yourself to be being unduly swayed by that source. Unless I am prepared to sit down and investigate the story, the sources found in the story and follow up with my own research, then I will not expose myself to it.<p>I have not investigated this story thoroughly, but I have tried to get to the bottom of many other stories.

Imprinting our own thoughts and values and goals into the stories we tell. Barely aware of our own motives.')
