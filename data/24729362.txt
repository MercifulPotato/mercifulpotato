Item(by='auto', descendants=None, kids=[24730124, 24729509], score=None, time=1602247841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723800, text='After going back and forth on a chair replacement, wanting a Herman Miller like I had at the office, but not wanting to actually <i>pay</i> for a Herman Miller, I ended up picking up an &quot;AKRacing&quot; model on mass drop after watching a ton of reviews.<p>Coming from a automotive background, here&#x27;s the thing no one seems to point out about these racing &quot;inspired&quot; gaming chairs (presumably because the people reviewing them have never been in a proper racing seat); the chairs have a similar silhouette to racing seats, complete with the totally unnecessary channels for a chassis mounted five point harness, but they have literally none of the actual supports of a racing seat.<p>I bought this expecting a pretty aggressive built-in lumbar support, along with tight lateral support berms on seat sides.  Instead, they try to makeup for the lack of actual lumbar support with a crappy pillow attachment, and despite being 6ft and ~200lbs at the time of purchase, the seat wouldn&#x27;t be snug for a person 50lbs heavier than me.<p>A proper racing seat is meant to keep you in place, and while you obviously don&#x27;t need to overcome the same forces at your computer that you do while racing around a track, I&#x27;ve got lingering back issues from a lifting injury and spend a ton of time in front of screens; I was expecting something that would keep me snug and in place, and this thing is not it.<p>These days I&#x27;m on the prowl for a cheap Aeron, because now being stuck at home without my office adjustable standing desk, the gaming chair&#x27;s deficiencies are becoming glaring.')
