I first found out about that with slickdeals.<p>The one thing I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use with it is the zapper. Adblock plus&#x27; &quot;zapper&quot; just worked and always prevented that pop up or whatever from showing. Ublock just stops it from showing again after you do it after the page load. Then it&#x27;ll pop up again.')
