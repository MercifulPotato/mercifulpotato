In fact, as I type this on PC my iPad is sitting next to the monitor. All of that is most definitely &quot;getting work done&quot; to me.<p>I also find it useful if there is something I want to research or a document to read to go and sit away from my desk - I much prefer an iPad to a laptop for that kind of thing.<p>Indeed, I find the combination of a full sized PC <i>and</i> an iPad to be preferable to a laptop - which is neither as powerful and ergonomic as a full sized PC or as portable as a iPad.<p>edit: In fact I do have a work laptop, but I left it in the office in March and have never been back... I don&#x27;t miss it!')
