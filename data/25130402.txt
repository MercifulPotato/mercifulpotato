It&#x27;s also not about programming specifically; it&#x27;s simply a common distribution in many metrics of performance.<p>The rule of thumb Peopleware states is that you can rely on the best outperforming the worst by a factor of 10, and you can rely on the best outperforming the median by a factor of 2.5. This of course indicates that a median developer, middle of the pack, is a 4x developer. Obviously, this is a statistical rule, and if you&#x27;ve got a tiny sample size or some kind of singular outlier or other such; well, we&#x27;re all adults and we understand how statistics and distributions work.<p>Peopleware uses Boehn (1981), Sackman (1968), Augustine (1979) and Lawrence (1981) as its sources.
