Usually you get around this by actually doing the work beforehand and swapping it out, or doing something simple and then saying that this isn&#x27;t actually representative which is easier and doesn&#x27;t require a cut but can lead to the issue we see here. Again, I can&#x27;t fault them for choosing to do this, but I can still say it ended up being a poor choice.')
