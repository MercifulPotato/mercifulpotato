I mean, property damage is a stones throw too far, given that the government has listened and responded, and created laws which don&#x27;t remove access to courts for anyone with a dispute.<p>But yes, any violence to property is truly abhorrent. Incidentally, I am pro agri reform. I would <i>never</i> trust this government to execute anything though. Seriously, a bill which removes your right to legal recourse? Your only succor a tribunal run by the ministry?<p>Even then, they are not trying to redo the bills, they simply want to push it off to a later date.<p>To be honest I do hope everything they want passes, and that everyone who voted for them stays behind in the glorious country. I suspect there is no other way that the mechanistic, command and control mindset prevalent throughout the country will removed.')
