Which puts things like WASM in a <i>very</i> questionable spot (particularly things like WASM in the kernel), but Intel &amp; AMD probably don&#x27;t care about that too much. For web browsers all the major ones just gave up on in-process sandboxing and that&#x27;s why we have things like per-iframe process sandboxes now ( and then reduced privileges in-process iframes with the &#x27;sandbox&#x27; attribute: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;?search=sandbox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;?search=sandbox</a> )')
