It keeps me from having to look stuff up, and is much nicer navigable than command line imho.<p>My problem with such answers is not that I don&#x27;t want to have to memorize git commands (with all the flag  and sub command variations, git config entries etc.).<p>My problem is that the guys from the discussions about..\n... blender, vector graphics programs, Xcode, rider, gcc, apple notarization command line tools, brew, pip install, the python3 standard library, emacs, vim, the terminal and ssh, my Synology&#x27;s time machine configuration, my book keeping and tax program, Django library, the c# standard library, my insurance policies, my smartphone, smart home and my Samsung smart tv, ...\n... all said that it&#x27;s not so hard to memorise these few simple steps or commands, and that I should rtfm.<p>Not sure how useful of a retort that is to the criticism &quot;X is too hard to use&quot;.')
