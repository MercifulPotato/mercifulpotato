Item(by='zaarn', descendants=None, kids=[25454045], score=None, time=1608194280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452207, text='The user manager directs things like user services. That can be things like starting pulseaudio on a desktop machine, for example, or gnupg on general systems so the user has a gnupg daemon available in their own UID space. This alleviates putting them into .rc or .profile files and making them hard to manage in case they fail.<p>In this case, GNUPG is trying and failing to start (likely misconfigured), this in turn means system failed to start the likely only user service configured, hence it fails the session setup. The session is still created (managed via logind) to provide a shell and PAM environment.<p>On a non-systemd this stuff would be managed by other scripts and tools that do essentially the same thing (minus being able to start user services).<p>It also creates a slice for the session, which enables systemd to kill all processes created in a session when the session ends (logout), minus some exceptions that can manage themselves (like Tmux). Helps against people who forget that they backgrounded and nohup&#x27;d a script (which isn&#x27;t a good way to do things that are supposed to keep running).<p>If you want to see what services are available in your user session run &#x27;systemctl --user&#x27;.')
