Certbot is a complex beast that generates TLS configurations, has multiple plugins that likely require specific system configuration, and is I think charitably more than &quot;a glorified Python script&quot;.<p>The rationale makes sense for me:<p>&quot;While the Certbot team tries to keep the Certbot packages offered by various operating systems working in the most basic sense, due to distribution policies and&#x2F;or the limited resources of distribution maintainers, Certbot OS packages often have problems that other distribution mechanisms do not. The packages are often old resulting in a lack of bug fixes and features and a worse TLS configuration than is generated by newer versions of Certbot. They also may not configure certificate renewal for you or have all of Certbotâ€™s plugins available. For reasons like these, we recommend most users follow the instructions at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certbot.eff.org&#x2F;instructions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certbot.eff.org&#x2F;instructions</a> and OS packages are only documented here as an alternative.&quot;')
