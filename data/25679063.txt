The thing was notable by the fact that it had feature parity with HW Direct3D implementations of the time and worked by dynamically compiling D3D shaders into x86 code (which had the interesting feature that it used ESP as general purpose register).<p>IIRC the idea behing Intel&#x27;s Larabee at least partly involved running pixomatic on that hardware.')
