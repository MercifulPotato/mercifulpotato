But I&#x27;ve never had that happen and I have a siren set to go off if the steam tanks get under 25% and a constant combinator button I can press to insert fuel manually if that ever happens.<p>of course, by the time I got that going, I also had the breeder reactors working fine and with them in place the nuclear cells are really hardly expensive anymore.')
