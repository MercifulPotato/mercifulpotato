They might have been fed garbage propositions that explain their garbage conclusions, but calling them insane, crazy, &lt;pick-your-favorite-slur&gt; is just a cop out of discomfort of the dialogue and co-existence, through the way of sub-humanizing them.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s wrong, and if your epistemology won&#x27;t let you say it&#x27;s wrong, your epistemology is broken, not vaccines.<p>I’d say on the contrary, “epistemologies” that demand purity and certainty (ideology is a better term for this) don’t tend to explain reality well and because of that they don’t survive in the long run. They are inherently maladaptive.')
