If that makes sense.<p>Sure, the components of postfix are not standalone tools, they are very much like systemd. One codebase (monorepo, yaay, old is new), sharing a lot of common internal code.<p>In the end multi-process composite (like oracle and postgresql RDBMSes) or a multi-threaded monolith (like MySQL or anything that runs on a JVM) is not that big of a difference nowadays. Both can be performant, both can be maintained well&#x2F;efficiently by big teams and by a one-man-army (see how postfix is mostly maintained by Wietse Venema).')
