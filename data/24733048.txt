If you can not talk about abortion, birth control, sexual&#x2F;gender discrimination, gay marriage, and more because it is controversial then we might be getting in to an area where speech is so restricted that it impedes knowledge transfer and understanding on those topics.<p>And you can research and discuss those topics outside of work.<p>You&#x27;re not being paid to show up to work and form PACs. You&#x27;re not being paid to show up to work to virtue signal about the most fashionable wedge issue of the day. You&#x27;re not being paid to show up to work and sow discord by assuming moral high ground and vilifying the other side. etc., etc.<p>&gt;In order to have an informed populace then need to be exposed to things, sometime controversial.<p>The political culture status quo at Bay Area companies is that this is an alt-right talking point.<p>&gt;If you remove a reasonably large mechanism for that, conversation at work, it will have political consequences.<p>Conversation at work absolutely should not be a large mechanism for political discussion. It&#x27;s work. If there are political consequences because workers are no longer allow to virtue signal all day, then that speaks more about their weak mental state than it does about politics.')
