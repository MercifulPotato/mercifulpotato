Item(by='ignoranceprior', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608603624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502084, text='Yeah, it also annoys me when people assume that all of 4chan and 8chan is &#x2F;pol&#x2F;. 4chan has plenty of blue boards like &#x2F;sci&#x2F;, &#x2F;g&#x2F;, and &#x2F;tg&#x2F; that are relatively decent if you can tolerate shitposting, trolling, and bants. When people write racist stuff, a common response is that they should go back to their &quot;containment board&quot;. 8chan used to let users create their own boards, and there were plenty of inoffensive ones. On the other hand, I do think 8chan&#x27;s &#x2F;pol&#x2F; was just so terrible that it made 8chan overall a definite net-negative for humanity. Even the site&#x27;s original founder has disavowed it at this point. I also agree with you that mainstream sites like Facebook have their own problems.<p>But still, whenever I see free speech platforms, they tend to attract a majority of far-right users. I think it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re the ones who most often get banned from mainstream platforms and need to find alternatives.')
