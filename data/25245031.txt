Item(by='Jetrel', descendants=None, kids=[25245448], score=None, time=1606656973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25242865, text='&gt; The antidote to bad speech is more (hopefully good) speech, not less speech.<p>I used to think that humans could convince each other of facts using logic and rhetoric.  Disagreements would get aired out, and the better &quot;done in good faith&quot; argument would win.<p>I think our problem is that, as you know, humans are subject to a ton of logical fallacies and &#x27;hack vectors&#x27; of rhetoric (see also Shopenhauer&#x27;s 38 strategems).  If we, participating in or viewing an argument, fight to overcome these, we&#x27;re able to have debates of rhetoric - the &quot;truth&quot; wins out in a debate.<p>But it&#x27;s a lot worse than a situation where some number of people didn&#x27;t learn this in school, or can&#x27;t be bothered to cut through the logical fallacies.  Rather, the problem is that these particular kind of lies have a seductive capacity - they &#x27;feel right&#x27;, because they operate in the part of human speech and human logic that&#x27;s driven by our instinct, rather than driven by learned behavior.  People aren&#x27;t neutral, and evenly likely to pick the lies versus the truth - they&#x27;re overwhelmingly more likely to pick the lies, unless they&#x27;ve both deliberately trained themselves not to, and also personally value objective truth over feeling good.  Most people don&#x27;t - even scientists struggle with this.<p>Not all lies are seductive like this - but the kind that slot into &quot;tricks of debate&quot; absolutely are.  They&#x27;re the bread and butter of con men.<p>This is why every formal &quot;forum of debate&quot; - in the sciences or academia et al, has it as just a basic rule that they can just get shown the door immediately if they&#x27;re caught lying.  If you just straight-up-lie on a paper getting submitted to i.e. Nature, it can ruin your career.  It&#x27;s why perjury is a crime - because lies of that type just have far stronger evolutionary fitness compared to truth.  It&#x27;s because the rule-setters in these fields care more about reaching the objective truth than they do about feeling good - and they know how dangerous this is, so they treat it with a scorched earth policy.<p>---<p>I believe we&#x27;ve been able to get away with free speech because - thus far - most of our media wasn&#x27;t <i>censored</i>, so much as it was mandated to be &quot;true&quot;.  You could say whatever you wanted as long as it was plausibly true - people fudged stuff all the time but it generally couldn&#x27;t be bald-faced lies.  As long as that was enforced, then what you said about &quot;good speech being the antidote to bad speech&quot; could work.<p>But for a few decades, we&#x27;ve had no such enforcement of truth in lots of our media, especially the internet, and I believe the number of people believing outright falsehoods has gotten an awful lot worse.  Dangerously so.')
