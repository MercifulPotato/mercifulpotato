For me, the first sounds quite clearly like extortion.<p>The first case would get you likely in trouble. The second case would routinely cause a further review in any decent program, and if there&#x27;s any merit to it, you get a higher bounty.<p>Nobody is forced to participate in any bug bounty program. If people feel the reward is too low, they should not partake.')
