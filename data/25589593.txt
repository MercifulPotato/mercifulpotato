You need to be scientific and have a mathematical theory on how humans learn language, which is a multi disciplinary task requiring physicists, mathematicians, neuroscientists, cognitive psychologists and linguists. Benchmarks are useless, theories, models, experiments  and testable predictions is how science progresses. You’re making a comment on cognitive science, and trying to imply that language learning in humans isn’t learned, but pre baked. The psychological, linguistic, evolutionary biology and neuroscience evidence doesn’t seem to corroborate. The evidence points stronger to humans having general learning and problem solving abilities. For instance, there was no evolutionary pressure for humans to be good at math or programming. I was not born knowing english or calculus or probability theory, these were learned abilities. Evolution favoured brain mechanisms that lead to behaviour for success in a rapidly changing world. Had I been born in ancient Rome as a farmer, I would learn to speak Latin, and learn how to be a successful farmer, instead of the physics, math, probability, computer, driving, reading skills that I learned in my life time.')
