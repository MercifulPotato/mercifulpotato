Not so your boss.<p>I know what you mean, but I think there&#x27;s an alternate way to look at this.<p>Every time I&#x27;ve moved jobs, I really look at it as firing my boss.  The process is pretty much the same as firing someone:<p>* First, I voiced my concerns and gave my boss a chance to improve.<p>* When he wasn&#x27;t improving, I began searching the job market to find his replacement (my future boss).<p>* After a few interviews, I found a replacement that was a really good fit for the role of &quot;my boss&quot;.<p>* I let my old boss know that his performance had not improved enough, and I was forced to let him go, but I wished him all the best in his future endeavors.<p>* I gave my new boss a start date, and so far everything is going great.')
