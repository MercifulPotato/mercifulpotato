I don&#x27;t think I said those groups were militia groups specifically, and I don&#x27;t think the comparison is such a stretch since there are other commenters making the exact same leap to the IRA.<p>My contradictory wording is likely to be a subconscious defense mechanism of sharing my opinion on the internet. I have not claimed any specific knowledge or authority over this event or even in defense of my own speculation here. In full transparency, the only reason I posted was because people were going all in on the &quot;heist&quot; theory, which I find ridiculous.')
