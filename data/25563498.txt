Figure out someone&#x27;s future earnings to determine their &quot;credit worthiness&quot;. Just like buying a house. And the student&#x27;s collateral is the future labor. So assess how the loan will be used. Just to be sure everyone&#x27;s committed, pick a fraction that is repaid directly. Say 50%. Then plug in the numbers.<p>Someone going to community college to get an AA to work as a dental hygienist will need X dollars and likely earn X&#x27; over the next Y years. Another person is getting an MD PhD, who will earn 10x the future hygienist. So future doctor is eligible for a proportionally larger loan.<p>Tweak the incentives to encourage people to choose more needful professions.
