For example, I live in Canada. In the winter, I only see the sun a few minutes a day. I start the workday in the dark and finish it after the sun has set. If I see the sun, I&#x27;m most likely while I&#x27;m in my car driving from my house to the grocery store during the weekend.<p>Keep in mind that sun exposure through a glass window will not be enough to trigger the production of vitamin D.<p>Unless I ate enough fish to make me sick, I&#x27;ll get vitamin D deficiency.
