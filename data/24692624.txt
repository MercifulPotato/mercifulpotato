You have &quot;structured programming&quot;, &quot;object oriented programming&quot;, &quot;functional programming&quot; and now &quot;data oriented programming&quot;.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see is paradigms paired with &quot;where this works well&quot; rather than paradigms sold based on &quot;this will solve the software crisis&quot;, &quot;this works better(unqualified by when)&quot; and &quot;if you&#x27;re not doing this, you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;. The later two claims leave a bad taste in the mouth of the casual users&#x2F;observers, who gradually morph into active critics and sink the paradigm, wasting the good and useful parts of each (OOP has a vast universe of haters because it&#x27;s most successful of the panacea-paradigms so far and as a panacea, there&#x27;s much to hate here but still).')
