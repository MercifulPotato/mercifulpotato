WSL2 is virtualized and much faster.<p>Windows is plenty fast these days, but if you want it to be fast you have to do things the windows way -- conemu, powershell, chocolatey, etc. You can and should also use emacs and vim natively on windows (not via WSL). I use gvim on windows and it works well with these Microsoft tools. I can even send text from vim to conemu as a means of using a REPL. I just set up a python shell or clojure shell on conemu and I&#x27;m good to go.')
