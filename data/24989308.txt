That sounds great for all sorts of media and streaming!<p>However the fine print looks to be that this may not hold true for Chrome and streaming &#x2F; YouTube, but offline videos with certain players because Chromium doesn&#x27;t support hardware acceleration for this API. Chromium supports VAAPI, this uses libva. <i>sigh</i> Why does this Linux hardware decoding story always repeat itself. :-(<p>Still, raw CPU may let it manage at least 1080p at 30 fps but I can&#x27;t say for sure for anything more.')
