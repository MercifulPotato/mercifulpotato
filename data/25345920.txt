But I&#x27;m going to guess that for most people, the point of using headphones is have their audio portable and&#x2F;or to not disturb other people. I don&#x27;t think many people use them because they explicitly like the experience of audio playing &quot;between the ears&quot;.<p>As to &quot;why&quot;, people might actually prefer the (emulated) experience of a point sound source, as it could closer resemble talking to someone physically present (calls) or listening to a live performance.')
