I do web application security stuff (glorified xss detector), i&#x27;ve personally felt that the most useful tools by far are the browser dev console and curl, but ymmv.<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t meant that, sorry if I made it sound as if I expected people to solve CTF tasks during SE interviews<p>&gt;Just wanted to encourage people to do cool stuff :)<p>Oh i definitely agree, ctfs can be a lot of fun.')
