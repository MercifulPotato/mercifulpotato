The actual <i>technological</i> change — aggregating restaurant menus and allowing consumers to order from them via one interface — is orthogonal to the discussion here. We&#x27;re talking about the specific business practices that companies implementing that technology have settled upon.<p>I&#x27;m putting the blame on platforms because the change they&#x27;re pushing involves predatory behavior without consent of the restaurants. That wasn&#x27;t inevitable in any way — it was a deliberate choice made by delivery platforms to redirect money from restaurants to their investors.<p><i>&gt; Who are you to decide that this is wrong and that people should not be able to order food for home delivery?</i><p><i>&gt; You are also ignoring another already stated point: Restaurants are not required to offer takeaway.</i><p>These are both straw men. No one is saying that people shouldn&#x27;t be able to order delivery. No one is saying that restaurants are forced to offer takeout. No one is even saying that delivery platforms shouldn&#x27;t exist!<p>The point is that the onus should be on delivery platforms to get restaurants to <i>opt in</i>, not on restaurants to be vigilant against predatory middlemen moving in without warning. That&#x27;s where this starts and ends.')
