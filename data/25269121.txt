I had always shied away from trying hard to find a great gift. I was afraid I would give a terrible, terrible gift (I&#x27;m not great at receiving gifts). Someone I dated years ago had a talk with me about the joy of giving gifts and I&#x27;ve worked on improving. It&#x27;s actually a lot of fun. A little listening and preparation turns you into a thoughtful gift giver.<p>I also find it quite satisfying to sneak around and ask family or friends about what we should get so-and-so. It doesn&#x27;t always work out well but people appreciate you trying and sometimes you really nail it.')
