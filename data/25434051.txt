Always had firefox installed on my phone, but it was just too slow and buggy before. When the new FF mobile came out as preview it pretty much became my only browser. I&#x27;ve used chrome maybe max 3 times last month. It&#x27;s way faster in my experience. Ad-block works great (one of the issues I had with previous FF on android, extensions would easily bring it to a crawl), and I like how they reworked the UI, I still can&#x27;t believe nobody thought about putting the location  bar on the bottom before.<p>I do also see the blank screen rendering from time to time. However, I have encountered similar things on chrome as well, typically a refresh fixes it. There are some webpages that really don&#x27;t seem to want to render on FF mobile though (not sure if because of UBO or something else), that&#x27;s the only time I switch to chrome.')
