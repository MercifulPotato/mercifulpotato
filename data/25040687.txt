Even a job that you can complete in an hour is easily $100-200 worth of direct engineering costs.<p>I think the real problem is that most developers naturally plug in the value of their time on a hobby project&#x2F;in school (which is ~$0&#x2F;hr) when deciding if a time-cost tradeoff is worthwhile. Since the answer is almost always no if you incorrectly value time at $0&#x2F;hr and management usually can not do the analysis themselves, management pattern matches and determines that spending money on developer tooling is essentially never worthwhile and that sums like $5k (which few people would spend on personal projects) are outrageous. If the correct time-value analysis was done, you would get outcomes more like electrical engineers (who generally make less than high-end software developers) where companies will spend literally $50k&#x2F;yr&#x2F;engineer on tooling to make them 50% more productive since that actually makes perfect business sense based on the amount they are being paid. In contrast, if you went to management in a software company pushing for a $50k&#x2F;yr&#x2F;developer expense they would probably laugh you out of the room or require some totally outrageous improvement like 10x for everybody.')
