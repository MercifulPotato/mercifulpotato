They probably have had other channels that got banned. That is pretty much the only reason he has multiple channels, otherwise of course it&#x27;s better for 1 channel to have more content.<p>* The channel that got verified probably got verified only because they added the disclaimer that these are animal actors there, otherwise this content would not have been allowed by YouTube at all. They seeded that channel with safer videos, got verification, then started being more degenerate with the content. After being verified once, the channel is not really checked.<p>* They reused the description because they&#x27;re not the best at English; and they reused animals because they probably were able to find a limited number of them. Both being quite stupid mistakes that they now would have erased thanks to this video.<p>1k American views = $3-5 revenue from ads; I haven&#x27;t done the math but they could be making $500-2000&#x2F;week. That&#x27;s more than enough to live in Vietnam, where these animals are culturally part of their diet. Vietnam also has a culture of &quot;MMO&quot; i.e. &quot;make money online&quot; and has rich forums discussing YouTube ranking techniques, advertising and seo tricks, etc.<p>The sad part is, these channels will probably be deleted but they&#x27;ll be back within 1-2mo with new channels.<p>Source: My company does a lot of YouTube and internet marketing; I previously had hired Vietnamese marketers, designers, and devs; and I&#x27;ve been there.')
