I didn&#x27;t know she was a Nun initially. She just wore rather conservative clothes and had very close cropped hair. Generally she was very serious about education, but once she was explaining something in Genesis and she said something casually dismissive about &quot;fairy stories&quot;.<p>My overall take was she was a serious academic who had side stepped the social expectations of 1960s Ireland by taking vows and then getting on with her work.')
