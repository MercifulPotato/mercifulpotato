The second that happens all you get is inflation and that helps nobody other than people who think &quot;chart up and to the right == OK&quot;. Points are planning tools. That&#x27;s it. No company metrics, board level metrics, bonuses, performance evaluations, etc should be measured on team or individual point velocity ever. Period.<p>You DO need to measure the teams output and the way to do that is to measure two things at once. You need to measure the deployment frequency AND the quality of the application at the same time. Report your deployment frequency and uptime together in one page if you have to. Evaluate teams based on team output. Evaluate individuals based on known criteria - the least of which will be coding.')
