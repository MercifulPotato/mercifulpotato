Instead, it uses algorithms to prioritize displaying certain information over the other (sometimes in direct contradiction with the user&#x27;s wishes, where their friend&#x27;s posts are ranked lower in the feed in favour of some unrelated bullshit).<p>Ultimately the problem is not <i>just</i> Facebook but the whole business model of advertising and engagement. Now this normally wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal if people were aware of it and alternatives existed, but people seem to be oblivious to it (and the mismatch between their interests and Facebook&#x27;s) and network effects make starting an alternative impossible (plus Facebook would abuse copyright laws to shut down any alternative services that would interoperate with them).')
