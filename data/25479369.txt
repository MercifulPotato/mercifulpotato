Trying to simultaneously support high end PCs, and lower end last-gen consoles (PS4 and Xbox One) with a 2020 release was just foolish.<p>I think it would have been a fantastic game if it was a console exclusive, or a launch title for PS5 and Xbox One along with PC (since many CDPR fans are PC players). Yes this would have limited how many copies sold, but it would have set them up for building a long term franchise too.<p>Half measures to support their last gen console support was ultimately what killed their PR for the game.')
