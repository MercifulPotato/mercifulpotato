It works nice for Wayland applications, but X11 ones are blurred (as in upscaled from @1X). X11 includes Chrome and all the Electron apps, so I it would not be a popular choice... hence it is hidden by default.<p>If you want to try it, it is `gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features &quot;[&#x27;scale-monitor-framebuffer&#x27;]&quot;`')
