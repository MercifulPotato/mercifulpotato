Firefox now remembers your preferred location for saved bookmarks, displays the bookmarks toolbar by default on new tabs, and gives you easy access to all of your bookmarks via a toolbar folder.<p>I don&#x27;t see a lot of use of Bookmarks toolbar, bookmarks menu, and other bookmarks when there can be simply bookmarks and other bookmarks like Chrome. Bookmark toolbar makes menu utterly useless. I would rather have toolbar and an extension that displays those bookmarks toolbar in a similar way as menu to avoid added cognitive load.')
