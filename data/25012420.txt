I don’t trust my team.<p>I really feel over billed (I pay US prices (over six figures per year per programmer) even though this team is in South America) and they have failed over years to really provide a quality service. Not only that but they over bill me and I frequently catch it. Why don’t I switch forms - well, I’m scared I’ll have a worse experience with another firm, that I’d have to share the code base with someone else, and it would take another team a long time to learn the code.<p>So, I micromanage my billing, which sucks. Then I also micromanage the team - the design, the dev progress, etc. Why I do this is they don’t get it. I tell them to organize projects better and they don’t. I tell them how customers are interacting with the software and why we’re building new features and design doesn’t get it. I get software and it’s full of bugs which I have to personally test and the dev team says we should just launch.<p>I’m not going into super details here, but I’m on burnout constantly trying to deal with these people. If I were to let them just do their thing, my project would have failed long algo.<p>When you hve a vision, micro manage. If you’re at some firm where you are struggling to spend your overly massive budget every cycle, dont micro manage.<p>Big difference in big companies and small ones. If you’re not micro managing as a small startup, you will fail.<p>Ever seen a real rich person outsource to another firm, share their idea, and let the firm create everything in their own - that’s a bit fail waiting to happen. And the dev firm knows it and is happy to take as much money from you as possible.')
