The point of contention is around what constitutes &quot;best interest.&quot;<p>&gt; The interests of outsiders are simply not relevant to that<p>If this is so simple, why did it require an additional 500ish words to qualify it?<p>Your point seems to boil down to this:<p>In cases where there is a conflict between the perceived &quot;best interest&quot; of citizens and those of non-citizens, if the citizens haven&#x27;t specifically directed the government to do otherwise, the government should act in the perceived &quot;best interest&quot; of its own citizens.<p>But it&#x27;s reductive and short-sighted to say that humanitarian aid &quot;hurts&quot; one side and &quot;helps&quot; the other. For instance, the marginal impact of a U.S. dollar on a U.S. citizen&#x27;s productivity is effectively nil. But that same dollar spent in a third-world country would have much higher marginal impact. The productivity of that other citizen allows them to specialize and trade, and then everyone benefits in the long term.<p>The hyper-nationalism perspective that your country should take whatever it can at the expense of other countries is exactly what led to both of the world wars.')
