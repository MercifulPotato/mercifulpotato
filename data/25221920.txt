One of the most imporant aspects of modern parser combinator libraries is that a very small composable core can be exhaustively tested (importantly: with both hand written and random cases) to provide a reliable kernel for parser combinators.<p>Given that those cited parsers were built from the ground up to mesh with an effective and expressive type system like Haskell&#x27;s, this problem was significantly reduced. The downside, of course, is that it became quite opinionated.<p>There is no magic want to wave, but certainly it&#x27;s easier to work on a common minimal core of components than work on custom ad hoc validators. Lax parsers are not an inevitable outcome; they&#x27;re a decision propagated by decades of bad opinions being taken as gospel.')
