If not, the ruleset needs to be really good and as minimal as possible. Otherwise you&#x27;ll just get crappy but compliant code which isn&#x27;t helping anyone.<p>Also, it sometimes makes sense to leave suboptimal but old and correct code as-is to preserve the Git history or because the suggested change doesn&#x27;t actually make the code any better. And finally, these tools do still generate false positives. While it makes sense to thoroughly review each of these with a coworker, you should still be able to mark them as false positives.')
