When that happens, I can take control of the dream and do cool things like fly.  Usually this only lasts a minute or two and then I wake up.  But on a handful of occasions I&#x27;ve reverted to a non-lucid state, where I <i>forget</i> that I just figured out that I&#x27;m in a dream, and I lose control again.  It&#x27;s super freaky, and raises some pretty deep existential questions: who&#x2F;what exactly am I when I&#x27;m in that state?  How can I ever really be sure that I&#x27;m <i>not</i> dreaming?')
