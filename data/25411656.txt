That means that clients&#x2F;user-agents should grab feed updates from the original RSS, using ETags and Last-Modified to avoid unnecessary fetches of unchanged feeds. (Caching for temporary unavailability is normal and fine.)<p>&gt; <i>â€¦I&#x27;m not sure I understand why a feed source needs to know if a viewer is accessing the content via Brave or Chrome.</i><p>You brought this up, but it isn&#x27;t a concern I&#x27;ve expressed. Brave Today would ideally have a uniquely identifiable user agent for RSS metrics, but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s necessary.<p>(That&#x27;s all I have to say about this. Thanks for listening.)')
