It was one of father’s words— Rent to the ideal, to his own faith in human nature. You remember how he would trust strangers,  and  if  they  fooled  him  he  would  say,  ‘It’s  better  to  befooled than to be suspicious’—that the confidence trick is the work of man, but the want-of-confidence trick is the work of the devil.”<p>This quote links back to this article and mentions the cost of closing yourself off and growing distrustful, which is really losing faith in human nature and kindness.<p>Interesting read!')
