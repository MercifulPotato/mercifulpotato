Twitter has long refused to answer exactly how many of its users are bots as a percentage of its user base, Facebook did the absolute bare minimum in cooperating with Senate Intelligence in 2017 relating to Russian propaganda, etc.<p>Kara Swisher said it best in an interview with Preet Bharara around the time of the Russian propaganda scandal: &quot;The Russians didn&#x27;t hack into Facebook and manipulate its servers. They were users of Facebook, they were users of Twitter. They used these platforms exactly the way they were designed to be used.&quot;')
