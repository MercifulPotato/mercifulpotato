Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a technical solution to it: the type system simply won&#x27;t stop you from making types that are way too complicated (unless you use a language like Go where the type system is intentionally lobotomized, which obviously comes with its own problems).<p>We&#x27;re used to avoiding complexity when it comes to <i>logic</i>, but maybe there&#x27;s less awareness when it comes to <i>types</i>. Maybe what we need is to have a bigger conversation around that so people realize it&#x27;s something that needs to be on their radar.')
