By analogy, consider John Boyd&#x27;s OODA loop.  He broke down goal-seeking behavior into a 4 part loop: Observe Orient Decide Act.<p>Now, some numps decided that they would then teach people to be better thinkers by having them step through this loop deliberately.  i.e. We will teach you to reach your goals but first you must Observe.  Next Orient, blah blah blah.  This is not what John Boyd was teaching.  Everyone does the OODA loop naturally.  But if you break down goal-directed behavior into the OODA loop, as an analysis tool, you can find the techniques that are particularly effective versus those that aren&#x27;t working very well.  And if you can find things that speed up an OODA loop, or compromise your opponent&#x27;s OODA loop, you can have outsized success with an otherwise &quot;dull tactic&quot;.<p>PG&#x27;s essay is kind of like that.  He&#x27;s saying: here&#x27;s how I think about independent thinking, how to recognize it, where it works, and where it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s mostly descriptive and analytical, but nuggets of prescription are sprinkled in there as well.  It&#x27;s written for himself, in that it helps him organize his own thoughts, but primarily it is written for the benefit of his audience.  It will glance off people uninterested in accepting its ideas but benefit those are similar to him in important ways.  He&#x27;s not &quot;telling them how to think independently&quot; but helping them be more effective in the use of that tool.')
