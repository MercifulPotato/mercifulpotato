It&#x27;s very difficult when you have doctors--who society tells you to deeply respect--calling you a lazy liar.<p>I don&#x27;t think I would have been diagnosed if I didn&#x27;t have a supportive family who insisted it wasn&#x27;t &quot;all in my head&quot; and that I needed to keep searching for answers. It&#x27;s very easy to start believing what the doctors say, no matter how loudly your body is screaming otherwise.<p>And then there&#x27;s the opinions of general people... It&#x27;s surprising how ignorant highly-educated engineers can be about medical issues. Again, I credit my family and friends for having kept my sanity all these years.')
