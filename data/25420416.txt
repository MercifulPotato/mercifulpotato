What if we are a media publisher but than without worker rights and unions? Youtube.<p>What if we start a hotel franchise but without any regulation or oversight or liability? Airbnb.<p>What if we start a cab company but make all our employees independent contractors, ignore all regulations and put all liability and legal risk on the independent contractors?<p>Silicon Valley is nothing but a bunch of young spoiled boys asking themselves the most American business question of all: have you tried slavery yet?<p>Business model innovations where you make money while someone pays all the costs.<p>&gt;Is there a “right way” to do this that protects everyone<p>There is no investment if you do that, because the competitive advantage comes from the stealing. Nobody is investing in technology. Nobody is doing actual R&amp;D. It&#x27;s all about the viability of the scam. How profitable is this loophole?<p>We go out of our way to engineer protocols and technology and platforms that make it impossible to do that the right thing (by design). From p2p networks in the 90ties to crypto currencies. From YouTube to Spotify.<p>It&#x27;s a dog eat dog world and I&#x27;m not here judging any individual. But let&#x27;s not be naive.<p>Theft is the plan. Abuse is the strategy. Fortunes are not built on sweat. The people who work hard are the ones you hire to clean our house. The ones that pick our vegetables.<p>But we at least show the respect to others to not lie about the true nature of the successes of our industry.')
