I remember being taught it was something &quot;shifty&quot; Chinese people do to their food to make it taste better as a sort of dishonest competitive trick, at the cost of the health of their customers. I was told so many ethnic groups were &quot;shifty&quot; like this compared to the &quot;moral&quot; white majority. I think growing up in the USA means being exposed to a lot of different kinds of racisms and &quot;otherings.&quot; Its incredible how in denial some people are over this and how &quot;racism is dead, if it ever existed&quot; is a common theme in the USA, especially over the last 4 years due to presidential politics.')
