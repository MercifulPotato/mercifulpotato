There is absolutely no appeal for large technology-based companies do this once they can (the following is the lowest scale example) afford to maintain their own servers, while potentially renting a few offsite backups in other areas of the world (again, this is just the lowest-scale architecture starting at which Serverless is always the worse option).<p>Existing solutions are extremely over-engineered. It can be excused with &quot;officially planning for the use-case where maximum scalability is required&quot;, but it&#x27;s almost certainly a pretense to sell &quot;certifications&quot;, aka &quot;explaining our own convoluted badly documented mess&quot;.\nWhat this actually means is that many SWE&#x27;s who are good enough to learn to use Serverless effectively, can learn any other framework that allows building distributed systems across server nodes with equal effort. Why would I base my whole business on your vendor locked, sub-optimized dumpster when I can do the same on an infinitely scalable VM networks, that can be ported to literally any vendor who supports $5&#x2F;mo VMs (or, you know, self hosted if my company is large enough)?')
