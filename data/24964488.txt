Especially nerds. I&#x27;m a bit socially awkward, so I can never tell when it is a good time to start speaking. As a result I interrupt other people quite often. It&#x27;s not intentional, I just don&#x27;t know any better. I also don&#x27;t care one iota what genitals you have.<p>You should not assume malice on the part of your co-workers. Just because someone interrupted you doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t value your input. In the case when it&#x27;s obvious that they don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t hesitate to push back, but in most cases it&#x27;s not going to be anything of the sort. It&#x27;s just someone else being socially awkward while trying to wedge themselves into the conversation.')
