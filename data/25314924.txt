Frankly I think much of modern C++ should be rejected. If you want to use a language like with those features then fricken switch language! There are countless better alternatives today: Rust, Swift, D, Haskell etc.<p>Many are stuck on C++ for legacy reasons. I have worked in such large C++ legacy systems for many years in the past. The average programmer simply cannot deal effectively with this modern C++. It is too complex.<p>I’ve been down that road being exited about new C++ features only to realize that I’ve actually reduced the productivity of my co-workers.<p>Often I wonder if C++ programmers all suffer a Stockholm syndrome. They have come to sympathize with their hostage taker C++, making up excuses for the many ways C++ abuse and terrorize them.<p>I go to these C++ conference talks in occasion and I see people in ecstatic praise about how some genius C++ guru came up with an elaborate convoluted solution to something which is like two lines of code in a sane programming language.<p>Seriously I think C++ has drained so much of their brainpower that they have simply not been able to look outside and see how the grass is greener everywhere else.')
