Things as simple as an Excel file, or writing simple email filtering rules may expose you to _some_ programming.<p>As a side note - I believe this is going to be more and more true, especially among knowledge workers - I&#x27;m somewhat bullish on UiPath&#x27;s low-code app platform [+]. As programmers we understand well the benefits (and pitfalls) of automating our menial tasks, if you can lower the bar so that most people (like assistant managers, receptionists, call center operators etc) can do that - you suddenly start exposing much wider audiences to programming.
