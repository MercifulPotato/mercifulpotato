One of the (many) problems with static generators is that it&#x27;s really really really hard to get it to generate the code you want. It&#x27;s easy to get it 95% of the way there. But that last 5%? It&#x27;s brutal, and sometimes impossible.<p>A tool automatically does 95% and can be manually finished is very different from a tool that must do everything 100%.<p>A good rule of thumb would be &quot;use wordpress until you hit 50 posts&quot;. At that point decide what makes sense for your content. And at this point you should know what you want, so any choice you make is likely to stick.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend handcrafted HTML for most people. But I do think more folks should at least consider it. For my content it both gives more control AND saves me time. Even if I have to do a little grunt work every once in a blue moon.')
