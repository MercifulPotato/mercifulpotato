I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re from but news outlet projections are taken as the de-facto actual result of the elections until the official counts are certified, often days or even weeks later. Note that these projections (in France and the USA) come from official, if only partial ballot counts.<p>The only actual decision the news outlets have to make is to decide when to call the win when they judge that the winner is statistically almost impossible to change.<p>In France for instance we get the first projections at 8PM sharp, once the last voting places close. Nobody, including the politicians involved, wait until the the final count to concede or celebrate their results.<p>The only &quot;americanism&quot; I can see here is this odd electoral college system that leads to absurd situations where ~100k people effectively decide the elections for everybody else, while hundreds of millions in non-swing-states effectively don&#x27;t count. If there&#x27;s something worthy of scorn and foreign arrogance, it&#x27;s probably that.')
