Circumvention is defined in a different chapter[0] than copyright infringement, and there is no language to imply that circumvention is copyright infringement.<p>Besides that, there are requirements in 1201 that YouTube and youtube-dl might not meet.<p>* The technological measure being circumvented must be &quot;effective&quot;. There is a possibility that YouTube&#x27;s poorly encrypted URLs might not meet that bar. E.g. they evidently don&#x27;t work that well, and only the URL is encrypted, not the copyrighted work.<p>* Since you can freely receive a copy of the work by ordinarily visiting YouTube, it&#x27;s pretty questionable that the measures control access at all. E.g. Region restricted videos are blocked based on IP, not using this measure, and so youtube-dl can&#x27;t download them.<p>* &quot;use&quot; isn&#x27;t a right restricted by copyright. There generally isn&#x27;t a distinction between a copyrighted work that your computer transiently stores or saves (e.g. streaming vs. download). The violation would be in a license that you agreed to that specified additional restrictions beyond those offered by copyright (e.g. TOS violations).<p>* youtube-dl has to be primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumvention. That seems a little far-fetched since I think it might predate YouTube&#x27;s technological measures.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;1201" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;1201</a>')
