This has repercussions even now, when users are justifiably annoyed at a mass produced phone with a non functional camera app.<p>The Sailfish OS and Mer communities have had a working plumbing and porcelain stack for years (granted Sailfish&#x27;s UI is not fully opened source) but Purism insisted on bootstrapping their own instead of building on those. I feel like they could have forced Jolla&#x27;s hand to open source the last bits of their proprietary UI and everybody would have been happier.')
