Little things like Apple’s implementation of drag-and-drop being lost in this sea of ugly, slow Electron apps is something that you just can’t explain to Electron developers — they make for Windows first, they have no idea what Mac users complain about, and even when we tell them they think we’re being silly.<p>As per the comment to which I replied asked (although I believe GP asked in good faith): “why would you want to do that anyway?”<p>Because that’s how we do it on macOS. That could be <i>why</i> we use macOS. If you care so much about letting macOS users access your app that you went with Electron rather than writing something Windows-only, it shouldn’t be hard to learn to respect the Mac platform and, more importantly, its users.')
