There was an annoying streetlight outside and I wanted it darker at night, and the view was only of a parking lot, so I blocked off the window with a big piece of plywood, but it was about 1 inch too short, and the blinds behind it left also left about 1 inch uncovered, so there was about a 1 inch by 1 inch opening left uncovered.  And funny enough, I didn&#x27;t lose the view of the parking lot, as it was projected upside down on the opposite wall.')
