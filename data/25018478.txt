By removing other sources of power, their power grows.  An authoritarian&#x27;s ultimate goal in the US is to remove all checks and balances they can.<p>In comparison a libertarian aims to remove non-centeral government, like laws that effect small towns, schools and police forces in small towns, and so on, though each libertarian voter aims to remove different things, so not to mislead: Not all libertarians want to remove police, or schools, or roads, or whatever else.  What you will not hear is a libertarian wanting to remove congress or another form of checks and balance.')
