I really like using Macs, but my latest computer is a Dell XPS 17. This is not a cheap computer if you get the 4k screen, 64GB of RAM and the good graphics card. At those prices, you should consider the MBP16. The MBP is better built, has a better finish and just feels nicer.<p>Thing is, Dell will sell me an XPS 17 with a shitty screen because I don&#x27;t care about the difference and would rather optimise battery life. I can get 3rd party RAM and SSDs. I can get a lesser graphics card because I don&#x27;t need that either. I can get a more recent Intel CPU. And I can get the lesser model with a greater than 25% discount (they wouldn&#x27;t sell me the better models with a discount though).<p>I think some of the Apple Tax, is them not willing you sell you a machine closer to your needs, not allowing some user replaceable parts and not having discounts.')
