It’s all imported from California. It’s substantially more expensive than buying it from a vendor in legal state. I bought six vape cartridges a couple of weeks ago for $250.<p>All that to say, it’s already being taxed. It’s just that NYC isn’t getting the revenue.  If NYC does ever legalize it and taxes the hell out of it, I still bet I end up paying less.<p>I’m sure I could find a cheaper dealer but I trust these dealers and the quality is excellent.')
