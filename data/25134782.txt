Item(by='ohazi', descendants=None, kids=[25134931], score=None, time=1605691594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134332, text='&gt; The American public would demand a nuclear strike against China in retaliation<p>This... doesn&#x27;t seem likely.<p>&gt; If the US goes down - eg loses its top 30 cities - why shouldn&#x27;t it take every Chinese and Russian city with it? Try convincing the American public to not want revenge against anyone that has ever assisted North Korea.<p>Okay, I see where you&#x27;re coming from, but this was not the scenario being discussed. The scenario presented was &quot;NK lobs a single nuke at Los Angeles.&quot; The expected response is closer to &quot;US decapitates NK before they can fire any more, everybody shits their pants, but no additional nukes are fired.&quot;<p>Decapitating NK in one fell swoop <i>might</i> be possible... decapitating China is highly unlikely. The US should therefore <i>not</i> initiate firing nukes at China unless a substantial number of US cities have <i>already</i> been hit, because doing so would all but guarantee that those cities would be hit by China in the next volley.')
