Which is just the Fourier transform.</i><p>That statement is a bit muddled, let me unpack it. The infinitely many overlaps thing can be expressed mathematically as the convolution of the image with a function that&#x27;s one where the aperture is open, and zero where it&#x27;s not. The thing about the Fourier transform is actually related to a different phenomenon. When the slit is really small, you start getting diffraction effects. The diffraction bands are approximately the Fourier transform of the slit function. However that is not significant unless the slit is extraordinarily tiny.')
