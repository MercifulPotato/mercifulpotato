Personally I think Tesla is here to stay and perhaps Elon can expand the company into different markets and that could increase the value of the company. If the stock price drops a bit, that I think is fine.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automotive_industry_in_Thailand" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automotive_industry_in_Thailan...</a>')
