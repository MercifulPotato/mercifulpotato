It&#x27;s actually really big and awkward to place and has kind of a loud fan. Currently I have it propped in a corner since it&#x27;s too heavy to be held by anything that I have to support it. But it will light up a bedroom just as much as a window of sun will. It doesn&#x27;t look entirely like sunlight, but for the price, it does an adequate job.')
