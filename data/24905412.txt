I wonder how creators did not see this blunder beforehand.<p>I know the solution is to use 5GHz for WiFi but my dad has to take online tuition from a floor above me where there is hardly any 5GHz coverage and he can&#x27;t reliably connect to other band because I need to take my calls over Bluetooth headphones during same time. Now either I have to deploy another router on top floor or need to buy wired headset or continue taking calls from room on the other corner of the house where there is hardly any WiFi coverage.')
