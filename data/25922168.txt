You can&#x27;t look at just preparation when deciding if something is too dangerous.  The actual risk numbers are the important thing here.<p>If I&#x27;m driving 100 miles, and I do something sloppy that doubles my risk of dying in a car crash, the actual danger I face is less than the danger of skydiving just once with perfect prep.  If it&#x27;s also a special occasion where I&#x27;m going to get a huge amount of enjoyment out of it... the risk seems okay.<p>Even if we&#x27;re focused just on car safety, we should be far more upset when someone buys a car without top-tier safety ratings than about some one-off trip like this.<p>Being able to point at some specific danger, like a battery on the floor, is just bikeshedding.  What matters is the risk per day&#x2F;month&#x2F;year, and most of that risk is invisible.')
