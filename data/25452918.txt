The one very minor annoyance I&#x27;ve had with Dart that immediately pops to mind, and I think is going to be fixed soon (according to the github issue), is typedefs only working for functions. I personally think it makes things a lot more verbose and unnecessarily difficult to read at times ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>I certainly like it well enough to continue to learn and use both it and Flutter :)')
