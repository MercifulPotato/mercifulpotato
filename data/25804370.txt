Those scientific reports say that the lockdowns are at best useless.<p>At what point have the &quot;experts&quot; been right this year?  Which of those things should we have labelled misinformation?  Attempting to install a technocratic version of truth has never worked, and we should have the grace to allow &quot;wrong&quot; things to be said.  The experts, so-called, have been inconsistent and wrong through this whole debacle.')
