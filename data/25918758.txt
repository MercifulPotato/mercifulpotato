It&#x27;s got to be like those old blenders or fans... wait they still work; we&#x27;re cursed forever.<p>Want the Internet to be fast?  jQuery is a defacto standard that needs to be made native in browsers and then when called for not loaded as script but already existing as native code and management models.')
