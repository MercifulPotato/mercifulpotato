How thick does a cable need to be to move that much energy in that amount of time without overheating or being too heavy for a user to carry and plug into their car. Let&#x27;s say 100KWh battery, to be charged at 99% efficiency via a 99% efficient DC-DC converter in 10 minutes. That is a rate of 600 KW. Current HV chargers use 600volts, so that is 1000A current. 0000 gauge wire is rated for 302 amps, so we&#x27;ll use four such wires for VCC and four for GND, thus 8 total. That is eight wires, 0.46 inches diameter each. Must be heavy and unbendable, but let&#x27;s persevere. Copper&#x27;s density is 8.96 g&#x2F;cm^3. This cable assembly will thus weigh 11.7 kilograms (and that is without insulation) Given copper&#x27;s resistance (0.046 ohms per 1000 feel of length) at 0000 gauge, our cable assembly will be shedding ~24W of heat simply conducting this power. Toasty for user hands... I cannot even fathom the kind of connector required to allow for this current <i>AND</i> specced for thousands of insertion&#x2F;removals. Contact areas in connectors are a constant issue, and here it will be even more so.<p>You&#x27;ll also need to bend 8 half-inch-thick copper wires to plug&#x2F;unplug this... I am not sure many people are ready for the force that will require. Also copper tends to break if you bend it a lot, so you&#x27;ll need some other kind of conductor that bends, which means it will conduct less well, which means it will be thicker and heavier...<p>The alternative is a lighter cable with <i>active cooling</i> and higher losses. This has issues too (failure of cooling can snowball into a fire quite fast, coolant leaks are no fun, etc)<p>Now, back to our 99% efficient DC-DC converter. It will be shedding 6KW of heat, good luck cooling this, the battery charging at 99% efficiency will also be shedding 6KW of heat...same issue...<p>Basically, i am sure a small such battery can indeed charge in 10 minutes in the lab (~a 6C charge rate), and that is <i>VERY</i> cool, but moving 100KHw safely in ten minutes from anywhere to anywhere near live humans is a nontrivial engineering difficulty.<p>EDIT: \n why not higher voltage? arcing, insulation material limits, cracking, rain, costs')
