More companies refuse to pay inflated SV salaries (note: most companies in the world already do not employ people there anyway), so some of the concentrated SV talent leaves for other places like Chicago where they can still get a sufficient wage relative to the cost of living. This continues for a while and eventually the COL in SV will start to equalize with other places in the country like Chicago, won&#x27;t it?<p>Perhaps the real message here is that SV companies are realizing this is a perfect way to get out of paying $300-500K salaries for jobs that are more like $150K anywhere else in the US. It&#x27;s kind of like the outsourcing craze from 15 years ago, except instead of getting 3-5 developers for the price of 1 by going to Europe or Asia, SV companies can get 3-5 developers for the price of 1 that are still US-based and only a couple of timezones away.<p>As someone who doesn&#x27;t live in California but still near a big city in an area that is still &quot;expensive&quot; (but nowhere near SV prices) relative to smaller towns and rural areas, I can&#x27;t figure out if this remote shift is a good thing or bad thing for me yet. I fear that my suburban house will be worth less going forward because proximity to a major city may be way less valuable now if so many fewer people ever physically go into work anymore.')
