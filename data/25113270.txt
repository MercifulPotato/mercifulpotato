Nevertheless, that is a sweet idea, and there are other replies that suggested using a static site generator to generate one html file per short link, with each html file containing a &quot;redirect&quot; tag in &lt;head&gt;. This idea can definitely be combined with a GitHub action. Personally I feel that is overkill, because if I were doing something so elaborate, I would have opted for a simpler and more scalable option like Google Cloud Firestore or Firebase URLs')
