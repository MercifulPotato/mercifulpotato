Big-O is a mathematical measure, not a practical measure. Mathematically speaking we don&#x27;t care if malicious input difficult to construct. We care that its possible - which it is - so the upper bound on time is at least O(n).<p>If you think this isn&#x27;t useful in practice, you&#x27;re right! If you want to compare the actual speed of an algorithm, benchmark it. And once you&#x27;ve done enough of that, your intuition will guide you far better than big-O notation ever could.')
