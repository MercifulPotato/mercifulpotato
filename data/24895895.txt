When you&#x27;re talking naturally with a group of people, you don&#x27;t submit formal requests for the floor; you simply lean in and everyone subconsciously acknowledges the fact that you intend to say something. The speaker can naturally cede, or you can jump in at a suitable pause. Or you can back off entirely and that&#x27;s fine too!<p>The simplest way to accomplish this is through push-to-talk. Since you have to push a button before you can speak, the UI can highlight your speaker tile and allow others to acknowledge your intent. It&#x27;s much more fluid and natural than formally &quot;raising your hand&quot; and then having to rescind it if you decide to back off. The point is to provide low-level primitives that can become almost reflexive parts of video chats.')
