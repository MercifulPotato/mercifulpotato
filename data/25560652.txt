As this was meant to be a pet project, I really didn&#x27;t want to pay for it, so went with the wordpress.com free account.<p>A payment is actually not needed in order to use the Classic Editor with a Free site.<p>You can use the Classic block in the Block editor, which you can learn more about here - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;wordpress-editor&#x2F;blocks&#x2F;classic-block&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;wordpress-editor&#x2F;blocks&#x2F;classi...</a><p>There is also a possibility to edit or create any post or page in WP Admin, which will allow you to use the Classic Editor. Navigate to yoursite.WordPress.com&#x2F;wp-admin and then click on Posts or Pages in the left sidebar.<p>Next you can hover over any post or page title and choose the &quot;Classic Editor&quot; link below the title. If you wish to create a new post or page within Classic Editor, then please click the down arrow next to the Add New button at the top and choose Classic Editor.<p>We are also happy to answer any of your questions and try to understand why the editor is laggy for you if you send us an email via help@WordPress.com.
