Item(by='Gibbon1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609703354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620961, text='It has been 30 years, but there are FCC technical rules for consumer radio&#x27;s. There are specific rules for channel requirements. Includes the ability to receive on all defined channels in the alloted band.<p>The comment about banning single channel radio&#x27;s was from an old ham radio book. If you think about it an old school AM radio that works on a single channel can be made really cheaply. I think you only need one tube and a couple of components.<p>If you look online you don&#x27;t see anything about technical requirements. But you do notice that historically the FCC has had a serious bug up it&#x27;s butt about making sure no one could buy up all the stations in an area. So you can imagine what the old FCC thought about radio stations selling radio&#x27;s that can&#x27;t pick up their competitors stations.')
