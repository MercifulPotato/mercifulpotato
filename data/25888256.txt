Guyenet.  It looks at the neurology of eating, overweight and obesity, and there is a ton there.  Basically, most of the popular theories (insulin, microbiome, willpower, sugar, etc.) are only a tiny bit right, and the truth is predictably holistic, mostly driven by things that are not acting under conscious control.  There are of very interesting studies covered in that book.')
