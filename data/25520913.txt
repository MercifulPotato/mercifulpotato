Philanthropy may or may not have covenants attached and the philanthropist will have different levels of control: &quot;You must give these vaccines first to the teachers of my local elementary school&quot; or &quot;these must go to teachers in low income areas&quot;, etc.<p>That the rich person receives the vaccine for their money, ie a material consideration, makes this not philanthrophy by definition - it&#x27;s a sale. Or, put another way, me buying an overpriced handmade christmas ornament from Etsy isn&#x27;t philanthropy either, even if I&#x27;m choosing to really overpay.')
