(Haven&#x27;t touched it since.) Today, I&#x27;d have to pull the datasheets and spend a few days re-reading them to remember much of any of it.\n- 9 years ago I worked heavily with a large, legacy perl code base and wrote a bunch of internal web apps in perl. Again, I haven&#x27;t touched it since and again it would take me a while to get back up to speed on that language stack.\n- As recent as 3 years ago I was heavily into a 200~300k loc PHP code base that did some pretty complex stuff (think ERPish ). Again, I haven&#x27;t touched it much since then and again it would take me a few days to a week or so to get back into the swing of working on that code base.<p>This kind of knowledge is highly perishable if you don&#x27;t use it everyday. You quickly find yourself moving from &quot;knowing&quot; something to &quot;knowing how to find&quot; an answer to &quot;how did that go again?&quot;. It&#x27;s just the nature of the business.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean you aren&#x27;t good at or capable of picking those things back up, it just means you may need a quick refresher. Not being allowed to use references makes that artificially worse.')
