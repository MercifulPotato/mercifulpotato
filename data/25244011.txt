Now think of visa and mastercard that you use to charge your customers: imagine them also taking another 30% cut. That&#x27;s basically what is happing here.<p>Many here pretend that Apple, Google, MS - first layer platform hegemons - and Roblox, unity, Uber etc - second layer platforms - charging 30% is fair because it&#x27;s result of competitive market dynamics. But there&#x27;s no true competition between these platforms. Specially when you consider that the longer a user is in a ecosystem, the costlier it is to move away from it.')
