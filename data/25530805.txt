The original coin flip runs 230% the speed of your new RNG (that throws away so many results).<p>The Von Neuman method is a great way at demonstrating that removal of bias is possible, but not necessarily practical (especially at high bandwidth). In practice, you want to just cryptographic_hash(coin flips), which should maximize your entropy up to the entropy limit of 1&#x2F;2 the hashsize (assuming you have a perfect cryptographic hash function).<p>A 512-bit perfect cryptographic hash can only support 256-bits of entropy, due to the birthday attack.')
