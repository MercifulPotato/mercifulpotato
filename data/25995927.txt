Too much and you actually get worse. However they always make it easier to sit with stuff like homework, so it makes parenting easier even when their kid don&#x27;t need it and the medication actually hurts the kid. Therefore I think it is wrong to medicate a kid before they are mature enough to make their own decisions about medication.<p>I do know that medication helped me a lot, I got diagnosed as an adult though. I don&#x27;t think I would have liked it if I was diagnosed as a kid and got pills with ever increasing dosage forced on me just so I would stay quiet in class.')
