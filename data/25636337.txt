Overall it&#x27;s really clean and I like the design.<p>Some quick feedback, which you can take with a grain of salt:\n* I was confused by the image CV on the homepage. It expected it to be clickable, and it took me a minute to find the View Demo button. \n* I love the collaborators feature. IMO this is one the biggest missing factors of LinkedIn (e.g. who did you actually work with on a small team)\n* It would be nice to be able to customize the invite message when inviting a collaborator. \n* The Create a Profile button on the homepage doesn&#x27;t user cursor: pointer, which made me miss that it was the sign up button at first glance.\n* It looks like most of the links don&#x27;t have cursor: pointer, which feels off to me\n* Once I saved my profile, it took me a minute to find the edit button in the bottom left<p>Overall, nice working and I&#x27;m looking forward to following the updates. Also, great first name you have there.')
