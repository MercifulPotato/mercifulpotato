Then you can decide if it&#x27;s worth it. If such a situation never arises, then no, it&#x27;s not worth it in your case.<p>I used it a lot when datamining in World of Warcraft - I would find reverse engineered documentation from previous versions of the game, write it into a 010 editor template struct, run it on the DBC file and then I&#x27;d usually get a result where the header and the first few fields would be fine, but the rest would be completely wrong. All I did was add a field in the template before the first obviously wrong field, with different, random sizes, to add random padding until the field started looking correct again.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty specific case, but it almost always worked!')
