I also think my tastebuds are more important than an animal. This is why things like impossible foods sidestep this issue, because they know people don&#x27;t switch en masse on ethical grounds, but they do it you make a better product, in terms of price and more importantly, taste.<p>If an alien comes to us to eat us, I mean yes, that&#x27;s just how it is. We can try fighting back of course (which species wants to be killed?) but if they win then, what can you do? Appeal emotionally with them? They could say the same thing, that it&#x27;s just how it is. Might really does make right. If they have superiority in fighting power, I mean, there&#x27;s nothing we can do other than accept it. And that&#x27;s the same thing that&#x27;s happening with us and the animals we eat.')
