Salamanders on a cosmic scale are probably difficult to distinguish from humans â€“ just more bundles of cellular automata that share more in common than they don&#x27;t, but the differences are fascinating from an earthly&#x2F;human perspective.<p>I really wonder, too - does a dog care as much about a salamander as a human?
