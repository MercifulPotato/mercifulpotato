Oh, and the rise of typescript of course.<p>I mean, I&#x27;ve abandoned Python years ago, and I was quite surprised when I discovered python people are adding type annotations everywhere.<p>Sure, gradual typing is not a strictly enforced as in statically typed languages, but seems people are agree that modularity and abstraction without type signatures is painful in sufficiently large programs.')
