At least, that&#x27;s what Hawking&#x27;s original model, the one he used to predict that black holes evaporate, says.<p>One way of seeing why Hawking&#x27;s model had to say this is to combine the following facts about the evaporating black hole and the Hawking radiation in Hawking&#x27;s model:<p>(1) The hole itself cannot contain any information other than its mass, charge, and spin (because of the &quot;black holes have no hair&quot; theorem), which is far too little information to describe everything that fell into the hole.<p>(2) The Hawking radiation cannot contain any information about what fell into the hole because it is thermal, black-body radiation, i.e., the only information it contains is its temperature, which is related to the mass of the hole.<p>So the information can&#x27;t be stored either inside the hole or outside the hole, which means it must be destroyed, and the only place it can be destroyed is by hitting the singularity inside the hole.<p>The black hole information loss problem is that the above is inconsistent with quantum unitarity. So Hawking&#x27;s original model can&#x27;t be right; but nobody knows what model should replace it.')
