Citymapper is only good when you’re in a city. When you’re not in a city &#x2F; travelling outside the city, the experience is subpar.<p>Fortunately the clue’s in the name. Like the OP (and sibling), living in zone 2 and rarely venturing outside of my z1-2 bubble, nothing comes close to Citymapper.<p>When I do venture out, I’ve now switched to Apple Maps, as I’m typically driving. Voice notifications are intrusive to music &amp; audiobooks, and having to regularly look at the screen is distracting and dangerous. Apple’s restrictive APIs for the Apple watch means it’s the only mapping platform that can give me haptic feedback when it’s time to turn, and that’s extremely valuable driving in and out of London.')
