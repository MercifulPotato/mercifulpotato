He talks about research on quantum effects in microtubules, for example. Of how the concepts of computability and consciousness relate, how quantum physics drags in this concept of consciousness into science hitherto imagined purely objective. There are so many interesting connections, which might well be directions science will investigate in the years to come. That&#x27;s a big part of what the whole book is about.<p>The other part is where he describes how quantum physics, logic and consciousness are weird. That&#x27;s basically just science popularization, coming from a top mind in both math and physics. To me, that&#x27;s already enough to justify the price of admission: the time and mental effort of going through the book at a pace that assures comprehension, which does take some patience.')
