Item(by='jandrese', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610737211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25793685, text='&gt; It&#x27;s clear that this man developed a personality disorder as the result of suffering abuse as a child.<p>I don&#x27;t think the causality is clear at all.  If he treated his parents the way he treated his girlfriends then his childhood would have been rough no matter how loving they were.<p>If he behaves like he did in the article: polite at first but increasingly hostile the longer the relationship lasted then he must have been a hellish teenager to wrangle.  One part of the article mentions that his anger at his father may have been the result of putting him in an institution.')
