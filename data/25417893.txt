It did mostly correct itself. Today there&#x27;s very little of the wage gap that you could possibly attribute to sexism. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s zero and sexism is no more - but it&#x27;s the smaller part of the problem now.<p>The wage gap is mostly a motherhood gap. For those women who choose to become mothers, suddenly there are more important things in life than the company&#x27;s priorities. They start falling behind women who didn&#x27;t have children, and men who carry less of the work of the household. This is surprisingly not common knowledge by now even though it&#x27;s well supported by data and well discussed by feminists, including Hillary Clinton. Speaking about populations in general and not individuals - women with children on average earn less because work isn&#x27;t the highest priority in their lives. I think they&#x27;re the smart ones.<p>The other major component of the wage gap is that women on average aren&#x27;t as well represented in higher paying fields like STEM fields, or work that&#x27;s physically dangerous and undesirable - but pays well. With that latter segment of jobs, again one could argue women are being smarter about it. This is true even in the most enlightened countries like the Scandinavian countries - in fact it&#x27;s more true there. I think the only way to address that is to get it into the heads of young girls who&#x27;re still in school that those STEM jobs can be women&#x27;s jobs. How to accomplish that is still a mystery.')
