Your question about demographic breakdown is entirely valid.<p>Hospitalization rate for covid is about 228.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 population [0]. Or, more easily interpretted, about 10-20% of cases turning to hospitalization. \nTaking the more conservative (10%) rate, we&#x27;d need 31 samples for a 95% CI and 5% margin of error. Thus, the interpetation is that is it unlikely that the _lack of seeing any hospitalizations in the vaccine+covid-positive group is by chance_.<p>Hope that helps!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;covidview&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;covidvi...</a>')
