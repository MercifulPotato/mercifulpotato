Are there any recent models that are equally open? Giving Chromebooks to my nieces and nephew seems like it would be a good way to cover the mainstream content consumption use cases that they and their parents want, while giving them something more open than the Amazon Fire tablets that I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit I gave them a few years ago. But I&#x27;d like to buy a model that&#x27;s near the beginning of its support lifecycle.')
