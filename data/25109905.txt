Finally it&#x27;s safe for Basques to visit Iceland again! :D Jokes aside, Iceland is a very interesting place, not just because of its incredible nature, but also its history and language, especially due to their very interesting and well preserved old texts, and also because they&#x27;re so remote and insular. It&#x27;s a treasure trove for etymologists and laypeople alike. It&#x27;s also quite interesting to track the etymological differences between the nearby islets and countries, for instance on Faroe Islands. Personally I wonder about graph-driven language analysis, and it&#x27;s a hobby project of mine to go deeper into that.')
