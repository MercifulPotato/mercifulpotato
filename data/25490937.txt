The former will cause anger, frustration, defensiveness and denial.<p>If the idea is to get everyone on board with the idea that the deck is still stacked against minorities even in the absence of conscious contemporary racism (which I believe to be true), telling people they&#x27;re racist is probably the worst way to go about that.')
