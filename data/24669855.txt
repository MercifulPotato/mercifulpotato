Obviously, their best outcome is reducing that percentage to zero.<p>But to get there, their argument obviously can&#x27;t be &quot;Apple is a monopoly allows it to extract 30%, which is too high, so we want it reduced to zero&quot;. That&#x27;s not going to work.<p>Rather, they get it to zero by saying &quot;Apple is a monopoly and prevents competition by banning apps that implement their own payment processing system, so leave the 30% as-is but let any app implement its own payments&quot;.<p>So the actual percentage, and the restriction against accepting payments outside Apple IAP, are two slightly different concerns. Reducing the percentage to 20% would obviously be a net financial win, but it&#x27;s definitely not their main objective.')
