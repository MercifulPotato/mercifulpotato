I personally consider that Covid19 was a godsend. Everyone (including Gates) were saying that a pandemic is not a matter of if but rather of when. And one came. But remember, we have a flu pandemic every single year. For a pandemic to be registered as serious, it has to be more lethal than flu. And Covid19 was, but not by so much. It was quite the minimum extra-lethality needed to shake people into action. And we did act. We saw how bad we are at preparedness (I mean, if the famous &quot;stockpile&quot; doesn&#x27;t have N95s, then what does it have?). It exposed so many holes. But then Pfizer and Moderna pulled the miracle. What they have done is not just come up with the vaccine for Covid, but they have broken the 4-minute mile of vaccines. Shattered it. Like going from 4:05 to 0:35. When the next one will come (and come it will), a 10-month sequencing-to-EUA cycle will be the target to beat. Not a 5-year timeline. Will we be able to have a vaccine in 6 months, or maybe 3 months? That&#x27;s not entirely inconceivable now.<p>So, sure we&#x27;ve paid a dear price in blood with this Covid19, but it could have been much, much, much worse. And when the truly bad one will come, we&#x27;ll be so much more prepared.')
