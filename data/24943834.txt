I&#x27;ve still yet to encounter someone who did it for the &#x27;killing&#x27;. It&#x27;s about fresh food, cultural traditions, and conservation. The modern hunter does more for the environment than most who sit behind a computer all day. You should take a intro course on hunting and understanding the carrying capacity of an environment impacts how tags are issued.<p>Sidenote =&gt; I also love to fish. I find it odd how much flak hunting gets over fishing. I guess people feel a stronger bond to an animal vs a tuna.')
