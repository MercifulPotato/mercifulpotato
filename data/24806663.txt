Section 230 doesnt really have anything to do with moderation. In fact, it allows websites that has user generated content to exist <i>without</i> moderation.<p>I think&#x2F;hope we agree that its completely reasonable and normal for websites to moderate the content on their sites. For example, I want Twitter to take down child pornography posted. Literally hate speech - calls for genecides and violence against people - websites should have the legal ability to remove that from their sites. I do not think there should be any consequences towards the websites for wanting to remove this content.<p>If you remove 230 protections from websites, it forces the sites that are able to survivce to moderate <i>more</i> by making them legally liable for the content published.')
