Sometimes things just... behave oddly... in the editor. And the story around collaborating with friends is still not great (though a free tier for Unity Collaborate has helped with this a bit.)<p>If you haven&#x27;t messed around with Unity, I encourage folks to give it a try. The new Universal Render Pipeline stuff they&#x27;ve been building is really nice for a solo&#x2F;small team project.')
