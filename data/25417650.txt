That money would be unnecessarily wasted. I also doubt a huge staff is needed to figure out the tech part.<p>But I understand your point: startups can be viewed as economy&#x27;s distributed R&amp;D. Speculative investment makes a lot of sense - it could be that without startups #1-3, #4 wouldn&#x27;t exist because it couldn&#x27;t afford the risk of developing an innovative product. But my main gripe is how VC-backed startups repay the investment - they&#x27;re being pressured into user-hostile and sometimes antisocial business models. It&#x27;s so common that these business model became accepted as standard these days! So perhaps a way forward isn&#x27;t to reduce venture funding, but curtail the socially destructive business models directly.')
