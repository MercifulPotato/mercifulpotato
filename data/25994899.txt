In these cloud game streaming wars, Steam is a reservoir of totally untapped crude oil. Its the largest and most active western game platform, period, its beloved by its users, and Valve hasn&#x27;t even remotely signaled an intention to compete. Companies and products like Steam are one in a million; Stadia, Luna, GeForce Now, xCloud, PSNow, are not. There is no amount of money they could pay Valve to make that partnership happen that would not pay dividends.<p>Valve&#x2F;Steam is just &quot;behind&quot; in all of this modern gaming crap, and the fact that they&#x27;re still the most popular platform (and its not close) speaks volumes about whether the CloudStreamingGamePass-way things are going is actually the right one. Its reasonable to believe that people who identify as &quot;gamers&quot; right now are not interested in that stuff, and the strategy Google&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;etc have of &quot;Netflix for gaming, no console, convert non-gamers to gamers&quot; won&#x27;t work. Time will tell, but maybe Valve&#x27;s traditionalism is the right one long-term.<p>You know where Valve is investing their money? VR and Linux. God damn do I love that company.')
