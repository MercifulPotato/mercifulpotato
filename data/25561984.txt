I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.  What you are describing is not and cannot be how lazy IO works.  Lazy IO is <i>always</i> on the read side.<p>Lazy IO, like the partial functions in Prelude, is a convenience hack for making some very low-complexity things easy. I don&#x27;t have a problem with it existing, because I am fine with matching my tool complexity with the problem complexity.<p>And also, I understand what it does. I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m the first person to point out that your assertion is not an accurate description of anything that actually happens.')
