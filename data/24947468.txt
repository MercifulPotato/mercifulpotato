You need to list them as dependencies for objects that get built.<p>&gt; I just found this tutorial to get the compiler to list your dependencies for you with (GNU) Make<p>Yea, that works very well. A lot of projects sticking with make use that via some makefile hackery (e.g. postgres). Cmake etc do so automatically as well(at least for the common generators).<p>But with bazel you have to basically maintain that manually on a granular basis. So if you add a new #include to some random .c file you often also need to add that as a dependency. There&#x27;s a bunch of error checking around that to make it easier to get it right, but it&#x27;s still seems like a lot of work to me.')
