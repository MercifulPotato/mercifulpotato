What is it supposed to accomplish? We the users don’t understand their infrastructure anyway, how are we expected to understand the post mortem? Besides, as the users why should we care why things went down? The fact is, they did. And that’s the only thing that matters. I don’t feel better knowing WHY I lost my services. I just feel bad BECAUSE I lost them. Or are post mortems supposed to reassure users that the outage won’t happen again? It doesn’t reassure that either because by definition unpredictable outages always happen due to something new and unpredictable. This post mortem certainly won’t stop the next outage from happening. We KNOW there will be more, we just don’t know when. Or are post mortems supposed to show that the company takes full responsibility for what happened? But they always do and are fully expected to. So it’s meaningless. No company would ever say “we don’t take responsibility for this error we caused”. Even in the case of massive data leaks, which cannot be reversed, companies always take full responsibility. And it doesn’t help anyone.<p>The only thing post mortems show is that the company didn’t do their job or was careless or disorganized or confused. But we already know that, because they had an outage.<p>So what’s the point?')
