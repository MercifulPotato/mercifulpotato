That’s also 5% of the energy not going to charge the battery further raising the power pushed over the charging cable.<p>As for chargers with batteries, I don’t see how that’s viable. 75kWh would require each charger to have 6 powerwalls just to store 75kWh. If you wanted to dispense that amount of power in 10 minutes you would need 60 powerwalls per charger. Maybe a battery could be designed to provide higher power output, but it’s going to have the same issues that car will have when attempting to charge at a fast rate. Even with storage in the charger how quickly can it recover? Tesla superchargers run non-stop on busy travel holiday. Relying on a onsite battery would do no good on high demand days.')
