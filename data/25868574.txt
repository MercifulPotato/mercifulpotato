I don&#x27;t personally support tolerance of that, which is my right, and what I personally feel is better to avoid the spread of toxic cultures like found on Parler.  Tolerance of diverse and non violence-provoking political opinions, including those I disagree with?  That is something I totally support.<p>Parler clearly does tolerate incitement to violence, which is their right.  Good for them for exercising it, but nobody has to support them, nor should anyone be prevented from supporting them.  Likewise, if there are consequences (commericial or legal) for tolerating incitement to violence, Parler owns those too.<p>You are also free to tolerate it and provide services to support those who do.')
