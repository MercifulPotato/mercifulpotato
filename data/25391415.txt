(obviously, this does not apply to companies that have been founded in Africa.  I&#x27;m pointing to the Amazon, Uber and MSFT listings)<p>We should by all means support companies in africa, Ghana is an incredible source of genuine groundbreaking businesses.  I&#x27;ve visited and can attest to this first hand.  However, the big tech co&#x27;s posting here really just seems like the 21st century form of colonialism.  Taking advantage of a market that unlike the US still doesn&#x27;t see the less &quot;happy&quot; side of these huge tech companies in light of these tech companies having to put up with H1B legislation in the US that actually treats immigrant workers fairly.  Which means big tech can&#x27;t treat hoards of H1B&#x27;s as modern day slave labor.<p>Go Africa!  But this website left a bad - very suss taste in my mouth.')
