The document, consisting of 14 sections divided into bullet points, had a section on &quot;rules of war&quot; that stated &quot;make an offer of peace before declaring war&quot;, which within stated that the enemy must &quot;surrender on terms&quot; of no abortions, no same-sex marriage, no communism and &quot;must obey Biblical law&quot;, then continued: &quot;If they do not yield — kill all males&quot;.&quot;<p>&quot;In April 2019, The Guardian published records from a right-wing chat group of four people that Shea participated in, where Shea used an alias of ‘True Warrior’ in Latin. Other members in the chat group discussed carrying out surveillance, intimidation and violent attacks on political enemies, including Antifa activists and &quot;communists.&quot; Shea himself volunteered to conduct background checks on residents of Spokane, resulting in Shea naming three individuals. One of the chat group&#x27;s members forwarded the information to The Guardian, while another confirmed the existence of the chats and acknowledged the discussion on conducting surveillance on &quot;Antifa&quot; people.&quot;<p>&quot;An investigation commissioned by Washington House of Representatives reported, on December 1, 2019, that Shea had planned and participated in domestic terrorism on at least three occasions. This included his participation, organizing, planning, and promotion of the 2014 Bundy standoff in Nevada, the 2015 armed standoff in Priest River, Idaho, and the 2016 armed seizure of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon. Shea led a delegation of right-wing legislators from Oregon, Washington and Idaho that met with law enforcement on January 9, 2016, in Burns, Oregon and were appraised of confidential intended law enforcement strategies for dealing with the refuge occupiers. Shea then disclosed those details to Bundy, according to the report.&quot;')
