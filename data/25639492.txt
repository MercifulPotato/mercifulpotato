Item(by='bb88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609801261, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637935, text='&gt; I have heard dollars are popular with crime orgs all the world over, who are unlikely to use or be able to use the dollars in US courts.<p>I think once you&#x27;ve laundered drug money into dollars, it&#x27;s spendable just like dollars are spendable.  But it also makes sense they want dollars because dollars can pretty much be spent on anything anywhere.<p>&gt;&gt; If someone takes your Bitcoin\n&gt; This is one big if, and it will still be prosecutable by courts, as evidenced by all the current legal cases about crypto theft.<p>Well first you have to find the perpetrator -- then you have to find the money.  Do enough transfers and mixing currencies together and it becomes near impossible to trace.  This gets worse if it&#x27;s state sponsored hacking (Russia or China, say)<p>&gt; A lot of countries with good military might (e.g., North Korea) don&#x27;t have valuable currencies.<p>That&#x27;s because NK doesn&#x27;t have a lot of trust.  Saddam Hussein hoarded US dollars [1] even though he could have used Iraqi currency instead (since afterall he was the leader of Iraq and the currency had his face on it).  That&#x27;s because nobody really trusted Iraq&#x27;s currency -- not even the leader himself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;world&#x2F;nation-war-baghdad-hoard-hole-wall-palace-yields-millions-us-cash.html#:~:text=A%20huge%20cache%20of%20United,million%2C%20senior%20officials%20said%20today" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;world&#x2F;nation-war-baghdad-...</a>.')
