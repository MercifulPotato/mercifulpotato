If you imagine that the discrete universe has some kind of transition, where the properties of a given slot can be transferred to a neighbor slot, then the speed of light is the upper limit on the rate of change. Why does this upper limit exists? We don&#x27;t know, maybe we live in a simulation, maybe the universe would no be stable enough without this limit.')
