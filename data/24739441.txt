Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602342234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737444, text='&gt; I mean specifically the nipples, not the entire boob. It isn’t considered nudity (at least in the places I’ve been) for a woman to expose any part of their breast except the nipple itself. That (plus men’s nipples being so boring nobody even thinks to mention them) is what I find weird.<p>there are a lot of situations where it would be considered inappropriate for a woman to expose most of a breast (though perhaps not nudity, per se). the degree of coverage socially required for a man or a woman varies a lot. like if I wore cargo shorts to work, it would merely be against the dress code. if I wore only a speedo (or a woman wore a bikini), it would be inappropriate.<p>once you&#x27;ve decided you have to make and enforce rules about nudity, you need to make them unambiguous. &quot;cannot show nipple&quot; is a lot less ambiguous than &quot;most cover most of breast&quot;. &quot;must cover entire breast&quot; is also fraught; how do you decide exactly where it begins? if you agree that female breasts are sexual features, it doesn&#x27;t seem that weird that nipples would be where the line is finally drawn.<p>just for the record, I don&#x27;t think the world would end if women could expose their breasts without repercussions.')
