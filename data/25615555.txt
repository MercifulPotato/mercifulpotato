The intermediate string&#x27;s RAM is automatically much smaller than the RAM consumed by the DOM and the calculated box model and text layout graph, so its size is insignificant.  If it&#x27;s huge, you have much bigger problems from the DOM.  Also, the intermediate string is temporary, and will be freed after the DOM is created but before the box model and text layout graph is allocated and calculated, so it might not end up using any extra RAM at all.<p>In this example, updating the DOM as soon as you get the information is not optimal for user feedback, because rendering is paused until after all the DOM updates anyway.  DOM rendering in all modern browsers is lazy.  It only starts after JavaScript returns from handling the current event queue.')
