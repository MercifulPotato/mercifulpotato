It was being taught by a substitute teacher from the art department who knew some programming. The class was 5 assignments, the first of which I completed with about 60 <i>characters</i> of Python code; I remember feeling smug because others struggled with the same assignment. The other assignments weren&#x27;t much harder. It&#x27;s not all bad though, I had a great time &quot;hanging out&quot; (our classes were little more) with the teacher and other students.<p>My point is: Brick and mortar universities can also be ridiculously easy. Your students are either lucky or unlucky, depending on how they look at it. I&#x27;m currently approaching 40 hours spent on Software 1 at WGU, and I&#x27;ve worked as a professional programmer for over 10 years. In my experience WGU has been harder that what I had at my little &quot;community college&quot; (which was actually an accredited university).')
