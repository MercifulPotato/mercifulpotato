Item(by='hn_throwaway_99', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610603669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770357, text='&gt; I graduated with 2 bachelors degrees and a masters degree with no debt through scholarships and grants. I have saved nothing for my children’s education. If they want to attend college, it is on them to pay their way just as it was for me. I’ve told them that I will help a bit during their first year.<p>I just want to point out how <i>incredibly</i>, <i>incredibly</i> rare that is for anyone to have that experience in the US today, where according to you:<p>1. You were able to graduate debt free, and since you say you had no debt &quot;through scholarships and grants&quot;, I&#x27;m taking that to mean your parents didn&#x27;t pay for your college. While that is certainly possible (e.g. some colleges offer free rides for very top students), it is VERY rare.<p>2. You intend to save nothing for your children&#x27;s education. That is not only exceedingly rare, pretty much all financial aid packages expect&#x2F;require a certain amount of parental contributions. You better hope your kids get lots of scholarships and grants, otherwise they won&#x27;t be going to college.<p>Personally, I went to a top US university. I had some grants and scholarships but my parents still contributed a good part to my first 2 years, and I graduated with considerable but manageable debt. I&#x27;ve worked in software jobs over the past 2 decades, including 1 company where my stock options were worth a considerable amount, so I&#x27;ve saved a lot. I work considerably more than 40 hours a week, so honestly I&#x27;m quite envious of your &quot;20-30 hours a week&quot; story - I don&#x27;t know any job where you can work that little and still get paid that well. I see a very large portion of my salary every year go to healthcare and retirement, and as I am childless I don&#x27;t have to save for my kids education.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m doing quite well, and I still have anxiety about all the things I need to save for. I can&#x27;t imagine making a more median-level salary, with today&#x27;s cost of education, and with kids, and not being much more stressed at the prospect of having to handle everything financially.')
