The 15&quot; version can be specced to an 8 core i9 with around 290ppi and an 87Whr battery, and if you&#x27;re happy with a 6 core i7 you can get a 13&quot; with around 330ppi (same resolution), but with a 52Whr battery.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;18 hours&quot; means, I am inherently skeptical of any &quot;hour&quot; claims of battery â€” obviously the less you demand of your machine the less battery it will take.')
