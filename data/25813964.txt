You would think they&#x27;d be worth looking at if you knew about K.  I don&#x27;t remember exactly what Bristol have got now.  (Its not so easy to get detailed info on UK Tier 2 systems, even if you&#x27;re supporting one.)  I know it&#x27;s using Infiniband, not Tofu as they&#x27;re mostly interested in single-node performance for some reason, but I don&#x27;t know what other than the chips come from Fujitsu.  It may be right that they&#x27;re not doing much with systems. There does seem to be more interest this time round, at least.')
