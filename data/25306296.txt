If you formalise this kind of redundancy it leads to super annoying things like on-call rosters. Which are awful for a worker because it means you <i>MUST</i> be available immediately, can&#x27;t drink or go out to the shop or whatever.<p>I much rather just have them call me for that one critical issue that happens in a very long time, and appreciating me putting in the time after hours, than being forced to sit at home waiting for something to break which never actually happens.<p>In practice there is always someone available who is able to make time for it so there is really no need for on-call rosters. As such the act of stepping up and helping out avoids having this heavy commitment.')
