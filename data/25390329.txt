Bluetooth just works better on Apple devices.<p>that really is not accurate. macbooks are notoriously terrible with bluetooth. with my macbook pro, it is impossible to play music on a bluetooth speaker, as it starts stuttering within seconds of use. this is a common problem over many years, and there&#x27;s a litany of solutions on the forums, most of which don&#x27;t work. another common problem is iTunes automatically opening and even playing when bluetooth headphones connect. in many cases, there&#x27;s no way to prevent  it. in my case, the only thing that stopped it was renaming iTunes, which required a lot of ceremony to even do. it seems in zoom meetings, it&#x27;s always the people with airpods that are having audio trouble. i thought it was well known that apple has terrible bluetooth, at least on their macbooks.')
