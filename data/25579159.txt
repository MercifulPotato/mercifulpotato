That reason is metaprogramming.<p>DSLs are very powerful and extremely effective when they simplify how some specific task or sequence must be configured.<p>When you do something repeatedly in a programming language where it seems like there is a lot of copy&#x2F;paste, that is exactly when a DSL should be created and applied to avoid that sort of behavior.<p>In this sense, good DSLs are deeply related to the low-code movement.<p>When enough DSLs are made, need to write all logic in a general purpose programming language will be minimalized.<p>The place where this can most be seen currently is in process management systems and the DSLs used to configure them. Few are familiar with these because they are very expensive enterprise tools used to rapidly setup business processes and related interfaces.')
