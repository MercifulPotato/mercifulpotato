Oh well!<p>I too am a big fan of oatmeal. Funny enough, I like it a bit different than the author does. Particularly, I enjoy it with a less runny&#x2F;liquid texture, and I don&#x27;t submerge it like the author does afterward either. My setup I&#x27;ve eaten year round for 5 years now is:<p>* 1 cup dried old-fashioned oats<p>* Water plus a dash of creamer (oat milk recently) to submerge the oats<p>* 1-2 tablespoons of peanut butter<p>* Cinnamon to taste<p>* Sometimes flax seed to taste<p>The biggest thing is the cooking. On the stove top, bring the liquid boiling _and then_ add the oats. Don&#x27;t add the oats before hand, as that changes their texture a bit too. Then I&#x27;ll turn it down to maybe medium-low temp and cook most of the liquid off. It&#x27;s usually 5-10 minutes. In the microwave, I mix the liquids and oats together because what other choice do you have? Then it runs for 3 minutes on high.<p>You&#x27;ll end up with a bit of a softer texture, but the peanut butter thickens it up to be much more hearty. It&#x27;s hard for me to enjoy other oatmeal that&#x27;s runny.')
