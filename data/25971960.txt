Someone who shorted @20 gets squeezed when it goes up to $100, they&#x27;re forced to buy, they end up buying from someone else who is shorting @100.  That person gets squeezed @300, they&#x27;re replaced by someone else who sold short @300.  That next person isn&#x27;t going to get squeezed until $600-1000.<p>Ultimately the big winners are those who bought @10 and sold @300, or those who shorted @300 and cover @10.  Everybody in between gets rekt.  That&#x27;s going to include a bunch of retail buyers and a few shorts as well.')
