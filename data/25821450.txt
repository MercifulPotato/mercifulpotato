They&#x27;re forced onto a particular platform without much control over what that platform may record about them personally, with their employer being the potential beneficiary.<p>Sorry but why is the author surprised by this? I work in corporate IT. We issue company-owned laptops &#x2F; desktops &#x2F; devices to employees, most of which come with Teams. Anything they do on these devices is subject to company monitoring. There is no privacy when using a company asset.<p>All employees signed an agreement (Technology Use Policy) about this during their onboarding.<p>Are companies asking employees to install Teams &#x2F; other chat apps on their personal devices? Or is the author suggesting companies should not be able to view their employees conversations on an employee operated platform?')
