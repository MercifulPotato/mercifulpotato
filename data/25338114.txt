(Anyone remember google+?)<p>* Mocking and criticizing the SVP who led the project.<p>* Rejoicing in the departure of the said SVP.<p>* Talking about one of the founders having an affair.  (Well, to be fair, the news broke outside first.)<p>* Memes disagreeing with company decisions, including one that literally said &quot;What the fuck are you doing&quot; for firing someone.<p>* And, last but not least, complaining that the quality of microkitchen has gone downhill since $(the year you joined).')
