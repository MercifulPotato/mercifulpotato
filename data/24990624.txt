Pulling in tasks from multiple sources. Clubhouse and Things are the ones I use, sadly not supported.<p>2. Sharing tasks with teammates &#x2F; seeing what they&#x27;re up to regardless of the to-do tool they use.

Marketing depends on dev but without a higher-level tool pulling in todos from both it&#x27;s opaque to understand what other teams are working on.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of other stuff going on and Sunsama is a pretty opinionated tool (Channels? Estimated&#x2F;actual time tracking?)<p>On first blush comparisons to Superhuman are premature...')
