I still recall eagerly awaiting for the monthly magazine that brought a floppy disk with source code I could study and try.\nBut the best part, in the IDE, was the documentation, every keyword had an easy to access text explanation and fully working example. Borland was really great at this, same happened with turbo-c.<p>But there’s definitely magic to Basic, from a sheet of paper with line numbered, easy to understand (closest to language), instructions you can copy into a simple ide, to immediate results. There’s no entry barrier.<p>Such a nice story to read, thanks op.')
