Item(by='mlang23', descendants=2, kids=[25582738, 25582422], score=3, time=1609341444, title='Ask HN: Am I special in finding bugs early or is software just so bad?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I seem to have this &quot;special&quot; ability to find bugs in all sorts of systems pretty early on.  This seems to be so pronounced that even outside observers confirm it.  IOW, I have a reputation amongst some of my friends and collegues to be the one guy that can easily break things.  Now, this is a bit esotheric, I know, so I am suspicious.  I hear folklore that people like this are sometimes hired to put their ability to good use.  I guess my question is, is this a real thing?  Or is software really that broken these days and some poeple are better at ignoring situations where a system is behaving strangely?<p>I sometimes wish I could feed my bug list upstream somehow.  I am a iOS VoiceOver user.  Some of the bugs I discovered 8 years ago are still present, and the list is slowly growing.  I sometimes wish I could fly over to Apple, sit down with the dev team for a week, and get all of these small to medium hickups fixed.  And Apple is just one example.  I guess I could do that with almost everything I use daily.\nBut this raises a question: are we passed the point where software is so broken that <i>expecting</i> it to behave relatively bug-free is an illusion?  Why is it that I can unbox a new product, start the configuration process and find 3 UI hickups in 10 minutes?  Why do I see these, and the QA group does not?')
