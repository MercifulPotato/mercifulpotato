Nevertheless, the problem is big enough to be worth repeating and re-repeating:<p>Any link that ends up in a browser address bar should be treated as public.<p>And no, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you use HTTPS. Ways to leak it are many, but the gist is that it&#x27;s treated as &quot;meta-data&quot; and, rightly or wrongly, subject to much lower expectations of privacy. A recent scandal was that several common browser extensions collect this meta-data and sell it to marketing companies.<p>Which marketing companies offer searchable subscriptions (for hefty prices, true, this isn&#x27;t a $9.99 service), where somebody could for example search for &quot;yourcompany.com&quot;, or even worse, &quot;yourcompany.com&#x2F;authernticate?token=&quot;.
