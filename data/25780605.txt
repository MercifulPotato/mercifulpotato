It may stop the bullets, or maybe it wont. You cant be sure its not NIJ certified. But even if it did AR500 has the bad side effect of making the bullet fragment, the bits them flying perpendicular to the plate into your crotch and neck. They will apply truck bed liner and claim this &quot;spall liner&quot; prevents it but it doesn&#x27;t really.<p>The same companies that make body armor for the military and police, Hesco and RMA also sell to civilians. The NIJ also helpfully provides a list on their website of all currently certified body armor that passes their test. If its NIJ certified then it is deemed acceptable for law enforcement units in the US to use it.<p>AR500 the company has only one product on the NIJ&#x27;s CPL and its their most expensive plate and its ceramic like all real plates, not steel.<p>The body armor industry has a history of a lot of shady dealings and AR500 is only the latest chapter. They pay youtube gun influencers to make videos that make their products look good.')
