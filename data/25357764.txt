Therefore they get sold for ridiculously low prices (dump prices) or those who are interested even get <i>paid</i> for picking it up.<p>If you want to make an impact, just eating one piece of meat less a week has more impact than quitting eating whatever amount of licorice with gelatin it is you are eating.<p>Another irrelevant one is rennet. Yes, a calve gets slaughtered for rennet, but calves already get slaughtered and one calve stomach is used for, say, 100.000 cheeses. It makes no impact as a vegetarian to therefore not eat cheese made with rennet. Just like it makes no sense to avoid lab meat because an animal suffered from it. At one point, it gets ridiculous, and its <i>harmful</i> for the cause (be it animal welfare, environmental welfare, or personal health).')
