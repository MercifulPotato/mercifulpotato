If such an amendment wouldn&#x27;t pass, that&#x27;s because it damn well shouldn&#x27;t.<p>This is freedom-destroying authoritarianism, and the frightened sheep like you eat it up.  This is where democracy breaks, if 51% of people want to lock down the other 49% forever, the other 49% are fucked forever.<p>If you fear contagion and think you need to stay away from me, that is on YOU to restrict YOUR activities.
