Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=[25919423, 25919347], score=None, time=1611682648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916647, text='&gt; Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their gimmicky window manager doesn’t have a Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others).<p>My first thought was that the author was being unnecessarily and unhelpfully dismissive. Then I skimmed the rest of the article and I think if you take it as &quot;compositors are way bigger than window managers were in X, so if you want to write what would&#x27;ve been a window manager then you should consider working on top of an existing compositor&quot; then it makes sense. I&#x27;m wondering if maybe it&#x27;s just a language thing.')
