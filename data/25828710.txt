In fact, they’re machines for hyper-self-reinforcing echoes of the national id.<p>More speech leads to truth, unless you can choose to wall yourself off from all critical speech that offends you.  Then you just self reinforce and self radicalize.  The Twitter&#x2F;AWS response is a larger version of the same American reaction that got us here.<p>I’d like to see social media designed to get at truth, not just dopamine.  It makes no sense to me that you can’t get a retraction tweet sent to THE SAME people who view a false tweet. And yet you can’t.')
