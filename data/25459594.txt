Unfortunately a lot of people seem to think that they are a substitute for package management. This was obviously (and I do mean very clearly obvious in advance from first principles¹, no hindsight needed) going to become a disaster. Most people just do not care - they are either completely unaware of the problem, or they know that in a few years&#x27; time they will either have changed jobs or be promoted (in no small part thanks to their &quot;Docker thought leadership&quot;) and it will no longer be their problem (and they would still get to claim &quot;Docker thought leadership&quot; success on their résumés).<p>¹ Also from experience - VMware came out with &quot;virtual appliances&quot; in the mid-2000s that promised to do a lot of what Docker would later be used for.')
