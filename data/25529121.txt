If we didn&#x27;t at least agree that the concrete example wasn&#x27;t legally actionable, then our viewpoints would be too disconnected to make the effort worth it.<p>How about this: if there is a &quot;he said she said&quot; situation where the accuser believes the accused did something racially motivated, and neither the accused nor the accuser have any evidence other than their word, should the accused face a real consequence?')
