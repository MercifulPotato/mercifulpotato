In real life conversations, when you don&#x27;t agree, you don&#x27;t turn down someone&#x27;s voice so nobody can hear them. You either reply saying that you don&#x27;t agree, or you get them out of the discussion if they are 1 or 2 above.<p>If any opinion that is different than the prevailing opinion get downvoted - thus, less visible - people are not going to see the different angles of the discussion. Even if it&#x27;s an opinion based on wrong assumptions&#x2F;facts, other people might benefit from seeing the correction on the replies')
