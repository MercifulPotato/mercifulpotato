Build gentle density, walkups and row houses and four floors with corner stores. Don’t crowd density near main thoroughfares.<p>Build it and house your residents.<p>Once you’ve done that, the remainder of folks who have genuine mental and substance health issues—as opposed to the people who picked up drugs as a way of coping with the crippling depression of being unhoused—can be cared for properly.')
