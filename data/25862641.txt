That will decide how it might be adopted.<p>This test requires a chip rather than a simple lab assay.  If the cost of the test is comparably as low as PSA ($50) it could entirely replace PSA for screening.  However, if the chip is more expensive than PSA, it still may be very useful -- as a second test <i>after</i> a PSA screening test reports a high number but <i>before</i> a biopsy.<p>If this new test could diminish the number of infections from unnecessary biopsies that worry policymakers, routine PSA screening combined with this test could become a low-risk no-brainer new standard.')
