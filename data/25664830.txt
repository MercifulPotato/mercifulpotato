Let&#x27;s take it to the extreme, suppose he called on his followers to murder group XYZ. Should Twitter allow that? If the answer is no, then it&#x27;s not &#x27;scary&#x27; at all that such a message could be censored.<p>If you&#x27;re saying that this particular message shouldn&#x27;t have been cancelled, different discussion.<p>But you literally have a mob which stormed and broke into the capitol of the US, with armed guns, and explosives being found, all of which directly linked to the president lying for weeks, instigating things and calling on his followers to rise up, now obviously resulting in risk of violence and at least one person getting shot in the neck. The notion that such lies should continue to be freely posted on a platform that has basic rules in place just because it&#x27;s the president, is insane. If the president is insane and it&#x27;s causing violence, you can&#x27;t just sit back. (insert obligatory WWII&#x2F;Hitler reference if you will)<p>Lastly, he has plenty of communication channels. What&#x27;s scary is if a private company like Twitter or any other news outlet got forced to publish whatever the current person in power wanted to say on their platform.')
