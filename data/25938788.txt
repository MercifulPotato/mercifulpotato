As my hotel didn’t have a destination charger, the drive couldn’t be done in the Tesla, and I opted to drive an internal combustion vehicle. But let’s say I was determined to drive the Tesla, and not spend the night in Carlsbad. The trip from El Paso to Carlsbad caverns requires a trip to Van Horn first, for a total round trip of 454 miles, and over 8 hours. With an internal combustion vehicle, it’s a direct drive, 304 miles round trip, in just 5 hours. An additional 3 hours and 150 miles in the Tesla? No thanks.<p>The story for the north rim of the Grand Canyon is similar. In the Tesla, from Flagstaff, you must first drive to Page, AZ. Round trip 508 miles and 10 hours. In an internal combustion, its 422 miles and roughly 8.5 hours. When you arrive at the north rim in the Tesla, you can’t go anywhere else, and you must return the way you came.<p>Tesla should work on optimizing their National Park experience, as it’s the classic destination of an old fashioned American road trip.')
