This means more of your team can get excited and get involved, at least in terms of reading the code.<p>And with Zig, where you have to spend a little extra maintenance time paying for the language being pre 1.0, that&#x27;s still nothing compared to the upfront and long-lived costs associated with C. You can develop so much faster in Zig compared to C, that you&#x27;re ahead even pre 1.0.')
