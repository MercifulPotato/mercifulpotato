So it took 20 years. And you are still a minority, global adoption is below 35% years later. Here in this country you can&#x27;t really get fixed Internet connections for consumers supporting IPv6 at all. So I don&#x27;t have it. (Although we have cheaper and better mobile broadband than nearly everywhere else and there the majority of the operators supports IPv6 by default. So when I want to play with IPv6 I just use mobile data.)<p>Wayland became somehow useable for those who really wanted a bit less than 10 years ago, Fedora bot not many others use it by default now.<p>That was my reference to twice the speed, 10 instead of 20 years. Of course it&#x27;s a rough oversimplification, details are much more nuanced. My point was really lack of speed in both cases.<p>Edit: details added')
