See season 5 of Lost for endless discussion on this point. You also can avoid paradoxes if it turns out that time travel just puts you on an alternate timeline.<p>There&#x27;s a different paradox with this version of time travel though. Suppose I&#x27;m a kid and future-Me comes back and tells me a story. &quot;you will write down this story and publish it and it will be famous.&quot; I do as he asks and he&#x27;s absolutely right, leading me to eventually return the favor to my past self in a time loop.<p>Where did the story come from?')
