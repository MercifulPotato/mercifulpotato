Packing all of these &quot;days&quot; into &quot;life&quot; is not simple at all. It&#x27;s an error.<p>There is no &quot;life&quot;. It&#x27;s an ideology, and letting the idea rule you too strictly will turn you into an ideologue. It&#x27;s our mind that sorts our infinitely complex realities out, but also inevidably finds itself tangled in its own abstractions.<p>Emotionally, happiness can only be felt in moments. Days where happy moments outnumber the sadder moments could be considered a happy day. But to then extend this to a lifespan is just too ambitious to be practical. It&#x27;s surreal.<p>Once you have happiness in your days, living a day at a time should suffice. And once you have happiness at arms reach, knowing that should suffice. That is a good place. That is one better model of a good &quot;life&quot;.')
