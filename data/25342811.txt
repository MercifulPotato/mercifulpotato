The gravity of the situation is the same as it always is: OSS projects have created a hard dependency on a commercial 3rd party service because it was given to them for free.  Free service is now going away and they&#x27;re screwed because they have no plan &#x27;B&#x27;.  The issue isn&#x27;t that they haven&#x27;t gotten off of it already, it&#x27;s that they likely never should have gotten on it to begin with.  Seriously, with all the OSS projects building workflows on Travis CI &#x2F; Slack &#x2F; GitHub (I&#x27;m talking about the non-git parts of it like issue management) &#x2F; etc how do they think this will all end?  Even YouTube is sending signals that the free ride (for unmonetizable content) will likely end.<p>OSS projects should not have dependencies on non-OSS infrastructure unless they are prepared for this eventuality.  This has happened, in various forms, to most &#x27;free as in beer&#x27; services given enough time.  Companies typically provide the service as some combination of crush the competition &#x2F; building goodwill &#x2F; altruism &#x2F; the prospect of eventual conversion of some small fraction of OSS projects to a paid version.  The reasons tend to vary (in this case, new ownership) but eventually the bottom line tends to win out.  Often you won&#x27;t be given much time to transition when the free ride ends.')
