Congratulations on the English, wouldn&#x27;t second-guess your fluency one bit. But I don&#x27;t understand how you went through some social catastrophes and still manage to level-up in the rest of your life so well? Please allow me more vague details or in private for such an amazing turnaround.<p>The reason I ask is because I have been struggling with socializing my whole life. While not autistic, I have lots of shyness and anxiety ever since I was a kid, got a bit bullied in high school, cared too much about what other people thought. Even in my early 30s now this is still a huge problem, because I have become a pretty avoidant person and other people perceive this as lack of initiative, bad work ethic, etc. I also wake up every day replaying any 1 of 100s of bad social experiences in the past, where I said something I shouldn&#x27;t have impulsively and made things embarassing or awkward, or how I mishandled some friendship.<p>So its as if I base my whole identity off how well I&#x27;m maintaining my personal relationships, literally rewrite Whatsapp messages the more I am not close with someone (should I end the sentence with a period or &#x27;lol&#x27;? Is the frequency of these emojis too much? Yeah its that extreme).<p>When I read your comment, I just get the impression that though you lost all of it, you were able to somehow transform yourself after. How?! If I were in your shoes, I would literally be watching YouTube videos about social skills, and think that &quot;if I can&#x27;t get this social thing down, I&#x27;ll never be able to survive at a job&quot;. Please break my brain.')
