I won&#x27;t speculate on the other end of the spectrum.<p>I for one am disgusted at how servile about censorship readers of HN have been lately just because it was their percieved enemy who was being attacked, without understanding that this will be applied to $notenemy later. I&#x27;ve frequently complained about the state of &quot;too many MBAs and not enough hackers&quot; here but fuck the last few months really brought that out. Starting to wish I knew if there is a hn where the more anti-authoritarian types hung out.')
