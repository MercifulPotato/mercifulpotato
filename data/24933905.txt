Things like DRM (direct rendering manager) and KMS. One of the neat things about the former is allowing interprocess graphics buffer sharing. One example of where they&#x27;re super useful is in all of the browsers that run their rendering process separate of their window process. Chrome and Firefox for example. You can just send a handle to the graphics buffer across a unix socket rather than having to use something like Angle (Chrome) and actually send the graphics commands across some IPC mechanism.<p>this is also one of the mechanisms that Wayland is built on top of.')
