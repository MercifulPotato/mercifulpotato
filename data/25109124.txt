I&#x27;ve been Linux only for several years now and things have stabilized a lot in past years.<p>Ubuntu&#x27;s kind of lost its way recently though (snaps&#x2F;apt mess, went a tad bit early with pushing Wayland as default). The derivatives like Mint, Manjaro, PopOS and Zorin seem to be the way to go for the average user.<p>The one thing that might trip you up is (these days rare) hardware incompatibilities. Dell and Lenovo (the only personal experience I have) are great when it comes to laptops. For integrated GPU, Intel Just Works; nVidia and AMD can occasionally require a bit of hassle depending on chipset and kernel. Discrete GPUs I don&#x27;t have any recent experience but the word on the street seems to be that if you&#x27;re fine with proprietary drivers both nVidia and AMD&#x2F;ATI works flawlessly while FOSS drivers can be hit or miss.')
