You will never arrive at a correct conclusion if all your premises are fundamentally wrong.<p>I mean, think about it. What do you think &quot;peer review&quot; is supposed to be? Why do you think these papers are accepted and published after being subjected to peer review?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peer_review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peer_review</a><p>&gt; This is de-facto a lockdown propaganda tool.<p>It really isn&#x27;t, and it boggles the mind how easy you come up with conspiracy theories to find alternative explanations to obvious and undisputed facts. Just because you feel a finding is politically inconvenient and incompatible with your feelings and personal beliefs it doesn&#x27;t mean the world is conspiring against you. In this case it just means you&#x27;re talking about stuff you clearly know nothing about nor you care to learn, as is demonstrated by your use of the term &quot;ivory tower&quot; to try to attach your fundamental misconception of what a research paper is.<p>In fact, you should think your assertions through. I mean, you&#x27;re somehow accusing a scientific paper of being rubber-stamped facts while at the same time complaining it&#x27;s propaganda? Come on.<p>Please learn what science is and what is the role of the scientific paper in conducting research, and please stop making conspiracy theories up to fill in your knowledge gaps.')
