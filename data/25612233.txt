As long as they&#x27;re bound by &#x27;static.<p>:)<p>...but it can also have values in it which are not &#x27;static.<p>So is T: &#x27;static, or not?<p>It&#x27;s arbitrary semantics; ...but my take on it is:<p>- IF you take &quot;x is &#x27;static&quot; as meaning the &quot;X is valid for entire lifetime of the application&quot;<p>then if:<p>- x: &amp;&#x27;static &#x27;is static&#x27; and must be valid for the entire lifetime of the application.<p>I would expect:<p>- x: T + &#x27;static &#x27;is static&#x27; and must be valid for the entire lifetime of the application.<p>I&#x27;m happy to agree that&#x27;s not what it <i>does</i> mean, what I&#x27;m saying is that it is <i>inconsistent</i> for it not to mean that.')
