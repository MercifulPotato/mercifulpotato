Second, you want range and precision that captures the smallest widely used physical constant (Plank constant) and range for the largest (Avogradrosâ€™s number).<p>All that really means practically is that you want about 8-10 bits for your exponent.<p><i>If</i> you&#x27;re starting with 32 and 64 bit words, that naturally gets you into a couple particular ranges for mantissa.<p>But they <i>weren&#x27;t</i> starting with a 64 bit word and then removing ten bits for exponent.  So that leaves a big missing explanation for how they got to 53.<p>Especially since, as the author&#x27;s sibling comment says, it was fixed point.  It couldn&#x27;t represent either of those numbers.')
