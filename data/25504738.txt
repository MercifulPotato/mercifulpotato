Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608631932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491379, text='Well, if we&#x27;re going to root for the simplest technology, then I have to say that I&#x27;ve never owned a rice cooker, I cook a lot of rice in a pot, brown rice, black rice, red rice, basmati, long-grain, short-grain, etc, and I&#x27;ve never thought I needed a machine to cook it to perfection. Just any random pot with boiling water seems to do the job well most of the time. So why do I need to replace my old pot with a rice-cooking-robot-with-fuzzy-logic (or just a thermostat throwing a switch)?<p>Edit: Of course my random pot can make Persian-style crunchy rice too... :)')
