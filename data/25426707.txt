Which is why I engaged your post instead of downvoting and moving on.<p>&gt; If it&#x27;s something that can be handled therapeutically and allow the person to live in the skin they were born in without dysphoria, doesn&#x27;t that seem like something an awful lot of people would probably consider, especially if it&#x27;s not invasive?<p>And, we&#x27;re back to conversion therapy. I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with you here. I think my reservations don&#x27;t come from the therapy itself, but rather the circumstances under which it&#x27;s recommended or administered.<p>For instance, is it better to take HRT and be closer to the person you feel by default? Or is it better to take b-yr-c15-53lf trans-blockers to get back to living your happy norm life? Is it being <i>pushed</i> by a therapist? Am I discovering it myself? It brings up a lot of questions about vulnerability, self, identity, etc.')
