That seems relevant if so, and the comment sounds credible.<p>I don&#x27;t know if they do it every election, but I&#x27;m guessing they may have started to do it in the 2016 election and this one in 2021 (they have elections every 5 years), and I could see it being a trend that may continue if the leadership remains the same.')
