Even the ageing process could reasonably be defined as an illness, it probably will be one day if the world hasn&#x27;t gotten there already. That leaves the unlimited nature of healthcare as an open problem. We all die, and arguably anything other than an accident death is people dying sick.<p>&gt; Then, you (as a society) ... define what &quot;adequate&quot; means based on your resources.<p>Your country, and the US if if isn&#x27;t your country, has already done that. The political process asked that question with Obamacare, for example. That is pretty recent accounting of what resources are available and what the people thought they could do with them.<p>And you&#x27;ve not grappled with the key question - we aren&#x27;t going to use wealth to decide who gets healthcare. Ok, take that as a premise, we aren&#x27;t using wealth to decide allocation questions. So someone comes up and says they need more healthcare. We don&#x27;t have the resources to deal with them. What is the criteria where they get told no vs someone else loses treatment? You&#x27;re not allowed to say &quot;well, we&#x27;re assuming there is enough for both&quot; because there are finite resources and infinite demands. We aren&#x27;t dealing with food here where everyone can reasonably be fed. Everyone suffers from diseases and could use healthcare.')
