Item(by='neartheplain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610330031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721810, text='Gab is a free speech-oriented social media platform similar to Parler. They position themselves as a home for users censored by mainstream social media platforms. In practice, Gab tends to attract racist, far-right, and extreme anti-government users.<p>Many people who stormed the capitol on January 6 discussed their plans ahead of time on Gab. US Senator Mark Warner wrote an open letter [0] to Gab in which he asked them to preserve all posts related to that attack.<p>Unlike Parler, Gab has a robust technology stack and operates independently of major cloud providers and payment processors. They were kicked off all those platforms years ago [1], just as Parler is getting evicted from them now. I suspect Gab will replace Parler as the platform of choice for QAnon proponents and the more fervent Trump supporters. For this reason, as well as for the extreme test case Gab represents for the 1st Amendment, I think Gab is worth watching.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.warner.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;_cache&#x2F;files&#x2F;0&#x2F;f&#x2F;0f7317b1-b27b-429f-915e-e8187e1fb4e5&#x2F;EB1EAF925FA2AFBA8219B7DBF485ECB0.letter-to-social-media-re-capitol-attack---gab.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.warner.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;_cache&#x2F;files&#x2F;0&#x2F;f&#x2F;0f7317...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gab_(social_network)#2019%E2%80%93present" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gab_(social_network)#2019%E2%8...</a>')
