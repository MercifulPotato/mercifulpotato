Interestingly I have a small program synchronizing the brightness of my LG with the iMac, the LG would light up ever time I opened the video on the iMac and then come back down on closing. This might explain som weird brightness behaviors I’ve been noticing on the 5k every now and then, I use to decouple the syncing whenever that happens and now I might know why.')
