I&#x27;m on two separate projects right now. One is a legacy mess of unnecessary if statements where none are required (in Django, but that&#x27;s not the issue) and the other is one is a Rails project I took over from a reasonable developer.<p>Rubocop is awesome. The -A flag does the right thing and the lint fixes really do make code easier to read. Even the examples in this post make me even more convinced of Rubocop&#x27;s awesomeness.<p><pre><code>    super if safe?(name, attrs)\n</code></pre>\nSeems reasonable to me. If I care about the return value I can check the parent class. The problem with &quot;if statements for readability&quot; is that as the implementation grows so do the if statements. You&#x27;re pushing state into the program cursor instead of into local variables or data structures. It makes it harder to determine if you have full test coverage and it makes it harder to understand if you&#x27;ve caught every combination.')
