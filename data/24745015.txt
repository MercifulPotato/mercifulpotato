When people do backroom deals to buy good reviews with money there is always plausible deniability so the powder keg was already there, it was just waiting for the fuse to trigger.<p>The fuse was triggered by a random computer novel getting a 10&#x2F;10 review because the reviewer had a relationship with the developer of the novel. &quot;Gamers&quot; don&#x27;t go to game review sites to see the reviewer&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s computer novels. Corruption became extremely obvious now and was given a visible face called Zoe Quinn and therefore everyone started directing their hate against media to that visible face. Of course the media then tried to spin it as an anti women thing even though it was an anti media thing. Obviously media reporting won&#x27;t be reporting negatively about itself. Nobody is going to release articles about how many bribes they have taken to promote certain games.')
