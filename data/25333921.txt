All the landlord needs to do is require that the tenant leave the range in pristine condition or forfeit the cost of replacing the cooktop from their security deposit. Since it&#x27;s virtually impossible for a person who actually cooks to leave the cooktop in like-new condition after a year -- even with special cooktop cleansers -- you may never have to pay a security deposit back in full, ever again!')
