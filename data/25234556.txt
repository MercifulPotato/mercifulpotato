I could not tell if the video was corrupted or if I wasn&#x27;t hearing it properly, at first.<p>Let me be clear: I&#x27;m not making any negative comments about languages that aren&#x27;t English!  I&#x27;m just surprised that I watched the entire video given that I was so confused through the entire thing.')
