Private projects with public repositories are a sign but nowadays I see people started showing up who <i>force</i> themselves to do these projects just to improve their interview prospects.<p>I even had one person admit it when it was obvious they can&#x27;t tell me anything about <i>their own</i> project.<p>Obviously, this is a result of a very know effect where judging performance based on some measurements causes people to pervert this measurement.<p>Other signs that people overlook and misunderstand is deep knowledge on <i>any</i> topic related to software development. If somebody could acquire good, deep understanding of at least one topic it shows they were likely at least at some point interested in it.<p>People are sometimes put off that I seem to be asking large number of hard questions and then grilling to death, but that&#x27;s what I am doing, looking for signs of being interested in something.<p>I even have one question where I ask: What is the question you would like me to ask you? That&#x27;s just another occasion to have a discussion on something where the candidate can demonstrate their deep knowledge.')
