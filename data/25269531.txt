I tend to be more concerned about things which store or update data durably â€” testing a Lambda function is relatively easy, and if you&#x27;re calling other services but your code isn&#x27;t a complete mess that&#x27;s a relatively manageable problem, but something like DynamoDB poses both a migration challenge (especially for a running system) but also questions about correctness if you aren&#x27;t really careful about how you handle things like concurrent access. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not worth using but it definitely tells me where you want robust validation, testing, etc. since it&#x27;s a lot harder to recover from missing&#x2F;corrupted data than it is to resolve a 500 error on a particular endpoint.')
