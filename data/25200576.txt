I’d switch to this immediately, but there’s a couple things I’d love to confirm before downloading&#x2F;paying for another app (I’ve tried nearly every MD editor on iOS!):<p>1. Does it support opening external folders from other iOS apps? I’ve started using Working Copy so that I can store and sync my notes in GitHub repos. I’ve been using iA Writer as my Markdown Editor (since it interops nicely with Working Copy), but I’m interested in something with better Roam&#x2F;Obsidian-like features.<p>2. Does it have a Markdown preview? Or just the editor +\nnavigation support? I often use a lot of Markdown tables, and so having a preview mode is pretty critical to efficiently reading the content later.')
