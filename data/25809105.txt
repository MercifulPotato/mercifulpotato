The police forces will tear gas (illegal in warfare), rubber bullet, etc. black lives matter protestors, but won&#x27;t dare go against white protestors &#x2F; insurrectionists. We still have a &#x27;uge race issue here. We just cover it up with policies. In reality (aka both insurrection and protests) we clearly see the two groups treated completely different.')
