Being barraged with uncertainty, the obvious answer then becomes that there is really no truth, there’s only approximations we can reach through the Socratic method: but eventually you grow weary of this as well. Surely there must be good and evil in this world, and if it quacks like a duck it’s probably a duck.<p>Being dogmatic isn’t a good thing, and I try to keep an open mind: but what’s equally dangerous is subscribing to the ideology that there is no such thing as good and evil. There is, and most of us have known the difference since we were children. I think adulthood is about finding the courage to speak out, when useful and constructive, instead of hiding behind the comfort of relativism.')
