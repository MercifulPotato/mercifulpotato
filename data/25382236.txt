It&#x27;s a fantastic car with unbelievable price to performance, but this is clearly on the way out.<p>Why&#x27;d you buy a re-badged BMW if you are worried about re-sale value and not just buy a MK4 Supra as an <i>investment</i> that holds its Toyota tax value as well as the Landcruisers have?<p>EV is finally making even the non-believers aware that the paradigm shift is happening, what I fail to see is how well those ICE to EV conversions will be. Much of the excitement of a ICE is how it makes you feel from the sound to the vibration you feel, when its all dialed in its an inexplicable feeling that satisfies all 5 senses.<p>You get none of that driving an EV, I did 1000 miles in a performance Model 3 when it first came out and while it was fun, and you have to have a different approach to driving a car with 100% torque at 0 RPM.<p>The raw feeling of man and machine coming into one wasn&#x27;t there at all, although it was a lot of fun to drive, which is why I&#x27;m giving up my collection of ICE stuff besides my first car and bike and getting a Cybertruck.')
