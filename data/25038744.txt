You don&#x27;t need to install 10 different IDEs and learn 10 different workflows for 10 different projects.<p>When I was demonstrating emacs to some co-workers last week, I opened up code in three different languages and pointed out how the comments were all the exact same color. It&#x27;s little things like that. And having things like hl-todo-next&#x2F;previous and flycheck-next&#x2F;previous-error bound to the same keys in multiple programming languages, or binding F4&#x2F;F5 to compile&#x2F;recompile, and that works for any command I want to run, then I can parse through error and warning messages with next&#x2F;previous-error, or cruise through blocks of code with C-M-a&#x2F;C-M-e. And all of this works in C&#x2F;C++, Python, Lisp, Perl, etc.')
