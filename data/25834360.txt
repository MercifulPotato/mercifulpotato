The West cares too much and incited too many revolutions.<p>Remember the Arab spring? People are still burning in hell and nobody in the West gives a shit anymore. Sure, Gaddafi was a terrible dictator, but his death is making things much, much worse. If Assad was dead, things would become even more ugly. All the West wanted is to judge and prevail instead of solving the problems, or at least try not to screw everything.<p>Imagine yourself as an average Syrian or Lybian person, the government is imperfect just like anyone else but life is Okayish. All of a sudden some superpowers just yell freedom in your face, then soon there&#x27;s wars and bombs - your home turned into rubble, many people you were killed.<p>It&#x27;s not only painful but also confusing and not constructive at all. Nobody learned anything. That&#x27;s worse, things like these doomed to happen again, in another year, on another land, and happens to some other people.')
