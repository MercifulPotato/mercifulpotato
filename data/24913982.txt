Not cut off, but slowed..<p>And back in the ISP days, we would actively disconnect high-usage users to free up phone lines during peak times (which was typically 6-10pm on weekdays and 1pm to 10pm on weekends)<p>Depending on how old you are, you may or may not remember a time when ISPs advertised their &quot;user-to-line ratios&quot;, meaning we didn&#x27;t have a phone line for every customer - we maintained a 7:1 ratio which was considered good back then).<p>So in order to allow the lower-usage customers to get online to check their emails or surf after dinner, we had to make sure that there were lines available.<p>If you had already used more than (I think - memory is fuzzy here) 150 hours per month, then you were subject to being disconnected during peak hours.<p>So in effect, we were also throttling them, which is similar to what wireless carriers do today I think...')
