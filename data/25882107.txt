Somebody spins the bucket, making the stars spin.  So you (the water) arrange your molecules in a parabolic shape, thicker at the sides of the bucket and thin in the middle.<p>How do you (the water know)? How do you know that the stars aren&#x27;t holes in a paper sheet with light shining through? How do you know the universe isn&#x27;t spinning, and you&#x27;re standing still?')
