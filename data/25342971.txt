Common for apartment buildings is someone smoking under the detector (more often than you think and often they don&#x27;t realize it they caused the alarm).<p>I&#x27;ve worked at places that take fire alarms (or chemical hazard alarms) very seriously. If they triggered without proper cause, an investigation was always launched to prevent future false alarms. Because otherwise, hundreds of people can die the one day the alarm goes off for real. They have less than 1 false alert over 5 years.<p>My father is a licensed fire safety advisor and I&#x27;ve taken a course on fire- and sound-safety during my bachelor thesis. When things go wrong here, people get hurt, hence every alarm should be taken seriously and false alarms need to be prevented at any cost.<p>I would also point out, if you&#x27;re sitting in the passenger cabin and water comes up to your ankles, it is likely to late to run. Same for fire coming from under your apartment door. That&#x27;s why we have alarms.')
