All of those examples you&#x27;ve listed are clearly marked in some notion of &quot;prerelease&quot;. Even in the FreeBSD example, you&#x27;re going to see that one version is labeled in such a way to make it sound safer. &quot;Long-Term Support&quot; labelling of one version says nothing openly about the unlabeled version.<p>It&#x27;s exactly the lack of label on non-LTS versions I&#x27;m talking about. It has a real impact on people, looking at which version to install, and having no guidance that &quot;this version not labeled in any special way, yeah, probably don&#x27;t use that&quot;. And no, digging into the developer mailing list to figure out what the versioning malarkey a particular project is using is not a documentation of it.')
