It&#x27;s simply a cost-benefit tradeoff decision.  If people perceive that being in California makes more money than the wealth tax costs, they will stay.  If not, they will leave.  There doesn&#x27;t have to be any moral or principled component to this, just simple self-interest.<p>Also don&#x27;t overlook the deterrence factor.  The wealthy currently in CA may stay there if moving represents a greater overall cost.  But anyone not currently in CA would have a great disincentive to never move there.')
