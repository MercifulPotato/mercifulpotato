What constitutes a foul vs a fair tackle, especially during set pieces. And, at what point in time should one draw the offside lines?<p>This year they’ve made enforcement of offsides extremely arbitrary, overturning goals by a distance smaller than the margin of error for the technology. The lines are drawn from players armpits. Armpits are a continuous body feature, and different humans have different dimensions.<p>In short, two good referees can review an identical event from omnipotent angles, and reasonably come to divergent conclusions.')
