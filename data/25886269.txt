But words mean precisely nothing to the right. One moment they&#x27;ll be screaming &quot;Blue Lives Matter!&quot; and the next they&#x27;ll be braining Capitol cops with fire extinguishers. Did a store owner kick out a kook ranting at and bullying people? Great! Did $WEBSITE boot a kook for doing likewise online? CENSORSHIP!<p>Here&#x27;s what I think: Smash out a store window and steal stuff because the cops killed someone you might or might not know? Go to jail. Rampage through the halls of Congress, carrying zip ties and looking for elected officials to kidnap and hold hostage or kill, in the name of overturning the election, because your presidential candidate lost? You damn well better go to jail for a long time.')
