Maybe I&#x27;m not great at describing my vision. Maybe I&#x27;m trying to keep too much control over my ideas (I don&#x27;t like the idea of sharing equity at all). Maybe my ideas are just no good.<p>I feel like there is a snake oil game I don&#x27;t play, where people who want money get good at asking for it, and it&#x27;s a continual game of &quot;try not to get scammed&quot; for the people being asked.<p>I&#x27;d rather just try to fund things myself, but it&#x27;s super slow to get anything done that way.<p>I wish there were a way for good ideas to thrive on their merits without having to beg others to help, and then give huge percentages of my hard work to people who did nothing but write a check.<p>Makes me sick to think about.')
