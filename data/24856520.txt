Society does not like or dislike, cannot be informed or uninformed.  It is just a collective term.  Like government.  Its a figment in people&#x27;s imagination, a term, or an idea - brought to life only because we in aggregate believe it to be true and act as if it is.  Personally, I don&#x27;t consider these ideas to have substance in the way they are presented.<p>The reality, is that &#x27;society&#x27; is made up of individuals.  Individuals are substantially real.  Individuals need to choose for themselves whether they want to be informed or not, according to their conscience.<p>Individuals should also step out of other people&#x27;s business, ie stop trying to manage &#x27;society&#x27;!  But that&#x27;s another story.')
