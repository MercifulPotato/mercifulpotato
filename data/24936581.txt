Several times in the last couple of decades, as graphics and physics engines have evolved, I&#x27;ve built little prototypes whose main goal was &quot;this should work using real physics and mechanics&quot;, and then built things like marble machines. Games like Crayon Physics always felt so limiting; they were <i>only</i> about things bouncing off each other. I&#x27;d like gears that turn and mesh, light that diffracts, motors that naturally work in reverse as generators, and the ability to build machines that use more than one of those effects without any special-casing.<p>I look forward to playing with this, and extending it!')
