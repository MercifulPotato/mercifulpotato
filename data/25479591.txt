(twitter was in SF only for the time they have the tax break. right after it elapsed..coinciding with the covid SAH order, Jack was more vocal about going 100% remote..but the plan to move out of SF was always there even before pre-covid).<p>A type personalities like to follow rules because it makes it easier to compete in the game. because when you have rules for the game, it means everyone who is playing with you also acknowledge the rules of the game. there will be less conflict, more order and they thrive in such environments because it offer sufficient stability to focus on their goals.<p>they also want to be recognised and feted. some humbly and others crave it openly. even those who dont realise it enjoy it. california&#x27;s environment will no longer foster what it did before.<p>have you ever been pickpocketed? have you ever given money to charity? which feels better? we are still pleasure seeking, rationalising apes. we like to say the words but we will still act with our ape instincts.<p>california should eliminate ALL taxes. and institute a flat consumption tax. and stop their dirty politics of turning their people against each other. inequalities exist for a reason. i have seen beggars in india with one limb and living in a shack with three children boiling pebbles for soup who are happier than millionaires in california.')
