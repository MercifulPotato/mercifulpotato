In the US:<p>- Gun rights as they are<p>- Antivax<p>- Pro-life movement<p>- <i>Unrestricted</i> freedom of speech<p>- Certain special religious rights (regarding exemptions from various taxes &#x2F; rules &#x2F; etc.)<p>- &quot;Free markets&quot; in specific fields like healthcare<p>- Largely unrestricted rights to political donations<p>- etc.<p>Each of those has many, many millions of passionate defenders. These are legitimate civil rights issues &#x2F; movements, even if you disagree with them.<p>Something being a &quot;civil rights movement&quot; does not automatically make it right, even if historically that was more often the case than not.<p>Even communism could be described as a civil rights movement, if it won and discredited capitalism. It <i>is</i> described that way in countries where it won.<p>Both pro-life and pro-choice can be correctly described as civil rights movements â€“ rights of the mother vs rights of the fetus. I&#x27;m not pro-life, but I am able to engage with other people&#x27;s opinions without labeling them racists &#x2F; bigots &#x2F; etc. and excluding them from my life, because I can be wrong, and I wouldn&#x27;t see it otherwise.')
