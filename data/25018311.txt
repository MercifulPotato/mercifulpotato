The 1st comes out of the framers ensuring that the government respects an already-existing right - it does not create one.<p>That right, then, cannot be upheld if half the country believes it&#x27;s ok to silence the other half.<p>There&#x27;s a huge value disconnect here and that&#x27;s the fundamental problem. What one CAN do and what one SHOULD do are very different things and I think people&#x27;s pragmatism is blinding them to how this will work out for people 100 years from now.')
