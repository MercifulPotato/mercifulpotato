Sure, private companies aren&#x27;t democracies, but why should they be? Democracies are extremely inefficient.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t the common argument of economists that democracies are more efficient? (I do believe they&#x27;re just paying service to their own governments, and just say what gets them grants and such, but in any case, that&#x27;s the conventional wisdom).<p>Plus, democracies are &quot;less efficient&quot; compared to what dictatorship that did better than a democracy?<p>The main counter-example that comes to mind is China, and even them are mainly effective because of huge population and low labor costs, by being the place to outsource production by those democracies that can pay for it.<p>&gt;<i>I can&#x27;t imagine them being nearly as effective because democratic processes to get new features would always be gridlocked.<p>Grid-locked by what? The purpose of voting in a democracy is to remove gridlocks. You don&#x27;t even have to vote for everything, you can vote on a platform, and can delegate power for a certain time to someone to make the decisions, and then judge how they performed, and vote again after the period ended.<p>&gt;</i>Outside of work I certainly live in a free society. I can walk up to a rich person (&quot;a lord&quot;) and insult him to his face and nothing will happen.*<p>You&#x27;d be surprised.<p>Plus, they can crush your neighborhood (e.g. to throw the tenants out and build some monstrocity), cajole with your lawmakers, fuck your working life, pollute your city&#x2F;countryside&#x2F;water supply, and usually nothing will happen.<p>And if they really cared, they could trivially have you killed, with nothing happening. It&#x27;s just not worth the small risk of them being tied to it. But they hire legal teams and detectives to throw dirt at their enemies all the time..')
