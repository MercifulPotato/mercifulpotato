That&#x27;s with an assist from Russia and Comey.<p>Despite all that, Clinton conceded the next day. She called Trump and congratulated him. She gave a gracious concession speech saying things like &quot;We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don&#x27;t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them.&quot;<p>No one accused Trump of fraud at the ballot box. She didn&#x27;t seek to undermine the democratic process. She graciously accepted defeat to a man who had been threatening to lock her up.<p>Lastly, he was the incumbent this year. That&#x27;s such an advantage that the incumbent has lost only five times in a hundred years.<p>The field was definitely tilted this election as in the last, but it was in Trump&#x27;s favor both times.')
