We&#x27;ve almost gone under quite a few times. We&#x27;re still here. It&#x27;s an interesting way to live. It&#x27;s certainly not for everyone, but you get an enormous amount of influence and autonomy. The pay isn&#x27;t &quot;great&quot;, but I make enough that my wife can stay home with our three kids and the numbers in the bank account just keep going up.<p>Of course, a lot of that is lifestyle decisions, but working at a small company is a lifestyle decision as well.')
