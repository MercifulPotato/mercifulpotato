They simply have to be.  A static electric motor, of the type needed for higher speeds, given full voltage would not only snap bits of the drivetrain but rip apart its own mounts.  So they are all limited to various degrees.<p>The limiting factor on low-speed power for EVs isn&#x27;t the motor.  It&#x27;s the strength of the drivetrain and ability of the battery system to provide the necessary current&#x2F;voltage without cooking something.')
