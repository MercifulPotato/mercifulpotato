I like that data is presented, but I find it rather short term oriented.<p>I have lived in market rate neighborhoods and have known the angst of lease renewal, each year wondering whether I was going to be able to afford to stay. And I was effectively kicked out a couple of times, forced to pack up and move for economical reasons.<p>I have also lived in rent controlled areas where, even as a renter, these worries go away. Unsurprisingly to me, the character of the neighborhood changes quite a bit when everyone is not constantly worried about being kicked out. People can build for the long term, engage with their neighborhood organizations, form a stable community. You frequently see people staying in the same apartments for decades.<p>The nature of the changes induced by market rate housing vs rent controlled housing is much more long-term than what is considered there. Long-term turnover needs to be understood, not just rent rates.')
