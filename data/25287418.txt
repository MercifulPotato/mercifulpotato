The FAA doesn&#x27;t employ an airline design team to review the schematics, etc.<p>- if the paperwork matches FAA regulations, then it&#x27;s certified. They don&#x27;t open inspection plates or walk around with a flash light and verify anything unless they have a particular reason to do so.<p>The FAA regulates the airline industry by receiving, storing and reviewing paperwork.<p>However, the submitted paperwork misrepresented how MCAS worked, stating that it met FAA requirements when the nose-down rate was actually about 4x what was documented, and was continuous rather than occurring once or twice.')
