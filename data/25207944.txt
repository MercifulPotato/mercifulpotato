ZigBee devices do not &quot;phone home&quot; over the internet, and in addition to that are not able to download and upgrade their own firmware without a supporting internet-connected gateway&#x2F;bridge device. Most of the risk comes from the attack surface that the gateway&#x2F;bridge provides, or from attackers having physical access to individual devices (eg. by obtaining keys from the device&#x27;s memory). As for ZigBee gateway&#x2F;bridge devices, in most cases you can replace it with an open source solution that gives you more control (eg. Home Assistant + a Conbee USB stick)')
