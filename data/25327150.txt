Certainly looks and feels like an eCommerce website from the late 2000s&#x2F;early 2010s.<p>I&#x27;m curious if this was an intentional choice or a sign the website has been on cruise control since the acquisition. It certainly makes me wonder what Hsieh was doing as CEO as late as this summer either way, which is to say while he was certainly a pioneer in the 2000s I&#x27;m not sure what about Zappos in the 10+ years post-acquisition feels cutting edge.')
