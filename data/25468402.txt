For me, the CompSci degree was the best part of my entire technology background. I loved the classes that stretched the mind: Automata, multiple algo classes, etc.<p>The downside - is once I had exposure to those mental highs, programming wasn&#x27;t nearly the same. The luster of C++ pointers or code optimization (or whatever) wasn&#x27;t nearly the same after touching the deeper stuff. Which made me sad - to be honest.')
