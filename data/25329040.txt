I was literally thinking about this today with a view to improving the personal training space.<p>I’ve a few friends who are personal trainers, they all complain about the “zoom centric” solution where by as a client you dial in to a zoom call, and have to move a phone, iPad, whatever, around a bunch so the PT can see you.<p>My mates have suggested that what they really want is to be able to select from a range of views while a client performs some maneuver.<p>While this doesn’t solve the upstart cost (multiple cameras, bandwidth, etc), it’s cool that it does solve the “hard part” of working out how to stream to some common end point that allows the viewer (the PT) to select the best view.')
