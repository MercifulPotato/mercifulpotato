The vessel &amp; primary heat exchanger of a MSR which are in contact with liquid-fuel is equivalent to fuel assemblies of many solid-fuel reactors. In solid-fuel reactors the clad which is designed to contain fuel doesn&#x27;t last long. Similarly, in MSRs the materials in contact with fuel doesn&#x27;t last long.<p>So, we need to dispose the vessel and primary heat exchangers similar to Zr-clad million dollar fuel assemblies.(PWR&#x2F;BWR reload costs $60-100 million per 12-18 months.)\nMaterial wise Zr clad is way more expensive than stainless 3XX &amp; graphite combined. Even if Ni-alloy is used in disposable MSRs Ni-alloy+graphite will be slightly cheaper. (Base metal costs: Zr metal: ~$22,700&#x2F;ton Ni metal: ~$13,100&#x2F;ton)')
