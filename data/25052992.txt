Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605047705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25052008, text='&gt; Is it allowed to tell wives who push husbands like that to get jobs themselves?<p>Certainly its a sign that much better communication is needed in the relationship (and probably, honestly, should have happened before the relationship proceeded to either children or marriage, but aside from warning to people not yet in the situation [0], that&#x27;s kind of moot.)<p>That communication probably needs to be a lot more nuanced than &quot;tell wives [...] to get jobs themselves&quot;.<p>&gt; Is it really believed that housework is as hard and stressful as a tech job?<p>Having done both, I believe it. Of course, there&#x27;s probably people for whom housework is less or a tech job more &quot;hard and stressful&quot; than is the case for me.<p>&gt; I feel like we&#x27;re not really supposed to voice that aloud, but how else is that to be challenged?<p>Why should it be challenged? Winning some abstract argument about the generalized relative strenuousness of different activities doesn&#x27;t seem particularly useful.<p>What is needed in a relationship is mutual communication and working arrangement that functions well for the two parties involved. Abstract generalities are mostly a distraction.')
