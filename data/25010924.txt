Item(by='leto_ii', descendants=None, kids=[25011027], score=None, time=1604695196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010564, text='&gt; Choosing to neglect (or underfund) the maintenance activities doesn&#x27;t cost the business anything for some period of time (the delay). And performing them does not (within the period of that delay) bring in any revenue. It is only a cost to them, it has no visible upside within their time horizon. By the time the costs start catching up, it&#x27;s death by a thousand cuts. Usually they&#x27;ll go from 100&#x2F;0 dev&#x2F;maintenance to 99&#x2F;1, then 98&#x2F;2, and so on. Then one day it flips from 80&#x2F;20 to 20&#x2F;80 and they realized they fucked up. But by then they&#x27;ve been promoted, so who cares?<p>Pretty much what I noticed as well.<p>&gt; You have to convince them<p>This is exactly the part that I hate. Good practices, code quality, design etc. are not a hobby of mine. The business is not doing me a personal favor by allowing me to practice these ideas.')
