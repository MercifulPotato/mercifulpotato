It was something along the lines of &quot;You must login to perform that action&quot;.  Our site didn&#x27;t have a login system.<p>By fixing that bug, conversions went <i>down</i>.  We literally did an A&#x2F;B test to prove that giving the user a stupid error <i>increased</i> revenue.   We even played with the text of the error to maximize revenue.<p>We never figured out why, but my hypothesis is the user has to feel like that are making progress through the task they are trying to achieve.   Getting a pointless error, and then getting past it, gives them a sense of achievement.  They&#x27;re then happier and more invested in your product when it comes to plugging in a credit card number...')
