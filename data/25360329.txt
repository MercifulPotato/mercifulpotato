These &quot;legal reasons&quot; may be user-hostile (e.g., censorship) or user-friendly (e.g., GDPR).<p>Having said that, it&#x27;s just good form to specify <i>why exactly</i> a request was denied rather than spitting out an &quot;access denied&quot; response and call it a day. Be liberal in what you receive, conservative in what you send, yada yada.')
