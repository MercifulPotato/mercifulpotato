Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608400514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478263, text='&gt; Personally I disagree with the whole idea of wealth taxes, you should be taxed when you do things, not taxed just because you own something worth money.<p>I used to as well, but now I flipped. I don&#x27;t think you should be taxed for doing things, I think you should be taxed for wealth. I think there should be no tax for working ( income ), buying things ( sales tax ), etc. Activity which promotes economic growth shouldn&#x27;t be taxed. But wealth should be taxed. House&#x2F;assets&#x2F;etc should be taxed.<p>It&#x27;s insane that you get taxed at 39% for work ( income ) but someone letting his money &quot;do the work&quot; gets taxed at 20% ( long term capital gains tax ).<p>&gt; I should be able to go live in the woods alone and not have the government take some percent of my net worth just because I exist.<p>But the government protects your ability to do so. So no. Though I&#x27;d be in favor of governments setting aside land internationally where people are allowed to live &quot;in a state of nature&quot;. They are not allowed to form tribes&#x2F;governments, but are allowed to live &quot;free&quot; as they wish untaxed without the help of society.<p>&gt; If I start a company and it gets valued at 30 million dollars, why should the government be allowed to force me to sell my company to pay their wealth tax?<p>Cause the company exists in a society governed&#x2F;protected&#x2F;etc by the government? It&#x27;s the beneficiary of the environment.<p>&gt; Now the government is going to force me to sell my car?<p>Nope. You could always go out and work to earn money to pay the wealth tax too and keep your car.<p>I&#x27;d be in favor of removing all taxes for one wealth tax.')
