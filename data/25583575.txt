I think you&#x27;re also right about the sick people comment. The two people I know who committed suicide were elderly and started experiencing alzheimer&#x27;s. Their decisions seemed quite final. I suppose if I were in a similar situation, I would probably find it a rational decision, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would be reasonable.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the argument before (temporary idea and effective means), which probably is true of the non-terminally ill. I haven&#x27;t seen any data supporting it so far. I&#x27;ve also haven&#x27;t seen any definitive evidence against it, only suggestive stuff.<p>There are some states with restrictive gun laws that show a slight decrease, but others seem to be unaffected (continue to increase). Just as there were less restrictive states that show the same mixed behavior. (CDC data referenced by both sides)<p>One thing that I saw in the CDC data was that suicide rates have risen over the past 30 or so years for all states. Non-firearm suicides are 27% more common since the 80s, but it didn&#x27;t look at why firearms are decreasing as a percentage. RAND says the number of homes with at least one firearm has stayed fairly consistent over that time (40% -&#x2F;+ 5%). So it seems that there isn&#x27;t a substantial reduction in suicides based solely on gun control laws, but it seems it&#x27;s also impossible to say if the number would have been higher without those restrictions. The fact the ownership has stayed the same, but firearms are a lower percentage of suicide cases could just be demographic or preference issue, but we don&#x27;t know.<p>One interesting thing I observed which I didn&#x27;t see studies about (because both sides are focused on just confirming their positions on pro&#x2F;anti gun policies) is the correlation between mental healthcare service ratings and suicide. This is just rough, but I found these two maps appearing to be more correlated than the gun ownership and suicide maps&#x2F;studies. Just something I found interesting and would need an actual study to look into it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mhanational.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;ranking-states" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mhanational.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;ranking-states</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;pressroom&#x2F;sosmap&#x2F;suicide-mortality&#x2F;suicide.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;pressroom&#x2F;sosmap&#x2F;suicide-mortality&#x2F;...</a>')
