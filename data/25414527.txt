Many if not most of those parts are imported.<p>If there are tariffs on imports, either:<p>1. Boeing will pay tariffs, increasing the cost of each plane. Great for Airbus, bad for Boeing.<p>2. The parts are sourced locally instead. These parts will invariably be more expensive, as if they were cheaper they would have been sourced locally before. Again, boeings get more expensive, great for airbus, bad for Boeing.<p>3. Boeing, to avoid raising prices and giving market share to airbus, decides to move manufacturing elsewhere.<p>What applies here for Boeing, is also going to apply to Tesla and Caterpillar.<p>Tariffs create incentives to source locally, but they simultaneously create incentives to manufacturer abroad. It is a very thin tightrope to walk and I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that Washington has the skill to wield them effectively.<p>On the topic of national security: “When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will.”<p>I&#x27;m far less concerned about a war breaking out between two countries with healthy trade relations and cultural exchange. Do we want China to be our enemy? Why?')
