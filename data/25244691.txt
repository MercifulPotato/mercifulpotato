( These long term payment are not unusual in many other industries, in some cases it is in fact the norm )<p>It wont happen now, but in later stage of the cycle where they fail to find new sources of revenue or profits.<p>One good thing with the current 45 days terms is that customer can ask for Refund of the past 30 days and Apple generally are pro customers. In the Mobile Gaming, Pay to Win  Gaming Industry this gives tremendous power to the players &#x2F; customers, especially those &quot;whales&quot; ( as they are called, meaning heavy &#x2F; top spenders ) could threaten for refund. But there are also group of people who abuse this system and Gaming Developers have no way to appeal, it is literally Apple took away their&#x27;s revenue. ( And it is even worst if those people sold their account before the Refund )<p>I still see Gaming, being 80% of App Store Revenue should be a separate store with separate set of rules. We cant have one size fit all solution to the App Store. And Apple needs to work better to help both its customers <i>and</i> developers.')
