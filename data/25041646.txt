Item(by='munfred', descendants=None, kids=[25041700, 25064548, 25042131], score=None, time=1604968225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041213, text='I have a suggestion to make on this regard, not related to body language.<p>In scientific conferences, typically at the end of the day (e.g. after dinner, with drinks) you have &quot;poster presentations&quot;. These presentations look pretty much like these images from Google [0]. Everyone goes to a big room, and the presenters stand in front of their posters which are ~90x120cm. People walk around looking at the poster titles figures, and when one of them catches their interest they stop to listen to the presenter (if they are already taking to a group) or ask him about it.<p>The fact that you have these big posters at all ends up being just a cue so people can identify who is working on which kinds of subjects&#x2F;projects, and go talk to them about it. My advisor had this really funny idea of having &quot;microposters&quot; at a conference, where he just taped an A4 paper with one figure and the project title and his name to his back, and that is all it took to start conferences. It worked super great, it was exactly what it took to &quot;break the ice&quot;.<p>In these conferences people will typically have read your papers, but they don&#x27;t know your face, or even that you were in a paper (at most they will remember first author or last author, which is the professor). So just having a small cue &quot;I&#x27;m Bob and I work on X&quot; is already sufficient to break the ice.<p>My suggestion would be two things:\n1) For mimicking the poster presentation aspect of scientific, to allow people to upload an image which gets displayed on an area of the map. Then the presenter can stand there, and interested folks just gather around him to listen.<p>2) Allow some kind of mouseover view that shows additional information about the person, eg a bio, a description of the projects, or a picture&#x2F;link to a description of the projects.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet seen a good virtual scientific conference, and it is exactly this aspect of the social interactions that is missing. In the end of the day, the primary reason why scientists move halfway around the globe to gather in a hotel for a few days is not to so much to listen to the speakers as it is to gather in small groups at breakfast&#x2F;lunch&#x2F;dinner&#x2F;happy hour&#x2F;breaks, and exchange ideas and get to know each other. Academic conferences allow people to put a face to the names they see in papers, and it really helps make science feel more humane and prompts you to exchange more.<p>Thanks!<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=scientific%20poster%20presentation%20pictures&amp;tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=rimg:CR-ifEMp6Vr-YZQUQn5BQKQv&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS874US874&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAIQrnZqFwoTCNC21ebZ9uwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAQ&amp;biw=1354&amp;bih=1458" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=scientific%20poster%20presen...</a>')
