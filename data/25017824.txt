Gangs and people in gang-plagued neighborhoods are very reticent to name names, in fear of retaliation.<p>Every police shooting is investigated. They are often found to be justified, sometimes not. There&#x27;s room for argument about the impartiality of these investigations, especially historically.<p>The fact remains that dozens of blacks are murdered every week in the USA, while black deaths in the hands of the police are comparatively very rare.<p>I completely agree that police should be held to a higher standard. But I don&#x27;t understand the complete silence and active suppression of debate over the bigger problem.')
