I’m sure there are better methods of preventing drunk driving then punishing people after the fact. Measures include:<p>* Better party hour transport availability<p>* Better driver awareness, education, and propaganda<p>* More enforcement of drunk suspects before an accident<p>* Police cooperation with bars, i.e. tattle-tail programs<p>Moving to America I’m astonished how much drunk driving goes unpunished here. In rural areas there people often go a few dozen km to the next bar, and there is no alternative to get home except to drive. When there is enforcement it seems like it is only over the top punishment. Bartenders seem to be fine with people having a few beers and driving home (as long as they are not <i>“too drunk”</i>).<p>I think America is failing spectacularly in preventing drunk driving, and I think the main reason is that this over reliance of punitive measures that simply don’t work.')
