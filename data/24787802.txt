An allegation is not proof<p>If you are indicted for a crime, the prosecutor must prove the allegations<p>If you are inclined to believe the allegation, your bar for proof will be quite low. Perhaps the accusation is enough.<p>For me, a destabilizing accusation like that requires more proof than anonymous CIA sources saying its true. I wish more Americans would put their dislike of Trump aside and demand that proof. It&#x27;s not about Trump, it&#x27;s about a destabilizing accusation from a government department. If they can do that about the President you don&#x27;t like, they can do it about the President you do like<p>Again, the <i>hard evidence</i>, tangible and verifiable, is about the same for both<p>I am open to be proven wrong, believe me, but links to indictments is not proof')
