But I&#x27;m in Massachusetts and we have early voting and a election commision that seems to want to make it easy.<p>Mandatory Voting actually seems like an interesting idea.  Work&#x2F;Government would have to make accommodations.<p>Voting rules here are handled by local entities (cites, counties and states).  So sometimes sadly it gets gamed to try to favor one group of voters over another.<p>Its kinda a mess. Lawsuits are common.')
