Then when it&#x27;s fixed, the code runs flawlessly. That&#x27;s happened a LOT in my 10 years of C++ development.<p>I can leverage the compiler to do 90% of the refactoring work.<p>For example, say you want to remove a field from an object in C++. The compiler will tell you every place where the field is accessed and raise a compiler error. In python this won&#x27;t manifest until the code is run in that particular spot. I can only imagine that in this type of language a well intentioned refactor could easily create 10 bugs that don&#x27;t get triggered for a very long time.')
