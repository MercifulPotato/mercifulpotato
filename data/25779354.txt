The salient point (defensive gun use) is not substantiated by your linked report as it specifically mentions the CDC may not collect this data<p>This is an odd claim, given that the &quot;salient point&quot; seems to be a verbatim quotation of the linked report, which contains further citations...<p>&gt; Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by\ncriminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to\nmore than 3 million per year (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about\n300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010). On the\nother hand, some scholars point to radically lower estimate of only\n108,000 annual defensive uses based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (Cook et al., 1997).')
