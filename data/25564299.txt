Whenever a countdown timed challenge was about to end, I would hear the audience count down starting with &quot;10&quot; at maybe 10.7 seconds, &quot;9&quot; at 9.7 seconds, etc. Then after &quot;1&quot;, there was a small period of awkward silence and murmurs from the audience before the siren blasted.<p>It&#x27;s a good example of how measurement of time in terms of human perception differs from the pure mathematical sense, and rounding is a good compromise here (wherever it doesn&#x27;t display fractional seconds).')
