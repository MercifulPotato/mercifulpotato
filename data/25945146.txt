By limiting purchases they are preventing their clients from getting into a trade that will almost certainly result in losses.<p>&quot;the short sellers&quot; could very well be other retail investors.  I personally shorted GME &amp; AMC when they hit ridiculous prices (I lost money on these trades when they became 2x ridiculous)')
