So I&#x27;ve found it useful for things like: &quot;which flashlight should I buy?&quot;<p>As another example, I had to repair my Fisher &amp; Paykel double-oven last year and was able to find help from an F&amp;P technician on reddit.<p>So, I guess I mostly use it as a reference where the information density isn&#x27;t important to me.')
