At least <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_astrology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_astrology</a> says &quot;On the fifth day after the birth of a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim&quot; and &quot;Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose&quot;.<p>However, I found it hard to find good resources using any of my standard search techniques as I&#x27;m overwhelmed with texts popularizing the use of Mayan astrology. I did eventually track down <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;Madrid-Codex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;Madrid-Codex</a> :<p>&gt; The [Madrid] codex contains a wealth of information on astrology and on divinatory practices. It has been of particular value to historians and anthropologists interested in identifying the various Mayan gods and reconstructing the rites that ushered in new years. It shows, for example, the Muluc years celebrated by a dance on high stilts. Also illustrated are Mayan crafts such as pottery and weaving and activities such as hunting.')
