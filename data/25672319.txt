They are meant to handle the run-of-the-mill protesters, and prepare for an active shooter or bomb threat. A mob of people breaking in is very different. Handguns are much less useful when you&#x27;ve got 20 people breaking through the windows. You can&#x27;t try to arrest one of them without being swarmed by the others, and if you end up firing a shot the crowd will panic and attack you and you simply don&#x27;t have enough firepower or distance. To defend against a mob, you need many more officers (enough to stand side by side at relevant choke points) equipped with riot gear and tear gas to disperse the crowd. And then a Quick Reaction Force on standby with guns and nonlethal weapons who can reinforce any area where the mob is threatening to break through.<p>Without the numbers and the right equipment for the situation, the mob was able to break through and then the priority had to become securing the congresspeople until sufficient force could arrive to help clear.')
