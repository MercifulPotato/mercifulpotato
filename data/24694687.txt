Do you think we&#x27;re seeing a shift away from it?<p>We have been since at least the introduction of abstract base classes; even in purely dynamic python, having the ability to more explicitly declare and interrogate intent than pure duck typing is frequently useful.<p>&gt;  do you think &quot;Pythonic&quot; code will include significant use of explicit interfaces?<p>Sure, as it already does via abcs. But it will also still use lots of duck typing, though over time more of it will be “static duck typing” by way of protocols.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mypy.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;protocols.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mypy.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;protocols.html</a>')
