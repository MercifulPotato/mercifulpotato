It&#x27;s incredibly naïve to think that companies are flushing half a trillion dollars a year down the toilet on advertising without any attempt to validate their investments.<p>We have a very large and conspicuous example here that suggests that Uber hasn&#x27;t been doing this.<p>Running experiments like you suggest is difficult and to do them right requires some fairly specialized knowledge to do correctly. I&#x27;d doubt more than a small percentage of companies have the expertise to effectively run any kind of advertising experiment that returns useful data. Most businesses lack that knowledge and rely on metrics provided by the people selling the advertising—who are likely to provide self-serving numbers.<p>While I&#x27;m sure some of the bigger F500 companies do a good job validating their ad spend, I <i>most</i> companies don&#x27;t even know how. Certainly the majority of small businesses have no idea how effective their advertising spend is aside from very crude word-of-mouth feedback.
