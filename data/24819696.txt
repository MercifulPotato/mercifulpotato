The others are reviews of current evidence that are readable and reputable. There are abundant studies on this subject.<p>Here is what the WHO actually has to say about masks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;emergencies&#x2F;diseases&#x2F;novel-coronavirus-2019&#x2F;question-and-answers-hub&#x2F;q-a-detail&#x2F;q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;emergencies&#x2F;diseases&#x2F;novel-coronavirus-2...</a>):<p>&gt; <i>“ Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks reduce potential exposure risk from an infected person whether they have symptoms or not. People wearing masks are protected from getting infected. Masks also prevent onward transmission when worn by a person who is infected.”</i><p>&gt; <i>” Within wider environments where the virus is spreading, masks should be worn by the general public in settings where it is not possible to maintain at least 1 meter from others. Examples of these settings include indoor locations that are crowded and have poor ventilation, public transport and places of high population density – among others.”</i><p>Also, masks are not “plague vectors”. Best practice (from WHO) is to clean the mask daily:<p>&gt; <i>” If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean plastic, resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag. Clean your mask once a day.”</i><p>Your rant is not really worth addressing further.
