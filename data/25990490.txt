No. That’s because they don’t have uncontrolled spread there, which leads to mutations due to the virus’s exposure to heterogenous immunity in the population.<p>That&#x27;s one hypothesis.<p>Don&#x27;t particular populations already have a degree of natural herd immunity to viruses which are commonly found in their proximity, compared to populations on the other side of the world who do not?<p>Like how Europeans brought their diseases, which they had built up immunity against, to the Americas which then decimated the indigenous populations.<p>Could we hypothesize that many Asians have a stronger natural immunity to covid19?')
