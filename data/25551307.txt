I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still the case, but Hearthstone used to have a decent amount of random effects (other than just basic card draw RNG). A big complaint at the time was that the randomness felt really awful if you were on the receiving end of an opponent&#x27;s good luck.<p>Sometimes it felt like a chess match where you had executed your strategy perfectly, but randomly three of your opponents pawns turned into queens.<p>I get that you&#x27;re talking about something more subtle than that (and maybe more akin to just, well, card draw RNG) but it&#x27;s a delicate balance because it can also feel really bad for players being on the receiving end of randomness.')
