But politicians can be held accountable by the people who give them a mandate based on election results. The public debate, journalism, education and the voting booth are instrumental in doing that.<p>These things aren&#x27;t self-evident though.<p>They are really expressions of emerging collective behaviour. And that behaviour is always a function of a multitude of social, economical, political, cultural, religious, geographical,... factors.<p>Authoritarians don&#x27;t necessarily take power through a violent revolution. It just as easily happens by simply exploiting weaknesses in the economy, society, financial system, the legal and the constitutional framework to a point where they arrive into power. Weaknesses such as economic and social inequality, widespread resentment, poverty,...<p>Many authoritarians and populist leaders derive their legitimacy from the same democratic processes that also lead to a lawful state which upholds moral values such as basic human rights.<p>&quot;Democracy&quot; in itself isn&#x27;t a guarantee towards a net &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; outcome. That&#x27;s just value attribution.  Democracy is just a form of governance which could just as well lead to less then desirable outcomes.<p>Democracy doesn&#x27;t protect society from bad actors who spout populist rhetoric. Nope, society can only protect itself as long as enough individuals are willing to call that rhetoric out for what it is: damaging and hurtful. Your &quot;democratic&quot; rights are only worth anything to the extent that each member of society is willing to back them.<p>And that requires believing in the value - the legitimacy - of the E.U. as a shared project.<p>&gt; Whether the EU is actually democratic, is another matter.<p>Well, during last year&#x27;s election cycle, I did get presented a voting ballot that allowed me to directly elect members to the European Parliament. The candidate I voted for, did got elected.<p>... which leads me to believe that, yes indeed, the E.U. is &quot;actually democratic&quot;.<p>And as far as I can tell, the fact that the E.U. provides a legal framework that allows me to enact my individual rights. Such as the GDPR. Not just from Facebook or Google. But also from public authorities itself.<p>I perceive that as a good thing.')
