As I didn&#x27;t really want to permanently affix it, we hammered it in instead of soldering it (I still had quite a bit to learn back then). It worked, though it might have required slapping the console before starting it up in latter years, I ended up softmodding it and removing the chip before selling it, IIRC.<p>I never got around to install Linux on it, though I learned some bits along the way, and ended up turning it into quite a versatile media center: DVD player, game console, HDD with movies on it, network access, etc.<p>I built another one with only a softmod, and a larger HDD in 2008, and only retired it around 2011 as it couldn&#x27;t play 1080p videos. I feel like I never found a proper replacement. HTPCs are generally bigger and more expensive than the original xbox, but I should have a good look at the Android TV market soon-ish (I suspect I&#x27;m going to try a Xiaomi device), with a USB DVD player and Kodi as a launcher, plus content served by jellyfin. Or I&#x27;ll bite the bullet and buy a NUC.<p>I had high hopes for the Firestick, but not being able to change the launcher is a dealbreaker. Stay away from that toxic waste of a backdoor for advertisement and lock-in (the remote and CEC integration is nice, though, I wish pine64 offered something similar).')
