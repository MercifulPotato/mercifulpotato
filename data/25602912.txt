One difference is that (as I understand it) you have to do some kind of computation for each Feynman diagram, and if there&#x27;s an infinite number, you have to cut off the enumeration of diagrams at some point; whereas with FGGs, in at least some (important) cases, you do not have to enumerate the factor graphs and can in fact do computations on the whole infinite set at once.')
