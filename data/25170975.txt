I still love Salsa even though I stopped actively going to Salsa clubs a few years ago (like many things in life, activities will fade in interest&#x2F;fade back in). As a note, most of the social dancing advice applies to a world without covid dangers.<p>1) Keep on going. You can take a break though.<p>One of my favorite articles from &quot;The Unlikely Salsero&quot; (archived copy)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20080316160328&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unlikelysalsero.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;08&#x2F;magic-of-time-last-one-standing.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20080316160328&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unlike...</a><p>2) Footwork is <i>everything</i>. One of the mistakes beginners make is that when they do their basic step, they take &quot;too big&quot; of steps. This is acceptable when you are a beginner. However, when you start doing more complicated footwork&#x2F;leading that is required by patterns, larger than needed steps can easily break the precise on-beat timing needed. Please try to focus on small steps.<p>3) Leading properly requires signaling. Something like a simple squeeze of the hand if you want your follower to stop. Also, prepping the follower for their turn by doing a very, very slight wind up.<p>4) Listen to Salsa music more if you are not already. The key feature of Salsa music is that breaks happen on the 8&#x2F;12&#x2F;16 bar of the normal song. If you can anticipate the breaks by counting in your head silently while dancing, this will make the difference in your lead from above-average to performance. I recommend Gilbert Santa Rosa. They are more laid back then the frenetic Salsa bands.<p>5) If you are just starting out, asking a follower to dance is one of the most intimidating things you can do. You will get rejected. Don&#x27;t take it personally. When you get better, you still will be rejected. In a group class at a club, take note of the followers in the class (you usually rotate) who seem enthusiastic. Ask them to dance if you see them still around.')
