Maybe it&#x27;s hard to remember what a joke he was at the beginning, and even through most of the campaign. I&#x27;d say the chances are much higher than zero that the pro-Trump base would win him the nomination again if he ran. It&#x27;s easy to imagine him pulling media stunts for the next 4 years in preparation for just that.')
