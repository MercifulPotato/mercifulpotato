I can&#x27;t help but wonder if it looks like this. The anti-overwork provision (creating 20 hrs&#x2F;wk over time and allowing but disincentivizing going over) and single metric (total creator revenue) seem like major wins for me. Do others think that more companies will begin to go in this direction? Something about it seems so much more simple, sustainable and elegant.')
