I haven&#x27;t for a long time. While I agree that there is propagation of misinformation happening on the platform, that&#x27;s not my main concern. My main concern is that Facebook, and other platforms, will use their framework for &#x27;removing misinformation&#x27; as a tool for censorship in the pursuit of their political agendas. My chief contention is that this poses a larger risk to society than the propagation of misinformation in the first place.')
