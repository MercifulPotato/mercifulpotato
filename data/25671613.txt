Best as I can tell, they&#x27;re social hubs, serving the same function as the MUDs my generation (dial-up BBS) played. The actual gaming parts are just the backdrop, like nightclub themes (jazz, EDM, rock).<p>A buddy of mine cofounded FlowPlay. Surprisingly popular, but nothing like Roblox. Pretty much same idea. Users keep going back to hang out with their friends.<p>I&#x27;ve read that Roblox also has a thriving eco system of third party developers. Something that MineCraft, SecondLife, and other 3D&#x2F;VR MUDs&#x2F;MMORPGs didn&#x27;t quite crack.<p>So Roblox gets that sweet flywheel effect. Like an in-game Steam (app) store.<p>Since my nephews cannot and will not use lame adult phones or chat apps, I installed both Roblox and FortNite, their preferred chat clients. I&#x27;ve never actually played any of the content.')
