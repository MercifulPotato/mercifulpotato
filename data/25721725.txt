Item(by='dr_kiszonka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610322112, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711062, text='Thanks for answering.<p>1. I think the website does your project a disservice instead of amplifying it. This is because it seems to focus on the cool engineering side of the project (really cool!). Instead, I think it should focus on the value it could generate for the clinics and how close you are to make it work.<p>For example, you change the first paragraph as follows. (English is not my first language, so phrasing and grammar could certainly be improved.)<p>Current version:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying to validate a program I&#x27;ve written to help your clients see what they might look like after a breast augmentation instead of using Photoshop or relying only on vests. Maybe they&#x27;d like to see how they could look by using Breastimate? Please take a look at what I&#x27;ve come up with so far and offer any feedback. (These results are from my rudimentary proof-of-concept)&quot;<p>Suggestion:<p><i>The idea</i><p>Showing clients how they would look like after breast augmentation often requires Photoshop or wearing a vest. This costs time and money, and results are often inaccurate.<p>My goal is to immediately provide accurate results, reduce the costs to the clinics, and increase client satisfaction by using artificial intelligence and computer vision.<p><i>Proof-of-concept</i><p>Currently, my software simulates breast augmentation results that are quite close to real-life augmentation outcomes. The below pictures were produced in 30 seconds from uploading pre-augmentation photographs.<p>[Photos: &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after (software generated)&quot;, &quot;after (real-life outcome)&quot;]<p><i>Partnership</i><p>To improve the results and validate this approach, I am looking for breast augmentation clinics to partner in using and developing this software.<p>What I am offering:<p>- Free lifetime access to this software<p>What I am looking for:<p>- feedback on improving it from a clinician&#x27;s perspective<p>- access to pre- and post-augmentation photographs to further increase the accuracy of produced results<p>2. I couldn&#x27;t find the comparison pictures in the format that I described above.<p>3. I would move the technical details to the very bottom of the page or a separate page. Instead, to build trust, I would write a sentence or two about who you are, add your picture, and link to your resume or LinkedIn.<p>4. I would remove the &quot;bizarre experiments&quot; because they distract from the main idea and suggest your software is not working well. Someone who skims the text and doesn&#x27;t know what labels or masks are may think that your software produces Total Recall-like breasts.<p>5. You could also address how your software is better &#x2F; cheaper from other options. I found one example here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epsteinplasticsurgery.com&#x2F;procedures&#x2F;breast-procedures&#x2F;breast-augmentation&#x2F;breast-implants-101&#x2F;choosing-the-right-size&#x2F;3d-computer-simulation-of-breast-augmentation-with-vectra-3d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epsteinplasticsurgery.com&#x2F;procedures&#x2F;breast-proc...</a> BTW, you need to make sure that the vast majority of clinics indeed relies on Photoshop and vests. Otherwise, your main selling point suggests that you don&#x27;t know this space and may turn off people you are contacting.<p>Just my 2c.<p>I hope this helps and that you succeed!')
