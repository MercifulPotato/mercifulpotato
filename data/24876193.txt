That is not a violation of copyright. </i><p>Making a copy on its own is not fair use. What matters is the <i>reason</i> for making the copy. If you are making an connectivity-shifted copy (aka, for viewing away from internet access) there could be a fair use argument to download content from a streaming site that is not otherwise available for offline consumption.<p>But the flipside of that: if there is a way to access the content in a way that fair use is not implicated (i.e., because the copyright owner makes the content available for that use case such as offline viewing, even if payment is required), then generally fair use does not apply.<p>Remember: fair use is a <i>defense</i> to violating copyright, and it must be reasonable under the circumstances. Not wanting to pay for a license for your intended use case is generally never considered reasonable.<p><i>If you can show it to me, then I am allowed to take a copy.</i><p>That has never been the law, at any point in the history of copyright, dating back to before copying works was trivial.')
