In time I was able to recognize them from photo to photo, watch them age, watch the fashions change (as well as consumer camera technology).<p>Entire lives are laid out in the photos: childhood, adulthood, marriage, children of their own, old age, finally a headstone in a small field in Missouri....<p>There is a somber but touching &quot;cycle of life&quot; on display that can make you try more often to &quot;seize the moment&quot; or at least reflect on your existing in it.')
