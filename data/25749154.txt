I was once in an association (ry) and we tried finding out if we could have a donation link on our website and we were told it is not allowed. Even just having a bank account number was not allowed. The only way to receive a donation would have been for a person to ask us proactively and then we could tell _that person only_ our bank account number.<p>I run a free web service where some users have asked me to set up a donation system but AFAIK it is illegal so I haven&#x27;t done it. Instead I set up a company and will sell premium accounts with some borderline useless but actual feature that normal accounts don&#x27;t have, so that it&#x27;s no longer a donation.')
