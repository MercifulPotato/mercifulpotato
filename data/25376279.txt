A description of what you think will happen needs better evidence. At least one other factor is religious&#x2F;cultural inertia encouraging people to have lots of children, and that is somewhat characteristic&#x2F;unique for each given culture s.t. you can&#x27;t really generalise it too much.<p>There was a similar theory about non-democracies being unstable (Democratic peace theory, wrt greater public wealth), and how free trade liberates nations. How did that turn out for Chinese superpower?<p>China is an emerging superpower, and economic powerhouse, and anti-democratic to the extend of suppressing democracy in HK. It also does <i>lot</i> of trade that never seems to encourage an increase in civil liberties.<p>Now, maybe the theory was all an illusion caused by the domination and coercive power, of existing democratic nations.')
