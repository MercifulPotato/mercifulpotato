Item(by='disabled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612217769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992895, text='&gt; One of my favorite signs you might have ADHD. Caffeine doesn&#x27;t do anything for you and&#x2F;or makes you sleepy.<p>Caffeine is an adenosine A2A antagonist, which has therapeutic potential in ADHD, except the half-like makes it an improbable candidate.<p>Ironically, I just started taking an adenosine a2a antagonist, known as Nourianz (istradefylline) (link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nourianz.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nourianz.com&#x2F;</a>), as a last-resort drug for my severe restless legs syndrome, which has been going phenomenally well. I also have ADHD combined type (inattention and hyperactivity), and fairly severely. I take Vyvanse for my ADHD.<p>Anyways, I have been taking the the istradefylline for a week now, and it has made a tremendous difference in many of my ADHD symptoms. Additionally, it greatly increased my sense of wellbeing within 1-2 hours of initially taking it, and it has been sustained for the entire week.<p>Thanks to istradefylline I can now focus seamlessly and without effort. I can just &quot;lock in&quot; to whatever I want to do. Before, it would require some static force (&quot;friction&quot;) to be able to &quot;lock in&quot; my concentration to do the task. I can also now just focus, without hyperfocusing. It now comes naturally to me. I also no longer find myself pacing around the house aimlessly. I also do not randomly get up from my seat or fidget hardcore. I can also lock back into a flow state without effort if I am disrupted.<p>I hope you find this interesting! The adenosine a2a antagonist made a huge difference in both my restless legs syndrome and ADHD symptoms. I cannot imagine NOT being on this medication for my ADHD.')
