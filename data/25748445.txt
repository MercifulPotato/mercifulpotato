It&#x27;s not perfect and in the development process but I think it&#x27;s a real alternative to native-like API focused on performance and easy implementation. It&#x27;s just a pure js. So every fix should enhance all framework implementations. Decoupled with a separate package to prevent a bloated bundle. Work with mouse event, so nothing new to learn. And most importantly it&#x27;s just a utility. You can use what you want. Finally, it doesn&#x27;t sort, move,s or whatsoever. Node positions are stored separately. Each movement calculates the current position and triggers any effect that movement caused. So It may cause &quot;dragging only with zero effect&quot; Or &quot;Switch with another element&quot;. It has also container&#x2F;children architecture. So you can drag a child, or parent..etc<p>Edit: I have implementation for React and Vue but not for Svelet. So if anyone is interested let me know.<p>And congrats to Isaac for this nice work dedicated to Svelte community.')
