I live in Madrid, this went on from March 30 to May 2 (I&#x27;m having trouble finding the exact dates, as they are not the same for every region in Spain, so we might have been locked down a bit longer than this).<p>After that, there were very rigid limitation about at what times we were allowed outside and at what times. At the beginning we were not allowed to be further than 1KM from our house, and only from 06:00 to 10:00  and from 20:00 to 23:00.')
