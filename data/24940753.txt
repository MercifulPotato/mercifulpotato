Started a ketogenic diet ~3 years ago - was very close to FODMAP and immediately saw stomach&#x2F;gut&#x2F;sweat&#x2F;sleep&#x2F;general well being improvements across the board. Been super interesting (since) to see what has an effect on me and after how much.<p>In particular, I cut alcohol in a big way (mostly casual beer) and was fairly stunned to realise how much I&#x27;d lived with &quot;booze blues&quot; every day. It&#x27;s now very, very obvious the effect alcohol has on my body afterwards (elevated heart rate, booze blues, etc etc). But at the time was like a fog being lifted for the first time in almost 20 years.<p>We&#x27;re all different, what works for me might not for you, etc - but personally was hugely enlightening to just <i>reset</i> and play around with what does what.')
