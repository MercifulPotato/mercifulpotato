So of course the politicians decide what the military is allowed to do. Unless we&#x27;re talking about a military dictatorship, though in that case it&#x27;s maybe more accurate to say that the military high command has taken over the policy functions of the state rather than the military existing in some magic policy-free environment.<p>Or to quote von Clausewitz: &quot;War is not an independent phenomenon, but the continuation of politics by different means.&quot;')
