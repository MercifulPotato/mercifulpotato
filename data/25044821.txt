Item(by='lifthrasiir', descendants=None, kids=[25049272, 25045505, 25045372], score=None, time=1605008191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044131, text='I don&#x27;t like the abbreviation &quot;pwd&quot; at all, mainly because it looks too much like &quot;password&quot; which is also often abbreviated to &quot;pwd&quot;. I prefer &quot;cwd&quot; which would unambiguously mean the Current Working Directory.<p>Thinking more about that though, &quot;cd&quot; in the shell universally means &quot;change (the current working) directory&quot; but can also possibly mean the &quot;current directory&quot; as well (and DOS&#x2F;Windows &quot;cd&quot; without arguments does print the current working directory). Note that similar abbreviations like &quot;md&quot; and &quot;rd&quot; are not as universal, as they are &quot;mkdir&quot; and &quot;rmdir&quot; in *nixes (for the good reason).')
