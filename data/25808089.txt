Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25808290], score=None, time=1610857314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807973, text='&gt; This begs the question - why do people pick and choose their religious dogma, but not their political dogma?<p>Interesting possibility: Religion is a protected class, politics isn&#x27;t. So people fear viewpoint discrimination (i.e. getting canceled) for diverging from the dominant political party, because that isn&#x27;t protected, but not for diverging from any given religious doctrine, because that is protected.<p>Maybe we just need to declare the political parties to be religions. In a way they are. And it&#x27;s in the same way that caused religions to be protected to begin with, isn&#x27;t it?')
