Hot end geometry varies by printer and can affect ideal print temperature. Also they used to often have inaccurate temperature sensing, though that is fixable and perhaps things have improved there. I don’t know how much these factors would affect things, but if the variance across products is too great, filament manufacturers couldn’t solve the problem with pre defined settings.<p>Other factors that affect print quality are: filament diameter consistency (must be very precise), absolute filament diameter (must be known), nozzle wear (changes over time), environmental humidity and air temperature, and air flow. Michigan, Florida, and Arizona might require different settings. And then part geometry matters a lot. Someone up the comment thread mentioned curling. This can happen even with perfect temperature settings if part geometry is not ideal. Once I was totally unable to print a large rectangular part without curling until I replaced the 0.4mm nozzle with a 0.8mm nozzle. The thicker layers eliminated layer delamination that allowed the curling.<p>It really takes a bit of learning and experimentation to get things working sometimes. It’s not a perfect process by any means.')
