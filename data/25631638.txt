I find that uncommon projects (even if unsuccessful) tend to be a better predictor of what I’m looking for.<p>- Uncommon educational paths: having changed majors, or pursued other stuff later (e.g. people that do physics in college but after 2 years working they switch to coding and join a masters in ML)<p>In the end you are trying to find people that are independent, emotionally stable, a little non conformist, but ideally don’t have serious communication problems. That is said easier than done though..')
