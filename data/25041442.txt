Maybe via consulting&#x2F;support on the technology, grants&#x2F;donations (OpenSSL, now), maybe just making it open to foster contributions and long-term maintenance[0]. Maybe the actual software isn&#x27;t the company&#x27;s main focus and open-sourcing the code is just a way of ensuring accountability and quality. IME, people are actually <i>far</i> more conscientious when they know they code&#x2F;docs <i>could</i> be read by anyone for all time... even if it probably won&#x27;t.<p>[0] I&#x27;ll grant that this is probably quite rare. That&#x27;s not the point... the point is that there are many potential reasons for open-sourcing.')
