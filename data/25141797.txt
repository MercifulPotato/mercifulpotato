Then I realized that I was over-using inline styles anyway since I was always afraid of messing with old CSS. I was adding layers of overwrites just not to accidentally change something unrelated.<p>Now I can&#x27;t imagine myself ever writing regular CSS again. I just love how I can look at the HTML and instantly &quot;visualize&quot; how the component will look just by seeing the classes. No more mysterious cascades where it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint where the styling is coming from. It makes iteration so fast and responsive design has never been easier.')
