However, what I couldn&#x27;t find was a charge controller that would be able to reasonably e.g track charge and time. I didn&#x27;t have the time and sufficient expertise to design such a charge controller myself.<p>My options ended up being buy a pre-made, significantly more expensive UPS and pay for the up-down conversion loses; Or just used my 12V feed with no monitoring and hope for the best. I chose the latter, which ended up OK given this was a research project with a limited time horizon.<p>Is the situation any better today?')
