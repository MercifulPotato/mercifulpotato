I worked in the US (NYC&#x2F;SF), the UK (London) &amp; emerging markets. I held number of positions primarily focused on sales, GTM (strategy&amp;operations), program management and customer services.<p>I am from a small &amp; underdeveloped country where I would like to eventually settle down.<p>As there are not many good opportunities in tech sector &#x27;back home&#x27; I want to come up with the plan to start something on my own that will become my main source of income.<p>Ideally, that would be a digital product&#x2F;service that I can take off the ground by myself and that can be scaled without necessarily hiring full time employees. My goal is to get to ~$5-10k&#x2F;month of steady revenue stream with low expenses and keep it small&#x2F;simple.<p>Although, I do not have tech. background I do have some programming experience (Python, Swift and SQL) as well as understanding web dev and fundamentals of cloud computing. So far I was able to pull off a couple of hobby projects, but the time has come to become serious. :)<p>I want to minimize mistakes and start executing as soon as possible so if you have any suggestions on: - what to focus on first - how to build out a solid (non-corp) plan - how to validate market&#x2F;users - decide on programming language&#x2F;platform to use to build a product<p>please let me know. I would really appreciate that as I am excited to start providing&#x2F;selling value instead of my time.<p>Thanks, zogqi')
