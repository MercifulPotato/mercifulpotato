The top 500 posts on Hacker News contain the following unique Tesla stories:<p>* Tesla cancels it&#x27;s no-questions return policy<p>* Tesla is against Right-To-Repair bill in MA<p>* How to fool Tesla&#x27;s autopilot with images on the road<p>* Tesla has water cut off at Berlin factory construction site<p>Nor should you expect to find much positive sentiment in thread comments. This level of lopsided negativity forms a feedback loop - there&#x27;s little incentive for someone with a positive sentiment to expose themselves to this sort of negativity, so they stay quiet or avoid the thread. This causes the thread to become more negative, and provides even less incentive for the next person to write something. This repeats until only people who wish to be trolls or contrarians remain.')
