I&#x27;m not the one suggesting there are universal truths here.  You are the one who established freedoms as binary.  Something being &quot;hotly debated&quot; and &quot;not black and white&quot; is a point in support of my argument.<p>2, 3, 4. I thought not owning the rights was implied by my comment.  I edited that to make it more specific.  I don&#x27;t know how potential for people owning a copyright and publishing their own works applies to issues 3 and 4.<p>5. You do have certain expectations of privacy even while in public.  Laws against upskirt photos are one example.<p>&gt;And yes we grant them conditionally, with the unstated assumption you lose them temporarily if your actions stop other people rights.<p>So do you know agree that there are &quot;buts&quot; on freedom?<p>&gt; It certainly not the case of these youtube channels, they are not restricting anybody&#x27;s freedom.<p>I have the right to vote and have my vote counted.  These Youtube videos are trying to invalidate my vote from being counted.')
