Europe is in a very difficult position now. RCEP agreement has just happened (it will take 1-2 years to ratify it by all countries), but it is a huge step towards Asia economic dominance.<p>Next, China is sponsoring actively similar agreement for African countries. Africa is a potentially huge market and has a lot of natural resources. It seems that Europe totally drop the ball here, the only thing they have done was to destabilize some of the African countries in the name of supporting democracy - this failed miserably everywhere, new rulers were equally undemocratic and often even more hostile towards Europe.<p>The same with US, they totally gave up Africa, they could not to come up with something else than mumbling about democracy and trying to impose some post-colonial trade deals. China is playing this game much, much better and, whatever I think of them, they have actually something substantial (investments other than digging diamonds and cobalt) to offer.<p>Europe will loose Asian and African market, India is building up its economy fast as well, so soon Europe will not have anything to sell over there too. Europe lags behind US for a long time in all aspects (education, innovation). This only means marginalization and the role of destination for cheap crap that cannot be sold on other markets.<p>It seems that UK politicians sort of noticed that, that&#x27;s why they decided to cut ties with EU without much fear (brexit without any agreement) as they count on their influence and position in Commonwealth countries, what will give them backdoor access to developing markets and be part of the global economy.<p>Europe leaders really need to wake up. Stop concentrating on immaterial issues, push for more competitive economy, lower taxes, less regulations, development of innovative companies in a natural way, not buy being financed from some EU founds - this just does not work, as this creates companies that are good in acquiring those funds, not creating market value.<p>Common market should be available for all EU countries, not only (still) the richest ones - &quot;innovations&quot; like 2014&#x2F;67&#x2F;UE directive are not helping - this one hit less developed EU countries - it forces companies to pay local wages for workers who are delegated to work in other country. As a result the truck driver from Poland has to earn the same money as the driver in France, Holland, Germany, depending where the truck is in the given moment of time. This makes new EU countries companies less competitive. And nobody cared that it violates EU treaties and the rules of &quot;free movement of goods and services&quot;.<p>Stop internal fighting with anyone who dares to have different views or elect government that EU bureaucracy does not like (Italy a few years ago, today Poland and Hungary).<p>There are very noble ideas like reduction of CO2, this is important, but maybe Europe just can&#x27;t afford being the leader in that effort if the rest of the World just does not really care? Europe need sources of clean and cheap energy. What the biggest EU economy does? Nord Stream 2, to buy gas from Russia. Is it helping? Not really. Why can&#x27;t Europe start spending funds on innovations in nuclear and fusion energy reactors?<p>I don&#x27;t see any leaders that Europe used to have who could push Europe in the right direction, unfortunately.<p>I am waiting for someone who would just say: hey, maybe moving whole &quot;The European Parliament&quot; every month from Brussels to Strasbourg and back does not make any sense and it costs a lot of money that can be spent better.')
