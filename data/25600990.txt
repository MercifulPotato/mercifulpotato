When it involves any knowledge that wouldn&#x27;t be available to the public, people on HN spout plausible-sounding theories as though they&#x27;re fact, but they actually have no basis in reality. &quot;Turned out Company X was having trouble monetizing Feature Y so they&#x27;ve decided to pivot and adopt a new marketing strategy which is why customer support now takes so long to respond if you&#x27;re not on an enterprise tier.&quot; And for other random companies that stuff sounds perfectly plausible, but every time I&#x27;ve been in a position to fact-check against deep personal knowledge of the company in question, it&#x27;s been total BS. Just wild speculation presented with an air of authority.')
