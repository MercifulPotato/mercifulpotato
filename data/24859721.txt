Neither is 100% passive.<p>The screen casting business means continuing to make a few new tutorials per month and making occasional improvements to its site. It sure pays a lot more per hour of my time than it did 18 months ago, though!<p>The starter kit is still in alpha, so there&#x27;s a considerable amount of work to do. I&#x27;ll be raising the price as it hits various milestones, though. Once it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot;, it will be mostly passive other than updating libraries.<p>Elixir is a rough market since it&#x27;s very niche but still has a surprising number of authors, conferences and screen casters in its ecosystem who are also creating educational materials.<p>My MRR is fairly low, but it&#x27;s just enough to cover my expenses living in Taiwan.<p>When I have the bandwidth, I&#x27;ll launch another product which will be still more passive and it won&#x27;t be limited to <i>only</i> Elixir devs. After that, the plan is to spend some money on outsourcing the editing of my videos and some routine social media tasks.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alchemist.camp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alchemist.camp</a><p>2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phoenixigniter.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phoenixigniter.com</a>')
