Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25120612], score=None, time=1605586283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25119939, text='&gt; Putting my manager hat on, I ask: Can I replace 10 of my average engineers with this one person? The answer is never &quot;yes&quot;.<p>Well, yeah, people aren&#x27;t interchangeable cogs. A person that is capable of delivering 10× value per unit of working time when properly employed probably isn&#x27;t a drop in replacement for 10 1× developers. And managers thinking of people as interchangeable cogs where productivity multiples work by simple substitutions that way are great at getting ~sqrt(<i>N</i>)× (or less) output and quick burnout from <i>N</i>× (<i>N</i> &gt; 1) developers.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s because a team does more than just technical stuff. There&#x27;s documentation, dealing with customers, bureaucratic stuff, etc.<p>Yeah, and all of those things are things a developer can be better at than average, not just technical design and coding. Sure, there&#x27;s some high productivity developed that are average or worse at some but much better at one area, there&#x27;s also high productivity developers that are better than average across the board.')
