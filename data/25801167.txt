As a result, even for subjects like mathematics or computer science there just wasn&#x27;t a path for an ambitious learner to piece together the full material from a bachelor&#x27;s degree. These days, even automated graders are behind the paywall and the promise of an education for all is more distant than ever.<p>OCW is truly an invaluable resource worth supporting and sharing!')
