Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608359602, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470487, text='The entire country only locked down once, starting March, reducing to milder conditions in April and totally ending (going to &quot;Alert Level 1&quot; which isn&#x27;t the same as before COVID but it&#x27;s pretty much normality in everyday life) on June 9th. But Auckland (their biggest city), locked back down after another cluster of unknown origin was detected, perhaps related to an import business, for several weeks from August, and the rest of the country was at &quot;Alert Level 2&quot; in that period until the first week of October.<p>Subsequent small outbreaks have not triggered a lockdown because their government remained confident it understood the scope of the infection although one leak got close, they asked people not to travel into central Auckland for a day or two at one point and sealed off a residential building while they tested everybody who lives there.<p>They anticipate continuing to have occasional small outbreaks detected, e.g. a border worker gets infected, infects a family member before a test spots it - and their plans assume they will either quickly achieve confidence they&#x27;ve contained the outbreak or they&#x27;ll lock a region or if necessary the entire country back down to eliminate.<p>For example at a press conference the press basically wanted to know if the government was imagining people should prepare to pay for an extra week&#x27;s accommodation on vacation in case they can&#x27;t return home (obviously unaffordable to many families) but the government seemed to be more thinking about if you&#x27;ve left a week&#x27;s cat food and instructions for a neighbour, do you have a way to tell them they need to feed your cat for an extra week? So, personal anxieties rather than population scale ones, the government can pick up a hotel bill but it can&#x27;t bring your pets back to life.')
