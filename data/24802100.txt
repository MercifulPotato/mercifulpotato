Item(by='08-15', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602864032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24796518, text='No, it&#x27;s the Unites States&#x27; fault.<p>In 1982 (iirc), the US decided that Thorium is a &quot;source material&quot; for nuclear weapons, even though it very clearly isn&#x27;t.  Since rare earth metals have chemistry very similar to Thorium, they tend to occur together.  Anyone who mines REE, ends up with waste Thorium.  It&#x27;s just slightly radioactive, chemically inert sand, but by decree it is a &quot;TENORM&quot; (technically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material), and by decree, someone stealing it could theoretically build an atomic bomb from it, even though they can&#x27;t in the real world.<p>So because it&#x27;s a TENORM, the waste can&#x27;t go back into the same hole in the ground that it came from.  And because it&#x27;s a &quot;source material&quot;, it has to be guarded.  And the eventual disposal has to follow all sorts of regulations.  All of that is so expensive, that nobody bothers anymore.<p>China simply doesn&#x27;t play these stupid games.  That&#x27;s why they are cheap.')
