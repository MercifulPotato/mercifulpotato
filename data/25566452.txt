Locomotives don&#x27;t have a problem carrying the weight of a diesel engine plus a generator; in fact the extra weight works in their favor.<p>If you tried that trick with an airplane it would never get off the ground. Locomotives use this system not for efficiency but because they need the low-end torque electric motors provide. (If they only needed efficiency they&#x27;d just drive the wheels with the diesel engine directly.) Airplanes don&#x27;t need torque; they need power.<p>You can run an airplane on batteries but only for a few minutes with modern battery technology. Practical battery-powered aircraft for military applications are not going to happen any time soon. We might see battery-powered air taxis soon but those are not even close to meeting military requirements for fighters, transports, etc.')
