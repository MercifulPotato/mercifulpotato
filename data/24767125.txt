The Altaic hypotheses were higher-profile proposals that happened to include common origin for Japanese and Korean. Even dismissing the former, the latter is not exactly out of consideration.<p>And, as the post points out, the whole line of argument is a curiosity that has little concrete bearing on the fact that the two are <i>very similar</i> from a learner&#x27;s perspective.')
