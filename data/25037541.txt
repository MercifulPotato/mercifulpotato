China, Israel, and every other power &quot;interferes&quot; in our elections, too, just like we do to them.<p>What was disingenuous of the US media was to make a huge deal out of 2016 shenanigans by Russia without any context, making it appear to the average voter that it was both significant and unique, neither of which is true.<p>The intel community and major media spent 3 years and tens of millions of dollars looking for something illegal or even unethical that the Trump campaign did related to Russia, and nothing was found.<p>The idea that there are &quot;too many checks, rechecks, processes ... to commit fraud at the scale needed for a large election&quot; is absurd in the US where the whole national election can be determined at the end by a single large county in one swing state, as happened in 2000. Now realize that 45 states were required to haphazardly design and implement, in 3 months, a mail-in voting system on a scale with which they had no experience, we&#x27;d expect a lot of errors that aren&#x27;t even malicious.<p>Add in a flurry of state governments quickly passing various laws to swing things to their favor as happened in all the swing states, and you have a recipe for disaster as we&#x27;re seeing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;sunday-review&#x2F;russia-isnt-the-only-one-meddling-in-elections-we-do-it-too.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;sunday-review&#x2F;russia-isnt...</a>')
