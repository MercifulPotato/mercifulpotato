Work from home is likely to see an uptick in companies that permanently allow it (or are open to it), but I <i>very, very</i> much doubt it will be the norm.<p>&gt; Flexible working arrangements, e.g. spending a few days a week at the office and a few at home, is the most likely outcome for most workers<p>This is exactly what I <i>want</i> once I&#x27;m allowed to go back into the office. The isolation of working from home sucks, and the communication barriers even more so. I&#x27;d be fine going in all the time too, but living withing walking&#x2F;bus distance of my office would be far more important to me then. I do not enjoy being fully remote, and short of long-term travelling, would never willingly do it again.')
