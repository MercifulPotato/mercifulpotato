I tried it towards the beginning, after a few years, and am currently on it again, running my own homeserver, and it&#x27;s been getting better and better each time. It&#x27;s definitely still got a few rough edges, but it&#x27;s both much more reliable and much more fully featured than in the past. E2EE is finally very easy on the flagship clients, which is a pretty great achivement on an open federated system.<p>Anyway, I think it&#x27;s still here and growing, but it pops into the HN consciousness every now and again. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s popularity is similarly varied :)')
