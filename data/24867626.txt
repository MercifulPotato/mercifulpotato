I worked in both engineering and research, so I could perhaps elucidate the difference.<p>Basically if one idea out of a hundred major ones really takes off, that&#x27;s considered a success for a researcher. We&#x27;re talking one, maybe two real hits throughout the entire scientific career. Researchers are well aware that much of what they do and publish is of little consequence. And they have to make &quot;empty promises&quot; from time to time to continue getting funding from the easily distracted politicians and upper management. They also almost have to have lofty, aspirational goals to keep the motivation.<p>Basically 99% percent of work of a good, hard working researcher consists of going down the alleys to see if they are blind, which they nearly always are. But the remaining 1% often makes the whole thing worthwhile to all parties involved. The question is, can you pull off that 1% hail Mary or not.<p>The potential discoveries we&#x27;re talking about in this case could upend industries, reshape the world economy, and bring about the post-scarcity future, at least when it comes to energy. If we&#x27;re willing to strain credulity a little, they might even enable interstellar travel. Is that worth a few days of the Pentagon budget? To me, it is, as long as we maximize the chance of the aforementioned Hail Mary.<p>In contrast, an engineer that doesn&#x27;t succeed with her ideas at least 50% of the time would quickly find herself out of a job, so by definition the amount of risk engineers take on is as little as possible.')
