For some reason Cable companies really hated this idea, presumably because... ads I guess?<p>I think that if they simply hadn&#x27;t fought against people trying to basically turn what they already provided into something more like Netflix, those tools would exist and be built with a cable package as a backend.<p>They provide all the shows in a datastream that they would otherwise provide via cable, let other people deal with paying for developing devices to make it easier to use, and price it more reasonably so that it can compete with a Netflix. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d be able to, but since they own the pipes and own the FCC it seems more likely than not. But they&#x27;d be doing a lot better than they seem to be now, they just priced themselves out of the market once networks realized that people would just download their content for free if it was too inconvenient to watch. Better a little than nothing...')
