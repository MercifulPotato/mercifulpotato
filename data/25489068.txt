The pearl clutching was so intense I was very worried the pearls would break from pressure!<p>Maybe because almost no man of any quality whatsoever would want to raise a daughter to be a whore, used and abused in all degrading possible ways. Funny that.<p>There is nothing &quot;free&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; or any 2020 buzzword that would make this argument anything other than disgusting. As if raising your daughter to be used in gangbangs and things like that is <i>anything</i> other than pure form of degeneracy and the absolute lowest of the low.<p>Some people think that just because they are capable of doing the god awful nasty things that no sane man or woman would do, that they are somehow &quot;progressive&quot; as if that takes some special skill or something...<p>What skill do women need to have in porn? Fake tits, fake lips, fake asses in some cases, fake everything.. they just get paid a lot of money because there are not enough insane people that want to do it.<p>Fathers talking about daughters being literal whores. Jumpstarting... What is happening with this world..')
