So you have the same number of people managing extremely more money &amp; supporting a larger population. Government has shrunk. Government is either more productive or severely under performing things they need to do (assuming they&#x27;re even working on the right things).<p>If &quot;small government&quot; means reduce US government spending, that&#x27;s interesting because the only different between Democrats &amp; &quot;small government Republicans&quot; is that the latter also cut taxes while increasing spending. Democrats don&#x27;t go out of their way to advertise they need to increase taxes, but at least they&#x27;re not outright lying &amp; ignoring the problem.<p>Unless by small government the movement really means &quot;no government&quot;. It&#x27;s interesting to me that government abolishing is associated with anarchists on the left and &quot;small government&quot; movement is on the right but the &quot;small government&quot; movement is so poorly defined on what goal it&#x27;s trying to achieve that in practice there&#x27;s actually no difference in the outcome being achieved.')
