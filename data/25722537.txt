Item(by='axguscbklp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610325905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722261, text='The recent wave of deplatforming has affected a very large number of people based on the actions of a small group of rioters. Imagine if far left rioters stormed Congress and all of Reddit got nuked as a result. Personally, I&#x27;m a lot less worried about right-wing insurrectionists than I am about politically motivated censorship on social media. Why? Because opponents of the insurrectionists are vastly stronger than the insurrectionists. Opponents of the insurrectionists dominate the military, intelligence agencies, tech, academia, and media. The insurrectionists pose virtually no threat to me. The difference between social media controllers&#x27; reactions to last summer&#x27;s riots and last week&#x27;s riot shows that a concern for keeping people from getting killed is not the controllers&#x27; dominant motive. The ones doing the censoring this week don&#x27;t care if you get killed in a riot that people encouraged on their platforms as long as the riot was politically correct and they won&#x27;t get into trouble for having allowed people to incite it.')
