CentOS Stream will only receive updates that have passed RHEL QA and CI testing.  These are patches that <i>would</i> normally go straight to RHEL in the next point release, so these are stable.<p>Even Fedora is pretty damn stable.  Stream will be far, far more so.  I&#x27;m planning to run Stream for all but one of my use cases (my home router, which is a SPOF for my internet connection.  Not sure what I&#x27;ll run there yet).<p>More info about why I think Stream is mostly a good thing (not universally a good thing, but for most use cases it is IMHO):  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;centos-is-not-dead-please-stop-saying-it-is-at-least-until-you-read-this-4b26b5c44877?sk=e500c2f16403d634ff8a4ea17d705252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedomben.medium.com&#x2F;centos-is-not-dead-please-stop...</a>')
