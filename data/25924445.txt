So I have tried to figure out what to do with the old phones.<p>Most common android reuse case: IP Camera. There are a few different apps which turn your phone into an IP Cam. I have used old phones to watch my 3D printer, explore under the floor in my house (phone attached to stick), to watch&#x2F;record plants grow, and as a security cameras. The problem is, often with these old phones, streaming live video will drain the battery faster than the charger can charge it. I&#x27;m still looking at workarounds for this latter issue. Depending on what you are trying to film it can be surprising how &quot;good&quot; the old Android cameras are.<p>I usually use this app: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.pas.webcam&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.pas.webcam...</a><p>The other thing I have done is turn them into dashboards, this is more applicable to tablets though.')
