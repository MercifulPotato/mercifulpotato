In the US, I&#x27;m not optimistic about a bike revolution lasting past covid.  We&#x27;ve seen some new bike infra being deployed in Boston but not much more than we&#x27;d be getting anyway.<p>When you say car traffic, I presume congestion and not volume of cars.  I&#x27;m sure volume is down overall and I recall from discussions about congestion pricing, even a 10% decrease in volume can result in congestion completely dissipating.  In normal times, Induced Demand would lead to volume going back up as transit users convert back to cars.')
