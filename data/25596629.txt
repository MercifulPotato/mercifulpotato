Can I get $100 please?<p>Every team has their own process that is tailored to their needs, process is decided by devs, not managers, managers only do &quot;I&#x27;d like to have this kind of visibility&quot; requests some times and I yet to see those requests introducing any kind of burden, usually very miniscule things.<p>We have very simple process in our team with two issue types for devs - task and bug. We have two week long sprints and  put tasks from backlog into them.\nStatuses are: open, in progress, code review, done.\nIf I forgot to move a ticket than a team lead or feature lead will do that for me whenever they are at it.<p>Besides this there are epics but devs don&#x27;t deal with them, feature leads and team leads and PMs do.<p>This is all running on an instance that is deployed every 4 hours with changes from master and goes through the same upgrade process our customers would go.<p>There&#x27;s special set of very high-level tickets but we don&#x27;t deal with those, those are for for people 3 levels above.<p>Sprint planning is about 30 minutes because backlog grooming is done for devs by feature leads and team leads and that&#x27;s pretty much the only obligatory meeting.')
