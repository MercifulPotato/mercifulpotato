I&#x27;ve been bitching about the industry burning down my shelves for years now... it&#x27;s unfathomable how much people rely on these stupid streaming services.<p>That said, I&#x27;d still gladly pay for the music discovery, I just have started to feel cheated out of my money over the years doing so. Should I really be paying $10&#x2F;month to listen to the same songs I listen to every other month. I don&#x27;t go on a music collection binge all <i>that</i> often you know.<p>And then poof, it&#x27;s gone.')
