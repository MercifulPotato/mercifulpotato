See, it is hard to know, because on Wednesday Trump held a campaign rally where he told a crowd of armed terrorists to go to the Capitol and &quot;save&quot; the country from &quot;weak&quot; Republicans who were going to <i>vote</i> to certify the results of the election Trump lost.<p>Nobody is coordinating these various bans.  The fact is that the Trump campaign had been allowed to violate terms of service for years because he was a major party candidate for president, and then because he actually became president.  Those special allowances could only go so far.  Once Trump crossed the line and started giving marching orders to terrorist groups -- and yes, the people who ransacked the Capitol were terrorists according to the definition the US government itself uses -- nobody could continue to look the other way.')
