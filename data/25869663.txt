Having a loss-leader implies that AWS is providing + capturing value elsewhere. In this case, you assert this is from Data Transfer. But regardless of where the cost-centers are, AWS is delivering value to their customers and charging for it. There is competition in the cloud space, and in all honesty moving clouds generally isn&#x27;t a huge deal, at least if you&#x27;ve architected your systems with that in mind (which any SysAdmin worth their salt should be doing in 2021).<p>The fact is, customers <i>like</i> having all their cloud managed under one roof. Customers like the exceedingly strong uptime guarantees provided by AWS. If customers have choice (which they do), and they&#x27;re choosing AWS, why is it a bad thing if Elastic can&#x27;t compete? If AWS is winning, it&#x27;s because they have a holistic offering that customers like better.')
