We had 100,000 Flash games. It matters because of distribution. One distribution mechanism was through MochiMedia and MochiAds. You&#x27;d upload an SWF to MochiMedia&#x27;s site and they would aggregate it out to thousands of other sites. Without a playable package format you would have had millions and millions of files. Game creators liked the &quot;copy protection&quot; that the SWF package provided and game sites liked the &quot;sandboxed&quot; game files. If a browser could host a ZIP file and load all the assets out of it as if it was a sandboxed local directory that would be the equivalent.')
