Though I agree with &quot;usually&quot;.<p>Yes, if in doubt then block the caller. I mainly provided it as an example because the article had it as an explicit requirement.<p>You&#x27;re right about errgroup. One can fit only so much in a HN comment. And I didn&#x27;t want to distract by making it look like &quot;no, you should use <i>my</i> favourite library instead&quot;.<p>But again it depends. If an error is handled by doing log.Fatal(), then there&#x27;s no point in using errgroup.<p>I&#x27;m also not passing ctx, which much (most?) nontrivial code should pass.')
