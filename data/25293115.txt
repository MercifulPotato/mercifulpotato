I think that she was trying to say that ML systems have an inherent bias that is independent of their data.<p>This is a consequence of the fact that it&#x27;s not possible to do generalization, and thus learning, without bias to begin with. What an AI researcher does when deciding which architecture is essentially tuning the bias in the generalization system in order to produce better results, which is not in and of itself bad, and is indeed unavoidable.<p>By bias, I mean really anything that means that the function g() is used over the function h(). In practice this can be anything from the seed for the random values, to the choice of activation function, to the architecture of the network, and so on.<p>If the architectures are selected for their performance on dataset y, then it is possible that even when trained on dataset x, they retain some of the bias of dataset y, because their generalization bias, which is architectural, was tuned for dataset y. This is, admittedly, a theoretical result, and it&#x27;s not clear that it applies in every case, but it is a solid point.<p>For that reason the point that benchmarking against non-biased datasets is important was made, and thus that there is more to bias than the final dataset used for training during deployment. Therefore, it&#x27;s not only a responsibility of the engineering community, but also of the scientific community.<p>I&#x27;ve posted it somewhere here already, but here&#x27;s a nice paper that explains the point that there is more to bias than simply the dataset : <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~tom&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;NeedForBias_1980.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~tom&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;NeedForBias_1980.pdf</a><p>Interestingly enough, this is true of all learning systems, including humans, and is a proof of why it&#x27;s impossible to be completely unbiased in really anything.')
