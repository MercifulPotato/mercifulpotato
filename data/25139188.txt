The argument seems to be:<p>1. individuals are blasted with a firehose of data<p>2. individual-focused systems to manage this data--like GTD--are ineffective because the left hand (one person working autonomously) doesn&#x27;t know what the right hand (another person) is doing, so they end up just creating more data<p>3. therefore, we need some sort of collective--as opposed to an individual--system so we can get a better picture of the whole and distribute work more effectively, thereby increasing productivity.<p>Maybe a good idea. But the &quot;call to action&quot; there is clearly addressed to managers rather than actually producers. They&#x27;re the ones who&#x27;d control any collective system. And in my experience those always decay and get in the way...though of course that could just be me resenting limitations on personal autonomy.<p>I&#x27;ll have to think this over more. One thing I dislike about the article is several places they say things like &quot;Following the lead of software developers, we might use virtual task boards...&quot; where I think I&#x27;d be more appropriate to substitute &quot;engineering managers&quot; for &quot;software developers&quot;.')
