And as long they&#x27;re on a path that -- if kept -- would lead them to be on a professional level) I played classical guitar for a few years, but stopped because I just wanted to play popular music, and there were no teachers around who actually taught that who were accomplished enough to be considered worth the money by my parents (who had a very limited budget).')
