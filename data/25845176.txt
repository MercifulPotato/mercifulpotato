When you use 0-based indexing, you can&#x27;t count <i>down</i> with a simple loop: you need to either extend your index type to include an invalid -1 or apply the infamous evaluate-then-decrement semantic. In practice, this means people often index with a signed integer, which is absurd.<p>And lest you think that counting down is unnaturalâ€”there are quite a few advantages in comparing to <i>zero</i> on every iteration instead of a computed upper bound, like that you can often roll the condition check in with the decrement instead of having to do a separate comparison.')
