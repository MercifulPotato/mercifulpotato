I don&#x27;t think being clairvoyant is a quality that should be expected out of an engineer or anybody.<p>This whole time estimation thing is akin to predicting when the next hurricane or earthquake will occur. The main problem is business people don&#x27;t understand that so they place this unrealistic burden on engineers.<p>A manager or business guy who needs constant and very accurate time predictions is a sign of a bad manager that is overly reliant on engineers and lacks understanding of software. A good manager should have the technical knowledge to make a technical guesstimate himself (that will also likely be wrong) and have the foresight to be able to manage delays and allow for buffer time.<p>A great team of people creating a product consists of both great Technical product managers and great software engineers. A rockstar software Engineer alone may not have the ability to manage the politics of unrealistic expectations.')
