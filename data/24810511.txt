But you have to understand yourself and what you&#x27;re looking for. And that&#x27;s what I think the real moral of the story is: understand what you want, what makes you happy, and what gives you meaning and purpose. Then make sure you&#x27;re working towards that. Too many people forget to do the first thing and skip straight to the second because they inherit the answer from their environment without questioning it.<p>For lots of people the answer to that question is <i>not</i> career related.')
