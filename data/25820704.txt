Stop looking. Most American techies won&#x27;t give you the time of day...and those that will even bother to skim-yes, I said skim-through your ad won&#x27;t even bother to do the polite thing and respond even after taking the time to interact with it.<p>I am so sick and tired of the rude behavior that I&#x27;ve decided to build all my upcoming projects myself even if it looks janky and barely put together just to prove concept.

The &quot;tech is God&quot; and therefore we don&#x27;t have to behave like mere mortals crap has completely ruined the tech people in this country in my eyes.<p>Of course, other industries have similar problems, but for some reason it seems more magnified, probably because of all the VC cash floating around even crappy ideas&#x2F;teams.<p>Dan Martell&#x27;s Idea to Exit course-if you can find a live link-is built just for this type of &lt;prototype to project&gt; approach.')
