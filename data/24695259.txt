SSO is key because it allows easy controls and auditing, and SAML (against shibboleth, KeyCloak, or a third party IdP) is an ideal fit, especially if you want to require multifactor auth for company resources with hard yubikeys instead of mobile authenticator apps, while also avoiding delegating this sensitive business function to google.  Stick with SAML between your apps and everything is possible!<p>Even without needing SOC2, post COVID, it makes even more sense to bake SSO into your infrastructure because it&#x27;s a lot easier to administrate remote work.  All the more reason to consider SAML from the beginning.<p>That&#x27;s the promise of SAML.  So it&#x27;s disheartening that its design&#x2F;implementations may introduce more problems [1] than it fixes.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latacora.micro.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-soc-starting.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latacora.micro.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-soc-starting.html</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stackallocated.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;saml-idp-no-shared-keys&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stackallocated.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;saml-idp-no-shared-...</a>')
