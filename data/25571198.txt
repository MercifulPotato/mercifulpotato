I dont think its that rare for someone to climb out of poverty. Maybe I just see it this way because I did it myself (born in a 3rd world country, single mom, step father with bad addiction issues, barely graduated HS)<p>Now that Im a father myself, Im of course trying to give my child the best opportunities, but also trying to raise him to be grateful and disciplined.<p>So I&#x27;m not talking about the billionaires. Im talking about regular people who can now grant their children not private jets, but just a good private school.<p>What would be fair in this scenario? How can we make things equal&#x2F;just in this case?<p>Also I dont think its rare or hypothetical at all, that rich kids never learn to work hard and squander their good fortune.<p>-- EDIT, i completely agree its absurd and completely wrong that 1% of people have 50% of the wealth, that should not be that way.')
