If you didn’t want a close to RHEL experience, you’d likely go with Debian to get more packages and a truly open community.<p>One way of looking at that is to see CentOS as a gateway into the RHEL world, and especially a way for people to get experience with it or test open source software on it. I think that viewpoint just lost out to the other one seeing every CentOS install at a company as lost revenue. That’s not entirely unfounded but I suspect it will produce less revenue and cost them more in network effects than they anticipated. Any open source project, for example, has just been told that they need pay to test Red Hat compatibility.')
