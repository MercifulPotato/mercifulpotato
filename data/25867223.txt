It&#x27;s okay for the therapist to have a skin color, perceived sex, perceived age, manner of dressing, accent, etc. - as long as those things just <i>are</i>.  The therapist&#x27;s job is to stay neutral, to have no particular emotional attachment to any of these qualities.  That way, when there is a moment of strong emotion in the session, it&#x27;s almost certainly introduced by the client, and then can be explored by them.<p>There&#x27;s ironically a good example of this in the blog post:<p>&quot;For you, the day [I burned] your village was the most important day of your life. For me, it was Tuesday.&quot;<p>Therapists can have race, gender, and age in the same way that it can be Tuesday.  They just can&#x27;t have race in the sense of having their village burned.<p>(And FWIW, it&#x27;s very difficult to have an effective blog devoid of emotional content.  I tried once and got accused of being a Markov Chain.)')
