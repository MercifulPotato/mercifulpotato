You&#x27;re dodging the question: Why would a cofounder want to start a company with you? No handwaving.<p>People cofound to get rich. Can your company offer that to your cofounder?<p>If you focus on that question, the rest falls into place. Unfortunately a lot of people don&#x27;t want to focus on that question, because it&#x27;s at the heart of why bootstrapping rarely works.<p>&quot;Not needing adult supervision&quot; indicates that you probably haven&#x27;t done what you&#x27;re saying. It&#x27;s not a matter of supervision. It&#x27;s managing expectations. You are legally required to lay out what you offer, in clear terms, and what you expect in return. That&#x27;s the basis of a business arrangement.<p>So, we&#x27;re going into business together. How will your company make me rich?
