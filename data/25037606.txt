Out of the 10+ classes I&#x27;ve taken so far, I&#x27;m currently enrolled in the only one that has required a lockdown browser (I haven&#x27;t taken any tests yet, so I&#x27;m not sure what that will be like). Up until now, all the classes just had me sign something saying I didn&#x27;t cheat. Also, usually the test was designed in such a way as to make it more difficult to cheat. About half of the classes, the tests are open-note. They combat the effectiveness of cheating by making the time of the test short enough to where if you don&#x27;t know the information, you won&#x27;t b able to look up more than 25% of the questions before time runs out. I can see how that wouldn&#x27;t work for all classes, and admittedly I haven&#x27;t taken any Math or Science courses so it may be different in that arena, but it seems like they have decided to take a different route than the schools mentioned in the article, and presumably haven&#x27;t had any issues.')
