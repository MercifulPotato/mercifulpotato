Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606024936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142277, text='Imagine also your coworkers casually mention they&#x27;d gladly shoot any pinko commie liberal they&#x27;d encounter, good that there are no such people among us! And then discuss how liberals are filthy amoral idiots only worthy of being spit on. And you happen to be a liberal. And even though you know they&#x27;re probably joking, and they most certainly don&#x27;t mean you, would it influence your work relationship with those people a little? Would it make you more distracted and less motivated?<p>And what if they get their suspicions - say, you couldn&#x27;t bring yourself to praise Trump as much as others - and then your promotion, which one of your Trump-loving managers has a decisive voice on, does not come through, would you wonder why? Would it impact your work? I think it might.<p>And yet, I&#x27;ve heard things like these (not about Trump, it was even back when Trump was a TV personality) from many people. Did it impact my work quality? I really hope not, as much as I can help it. But I certainly didn&#x27;t enjoy it.')
