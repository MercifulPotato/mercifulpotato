It fixes itself. For instance, the average Ivy League graduate only makes marginally more money than your public school graduate.<p>By the time you’re making even low 6 figures, the idea of interacting with an Stanford grad who has done nothing of note with their education and makes something comparable to you is quaint.<p>Generally speaking, distribution of US income as a proxy for social standing gets you pretty far.<p>At the end of the day, being associated with prestige is cute (working for a big name) and perhaps what many people desire, but holding it yourself manifests itself in different ways at the individual level. Those who really have any modicum of power don’t care about baseless associations.<p>“Yeah you worked for a FAANG, great, but what have <i>you</i> accomplished?”')
