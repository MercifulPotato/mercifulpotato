They&#x27;re uninterested and in fact dismissive of real, actual evidence and facts as examined in multiple court cases - and they refuse to accept the validity of the outcomes of those cases.<p><i>They wish to overturn the legitimate outcome of the Presidential election.</i> Full stop.<p>They act exactly like those crypto-racists who know that their true belief would be deemed unpalatable or unacceptable by the community so they&#x27;ll blow as much smoke around as possible without ever stepping out to say what they&#x27;re actually driving towards.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything remotely equivalent to this happening on the other side of the fence <i>at this time</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this in the United States and enough is enough. It&#x27;s clearly dangerous to allow these views the shroud of legitimacy by giving them space in the public square, because it&#x27;s gone so far that anything other than a total rejection ends up functioning as an implicit legitimization because the claims are so untrue, shocking, and destructive.<p>By allowing the lie of election fraud to be presented as just another thing to be discussed on HN, HN is enabling those people and their cause, which is to overturn the results of a legitimate election.<p>And I think it&#x27;s unfortunate and wrong that I probably have a better chance of being banned from HN for this comment, than someone who is obviously attempting to undermine people&#x27;s belief in the legitimacy of the 2020 Presidential election, which is to say, undermine small-d democracy in the U.S. and advocate for an authoritarian, one-party state.<p>Which is literally what they&#x27;re doing. And no, the Democrats or anyone else on the Left are not doing anything <i>remotely</i> equivalent to that right now.')
