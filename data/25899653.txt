There&#x27;s a sort of obvious blame, if you screw up, on them: &quot;you&#x27;re a moron you took an ex-convict and surprise he misbehaved, you&#x27;re fired, idiot&quot;.<p>The only thing to do is to have a contingency plan. If I go to jail for a period of time I think of what I&#x27;d do: preserve whatever savings I have, make sure my wife is at peace with it and will stay or not take everything I have, that I&#x27;m fine working in construction or bag groceries, and that I can live with nothing but books, some water, pasta and a small place because that&#x27;s most likely the only way the future will look if I make such a mistake.<p>If you&#x27;re at peace with it and understand life can turn that way, you&#x27;re not even scared of jail anymore. I&#x27;ll live through it and stay satisfied with whatever I find.')
