Plain and simple.<p>You’re at work to work. So get to it. Stop being children and coming home at the end of the day talking about how unfair it is that your Algebra teacher barely works but expects you to do 2 hours of homework.<p>Amazon employees protesting their own warehouse working conditions? Fine. That’s your option in America to try to get better working conditions. But complaining that AWS is bidding on military contracts? Grow up.<p>If I was CEO of any of these companies, I’d make it simple. You can either (a) quit, or submit a form checking off categories of business you have snowflake issues with and we will happily deduct an equal percentage of those categories of our profits from your paycheck by an equal percentage.<p>But anyone who goes public to complain about our categories of business? Fired for cause.<p>These lepers are easily replaceable, Spotify. Do with them what Reagan did to the air traffic controllers.')
