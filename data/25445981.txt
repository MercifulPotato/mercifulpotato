I&#x27;m have a basic idea of the modularity&#x2F;plugins and extendable plugins to add more functionality to the PostGraphile app.<p>But where&#x2F;how exactly do I write the core&#x2F;business logic of the micro service?<p>For example, I currently have a NodeJs REST based service that:<p>- Has an API that fetches data from database, sends it to another micro-service for processing waits for the result and stores the returned result back in the DB.<p>- Has an API that fetches and aggregates data from multiple micro-services and returns to the client, without doing any database reads.<p>- Has an API which fetches something from ElasticSearch and DynamoDB, processes it and returns a response.<p>So my question is, How do I do something similar with PostGraphile?<p>It just feels like I&#x27;m missing a piece of the puzzle.')
