But then, people expect more, even if I explicitly say I am not for that (e.g. discontinued projects, expecting free consulting, and getting offended for even a suggestion of paid options).<p>For example, I used to run the biggest Data Science group in Poland. It was a lot of effort to grow it from nothing to 14k participants. Yet, after explicitly saying that I don&#x27;t answer questions about moderation (and even worse: messages pushing me to review a post right now), it keeps happening. If I don&#x27;t (and I try to keep my boundaries), people get offended.<p>I think there should be a message (regardless of the context): if someone is volunteering, DON&#x27;T EVER push them to do more than they committed to. Pushing for more is as reasonable (and kind, respectful, etc.) as telling a stranger to go and clean your dishes. For free. Right now.')
