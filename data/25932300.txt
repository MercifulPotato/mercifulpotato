They don&#x27;t load and unload media when its no longer in the viewport either from scrolling or opening a thread, and the redesign infinitely scrolls.<p>Plus thread view is a modal over the feed unless you navigate directly to its URL, so often times you&#x27;ll have media loading and running in the thread view while other media may still be playing back in the feed.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the only source of the insane memory leak in Safari in particular (you will get into the GBs if you leave a media-heavy feed open past 10 minutes or so), but its gotta be a big contributor.')
