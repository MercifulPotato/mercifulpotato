No need to carry large payloads, reaction mass, or energy... those are at the endpoint where you find them (and convert them into grey-goo?).<p>It&#x27;s more of a viral mode of expansion where (virus) seeds carry the operational commands to new worlds (cells) which host them until they are consumed by the continued expansion. The intelligence and power consumption are concentrated where it&#x27;s available, while passive catalytic action and stored knowledge is transported at speed.')
