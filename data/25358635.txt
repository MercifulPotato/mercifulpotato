I think I read about 10 books this year, but some of those were references or cookbooks which don&#x27;t really count. I can&#x27;t say that any of them changed my life. They were all interesting, and some were helpful.<p>Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushroom by Stamets - great for anyone who wants to culture and grow a variety of mushrooms.<p>The Fungal Pharmacy by Rogers - This book is less useful but fascinating. It has a bunch of traditional uses of mushrooms, but also has references to modern papers on fungal use in medicines. It also lists common industrial uses as well (like the production citric acid).<p>A very Short Introduction: Fungi by Money - this is a very short book that covers many aspects of fungi.<p>Ham Radio Jargon and Q-codes by KC2TAV - this is more of a reference than a true book. It&#x27;s ok, but the internet is probably a better resource.<p>The Organic Gardener&#x27;s Handbook by Ellis and Martin - I read most of this, but got it mostly as a reference to identify and manage pests and diseases in the garden. This finally motivated me to build a compost barrel.<p>A couple of mushroom cookbooks.<p>We Get Confessions by Joseph - this one is good to understand how interrogations are correctly conducted, what your rights are in that situation, and what tricks are used by police. It&#x27;s written with law enforcement as the target audience.<p>The Tactical Edge by Remsburg - this is geared toward law enforcement too. This can be valuable to understand police thinking and tactics. Some of the material can be helpful in self-defense or other high stress scenarios (first few chapters on body response, visualization, force continuum, etc).<p>Defensive Tactics by Christensen - still in progress with this one. I&#x27;m not sure how I like it so far - some of the stuff seems useful but some also seems impractical. I plan to read the main parts of the book. Then there are the individual parts for specific holds&#x2F;strikes&#x2F;etc. I&#x27;ll probably skim these and select the 3 I think would be most useful to self defense for me. There&#x27;s too many in the book to learn all at once, or even maintain true proficiency in unless you spend <i>a lot</i> of time practicing.')
