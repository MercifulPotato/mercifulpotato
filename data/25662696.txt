Especially not over a long period of time.<p>Also worth noting that saying people &quot;do it to themselves&quot; only applies to adults: the adults who are &quot;doing it to themselves&quot; are, in fact, doing exactly what I described above to their children: providing an &quot;official sanction&quot; to only the propaganda that agrees with <i>their</i> biases, thus ensuring that their children grow up molded in the same way, with no easy way to make an informed choice for themselves.')
