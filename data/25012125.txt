There was a hilarious teardown and BOM estimation[0]. Should have been way cheaper<p>- The IoT aspect served no real purpose. It added to the BOM.<p>But I could totally see a subscription model with an inexpensive juicer that&#x27;s subsidized by a subscription to juice packs. Sure you could also buy some generic ones and someone will come up with a re-usable pouch, but really you are paying for the convenience. Nespresso did it (but coffee has way better margins than juice pouches).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ</a>')
