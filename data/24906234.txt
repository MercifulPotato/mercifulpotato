Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603796887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901401, text='No, the majority of migrants subject to removal have <i>not</i> entered the country illegally.<p>Most enter legally, and then something happens which changes that.<p>For some it&#x27;s government maladministration.  Outside their control.  This happens a lot.  I think that&#x27;s inhumane because it&#x27;s outside their control and they don&#x27;t have the money or legal backing to fight it, and because the system does not apply ordinary principles of justice to resolve these issues.<p>For some, it&#x27;s abuse by government.  That is, something just plain illegal by the government, <i>not a mistake</i> but an intentional administrative action which is against the law.  Again, I think that&#x27;s inhumane because most people don&#x27;t have the money or legal backing to fight.<p>For some it&#x27;s that their partner&#x27;s wage drops below a threshold.  Outside their control.  I think that&#x27;s inhumane because once you are in and settled and started a family etc. you should not be so precarious that a slight change in your partner&#x27;s income results in you having to leave.<p><i>Think of the number of people during the pandemic whose income has reduced.  Now imagine the added stress of facing deportation on a plane because your partner&#x27;s income dropped.</i><p>For some it&#x27;s losing their job.  Outside their control.  I think that&#x27;s inhumane because it&#x27;s a breeding ground for abuse by their employer: &quot;if you don&#x27;t do whatever we tell you and suck it up, we will fire you and you will have to leave your family and the country&quot;.<p>For some it&#x27;s their partner dumping them.  Outside their control.  I think that&#x27;s inhumane because it&#x27;s a breeding ground for abuse by their partner: &quot;if you don&#x27;t do whatever nasty things I demand you do for me I will dump you and you will have to leave your job and the country&quot;.<p>For some they never entered - they were <i>born</i> in the country.  They are legal until age 18, at which point they lose rights.<p>I think it&#x27;s inhumane to remove someone who is born and bred in a country, and who doesn&#x27;t even know something will happen until at the age of 18 or so, they apply to university, and find out not only can they not go, they get a letter telling them to leave the only place they have ever known.  Go &quot;home&quot;... where?  There isn&#x27;t another &quot;home&quot;.')
