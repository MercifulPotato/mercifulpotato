But the intent of making Google pay is absolutely reasonable.<p>This ploy of &quot;Don&#x27;t make us pull out.  The people will suffer the lack of our wonderful websites attempting to commandeer every moment of their attention&quot; is not very convincing.  We see that same from Facebook.  &quot;The people want us.&quot;<p>Look at what happened when these websites went missing in China.  Did the Chinese have any trouble providing alternatives.<p>Question: What is stopping anyone from trying to &quot;compete with&quot; (no, that&#x27;s unthinkable, so let&#x27;s call it &quot;offer alternatives to&quot;) Google.<p>Besides Google&#x27;s alleged anticompetitive conduct.<p>Answer: A reason.<p>One of personal favorite talks is from many years ago when Van Jacobsen spoke about content-centric networking (that talk was at Google, go figure).<p>In the talk he described a phenomenon he observed on the internet called &quot;evolutionary pressure&quot; as the basis for some of the most innovative protocols and solutions we have today.<p>Hypothetically, imagine Google pulls out.  Not going to happen, but for the sake of discussion.<p>That would create immense evolutionary pressure in Australia to find solutions.  There are enough highly competent programmers there I would be very confidant the results would be extraordinary.<p>All people need is a reason.  That&#x27;s why neither Google nor Facebook can charge user fees.  It would give people a reason to look elsewhere and a reason for not hired by Google&#x2F;Facebook programmers worldwide to answer the call.<p>Google just negotiated a deal with France where they will be paying.   There are more countries who want to protect their media institutions that cannot withstand the ongoing drain on revenue they are experiencing thanks to Google and Facebook.<p>Google has gotten very greedy and very arrogant.  Google News is a series of cloaked redirects to get to any article.  &quot;Do not scrape the middleman.  We are gathering data at every click as you try to reach this content. Only the middleman can scrape media websites with impunity.&quot;<p>It stands to reason they should be paying for that privilege.  They have no more right to scrape this content than you or I.<p>Like it or not, the truth is that Google at the core is just another bot.  A very privileged one.  Without Googlebot given license by every website, including those belonging to the news media, to do whatever it wants, the empire could not be sustained.<p>No one like the media, but the destruction of these institutions in favour of a data collection only middleman is not going to bode well for our future, assuming we want to preserve a functioning democracy.<p>Google wants to play &quot;internet traffic controller&quot;.  &quot;We can kill your traffic with the flick of switch.&quot;  That&#x27;s good for Google and whoever rides on their coattails but there is really no reasonable argument that is good in an objective sense.<p>I would like to start a website to search portal for news on all the media sites that Google drops, e.g., the ones in the EU.  An alternative way to find articles on these sites.  Wonder if Google would bury such a site in its results.')
