Even if teachers were rewarding other skills (eg: good behaviour), the teachers are setting the bar.<p>It&#x27;s not like grades are that relevant to someone&#x27;s life anyway.\nTo be honest, the only thing I want for my kids out of school is socialisation with kids their age and being exposed to basic scientific knowledge.\nMost of the stuff I learned in school went out of my brain the second I didn&#x27;t need it, anyway. What I retained is only what I still need or found interesting, and I probably remember it only because I did some personal study on it, because I liked the subject matter.<p>Instead of finding a gender appropriate way or fair way of grading kids, I think we should get rid of grading and the school system entirely.\nIt can be replaced entirely with project based learning. You can still have some form of curriculum, a selection of different projects that require different skills.\nIf you want to prove to a company you know classical mechanics physics, point them out to your &quot;rocket project&quot; in which you proved your knowledge of physics. Algebra? I developed a 2d game.<p>You may have a few teachers around to help but no frontal lessons. Everyone work on their projects and is surrounded by their peers and a few teachers you can turn to in case you need help.')
