Kids as young as 6 just absolutely clueless and learning nothing.<p>If you want your kid to program, just buy them an actual computer system with files and a terminal, not some ipad shit, and let them at it. If they code they code. If they don&#x27;t, you can try teaching them when they&#x27;re like 13-14 and actually have a bit of brain wattage to back up what you&#x27;re throwing at them.')
