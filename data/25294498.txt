An employer that engages in the practices alleged in the lawsuit against Facebook can expect more temporary visa holders to apply for positions and increased retention post-hire. Such temporary visa holders often have limited job mobility and thus are likely to remain with their company until they can adjust status, which for some can be decades.<p>I guess it&#x27;s good that the Justice Department is openly acknowledging that this is a problem. Maybe we&#x27;ll see if actually get addressed at some point now.<p>That being said it feels like a slightly out-of-place comment when much of this allegation is about hiring for jobs as part of the PERM process. If Facebook is purposely going through the PERM process with these employees, it is <i>actively working to remove those un-equal terms</i>. After the PERM process, the employee is free to leave and not remain with the company until they can adjust status.<p>Yes, the PERM advertising rules are stupid and outdated, but I don&#x27;t see any evidence here that Facebook didn&#x27;t follow them.<p>If the Justice Department wants to go after true abuse of the H1-B program, there are significantly-more-legitimate targets (Tata, Infosys, etc).<p>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that this has made me <i>defend Facebook</i>.')
