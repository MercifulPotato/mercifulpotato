Then they moved to console games in the early 90s.. and also computer games. It&#x27;s been what 50&#x2F;60 years of TV and 30+ years of consoles&#x2F;computer games.<p>If anything, things in the last ~10 years are <i>better</i> because kids have a good option to not just sit in front of the TV and watch whatever is on and all these ads.. they can be into games that are mentally challenging.  And they have all these options to have voice chats with friends, so it&#x27;s way more social than ever.<p>So just in general the argument is &quot;this can&#x27;t be healthy in the long term&quot; seems to imply that it&#x27;s some new phenomenon..')
