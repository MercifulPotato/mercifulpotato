People have been making their own liquid metal TIM at home. Playing with the ratio of the metals leads to different results in temperature and ease of application. Pretty cool.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Galinstan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Galinstan</a><p>Worth noting that it reacts chemically with other metals, including copper.
