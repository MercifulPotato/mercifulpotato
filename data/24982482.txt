In the enterprise software world the only options for a vendor&#x27;s library&#x2F;SDK are often .NET or JVM (and asking them &quot;Do you have a Python or Go library&quot; will probably elicit a response of &quot;What in tarnation do snakes and board games have to do with programming?&quot;).<p>As for whether it&#x27;s CLR or JVM, the question&#x27;s usually answerable with:<p><pre><code>    if vendor.preferred_os == &#x27;Windows&#x27;:\n        &#x27;CLR&#x27;\n    else:\n        &#x27;JVM&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nAnd since Windows is still pretty commonplace in a lot of smaller enterprise software shops, CLR ends up being the norm for a lot of the COTS products out there.')
