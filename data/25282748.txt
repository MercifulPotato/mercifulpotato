When tailing someone required a substantial investment of an actual person&#x27;s time and a wiretap literally required physical handling of the physical lines to that person&#x27;s phone, it makes&#x2F;made sense to give the police wide leverage in who they put under a lens because it required a substantial investment of time from the police in a way that was intrinsically limited and unable to scale to the population level.<p>Enter today, when nearly everyone can be and is surveiled with detail cops of previous generation could only dream of, and we&#x27;re still dealing with those same laws, but we removed the unwritten premises that they&#x27;re based on: surveillance couldn&#x27;t scale.')
