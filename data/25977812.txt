There&#x27;s a number of natural and synthetic substitutes that can accomplish the same goals (avoiding nudity when it would be considered immoral, staying warm in cold climates, etc)<p>What&#x27;s the difference? Is fur just worse because it serves as a status symbol in addition to the practical purposes?<p>Maybe not relevant for mink vs cow farming, but in some situations I think killing animals for their fur is morally and environmentally superior to raising and killing animals for their meat. Louisiana nutria bounty program is a net positive for the native ecology, which I don&#x27;t think could be said for <i>most</i> meat products.')
