Marco Rubio said Friday. ... Hackers were “in a position” to change voter roll data but apparently did not, Mr. Rubio told The New York Times.<p>If we can take Mr. Rubio&#x27;s word for it, the Russian hackers went to all that trouble and then decided not to act to change the result of the election, but perhaps they found that the voter rolls had already been subject to so much partisan tampering that any more manipulation would risk backfiring.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;apr&#x2F;27&#x2F;marco-rubio-hackers-were-in-a-position-to-change-v&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;apr&#x2F;27&#x2F;marco-rubio...</a>')
