Spend the night? Just stay there on the curb side hoping for a chance that someone will need a ride back? How is that &quot;making money&quot;?<p>&gt; or set your direction home and pick up rides in that direction<p>Drivers already do that. Additionally,<p>- A driver who lives west of town will not pick a ride to the east of town on the off chance that there will be a ride back if only he stays there long enough.<p>- A driver only needs to go home at the end of their shift. So why would he pick rides in the direction of his home at any other time? Hoping for a chance to pick a ride on the way back?<p>&gt; Drivers who say they don&#x27;t get paid coming back are ignorant.<p>As I&#x27;ve just demonstrated, it&#x27;s not the drivers who are ignorant.')
