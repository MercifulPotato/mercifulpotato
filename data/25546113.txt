This &quot;life management system&quot; space has tons of potential. It needs a unique combination of great data model, consistent syncing and flawless (responsive and attractive) user experience. I think in 5 years you&#x27;ll see the next unicorn here.<p>I&#x27;ve used a few variants for &quot;personal CRM &#x2F; personal tracking&quot;<p><pre><code>  (a) &quot;Unix&quot; approach: csv files &amp; encrypted text files (e.g. credentials) with gpg. Searching using grep.  Edit with Vim.  \n  PROS:  compatibility, CLI tools.  cons: gets out of sync across devices, poor experience on mobile. \n  (b) tiddlywiki:  pros: works on desktops, good search, cons: poor sync to mobile, poor ux on mobile. \n  (c) &quot;Google Ecosystem&quot; e.g. Keep (notes), Contacts, Keep (todos), Calendar – Pros: syncs everywhere, cons: apps are slow and limited; also lock in\n  (d) &quot;Apple Ecosystem&quot; – Notes, Contacts, Calendar, Keychain – Pros: good sync, responsive apps, Cons: lock-in.\n</code></pre>\nA few &quot;killer features&quot; that I&#x27;ve been working on:<p><pre><code>  (1) A dynamic &quot;daily dashboard&quot; that is a mix of metric graph along with easily manipulated spaces (like sticky notes, diagrams etc).  Currently I use Quip for this. \n  (2) Cyclical relationship reminders (like fitbit exercise reminders, but for your relationships). e.g. &quot;jenny&#x27;s birthday is in 3 days&quot; or &quot;you haven&#x27;t called your uncle in 3 weeks, schedule a call&quot;.    A ring-based interface would be idea, with colors representing the health of that cycle.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve thought on this a lot.  Some key pillars<p><pre><code>  (1) trust  – the most privileged data deserves the highest level of protection\n  (1b) dynamic – users can manipulate and personalize as they would their home desktop &amp; office space\n  (2) responsiveness – adding a contact or note should take &lt; 100ms . Zero latency – as fast as a pen and paper\n  (3) cross-device consistency : a change should instantly sync across devices\n  (4) comprehensive search\n  (5) polished UX\n  (6) mind-map : notes, contacts, events, reminders, photos should all link into each other.</code></pre>')
