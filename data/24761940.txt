You have all of these helper infrastructure functions that you implement for every single project you work on, and reusing that glue code is so, so much easier in Lambda&#x2F;GCF&#x2F;AF&#x2F;etc.<p>That sounds great until you need to add a feature or fix a bug in the reused code. Then you deploy a change to a Lambda function that impacts X other projects immediately, with no chance to test each of them individually.')
