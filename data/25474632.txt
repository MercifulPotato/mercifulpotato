If that&#x27;s followed with both &quot;sham&quot; surgeries and real surgeries, then it points to the possibility that the strong antibiotics are more important in some cases than the procedure.<p>There may be other medically significant details of sham surgeries that we overlook as not therapeutic. Many diagnostic exams involve not eating for x hours beforehand. Surgeries also can involve restrictions on diet during recovery or exposure to drugs like anesthesia that are given without intent to be therapeutic per se.<p>You can&#x27;t really rule out the possibility that those types of things are therapeutically significant but overlooked because they are done to be curative.')
