Background compiles, entirely too many Chromium (or Electron) threads, all my other random running applications--the thing is significantly snappier even than the 2600X I replaced it with, and it&#x27;s gotten to the point where using a laptop shy of a desktop replacement is pretty aggravating.<p>(I&#x27;m not interested in going back to MacOS so I&#x27;m not really looking at the M1 as anything other than intellectually interesting at the moment, but if I were it certainly at least seems like it might compete there.)')
