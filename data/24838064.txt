They&#x27;ll offer hacks or &quot;mind games&quot; to trick yourself into moving past the fear, as PG talks about here:<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself to avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts.&quot;<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see anyone over there talking about conquering fear permanently, such that these issues fall away and what is left is boundless creativity.<p>One tool offered here is to &quot;switch polarity&quot;, which means to take the other side of the argument. Fine, but real wisdom comes from transcending polarity.<p>Another tool offered is to tap into the motivation of curiosity. That&#x27;s great as &quot;early work&quot; on the inner game, but there are much more robust ways to conquer fear when one looks at cutting edge work on consciousness evolution, such as Integral Dynamics, or studies Eastern traditions like Vajrayana or Zen.<p>I look forward to the day where YC elevates this discussion toward awakening themselves and their network to more transcendental tools.')
