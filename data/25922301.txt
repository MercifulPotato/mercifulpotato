I&#x27;m also talking mental health and security (food and shelter), both of which have been badly affected by the lockdowns and lost jobs from the lockdowns.<p>&gt; obviously something went terribly wrong in the United States overall<p>There&#x27;s (at least) two things going on here, neither of which has to do with the response:<p>* The US is big.  Half the country has a different climate than the other half, and all evidence is that SARS-CoV-2 is heavily seasonal.  What you&#x27;re seeing in the country graph is as it recedes in one set of states, it grows in another set.  Check out the curves for southern states like Florida, Mississipi, or Arizona - their first wave doesn&#x27;t start until the summer, after first wave in the northern states like Illinois have already ended.  Add them together and you get the consistently high rates for the whole country.<p>* Too-high-cycle PCR positives without symptoms being counted as a &quot;case&quot;.  The WHO just changed their recommendations last week because PCR testing has been being misused (as people have complained about since at least last summer) to take into account the false positives <i>and</i> symptoms; if these new recommendations are actually followed, expect the case rate to plummet pretty rapidly (though perhaps not sharply as different states may adopt it at different times).')
