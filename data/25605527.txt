I think we&#x27;ve also heard time and time again that HR is not out to protect you but rather the company. I understand that this is this person&#x27;s first job but they should have understood that this is not normal behavior. You should always put your (mental) health first and seek other forms of employment, even if you are on a visa, if this type of abuse is occurring.')
