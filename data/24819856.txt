In an NJ town right across Manhattan, I know a town council man could make $150K&#x2F;year. He has been on the council for like only a few years (like 2-3 years top), but before then he was running all kinds of political stuff in the city (once an assistant of the then mayor, for example). I can&#x27;t help but imagine corruption when I saw how much he earns and how much property tax we have to pay in this town.<p>P.S. I got to learn his income because I am on the board of a co-op where he tried to buy an apartment (his secondary dwelling) at and we run his background check and income&#x2F;finance capability.')
