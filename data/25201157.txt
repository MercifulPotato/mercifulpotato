Item(by='littlestymaar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606241468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200550, text='&gt; Even Muslim-majority countries are having a difficult time reconciling themselves with the rise of Islamic separatism.<p>You got it backward. Unless you live in a country with a majority of Muslims, radical Islamism is not going to be an issue except for the Muslims themselves. They are never going to be politically powerful enough to enforce any kind of Islamic inspired law on the whole population, so their power of nuisance is limited to the Muslim community (especially young liberals in this community, women, gays, etc.) but as long as the society as a whole provides an escape from those Islamic circles, most Muslims will be fine. The ultra-orthodox Jewish community and traditionalist Catholics are other instances of Radical religious subcommunity in a liberal country, doing not much harm outside of their own small groups (where they do, like Radical Muslims).<p>The big issue in France, is that many (most?) Muslims live in ghetto-ized suburbs and have lots of difficulties to join the rest of the French society. This makes the nuisance power of the Islamic groups much bigger than it should be. And the state bears a lot of responsibility is this : both passively, by not taking strong stance on discrimination (for employment, studies, and housing), but also actively, by setting-up its own kinds of discrimination in an attempt to appeal far-right electors.')
