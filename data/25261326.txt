You did everything by mail. There was no proof that you did the work yourself; it was just a matter of trust. I took a required writing course that way because it never worked out to schedule it as a regular class. I think for some of the classes that had exams you maybe went to a local exam center where a proctor would check your ID and you&#x27;d take the exam. I don&#x27;t know what they did if there wasn&#x27;t an exam center conveniently nearby.')
