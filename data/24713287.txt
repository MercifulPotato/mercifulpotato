The Laffer curve is an illustration of that idea. Push vehicle taxes to absurd levels (85-150% in Denmark) and you&#x27;ll have half the population cycling to work. Some such effects might be desirable and socially&#x2F;politically worth the loss of revenue, others - like a switch from industrially produced alcohol to moonshine, and resulting deaths - not so much.<p>Looking from Europe, the American obsession with low taxes over healthcare and general welfare seems short-sighted, but the expectation that you can infinitely raise taxes without ill side-effects isn&#x27;t much brighter.')
