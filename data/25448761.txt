We had a novel approach to do this.<p>Problem is COVID-19 hit so getting other people to try it became impossible and most target users do not have their own headset. We used video&#x27;s to showcase but its obviously not the same.<p>Project on ice (for now) but we felt there was definitely something there. What we developed was not the final killer product but it got people talking a lot.<p>Its (VR&#x2F;AR) time will come, that&#x27;s for sure, but we need more 6DFs, lighter, capable standalone headsets.')
