He&#x27;s never stopped himself from using the term earlier. So why isn&#x27;t he now (or actually any time it&#x27;s an extreme right&#x2F;white nationalist terrorist)? This was clearly terrorism.<p>&gt; Take another angle. When Trump said, &quot;There will be a peaceful transition to a new administration&quot;, some of his supporters imagined that this meant that he isn&#x27;t leaving the Whitehouse.<p>Funny example, seeing as that came <i>after</i> the capitol riots, and not say... when he lost the election. Which entirely proves my point.')
