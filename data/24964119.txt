I lived in NYC at the time, and I rode most weekends and took annual trips to Florida, and rode it all the way to the Pacific once.<p>I sold it when I moved to an island in Alaska with few roads, but if I had stayed in the lower 48 I would have moved up to a 900 or 1000. I was very happy to learn on a 600, but eventually I kept wishing for more power at lower rpms.')
