I am seriously drawing a blank.<p>But there&#x27;s another hypocrisy to go around as well.  The left used to talk about &quot;the best way to combat speech is with more speech&quot; and that monopolies were evil and that Big Oil had too much power and that the Patriot Act was undue surveillance.<p>We now have a Democratic party deeply committed to restricting speech in the public arena, whether that&#x27;s academia, social media, or cancel culture in general.  They are backing tech companies which are the closest things to monopolies and 10X bigger than Exxon Mobil ever was.  They&#x27;re advocating for new measures on domestic surveillance for terrorism.<p>Oh yeah, and Net Neutrality was overturned and the ISPs didn&#x27;t ban things.  It was the people who argued <i>for</i> Net Neutrality (Google, Twitter, Facebook) that are committing all the horror stories that were supposed to happen with deregulation.')
