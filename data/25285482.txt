In my country I&#x27;ve seen Chinese panels for €80&#x2F;ea and locally manufactured for €140&#x2F;ea (for a ~300w panel).<p>Most people prefer the European panels because the overall price isn&#x27;t that much different, and they know if they ever need to make a warranty claim it&#x27;ll be a lot easier from a European manufacturer.<p>These are retail prices for home installation - of course for utility scale it&#x27;s a different story.')
