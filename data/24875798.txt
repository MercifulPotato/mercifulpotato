That leaves me wondering if maybe we should plan (and commit) to build nuclear up to, say, 50% of our energy need and then start to reduce that when we actually build wind&#x2F;solar&#x2F;hydro to replace it. Xor commit to building those renewables instead (concretely: X MWh using renewable technology Y in location Z). Or, heck, use coal and carbon capture (real stuff, not tree planting, preventing emissions elsewhere, or other cheap magic that doesn&#x27;t actually take the CO2 back out of the air) in case that&#x27;s the way people want to go. I don&#x27;t care, just get started already.<p>It&#x27;s not my choice, I already vote for parties that want to take more action, my energy provider is one that actively builds out renewables, and I don&#x27;t own an amount of land where even a single solar panel would fit. We can&#x27;t do this on an individual level so I guess governments will have to decide what goes where. It&#x27;s up to them, but we can&#x27;t choose it do neither solution.')
