The process is outlined here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archives.gov&#x2F;electoral-college&#x2F;roles#meeting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archives.gov&#x2F;electoral-college&#x2F;roles#meeting</a><p>EDIT - it should be made clear that this is when the electors <i>vote</i>.  Each individual state must finish their counting before that so they know which electors are voting on December 8. Each state is free to decide when they stop counting - and they each have their own laws regarding that.  The Federal government has no say - the US constitution <i>prohibits</i> the Federal government from getting involved.')
