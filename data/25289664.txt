This gave me a good starting point to understanding how to plan B2B products and companies. I sorta knew some high-level differences in go-to-market strategy for B2B vs B2C, but this article explains the concepts well.<p>&gt; In the early days of Github, the strong market demand for enterprise features initially clashed with a developer-first product and engineering organization, leading to lost deals. When a large financial institution requested direct customer support and access controls on the ability to push code, Github initially resisted, due to the fear that sales-driven enterprise product changes would erode the strong developer culture that was at the core of the platformâ€™s viral growth in the first place. They lost the deal.<p>&gt; When Paul St. John convinced the company to make the requisite product access adaptations and enable sales and support teams to speak directly with customers, GitHub won its first enterprise deal and never looked back.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;the early days of Github&quot; did anything wrong though. They knew what was important to their user base of individual developers and were focusing on their B2C product.<p>Not every B2C offering needs a B2B counterpart. The necessity is discovered through small experiments and talking to users.<p>Losing a deal should not mean the end of the world for a startup. It&#x27;s a necessary part of the process of discovering valuable problems that are common but are underserved.')
