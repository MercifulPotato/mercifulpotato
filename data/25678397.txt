My team has written a medium size web app ( ~30 pages) without JSX and the API works pretty well. You get used to it if the whole project uses it (just like any API).<p>&gt; create-react-app<p>I disagree. It is clearly intended as a quick start, people can customize or opt out in one command (and remove whatever they want).<p>It is very functional and engineers get a production ready layout and build system in &lt; 1 minute.<p>It doesn&#x27;t force you to use it, use it if you want.<p>--<p>Finally your example doesn&#x27;t look much better or clearer than using the React API directly..')
