I&#x27;ve been tiling-only (save for a couple of secondary things) for over a decade and it&#x27;s by far the most productive to me. Always having 100% screen used,  no windows overlapping (apart from things like file dialogs, alerts and my &quot;quake console&quot;), and never having to touch the mouse for navigating&#x2F;repositioning is great.<p>It works great both on a single laptop, and with 3 external monitors (of which one generally has a single workspace hardcoded). I fully utilize all 9&#x2F;10 workspaces most days.<p>The only time it doesn&#x27;t fit great is with e.g. GIMP that has several small windows for toolboxes and stuff - one can still target particular windows to be floating (either keybind at runtime or with static config targeting window names&#x2F;classes&#x2F;whatnot).<p>There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m switching away from Xmonad for my main workstation - but you do you!')
