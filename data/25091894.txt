I think using a provider you trust more (In my case Fastmail vs. Google) is a fair tradeoff. Fastmail has a pretty straight forward business model that makes sense to me so I feel like they don&#x27;t have a reason to scan my emails for ad purposes or else.<p>Of course if you are worried about some nation state looking into your emails you should encrypt them and use whatever provider.')
