The common criticism you’ll see in these Apple threads is that people don’t care to configure their device&#x2F;software as required in Linux. Or desktop OS is rough around the edges.<p>However anyone wanting to avoid these issues is now required to configure their Apple device. Anyone want to shift to Apple silicon will also experience a rough around the edges situation. In the previous days, Apple documentation for building on their no-config required platform is rough all around, not just the edges.<p>People are allowed to have criticisms and be hypocritical but it’s sometimes astounding how much Apple gets away with their choices because of marketing.')
