It worked well in regard to &quot;just working&quot; with Svelte (as opposed to shoe-horning Svelte components into something like Storybook, which we also tested),  but even so, Sapper still added more complexity that was needed in our specific case.<p>Before Svelte Summit, I had a &#x27;look into Svelte + Snowpack&#x27; on my list of, &quot;when we have some time TODOs&#x27; list.<p>From the looks of it, SvelteKit will dominate on the dev experience and also thin down some of the things we were doing with Sapper. I look forward to rolling our existing stuff to it.')
