It didn&#x27;t get nowhere near as bad as this article describes, although I did look at surgery, considered pain killers and had injections.  After research I decided the surgery and pain killers were probably worse than the disease.<p>Things came to head when I was on holidays, in a hotel lying on a double bed getting some rest.  The double was two singles pushed together.  They moved apart, and my body fell between them but my arms unable to move remained on the  beds, forcing my frozen shoulders to do things they didn&#x27;t want to do.  My wife saw the end result written on my face, and decided something had to be done.  She traipsed between doctors, one of whom said I should see a physio.<p>After a couple of visits the physio said the pain was caused by muscles pulling the wrong way.  The initial injury (a sprain caused by my throwing a barrel onto a truck) had triggered an avoidance mechanism, where my mind had learnt all sorts of tricks to avoid triggering the pain.  The result was atrophied muscles in some places, overworked ones in others.  He gave me a few elastic bands, toys really, and exercises using them.<p>The exercises weren&#x27;t particularly onerous - nothing as tiresome as a 5k jog for instance.  Just 10 or 15 minutes each morning.  To say I was dubious was an understatement, but I was paying for it and the discipline I force on myself to is either stop paying or do as the man says.<p>It took 6 months.  But it was gone.  Now it is as if it was never there.  I&#x27;ve never looked at a physio in the same way again.')
