Look at the assembly I posted above comparing mips64le to mips64be.<p>The code takes the byte at b[n] and shifts it (8.n)-bits. These are the same bytes on both little endian and big endian machines. They read the bytes in the same order (little endian), and convert them to the native order.<p>You can also see <i>very clearly</i> that it doesn&#x27;t always swap by looking at the simple x86_64 assembly output that the was posted where <i>no shifts or swaps are performed.</i> Just a mov instruction.<p>Read the assembly. Or better yet, try the code out for yourself.')
