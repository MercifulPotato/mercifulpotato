One of these solutions is to deliver parcels at a shop instead of a home address which will result in less driving.\nBut here comes a challenge: with over 1.000 shops we already use I need to find a way to sort parcels to 1.000 destinations, even 1.500 or 2.000 in the future.\nBeside sorting out to 1.000+ destinations, we are talking about roughly 100.000 parcel per day (future growth included). Luckily, the solution I&#x27;m looking for is only needed for &quot;smalls&quot;, parcels up to 400x400x400mm max\nAny idea how to solve this?')
