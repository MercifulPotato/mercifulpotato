Plus I need my files on my drive 100% of the time and routinely work without reliable network access.<p>I get kind of why Figma is popular, it solves issues with sharing and collaboration. But the day to day usage is crippled by the fact it&#x27;s in a browser and not a standalone app where I need it to have total control over keybindings and shortcuts for my workflow. Meanwhile in the browser, hijacking that behavior is a UX antipattern.<p>Sketch is just so much less cumbersome than Figma it&#x27;s not even funny.
