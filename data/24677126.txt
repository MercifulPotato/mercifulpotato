So fix that first.<p>And to reiterate - I always get downvoted for saying this but feel free to ignore the truth - if you use someone&#x27;s platform, you let them obtain data about you. \nYou have no right to data given to the other part in exchange for accessing some service unless that was explicitly promised beforehand.<p>That data is no longer &quot;yours&quot;, you gave it away, so you have no right to it.
