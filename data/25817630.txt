The penalty was often death, even though people don&#x27;t actually consort with demons in the real world.<p>There were no witches, of course, and the underlying causes of real witch hunts are a matter of speculation. Some people say it was a way to get rid of the elderly, some people say that ergot poisoning could have played a role, some people say that mobs are violent and irrational by nature. But everybody who was tried in a historical &quot;witch hunt&quot; was innocent.<p>Still, with the advent of the internet, it&#x27;s taken on a new meaning. Today, &quot;witch hunt&quot; means something like &quot;piling on&quot;. The target may or may not be guilty, but the phrase implies that their alleged guilt doesn&#x27;t necessarily merit the amount of attention that they are getting.<p>It might be interesting to investigate when that change in meaning happened, and why.')
