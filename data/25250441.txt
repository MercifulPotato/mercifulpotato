My father believed children should never be given a short answer, or told &quot;because I said so&quot;. If we wanted something we would have to give a rational argument why. If we asked a question and he wasn&#x27;t sure of the answer, he would say he didn&#x27;t know and we would go to the encyclopedia together to read the full answer.<p>Every night from the time I was 6 we had to read 50 pages in a book he assigned and discuss it. This was after he came home from 10 hour days at work.<p>Most parents are (1) too lazy to properly explain things to their children, (2) unwilling to say when they don&#x27;t know the answer, (3) lack the critical thinking skills themselves to evaluate statements, (4) lack the basic research skills needed to validate or invalidate a proposition.<p>That is the problem in America.<p>When I was about 8 years old we were riding in the car with a couple my parents were friends with and their children who were similar in age to us. The son asked the father why the sky was blue. The father turned around and said, &quot;well, it reflects the ocean&quot;. I said, &quot;no, you&#x27;re wrong, it&#x27;s the color the atmosphere refracts light&quot; (or something like that). The father and son both stared at me in shock because I would tell an adult they were wrong. My father just laughed.<p>I don&#x27;t think I was necessarily smarter than other children by nature. I was just brought up with the idea that it is everyone&#x27;s personal responsibility to read, to learn, to say when you don&#x27;t know the answer, to find reliable sources. And above all, never to memorize answers without fully understanding them.<p>Which is why I love writing code ;)')
