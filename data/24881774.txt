The Spotify guy is worth 7 billion with little to show for the modern music artist.<p>Also, a huge &quot;wtf&quot; from me for:<p>&gt;I do not want to pay for a streaming service and would like to buy individual songs &amp; albums instead. How can I do this on YouTube Music?<p>&gt;While you cannot purchase music from YouTube Music, you can do so from another store and upload that music into YouTube Music. This way, you can have your entire music library in one place. Note that you can play uploaded songs in the background, ad-free and offline with a free YouTube Music subscription.<p>Nice, I can upload my music to your service, and pay you to access music I paid for already?  How&#x27;s that expression go?  &quot;Smooth move, ex-lax.&quot;')
