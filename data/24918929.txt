Probably &quot;the web browser&quot; is more correct term these days, no?<p>The idea of &quot;browser as OS&quot; or &quot;OS as browser&quot; is not that new. That move started by &quot;active desktop&quot; concept on Windows 95 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Active_Desktop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Active_Desktop</a>).<p>And speaking about browser... It&#x27;s main goal is to serve following tasks:<p>1. To provide safe browsing experience.<p>2. To present content to the user.<p>Note that the order of these two tasks matters.<p>Initial active desktop effort has died because order of these two tasks was wrong at their first attempt.<p>From that point of view, &quot;browser as OS&quot; just increases attack surface. And so more and more isolation layers will be added into browsers making them less effective and performant than alternatives.<p>Consider WebAssembly for example. That was desperate move to provide an option to run some computation-heavy code inside browsers with at least comparable speed of native code. But it always be slower than native solutions. Java vs native code, we&#x27;ve been there, seen that.<p>To be short: native OS and solutions will always be more performant than the one <i>emulated</i> in the browser. Just because of the order of tasks.<p>In this sense the browser will never be complete. It may become asymptotically close to the OS but will never reach that point.\nAnd note the price: on that way it will become asymptotically close to the size of OS.')
