Conformity is hardwired into us, and I assume that came from evolution as a means to help our survival, though I can&#x27;t say I understand to what extent. I remember an off hand remark a friend made, but it says a lot: &quot;If people see someone riding a Segway, they will go and beat him up.&quot; First, I think that is hilarious. Partly because it is true. This says a lot about our nature. Maybe this urge helps us work together? Of course, a certain amount of new thinking is needed too, or else we wouldn&#x27;t get anywhere.')
