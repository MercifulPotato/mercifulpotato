Thibado’s team found that at room temperature the thermal motion of graphene does in fact induce an alternating current (AC) in a circuit, an achievement thought to be impossible.<p>So it sounds like, if this really works, it may have some impact on our general understanding of thermodynamics or the properties of Brownian motion?')
