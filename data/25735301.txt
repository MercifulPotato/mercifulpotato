So does XGBoost if you don&#x27;t want deep learning. You can then run them with KubeFlow or on whatever platform your SaaS provider has (GCP AI Platform, AWS Sagemaker, etc.).<p>edit:<p>&gt;All the replies to my original comment seem to forget that, or maybe Snowflake has such functionality and I&#x27;m unaware of it.<p>Snowflake has support for custom Javascript UDFs and a lot of built in features (you can do absurd things with window functions). I also found it much faster than Spark.')
