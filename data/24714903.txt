Ordinary names like Bob or Sue are common too.<p>I understand why Starbucks does it. It&#x27;s part of their corporate culture and marketing. I&#x27;ve no strong aversion to it. But I just wanted to highlight some of the downsides for people with unusual names, even though as you say it&#x27;s no big deal to find a workaround.<p>p.s. English names are not exempt from this. Imagine going to a non-English-speaking country and having a name like Cecil or Xavier (which Americans pronounce Ex-zavier).')
