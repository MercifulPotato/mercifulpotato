Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602122766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714866, text='Yes, many people with such names have so-called &quot;Starbucks&quot; names, and some are quite creative and funny -- I mean, there are people who use &quot;Barack Hussein&quot; as their Starbucks name. Ordinary names like Bob or Sue are common too.<p>I understand why Starbucks does it. It&#x27;s part of their corporate culture and marketing. I&#x27;ve no strong aversion to it -- as I said I&#x27;m used to it now and it is what it is. But I just wanted to highlight some of the downsides for people with unusual names, even though as you say it&#x27;s no big deal to find a workaround.<p>And there exist more universal systems that aren&#x27;t dependent on a barista&#x27;s ability to spell or pronounce an arbitrary name, and that doesn&#x27;t require the customer to reveal or invent a name.<p>p.s. English names are not exempt from this. Imagine going to a non-English-speaking country and having a name like Cecil or Xavier (which Americans pronounce Ex-zavier).')
