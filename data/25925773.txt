We need a CAPTCHA for truth - but I&#x27;m not sure such a thing is even possible without AGI. So what does that leave us with - making algorithmic message amplification illegal? Putting that genie back in the bottle isn&#x27;t going to be easy, so we&#x27;d need to be damn sure it&#x27;s the right thing to do, to ever drum up enough support to get legislation like that passed.')
