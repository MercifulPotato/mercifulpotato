What I have a problem with (maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough) is how we&#x27;re going to transition to meet the electric demand with our old infrastructure. People forget how damn energy dense fossil fuels are. If everything is electric and to make more electricity, we will need to burn fossil fuels to meet the demand, it makes things even worse environmentally (there is no universe where burning fuel at the generator, distributing, and using it for heat is more efficient than just straight-up burning the fuel at source). Even the Bay Area, one of arguably the most energy progressive area cannot transition fully to renewables only within the next decade or two.')
