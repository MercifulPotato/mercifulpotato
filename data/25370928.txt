Keep in mind that Pakistan has 220 million people.<p>One individual company with less than 2k employees is valued 1&#x2F;10th of what 220 million people collectively produce in a year. How can one explain this asymmetry. No doubt it was the biggest tech acquisition in the history but tech executives in the US bolstered by Fed&#x27;s dollar printing have been breaking paper records almost every year.<p>Maybe I do not understand the economics of this well so I would gladly accept any roast of my above observation.')
