So how many did you survey? 2000, apparently. Not a bad number, still a bit low to use a word describing &gt;5 billion people.<p>Regarding &quot;Adults&quot;: From where? How old? How rich? Does it include female Indians aged 50-80? Apparently they asked &quot;Britons&quot;. Refreshing that it is not US biased for once, but that is something very relevant conveniently omitted from the conclusion while <i>still being extremely vague</i>.<p>But let&#x27;s get back to n=2000. How did they get so many? Oh, apparently they used OnePoll[1], which is a for-profit company specializing in PR-surveys.<p>And, did you really ask &quot;would you agree that X is a <i>waste of money</i>&quot;? If I would propose such a loaded question in an academic study I would probably brought behind the barn by any respectable researcher. Ask for example &quot;How much would you agree with the following statement: If a new smartphone model is released, I feel the need to buy it&quot; you would probably get a very different result.<p>But let&#x27;s not unfairly presume. What did they ask? Well, the primary source is nowhere to be found. Just a bunch of News and blogs citing each other. Some wrongly cite &quot;The musicMagpie Annual Phone Depreciation Report&quot; [0] which does not mention this, but apparently lead to this study.<p>Wait: <i>musicMagpie</i>? So, this &quot;study&quot; was apparently &quot;conducted&quot; by a <i>used phone reseller</i>, directly profiting from the sentiment this propaganda piece is selling?<p>Meaning, this is literally, completely, PR fluff.<p>I am trying hard to not pull the &quot;HN is becoming Reddit&quot; meme here, but please enlighten me how this uncritical reception of marketing dressed up as &quot;science&quot; (?) seen in this thread is different from the average &#x2F;r&#x2F;technology experience.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.musicmagpie.co.uk&#x2F;phone-depreciation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.musicmagpie.co.uk&#x2F;phone-depreciation&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thesun.co.uk&#x2F;tech&#x2F;12806082&#x2F;new-smartphone-upgrade-price-high-cost&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thesun.co.uk&#x2F;tech&#x2F;12806082&#x2F;new-smartphone-upgrad...</a><p>edit: punctuation')
