But there is a key problem that they seem to share: cold starts. Our app doesn&#x27;t see a lot of traffic, so we can happily run the entire thing on the equivalent of a small VM. If there was a massive traffic spike then I guess this would fall over, but we&#x27;re an enterprise app so this is unliekly and we could fix that pretty quickly by provisioning more servers (in heroku this is as simple as dragging a slider). But even if we couldn&#x27;t, falling over in abnormal conditions seems greatly preferable to there being a good chance of 3 seconds+ of latency being added to a normal everyday request.<p>If you can solve this then you&#x27;re on to a winner.')
