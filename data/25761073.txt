It might be a serious remark about their state of mind, or it might be a flippant comment made after a long day. We can&#x27;t know, so we shouldn&#x27;t really weigh in on that specifically.<p>More generally though, if you&#x27;re concerned about project owners burning out and giving up on the things you depend on, how about supporting the project financially, or with contributions, or just with encouragement. Adding a &#x27;thumbs up&#x27; to a release or a fixed issue, or posting a &#x27;Thanks&#x27; message goes a long way. Better yet, raise a point about the value that the project brings to the company you work for and suggest they do corporate sponsorship. That&#x27;s likely to be more money, and it&#x27;ll continue after you&#x27;ve moved on. This is how we can all help open source maintainers avoid burning out.')
