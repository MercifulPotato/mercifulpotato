I first learned about the megaranches from Edna Ferber&#x27;s 1952 novel Giant and the transformation is a major theme of the book. (Incidentally, I created an account on some forum while I was reading the book and out of laziness borrowed the name of one of the characters, Jett Rink. I have used that name on the internet ever since.)')
