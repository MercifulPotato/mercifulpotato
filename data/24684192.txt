People on both sides of the exam table are not thrilled with the current system.<p>I&#x27;ve watched grown, experienced doctors break down and cry over what they have seen, the expectations and pressures placed on them, the type of things they&#x27;ve had to tell people, mistakes they&#x27;ve made, etc. It&#x27;s not pretty.<p>They&#x27;re not building apps for a living while working from home, they&#x27;re trying to fix ill people within the constraints of human behavior and mother nature, and that is a rough job.<p>Many get paid a lot, many don&#x27;t, but for people who went into it with the desire to help people you can&#x27;t just buy off the dying kids and the lifelong smokers who killed themselves one cigarette at a time for 40-years, and the diabetic feet, and sexual assaults, and the dead bodies harvested of organs looking up at you after the surgeons have left the room, the frequent flyers, the smell of bloody feces, the smell of infection, everything else that can possible go wrong with a human being.<p>Not to mention the over a decade of school, and hundreds and hundreds of hours of documenting for insurance, and covering your ass for each time you get dragged into court to testify over what at any other job would be a benign clerical error.')
