This is the order that applies to me, a middle-aged, married, father of two; the order of questions would be different for others.<p><pre><code>  1. Do I need to work for money?\n    - If not, you don&#x27;t _need_ to work but choose to work.\n      + Hence the question of job satisfaction is moot.\n    - If you&#x27;re working to earn money, the question of job satisfaction is pertinent.\n      + This applies even if you work for yourself or own a business.\n  2. Am I making enough money to not worry about money?\n    - If not, I&#x27;m not going to be satisfied at the job, irrespective of the all other circumstances at work&#x2F;office.\n    - Ask yourself: Am I able to\n      + pay my bills\n      + support my lifestyle, or lower the cost of lifestyle without too much inconvenience\n      + take care of my and loved ones&#x27; health, wellness, education, plan for future&#x2F;retirement, etc.\n  3. Do my coworkers respect me&#x2F;my work?\n    - Coworkers include anyone who you work with: peers, subordinates, managers, their managers, etc.\n  4. Do I _want_ to do the job?\n    - You may have started with certain set of expectations, but over time the expectations and preferences change.\n  5. Am I able to do my job?\n    - Various circumstances may prevent you from doing your job.\n  6. Am I able to do my job the way _I_ want to?\n    - Getting the job done, and getting it done &quot;right&quot; are different things.\n    - Adjust own expectations and try to understand why your way may not be the best way to do the job.\n  7. Am I allowed to do new things, if&#x2F;when I want to?\n    - If you want to, are you allowed to work outside your defined role?\n    - Is that work you did outside of your job definition appreciated?</code></pre>')
