I&#x27;ve been fully remote for 4 years. Because the small village where we wanted to live has 0 tech jobs within reasonable commute distance.<p>I&#x27;ve gone from IC to team lead, to group lead. I think this is my limit at the moment. Not because I&#x27;m remote, but that&#x27;s how much I can handle at the moment.<p>I don&#x27;t get some of the hallway chats from the mothership, but the feedback routinely is that we&#x27;re one of the strongest groups in the company. So I would take that as a sign that the remote aspect isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.<p>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t go back to the office routine unless I was out of options.<p>And yes, I do spend 80% of my time in various calls. This is not different from being in an office and working with a distributed team (also in offices in their regions).')
