I don&#x27;t have to worry about installing new tools or libraries and how they interact with my primary OS. While this isn&#x27;t a huge issue for many, I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about how Go, Python, Java, etc... are installed on my Mac. I like being able to pull in a Docker container with everything already setup (or a customized one). Then when I throw away a project, I don&#x27;t have orphaned installations on my Mac.')
