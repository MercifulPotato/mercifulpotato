But when I think of a “personal data warehouse”, I see a lot more utility in centralizing financial data (cash, assets, debts, receipts), health records, government documents, and other more... non-trivial information. The examples of “plot your dogs weight over time by filtering tweets” and “rank pictures you’ve taken of Pelicans by ML-graded aesthetic quality” are delightful but absurdly frivolous (and I honestly can’t tell whether they were meant as serious examples or not..).<p>What I want this to be is a kind of mint.com, but with the ability to ingest from a wider swath of sources, and without having to grant a third party app access to my bank account. I’m sure many companies have tried to make all-encompassing life-tracker tools that I’m not aware of, but I’m equally certain that they have serious security and privacy problems. And it’s entirely possible that this is all just wishful thinking... that centralizing sensitive data in this way will always create a single point of failure that is inherently risky.')
