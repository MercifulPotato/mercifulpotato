Why are Harvard and other Ivies the only ones that matter on your resume? Once a society limits the number of opportunities to reach the upper echelons, it is bound to set off scramble among all the parents, since everyone wants the best for their children.<p>For some reasons, this is not only an American thing. I believe elite institutions in other countries as equally (or even more) selective.')
