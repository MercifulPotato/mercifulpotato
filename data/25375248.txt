There&#x27;s also molecule patents, etc.  I could be wrong but typically pharmas don&#x27;t take out process patents because they are hard to prove and you need a warrant which has a nearly unattainable level of discovery to get on premises and determine if the process has been copied.  With a molecule patent you can buy a sample and prove infringement with an analytical technique.<p>While the fda has disclosure requirements on a pharma manufacturing process, it does not have to be disclosed to the public.')
