I understand that they don&#x27;t care about me, I don&#x27;t want that they care about me, I care about the paycheck, stock options and bonus. Thanks to that i was able to buy my Model X, 1 house in Bay Area and 2 investment properties one in Austin and other in Financial District in Sao Paulo. \nI will continue to work for the evil corp because it brings economic benefit to me and my family, I don&#x27;t care if my product is popular or not. I&#x27;m happy that my family has all they need')
