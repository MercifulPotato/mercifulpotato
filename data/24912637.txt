On the one hand, he says the best hiring managers &quot;didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects&quot;. But then in the <i>very next paragraph</i> he cites Google, Facebook, Stripe, and Dropbox as examples. Huh?<p>It&#x27;s so misleading to cite BigCos as examples of excellent hiring, because the founders of the companies and the initial employees are never hired in the same way that their engineers are currently hired. They&#x27;re usually just people who happened to know each other in a dorm. It&#x27;s only after the company gets a bunch of funding that they need to fill seats with a bunch of warm bodies. But the success wasn&#x27;t because of the assembly-line style hiring, it&#x27;s the product idea and the personal qualities of the founders that drove the success of the company. Engineers throw themselves at those companies because of the compensation and prestige. It&#x27;s not because they have a magical snowflake hiring process.')
