Surely, as of yet we are the most intelligent thing in the known universe, and the human mind can seemingly discover&#x2F;invent&#x2F;understand everything.<p>But knowing that our math itself has a limit, and we are already pushing that limit with some problems it is naiv to think that the human brain is all that much capable. (Interestingly enough we are intelligent enough to somewhat know our limits - like the complexity of ZFC)  \nWhile once singularity happens, an AI has basically only material limits to the complexity it can manage (though what I found beautiful is that even that would hit a limit not necessarily higher than we do - like there will be a busy beaver number it canâ€™t reason about)')
