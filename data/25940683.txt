If you ask me, this is a non-issue - where I live or where I was born is not Facebook&#x27;s business.<p>FB are concerned about the quality of the data they are selling to their customers, if they sell a batch of records &#x2F; API requests and disproportionate amounts of them have birth places that are small villages with ridiculous names, the value of that data decreases.')
