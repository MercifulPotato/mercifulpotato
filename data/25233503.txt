It’s higher than I thought. Thanks for bringing the data. However, even with a few dozen startups a year it cannot be termed to a major startup hub. Are there any accelerators, major VCs, or the like in Zürich? I’m not aware of many, if any.<p>I’m in Ostschweiz, so I don’t know Zürich super well, but here the tech meetups groups for almost everything are &lt; 100 members (not attendees), so I would have to go to Zürich for any real meetups, which are quite small based on group pages, as well.<p>And don’t get me wrong—I’m not disappointed in or minimizing the amount cool stuff that comes out of Switzerland. I want to see it grow and succeed. It’d be fantastic if Zürich became a major hub in the future. Hopp Schwiiz! :)')
