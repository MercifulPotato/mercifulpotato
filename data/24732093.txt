It&#x27;s probably one of the only good things about the online ad industry. If you book time slots, only the biggest players will be able to compete for that slot. Essentially killing the entire selling point of online ads, which is giving a chance to smaller players a chance at the game. I don&#x27;t want to, ever, see online ads transform into TV ads. \nTargeting would be okay if it was done properly. In its current state, it&#x27;s unethical and probably should be illegeal. Advertisers shouldn&#x27;t know what I like, they should only know that a certain device with a certain ID likes X,Y topics.')
