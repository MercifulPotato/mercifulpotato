Couldn&#x27;t pin it down, copied their database to my machine and it took only a couple of minutes. A bit of digging and I found that in this case this module caused a few million of fairly trivial SQL statements to be executed.<p>Each took less than a millisecond to execute locally, but round-trip time over WiFi can be 10 milliseconds or more. So suddenly 2 minutes becomes over 20 minutes.<p>I asked how the client connected to the LAN, and it was indeed via WiFi. As a quick fix we got the customer to use a network cable, which did indeed reduce the running time to a few minutes. The proper fix was to a bit of caching.')
