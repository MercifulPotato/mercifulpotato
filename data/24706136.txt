However, Justinian came to power in Byzantium in 527, while classical Rome appears to have been done for, if not by 192, at least by 268.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crisis_of_the_Third_Century" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crisis_of_the_Third_Century</a><p>&gt; &quot;The crisis began with the assassination of Emperor Severus Alexander by his own troops in 235. This initiated a 50-year period during which there were at least 26 claimants to the title of emperor, mostly prominent Roman army generals, who assumed imperial power over all or part of the Empire.&quot;<p>Furthermore,<p>&gt; <i>... religion is in severe decline in any place near or in a city.

For example, my wife, from a traditionally catholic area, divides christianity with the trichotomy of &quot;Christians&quot; (catholics), &quot;Reformeds&quot; (protestants) and &quot;Fishies&quot; (all the other cults). To be fair, she might count orthodox in their own grouping, but when this came up we were talking about local cults.<p>So (assuming all those racially segegrated listings are evangelical denominations?) she&#x27;d say the US a few years ago was 13% reformed, 20% christian, and 32-35% fishie.')
