You are talking about the SSPL, the parent poster you are replying to is talking about the Elastic License which does in fact prevent you from modifying the code and running it in production:<p>See 2.2 Restrictions:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elastic&#x2F;elasticsearch&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;ELASTIC-LICENSE.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elastic&#x2F;elasticsearch&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;license...</a><p>With the dual-licensing you have a choice of Elastic license or SSPL, but they both have terms you might not like.
