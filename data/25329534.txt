The app creates a full screen view in the foreground. A view is a rectangular area on the screen which is responsible for event handling and drawing. Additionally, it contains UI components such as buttons and text fields [13]. The malicious app opens the preinstalled Google Play Store app in the background. The view of the malicious app overlays the opened Google Play Store app. As a result, the user does not notice that the Google Play Store app is opened. The chargeable app of the attacker is selected in the Google Play Store app. Furthermore, the Google Play Store app contains the button Buy for 50 $.<p>Is this even possible? Android allows developers to &quot;launch&quot; other applications &quot;behind&quot; the foreground app, and click events actually make it back down to the target app? I find this hard to believe.')
