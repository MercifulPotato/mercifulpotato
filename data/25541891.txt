Within the realm of tech? Maybe. Within the realm of XYZ? Maybe.<p>Innovation requires investment and time. The classic example for the positive merits of the patent system is the pharmaceutical industry. No pharma company is going to spend 5 - 20 years and millions or billions developing new medicine if someone can immediately copy it and make a generic brand pricing it cheaper (they don&#x27;t need to make back those costs). The issue of drugs costing an arm and a leg here is not really relevant either as that&#x27;s moreso an American phenomenon, here in Australia or the UK they are reasonably priced.<p>Anyway the point here is that the patent system&#x27;s happy-path design is to give the inventor of X time to make their money back and some profit before competition drives the price down. Is that abused? Absolutely whole-heartedly yes. Is the solution to the abuse the absolute removal of the patent system? Absolutely not.')
