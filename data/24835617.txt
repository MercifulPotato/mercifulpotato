(Note, though, that I am still <i>100%</i> on the side of the anti-HTTP&#x2F;2 camp in this thread.) The core problem is that somehow people think they can implement a spec without even, you know, <i>reading the spec</i>, which is so far past hubris as to have gone through incompetence into obvious negligence.')
