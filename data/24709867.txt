For someone working at a Big Tech company, a single developer - even a low level one - can produce substantial value for the company.  On the other hand, working at a small company, the entire company may not have as much revenue as the low level developer produced at the Big Tech company.<p>Should a developer at a small company that is... say... optimizing routes for auto parts delivery for a handful of clients be compensated at the same &quot;market price&quot; as someone who is working on optimizing AWS?<p>My point is that not every company - even in the Bay Area - can afford to pay &quot;market rate&quot; for everyone.<p>Its not that the labor market doesn&#x27;t value the skills, it&#x27;s that the labor produced isn&#x27;t worth the same.  I believe that it is foolish for a software developer who to expect the wages of someone who is working in Big Tech at all other companies (and it would be foolish for the company to pay an employee more than the value that they&#x27;re creating for the company).')
