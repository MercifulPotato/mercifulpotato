I am not saying it is heavily moderated to make them stop moderating it.<p>But the fact is,  it is what it is precisely because a lot effort goes into moderating it. Acting like HN it&#x27;s some kind of free speech place is absurd.<p>Claiming that HN is good and then going into outrage because another site applied significantly looser restrictions is dishonest. For that matter,  trying to pretend the Donald or incels subs were merely normal subs merely discussing conservative policies is outright lie.')
