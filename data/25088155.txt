Descendants of mainlanders that came to Taiwan after 1949 are a minority and Taiwanese identity is very popular here. Both Taiwanese and Waishengren will quickly point out that ROC is the original China and of course they are independent because how could they not be independent from a country that split from it. Then Taiwanese will disagree about whether China (ROC or PRC) has any right to colonize their island.<p>Another generation and hardly anyone will have Chinese identity, I imagine. An example I hear a lot is that the Vietnamese and Koreans also used to be Chinese.')
