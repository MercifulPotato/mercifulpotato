I&#x27;m only in year 3 but things are progressing albeit slower than I expected. I hopefully can produce around 2 tons of nuts per acre once the trees are mature and it only requires around 50 hours labour per acre, per year. It is only a small 10 acre orchard which I expect to earn around 30K per year for the raw in shell nuts(field price) before value added processing and marketing. Eventually I would like to build a small commercial kitchen to produce craft butter and brittle that I will market online.<p>The trees were planted 3 years ago but wont begin producing anything substantial for 4 or 5 more years, until then I have a small layer hen operation with farm gate sales and a small wood working side hustle.<p>It&#x27;s a low stress simple life which is enjoyable most of the time and provides me with a lot of spare time to pursue my hobbies.')
