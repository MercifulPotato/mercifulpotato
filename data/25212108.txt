I was so angry at that offer. I told the hiring manager that I couldn&#x27;t possibly work for less than $35k they scoffed at that, I told them no thanks. I could make more money flipping burgers.<p>I kept looking for work.<p>Had another offer for $32k with one week of vacation a year, and no health care.<p>It took me over a year to land my first gig, only making $45k a year. No job since has paid me more.<p>I had phone interviews that last for less than two minutes because I didn&#x27;t have industry experience when the posting clearly no experience needed&#x2F; will train.<p>I&#x27;ve had my time wasted by recruiters who send me to interviews that I&#x27;m not qualified for.<p>Interviewed with Amazon at one point, got invited to onsite interview, when my contact ghosted me while trying to arrange travel.<p>I&#x27;ve worked some programming jobs, all of them have been horrible in their own way. Alcoholics, cliques and fiefdoms, to being left to my own devices working alone often forgotten.<p>At this point my wife thinks its time for me to go back to school and get another degree, leave programming behind. I love computers. I&#x27;m a good programmer. I have no idea what I would do if I wasn&#x27;t in technology.<p>What frustrates me the most, is the number of people I know in my personal life, that never got programming degrees that are now well paid programmers. All of them have degrees in non engineering fields, started non programming jobs that turned into programming jobs because they needed something coded up.<p>The second thing that frustrates me is the sheer number of people that I have interacted with that have pulled the ladder up behind them once they make it out.<p>It is frustrating knowing I am a good programmer and seeing bad programmers getting well paying jobs.<p>I guess where I&#x27;m trying to go with this, is that for some of us, we just can&#x27;t seem to get ahead. Maybe we are just unlucky. Maybe we have been beaten down by the interview process or jobs and we don&#x27;t want to deal with it anymore.<p>I know for a fact that had I just taken a regular 9-5 non-stem job I&#x27;d be ahead of where I am right now. And what scares me is the thought that if I keep trying, I might not ever do better in STEM.... I love STEM...')
