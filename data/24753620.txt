The small size is rather a plus since it cools down quickly when I need it. It only needs to hold a few bottles of seltzer or coke zero.<p>It&#x27;s only rated at 2.8A (34W) so it&#x27;s within USB-C spec. It can probably exceed the spec when the compressor starts, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.<p>Mine does have a thermostat control, and it can keep things frozen well. Used it with a portable 220Wh Li-ion battery to keep ice frozen during a party, it kept it frozen solid on a hot day in direct sunlight for 5 hours')
