Despite a chemistry degree, I have never really thought to consider whether or not endothermic combustion exists, even though endothermic reactions exist. Nitrogen &quot;combustion&quot; with oxygen is endothermic. But really, the definition of combustion implies a high temperature, relatively rapid and self-sustaining reaction, e.g. rust and glucose metabolism aren&#x27;t combustion.')
