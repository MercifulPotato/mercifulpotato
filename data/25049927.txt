And the only differentiation are their TDP cooling. The MacBook Air is 10W TDP, and both Mac Mini and MacBook Pro are likely ~35W range.<p>The did mention MacBook Air&#x27;s SSD performances is now twice as fast, so this isn&#x27;t exactly an iPad Pro with Keyboard. That is great except I suddenly remember the 2019 MacBook Air actually had a slower SSD than the 2018 MacBook Air. Where the 2018 do Read at 2GB&#x2F;s, 2019 could only do 1.3GB&#x2F;s. So even at 2x &#x2F; 2.6GB&#x2F;s it is still only slightly better than 2018. And considering modern day NVME SSD, this is barely good enough.<p>Pricing kept at $999, and same old ridiculous upgrade pricing of RAM and Storage. Although they did lower the Education Pricing to $899, a little bit better than previous ~$829. But for MacBook Pro, <i>You are essentially paying $300 more for a Fan and Touch Bar</i>. And <i>Pro</i> still limited to 16GB Memory ( because it is now using the LPDDR RAM as used on iPad ).<p>I guess may be this is exciting for many, but extremely underwhelming to me.<p>A Quote from Steve Jobs:<p><i>“When you have a monopoly market share, the people who can make the company more successful are sales and marketing people, and they end up running the companies, the product people get driven out of the decision making forums.\nCompanies forget what it takes to make great products. The product sensibility, the product genius that brought them to this monopolistic position is rotted out... The people running these companies have no conception of a good product versus a bad product. They&#x27;ve got no conception of the craftsmanship that&#x27;s required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. They really have no feeling in their heart about wanting to really help the customers”</i><p>And my small rant and wishes, Dear Tim Cook &#x2F; Apple, Please Stop Saying you LOVE something. There is no need for you to tell me that, because if you did love something; We will know. Steve never said anything along those lines, but we all know he cares way more than any of us could even imagine.')
