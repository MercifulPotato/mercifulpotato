I have a similar 3M mask (6000 series) but haven&#x27;t used it since March since the exhale port doesn&#x27;t make it easy to attach a filter. Being able to use it would solve my glasses fogging, which I&#x27;ve only been able to mitigate somewhat with shaped 3D printed pieces of plastic in the nose-wire slot of my fabric mask.')
