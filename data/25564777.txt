It&#x27;s proportional to the aggregate of everybody - which basically completely disconnects it from what individual users listen to.<p>For example: Spotify only has 2 users.  User A listens to 10 hours of Drake.  User B listens to 90 hours of Kid Cudi.  Even though User A and User B both pay $10 and have very exclusively chosen their musical preferences, Kid Cudi gets 90% of the total pool of money.<p>To put this in another perspective - imagine if someone on Netflix just looped Shit Show A 24&#x2F;7 and there were 24 other users who watched Good Shit X,Y,Z... for exactly 1 hour every day.  Netflix would allocate funding equally between the 1 Shit Show A that the 1 user watched and <i>everything</i> else that the 24 other users watched, even though that 1 show only actually generated 4% of their revenue.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense from a user perspective.<p>As the numbers increase to the ~100MM paid users of Spotify or Netflix, disparity increases between casual users and power users, it all sort of explodes to amplify all of the earnings to a select few.<p>What this means is the big guys dominate everything.  I realize the music industry has shifted from touring to sell records, to streaming to sell concert tickets - but how do you do that for newspapers?  Newspapers can&#x27;t do anything equivalent to concerts.  At that point they&#x27;re just news stations, which really aren&#x27;t the same as concerts from a business perspective.')
