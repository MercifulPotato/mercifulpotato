Item(by='astrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611958901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962789, text='&gt; As I understand it, Robinhood had a cash problem because of the various collaterals required for high-risk securities during the clearing process. When each share traded needs a high amount of collateral (1:1, even), and you have a high number of those trades happening, you might not have the cash to pony up.<p>Something like that. But note that it isn&#x27;t related to margin trading - Robinhood has to post their own cash as collateral with NSCC&#x2F;DTCC, they can&#x27;t use their customers&#x27; cash. So if a customer wanted to opt out of the margin account this wouldn&#x27;t actually help.<p>(I don&#x27;t know what this rule is for, but it&#x27;s in the rules.)')
