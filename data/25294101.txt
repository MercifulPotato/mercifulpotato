Norms shift over time and your suggestion that it&#x27;s unlikely to change is your opinion based on cultural analysis, not something that can be proven to be true even in principle.<p>&gt; <i>It would be much, much more difficult to change than e.g. the supply of dollars or euros which are considered scarce enough by most of the world</i><p>This thread is about gold not fiat money, obviously the scarcity of fiat money can change, that&#x27;s the whole point of fiat money.')
