Item(by='SkyBelow', descendants=None, kids=[25083385], score=None, time=1605281660, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082285, text='&gt;Do you disagree that a job should mean that someone is able to afford rent and pay your bills?<p>Could we focus down on this question.  Ignoring what led to this question being raised, I would like to better capture what is being asked here.<p>Is the idea that any job should be able to provide for any rent and any bills?  I think that is an entirely unreasonable interpretation, but I want to make sure we are in agreement that there are some combinations of jobs, rents, and bills that aren&#x27;t reasonable to be included.<p>If we can agree on that point, then how should we determine what pairings of job&#x2F;rent&#x2F;bills should be covered and should not?  For example, maybe we should say that for any job, there should exist rent within 30 minutes of the job and bills that include X amenities which is affordable working that job.  (For the moment let&#x27;s ignore the complexities of deciding what should be included in X, especially given that people can acquire some very large bills in numerous ways.)<p>If for the moment we agree to the above standards for jobs, how should part time jobs work?  Should it be that any part time job whose total pay when accounting for hours worked dips below the threshold we agreed to shouldn&#x27;t exist?  Say there was a job where working 25 hours was enough to meet the threshold, should we say that it would be illegal for the job to offer 24 hours or less a week (there would be a number of ways to enforce this, potentially having a minimum wage monthly in combination with an hourly minimum wage, but other options exist)?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to disagree with the sentiment.  Instead, I want to better understand the details of the sentiment beyond the trivial case (all jobs, all rents, all bills) which has trivial counters, trivial to the extent that bringing them up almost seems like a bad faith strawman.')
