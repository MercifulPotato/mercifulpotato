I know that full-disk encryption is less secure after boot (which I think this thread addresses), but I&#x27;m under the impression the method they&#x27;re using is basically on-par with actual full-on &quot;this is a computer used for x purpose&quot;-level encryption.<p>Unless that impression is wrong (possible), does that mean that a) Android and iOS devices are now fundamentally less secure than these new distros with disk-level encryption enabled or b) that encryption is really just a hard problem and this isn&#x27;t actually unique to phones, it&#x27;s just that police have more opportunities to try to break into phones than they do into laptops, so it gets more attention?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;mobian1&#x2F;issues&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;50" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;mobian1&#x2F;issues&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;50</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;calamares&#x2F;calamares" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;calamares&#x2F;calamares</a>')
