Well, it would if we had one unified board.  Instead we have stuff scattered across multiple boards.  Still it would only take 1-2 minutes to open them all up and glance through them.  Information radiators.  They work well.<p>Instead we have a 30-60 minute standup&#x2F;sitdown&#x2F;try-not-to-doze-off meeting to achieve the same thing.  We used to also have additional meetings to review the boards but eventually cut those because people got tired of me saying &quot;the status is still the same as I said an hour ago, because I&#x27;ve been in this meeting since then.&quot;<p>The exception is stuff like team announcements, reminders that someone&#x27;s going to be out, requests for someone to volunteer to take a task.  That can all be done async though.')
