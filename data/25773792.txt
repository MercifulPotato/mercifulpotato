In my country, memories of war (World War II in particular), tragedies, sacrifices, &quot;heroes&quot; etc. are continually fueled by the ruling party. They built hundreds of <i>new</i> monuments in the past 10 years, gave thousands of streets names related to their selection of war and post-war heroes, etc.<p>Let me tell you, this is the main way to drive nationalistic divide, because the other half of the people in the country recognize for what it is -- evil manipulation of people&#x27;s emotions for political gain (through conflict, much like Trump was doing in US).')
