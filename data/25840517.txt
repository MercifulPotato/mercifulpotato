It&#x27;s likely this created a short squeeze on Wednesday which caused these put sellers to take a loss, buy the underlying stock, or roll their contracts to a later date. Most of this price action occured on Wednesday, where there weren&#x27;t volatile swings in either direction on Thursday or Friday.')
