Item(by='jen729w', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607923883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412668, text='This looks cool, there&#x27;s a bunch of ideas here that are similar to scribbled notes on my wall!<p>I really like the idea of &#x27;everything related to one task in one place&#x27;. What I&#x27;m planning on doing with the app I&#x27;m (trying to) write is extend this to make sense of the fact that your task is in a JD category and might therefore be related to <i>other</i> tasks in the <i>same</i> category.<p>So I&#x27;m looking at `11.01 Some item` and it has a bunch of tasks. Over in `11.04 Another item` I have other tasks, and optionally I can choose to show them -- because they&#x27;re likely to be at least <i>related</i> to the thing I&#x27;m doing. Maybe I can do a bunch of related stuff at the same time?<p>One of the things I love about JD is the way it helps me stay in context. Everything in a category relates in some way to each other, so given that my job is mental and I do a hundred things a day, I can save myself some cognitive load and at least bunch similar things together.')
