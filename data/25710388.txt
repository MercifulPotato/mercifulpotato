AWS can already terminate you at any point<p>That is literally my point, the &#x27;rules&#x27; don&#x27;t matter. The post that I responded to claimed that somehow there was no slippery slope here because they have rules after all.<p>&gt;Amazon is a business, and can choose to do business with just about anyone they&#x27;d like<p>Well, that&#x27;s how it currently is, but this doesn&#x27;t apply to all businesses. An electric provider can&#x27;t just cut you off because they don&#x27;t like you, maybe it&#x27;d be a good idea to implement something similar for services that provide equally critical digital infrastructure?')
