This is not the kind of relationship you want to have with someone providing critical functions.<p>This looks like a good theoretical point, but I don&#x27;t see how it holds in practice. What would be practical examples of this happening? (assuming POV of somebody not intentionally abusing the system)<p>&gt; If you pay for every bit you store, your provider will enthusiastically enable you to store as much as you can.<p>Again, good point in theory, but I&#x27;m not sure how this works psychologically - flat rates bring peace of mind and allow easier budget planning. I still remember how internet browsing in dial up days were sort of stressful.')
