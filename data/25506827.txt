It&#x27;s sitting on a shelf somewhere because the battery won&#x27;t charge anymore, the barrel connector is too loose. Purism tech support was no help at all. Another minor issue, the screws weren&#x27;t held in by any kind of loctite and they just fall out after awhile if I don&#x27;t remember to periodically tighten them. Like 4 of those screws are missing. And the rubber feet just had the worst adhesive on them, so they&#x27;re gone.<p>Until the thing just plain stopped working on me all of a sudden, it was great.')
