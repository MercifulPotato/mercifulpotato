I wouldn&#x27;t say having a GC is the most important facet--I&#x27;d rather have good tooling and ecosystem. Of the mainstream languages without GCs, Rust is the only one with good tooling and ecosystem (or arguable C&#x2F;C++ have &quot;good ecosystem&quot; but the tooling makes it prohibitively difficult to integrate well). Further, the other GC-less languages have a lot of other issues, such as poor error messages and bad ergonomics. Basically success correlates with having a GC, but this is a classic case of correlation != causation.')
