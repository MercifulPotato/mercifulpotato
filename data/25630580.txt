I think I understand why the Google calendar might do this. The target usage might be more for events or meetings which fit more nicely in these blocks. For usage outside of events and meetings, I want to be able to paint the calendar at whatever minute and intervals that I like. And if we&#x27;re only doing 30 minute blocks, aren&#x27;t we just doing yet another recreation of the king which is Google calendar? Seems like there&#x27;s a high bar to get people off the king, which is probably also why so many recreations have features to sync there.')
