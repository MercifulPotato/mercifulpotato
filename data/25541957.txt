I also would prefer to see an org with whitelisting and ASR enforced office over AV (if they <i>had</i> to be mutually exclusive), but alas we as an industry tell people to waste their time with things that don’t matter all to pass some checkbox security test to at least obtain some baseline. Some of this is probably greed&#x2F;scams in the case of self-appointed standards (CREST for instance) where others legitimately are at least trying to solve the problems.<p>How do we solve these issues without upskilling a bunch of people who don’t know&#x2F;care about security? Is there even a solution, or are we just bound to hit some mr robot-esk post apocalyptic scenario before people get their shit together?')
