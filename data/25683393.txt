But that&#x27;s also true for most affairs&#x2F;relationships, and according to statistics, marriages (if we consider a divorce as &quot;the marriage not working out well&quot;). And it can be awkward, like those.<p>But my point was, it&#x27;s human, and not some moral issue to condemn a person or a writer&#x27;s writing for.')
