I&#x27;ve seen other scientists, once they have something, &quot;toss it over&quot; and get the entire thing rewritten-- this isn&#x27;t really scientists owning their work.<p>Now-a-days, I do test-driven EDA, i.e. via using pytest. Write the test first that describes what you&#x27;re &quot;exploring for&quot;, and the code to document how you got it. As a bonus, an engineer can rewrite it since you&#x27;ve done them a favor and written tests they can validate.')
