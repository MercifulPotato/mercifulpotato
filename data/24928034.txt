They posted the article as if not conceding would be an appropriate reaction. I have read the article (multiple times at this point), and I have come to the same conclusion: while not outright instructing them not to concede, it is normalizing not conceding.<p>And yes, the title is incredibly leading. If it were an article about how some <i>republicans</i> may choose to not concede, the article would be titled &#x27;Why the GOP won&#x27;t concede the election&#x27;. It should have been similarly titled for the Dems, but of course, it&#x27;s not, because it&#x27;s being normalized.<p>With regards to clinton... Another commenter posted articles linking to the tweet. And you&#x27;re giving her more benefit of the doubt than trump. Trump has said he will concede if fair. You are now wondering if Clinton&#x27;s call to not concede is really just a call to not concede until the election is fairly settled while attempting to draw a difference between the two.')
