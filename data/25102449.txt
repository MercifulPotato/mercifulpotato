Item(by='barnacled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605458304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094753, text='I know this is going to sound like a typical missing-the-point HN comment (and possibly deserves to end up on n-gate) but - I do hate the trend of &#x27;xxxOS&#x27; meaning not an OS but rather a distribution of linux.<p>I think it adds confusion as there are xxxOS projects which are indeed separate OSes and it dilutes the meaning of an &#x27;OS&#x27;. Probably the GNU&#x2F;-prefix crowd find it especially egregious as the work put in to the distribution exists more so around tooling than any kernel-specific aspect.<p>From the name I expected it to be an interesting new microkernel from OpenSUSE (the concept of which surprised me) so I have direct experience of the confusion this naming convention causes :)')
