That and most OS X apps.<p>If a user can download and run the Amazon Prime app, why bother supporting Safari? The App version supports detection of VPNs, supports analytics etc...<p>Same applies with Netflix, Disney+ etc...<p>Then there are the devs which have OS X and iOS apps. Why would they maintain two code bases when now they can just support the iOS app and work on both? The app itself will be more optimal because it&#x27;s designed for ARM&#x2F;mobile so is likely newer with a cleaner architecture.')
