Here is the first paragraph of the OP (ABA Journal) article:<p>&gt; A U.S. Department of Justice lawyer argued Monday that the United States can kill its own citizens without judicial review when litigation would reveal state secrets.<p>Here is the first paragraph on the CNS article on which the ABA article is based:<p>&gt; Drawing alarm at the D.C. Circuit, a lawyer for the United States argued Monday that the government has the power to kill its citizens without judicial oversight when state secrets are involved.<p>Neither of these suggest that this is the defense attorney&#x27;s claim.  If you want to challenge the Judge&#x27;s characterization of DOJ&#x27;s position, feel free to read through their brief and come back with a legitimate argument.<p>Also, a sibling comment suggests that this should be dismissed as the decision of a single DOJ attorney, rather than the DOJ as an institution.  There&#x27;s not a chance in hell that this case isn&#x27;t being strategized, coordinated and monitored from the highest levels of the DOJ.  The idea that this would be the argument of a single, possibly rogue, prosecutor is ludicrous.')
