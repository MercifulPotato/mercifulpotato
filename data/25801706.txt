Yes, I know, Facebook, but this was before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, though I still should have known better.)<p>Sure, OpenXR : Monado and Arcan sound promising, but will they attract video game developers ?<p>Vulkan seemed extremely promising too, but without Xbox support, it currently seems to go the way of OS&#x2F;2, with no game developers directly targeting it (without even bothering with DirectX), and it being mostly used as a compatibility layer in the Steam&#x2F;Proton stack.')
