We are exempt so far, so our old-school technicians use leaded solder for cobbled-together boards that I prefer to stay away from, especially their desks.<p>AFAIK, all components&#x2F;equipment we buy is RoHS compliant and we had 0 failures from lead-free solder issues. Lots of bad connectors, cables, heat on SSDs and batteries, short circuits, power applied at inappropriate places, botched soldering on leaded! boards in an assembly house, but I don&#x27;t think we had solder issues with industrial RoHS boards. Even if we counted all unattributed component failures that could plausibly have something to do with solder (likely not), it would still be a small minority, maybe 10% of failures.<p>Lead-free solder had issues while manufacturing adapted, but most issues have been mitigated, unless you&#x27;re taking shortcuts for devices in harsh conditions. And if you really need it, there is high-reliability lead-free solder.')
