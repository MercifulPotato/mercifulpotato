It&#x27;s one of those medications that several different side effects depending on the dosage.<p>Yes, it can be used as an anti-psychotic. However, in most of the cases I&#x27;ve heard, it&#x27;s used as a sleep aid.<p>This was the case for me, too. I was on it for 10 years and ultimately went off because I grew out of my chronic insomnia. Aside from a muted personality and nightmares (the latter controlled by another medication), it was pretty fool proof and had very little consequence in my particular case.<p>As always, it depends on the person, but the blanket statement you quoted doesn&#x27;t seem fair.')
