Item(by='mmm_grayons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604762705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015467, text='&gt; these votes with &gt;60% in favor of legalization show that significant portions of America think drug-related activities are not &quot;immoral&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; and should not be criminalized.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that these aren&#x27;t the same.  People can vote for legalization while believing that recreational drug use is immoral.  I believe it&#x27;s wrong but support all drug legalization because I believe it&#x27;s the job of the state to stop aggression, not to enforce morality.')
