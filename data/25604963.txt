Basically, it&#x27;ll take a big chunk of 2021 to vaccinate everyone (at best), immunity may take a while to kick in, and while vaccines may be 90ish% effective, continuing to follow transmission reduction measures will help further mitigate spread while COVID is still prevalent, so keep it up for a couple months after the bulk of people start receiving vaccines. Not amazing, but also not indefinite, and I believe this has been the messaging for quite a while now.')
