So one doesn&#x27;t know, what to expect, especially since there is no 4-port M1 MBP, as there is no non-touchbar M1 MBP.<p>Though you might have a point with 3x3 wifi6 chipsets, I didn&#x27;t do any research whether there are any. Given the way the market went with wifi5 ones - with majority of vendors just using 2x2, this is something I should have expected.')
