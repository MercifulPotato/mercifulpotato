Also since twitch stopped preserving old videos, that number will be lower, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be on peertube. But, again, in-stream ads can&#x27;t get measured viewership and get stale for the usual twitch use ads (new hardware&#x2F;software) so you need them out of band to perform well.')
