It&#x27;s that hospitalization number that&#x27;s the worrisome.  10% of the population is way more than the hospital capacity of <i>anywhere</i> - in the U.S. we have about 1 bed for every 300 people, 0.3%.<p>Without hospitalization a fair number of the 9% that is hospitalized but won&#x27;t die will instead just die.  This is why you see death rates of close to 10% in areas like Lombardy or NYC where the hospital system was overloaded.  And even if they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re too sick to go to work.  Most industries will have serious problems if 10% of employees call in sick.  Then there are issues with people who have non-COVID illnesses (say car accidents) who won&#x27;t be able to find beds because all the hospitals are filled with COVID patients.<p>When #FlattenTheCurve came out people had very legitimate criticisms that centered around them doing the math and computing that if we flattened the curve enough to avoid overwhelming the hospital system, we&#x27;d be locked down for the next 20 years.  Realistically, the only solution was to lockdown, social distance, and wear masks long enough for a vaccine to come out, then vaccinate everyone who hadn&#x27;t already gotten it.  It looks like that&#x27;ll actually be the outcome in wealthy coastal areas like the Bay Area or New England, but in the middle of the country we&#x27;ll just overload the hospital system and see what happens.')
