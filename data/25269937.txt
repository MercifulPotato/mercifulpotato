You don’t have to operate your own equivalent services, but rather you pay for Amazon engineers to operate them on your behalf. Of course, there are some people for whom running their own services is the more appropriate scenario, but I think this is not a good default for anything more complex than a Rails app.<p>Someone will snarkily mention that Amazon services go down from time to time across an availability zone or even a whole region, and presumably this never happens on prem (I guess the idea is that Amazon engineers are well-below average?) simply because you rarely hear about it when $MomAndPopCRUDShop goes down. On that note, in my experience, customers are really sympathetic when an Amazon outage brings you down (because half of the Internet is also down) but not very sympathetic when it’s just your site that’s down.')
