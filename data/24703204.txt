Item(by='curiousllama', descendants=None, kids=[24703339], score=None, time=1602024020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702393, text='I really, really want to like this move.<p>I&#x27;ve written on HN before that the Trump admin&#x27;s revealed immigration preference is, in effect, &quot;as few immigrants as possible&quot; [1].  Every past move this administration has made with regard to visas has been ill-advised and badly executed (imo).  That they solved problem 1 (ill-advised) does not mean they&#x27;ve solved problem 2 (badly executed).<p>In that light, I can&#x27;t help but think this is just another RFE hole: &quot;you studied math and cs, and now want to work as a data scientist?  That&#x27;s not closely enough related&quot; or &quot;quantitative economics is not STEM, even though 12&#x2F;15 required courses were math, stats, and CS, and we previously approved the program&quot; (both objections I&#x27;ve heard raised in the past year, _before_ this new emphasis on degree-job relatedness).<p>This isn&#x27;t a bad policy - it may be good, even! - but I hope it gets implemented by the next administration.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23760337" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23760337</a>')
