Fascists are at least more honest (in this regard) and mostly call a empire a empire and conquest a conquest. And a war a war.<p>Socialists never call their socialist state a empire with conquest desires. And they are against war, sure, they just want the worldwide proletary revolution by force. Which just means world war.<p>And this I call sophism. Misleading, disguising real meaning of things. Welcome to 1984. Ministry of Peace, etc.')
