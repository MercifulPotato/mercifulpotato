You build it in Europe paying a generous salary of $80k.<p>Optimistic and dangerous. You will need at least a visionary person like Moxy willing to dedicate his&#x2F;her life to the project. You need a master mind to get all the security architecture right. BTW You will need an operation team and multiple servers to make sure that everything runs stable.
