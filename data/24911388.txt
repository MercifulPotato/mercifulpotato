It ignores the fact that it&#x27;s not unheard of for platforms which started out no-code later REGRESS and introduce coding features such as APIs because as it turns out, no-code is intrinsically limited in a lot of very significant ways.<p>When I use a &quot;no-code&quot; product it&#x27;s usually not more than a few months before I start using it&#x27;s API and adding small bits of code here and there to do things not natively supported by the product.  You would have to have a puritanical fervor and a lack of sense to want to eliminate all semblance of code from a product made out of code.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if after seeing you could add images to Microsoft word documents you saw an article coming out about how Written English was going to be replaced by Hieroglyphics and soon we could communicate with nothing but Emoji and talking about how the next generation won&#x27;t be literate.  The sentiment in this thread is mostly a reaction to irritating and implausible clickbait.')
