I&#x27;ve been there long time ago, it was recommended by a chiropractor. I used to have bad issues and was seeing a chiropractor 20 years ago but am doing really well now. As a matter of fact I&#x27;m in much better shape in my 40s than I was in my 20s and I don&#x27;t work out like crazy. It was all about fixing sitting&#x2F;standing and walking postures then the benefits became apparent.\nYou seem like you&#x27;re on the right path or even are in good shape yourself. Leaning on the back of the chair or supporting on the armrests teaches us to sit wrong and while maybe comfortable at the time it will soon start to mess up with the sitting posture. And sitting on the front side of the chair is a good way to sit. Also I find that bringing the keyboard as close as possible to the lap and the body (desk or keyboard extender) promotes good posture. (elbows close to the torso and body straight, head above torso not sticking out front, adjusting the screen at eye level helps with that).')
