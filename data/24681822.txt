Academic writing is taught and word choice is a part of what is taught. I started using those words in my academic writing because that’s how I was taught to write from lab courses to journal contributions.  Early in my studies professors and teaching assistants did correct single words where a more normative word was possible, so you just start writing like that to avoid any trouble.<p>There isn’t anything intrinsically evil about norms and signaling, I feel that assuming someone recognizing a structure means that structure is inherently evil is a bit presumptive.  In-group jargon usage is common and useful for some, and a hurdle to overcome for entrants, that’s it, absent any moral judgement.')
