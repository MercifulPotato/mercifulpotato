If I&#x2F;O interactions with a remote peer are (for whatever reason) <i>stalling work in the local node</i>, as far as the local node is concerned, it is I&#x2F;O bound.<p>If you own both local and remote peer, you then instrument the remote peer. In your hypothetical scenario, CPU saturation would finger the query provided, in which case you are back to correcting that code in the I&#x2F;O bound node. So, your calling&#x2F;local node was I&#x2F;O bound, and your remote&#x2F;server node was CPU bound.<p>Sometimes this very same <i>I&#x2F;O bound</i> pattern -- low cpu utilization on the client node due to blocked threads waiting on <i>I&#x2F;O</i> from remote peers -- is simply due to insufficient resources and requires changes in capacity planning.<p>Extending your hypothetical, let&#x27;s assume as the system in question (post- query optimization) is used over time, the <i>extent in data to be processed</i> grows, with the subsequent result that the optimizied query is now saturating the CPUs while supporting the same number of clients as before. Do you still insist on asserting that processing conditions of a remote peer allow for mis-characterizing the processing condition on the local nodes as &quot;CPU bound&quot;?')
