Trump is referred to as &quot;Individual #1&quot; in indictments that sent people to prison, and in the Cohen case, this is clearly Trump. That phrase becomes unsealed when prosecutors unseal it, and they&#x27;re most likely waiting for Trump&#x27;s term to be over, making it clearer he can be Federally indicted.<p>Otherwise who do you think &quot;Individual #1&quot; is?<p>So when Trump is cleared by these indictments in the future I&#x27;ll admit there was nothing provable in court. Until then we should wait to see what these existing charges do when they hit Federal court.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;937044524&#x2F;once-out-of-office-trump-faces-significant-legal-peril" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;937044524&#x2F;once-out-of-office-...</a>')
