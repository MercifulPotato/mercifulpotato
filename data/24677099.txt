They don&#x27;t need to write it, they can just use it. When there are rivaling implementations for the same feature &#x2F; concept, they can choose what they want to use. Or write their own implementation. Whatever is the right tradeoff of risk and timesaving for them, but timesaving will trump risk a lot and risk can be estimated through answering questions like &quot;How established is this open source code?&quot;, &quot;How big is the community?&quot;, &quot;How much testing is there?&quot;, &quot;Can I understand the code?&quot;<p>If there is a bug in the OSS code one project uses and the customer notices, they can report it and someone else might even fix it. If no one does in the time they need it, they have to fork and do it by themself.<p>Yes, if the code is handling data and data is corrupted, that&#x27;s some serious risk. By just choosing some more established persistence layer and having backups, this can probably be mitigated. If your data is important, maybe don&#x27;t run the latest version but wait until bugfixes are released.<p>So I would urge developers who opensource their code to establish what their users can expect.')
