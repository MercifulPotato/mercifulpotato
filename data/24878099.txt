Item(by='kbwt', descendants=None, kids=[24878191], score=None, time=1603533349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24876598, text='I am not a physicist, but the experiment does not seem convincing to me.<p>The Larmor clock doesnâ€™t measure a proper time as in spacetime distance between two events. Instead it measures the rotation of a dipole in an electromagnetic field.<p>The experimenters apply a combination of an electrostatic field (the barrier) and a magnetic field (the timer driving Larmor precession).\nIn the frame of reference of the spinning particle, this is exhibited as a sum of two electrostatic fields. The barrier is a locally uniform repulsive electrostatic field, while the the timer is a radially varying axial electrostatic field.  The particle is a dipole, tilted from the timer axis by the precession angle. When the particle tunnels through the barrier, it also tunnels through the timer field, without precessing over the tunneled distance just as the particle is not exhibiting repulsion from the barrier over the same distance.<p>This is experimentally verifiable as the amount of missed precession has a lower bound proportional to the sine of the angle between the magnetic field and the barrier.')
