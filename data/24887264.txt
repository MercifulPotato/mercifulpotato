If walking feels tiring or\nunpleasant it’s likely that one doesn’t have a good walking posture. I’ve been walking wrong a big chunk of my life until I re-learned the right way, in my 40s! It’s wonderful to walk now and don’t get tired and achy like i used to. Bad habits get so ingrained in us that it becomes extremely tricky to correct them but it is very possible to fix these and the reward very high, I have a better posture, more energy and am better in a shape than when i was younger and any back issues i had nearly vanished.')
