I grew up when dithering was simply a fact of life because of the extremely limited graphics capabilities of early computers.<p>I love the reference to Obra Dinn as the graphics remind me of very fond feelings I had for the first black and white Macintoshes. There was something wonderful about the crisp 1-bit graphics, on a monitor designed for only those two colors, that made it look &quot;better&quot; than contemporary color displays in most respects -- almost higher resolution than it actually was. It&#x27;s kind of almost impossible to replicate <i>how</i> it looked on modern color displays.<p>I didn&#x27;t experience that feeling looking at an electronic display again until the Kindle. It also had the funny side-effect of making art assets on Macintoshes a fraction of the size as on color systems, making both the software smaller, and the hard-drives hold more.<p>There&#x27;s also something somewhat unsatisfying about automatically generated dithering patterns used to recast color graphics into 1-bit b&amp;w. It seems to really take an artist&#x27;s hand to make it look beautiful. However, the author of this post ends up with some very nice examples and it&#x27;s really well written.<p>If anybody is interested in seeing how the old systems looked, and some great uses of dithering throughout, I&#x27;d recommend checking out this amazing Internet Archive Mac in a Browser - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;mac_MacOS_7.0.1_compilation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;mac_MacOS_7.0.1_compilation</a><p>You get dithering literally at the system startup background.')
