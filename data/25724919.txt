It should be done in person. In social media complex&#x2F;emotional things are being discussed in text form which causes more rift. So we need better tools video&#x2F;animation&#x2F;pictures to discuss things that are being discussed in social media. These better tools should be easy to use for common person to use and communicate.<p>I think banning things temporarily to finish Biden take presidency seems OK to me. But banning permanently means we are failing with arguments to win over people.<p>Opposing violence permanently seems OK to me, but then a law should be made for it and not left for individual company.<p>It will be also good to have a tool, which for any argument gives all the assumption being made. Such a tool can also help in communicating better.<p>In short we need better communication tools and better laws.')
