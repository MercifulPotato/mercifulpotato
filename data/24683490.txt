The majority of the data mentioned in this article have a clear application in improving user experience and customer support.<p>Sonos is an ever evolving ecosystem which works with a huge variety of services and devices, which are also constantly evolving. I was just at my parents house with sonos speakers and I could be play to them instantly from the Spotify app without any configuration or delay. It’s basically magic.<p>They are essentially operating a massive edge network for many thousands of customers to support all of these magic features and add new ones to stay competitive. When you are operating a network, you are gonna want telemetry and metrics so you know what’s working and how to improve. That’s what I believe this data is used for, which seems pretty legitimate to me. I don’t think it is some conspiracy to gather a database of WiFi network data for nefarious purposes.<p>If you don’t want the telemetry, setup you own speaker network with a rpi or something which you can operate yourself in your free time. However, most people don’t want to do that so they buy Sonos.')
