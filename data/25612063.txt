Survey after survey keeps coming out where the BMW 3 series and its countrymen are losing ground to Tesla&#x27;s Model 3, meanwhile BMW has executives who doesn&#x27;t believe that EVs are already a thing.<p>BMW has squandered a massive lead, if not in technology, at least in terms of mindshare - I remember driving an electric 3 series with DriveNow in Berlin, in 2013, even before the i3 came out. Since then they have basically deprioritized EVs and are now dead last among all the German manufacturers, preferring to be the Nokia rather than the Apple of cars.<p>What a disappointment, and this is coming from someone who grew up lusting after the clean lines of the BMWs of the early 2000s.')
