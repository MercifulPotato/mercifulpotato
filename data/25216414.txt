This helps save bit of tax and avoid scrutiny by tax department as you aren&#x27;t drastically showing a low value. When everyone does this, the property value to government&#x2F;tax agencies always appear at 80% of its actual value (the money actually being paid) for the transfer of property rights.<p>What happens to the cash portion? Usually the seller will use that cash to renovate their house or pay for other things in cash or use it for their everyday expenditure.<p>High value property here don&#x27;t fluctuate much in price and are considerably safe investment to hold and move money when you want.<p>I am in the market and I am seeing the guys with money during lockdown are getting wayyy better deal now.')
