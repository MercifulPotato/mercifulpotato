Item(by='mrlala', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608592344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499021, text='&gt;Because of limited resources in Canada they had waiting times of several years (Google can point to multiple sources), UK or Nederlands a few months<p>First, EVEN if what you are saying is true (spoiler alert- it&#x27;s not).  There are always private options if you really want to pay for it.  So your argument of &quot;there are wait times&quot; basically goes away, because if you really want something &quot;like you have now&quot;, you can pay and get it.<p>Next, what is better.. never being able to afford an elective&#x2F;non urgent surgery, or wait 4-6 weeks (or perhaps even longer) for it? The point is you will get it and not go bankrupt.<p>And if it&#x27;s urgent, you get it right away. Anything else you have heard is bullshit or has some other context you don&#x27;t realize.<p>I mean, do you realize how many people in this country are living with conditions that probably even being able to go to a doctor on a regular basis would massively improve their life? But they can&#x27;t afford it- even with &quot;insurance&quot;.<p>&gt;I hate the system in US, but at least it gives a chance to people who can afford it;<p>&gt;here, everybody is equally screwed.<p>How do those two statements make any sense? You literally just said it gives a chance to people who can afford it... then claim everybody is equally screwed.  No they aren&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s like anything else- the top maybe 10-20% have no issues with it because they can afford it.  So fuck everyone else right? The same top 10-20% who just love that the stock market booms during a pandemic because they can just continue to print more money.<p>Man your attitude pisses me off.<p>&gt;The only thing that works well here is giving birth, that is free, you can cover that by the state or federal in US too<p>The hell are you talking about? &quot;Insurance&quot; covers birth yeah, but it&#x27;ll still generally max out most peoples deductibles so it&#x27;s still thousands and thousands of dollars... and heaven forbid you have a c-section or some other complicated birth.<p>Also, I lived in the UK for a number of years.  We had so many trips to the doctor for our birth.  Cost? Fucking 0.  Yeah peoples taxes are a bit higher once you make descent money, but that&#x27;s the damn point! People who can afford it are paying into a system that makes everyone better off.<p>We should be trying to make EVERYONE AS A WHOLE better off, not only the top 10-20% which is apparently what your logic is.')
