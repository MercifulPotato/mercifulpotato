People are not actually killed for their beliefs. Rather, people are killed for their actions. Nobody can be killed simply for holding a belief, because it&#x27;s not possible for the killers to <i>tell</i> who does and does not hold the belief.<p>So, really, what you&#x27;re asking is whether people are willing to, once they start acting in a way which risks their life, continue acting in that same way. And it turns out that the vast majority of people killed by this reasoning are killed by genocide or as collateral damage of war; they&#x27;re swept away by hate and violence which they did not invite.<p>The question really should be, then, rather one is willing to risk their life for the specific action of <i>interrupting</i> those who are trying to kill others in this way. And such interruptions often turn out to not be very risky, unless the interruption is happening very late in the process, at the moment of violence. It was not risky to yell at street fascists in 2017, before they were creating so many street fights, because they were not yet strong enough to simply fight, but instead had to justify their hate before a largely non-violent crowd. Now in 2021, though, yelling at street fascists is dangerous, but referring them to the FBI is relatively safe. What was acceptable praxis has changed.<p>From this POV, we must recontextualize your original message. Who is pushing and shoving? Fascists. Who are they pushing and shoving? Undesired minorities. By what means are you allowed to be selfish? Well, you might not be in an affected class! This is a failure of solidarity. You must be willing to defend the rights of others, if you expect them to defend your rights as well.')
