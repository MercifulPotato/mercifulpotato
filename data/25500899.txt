Seems like itâ€™s doing its job.<p>That is it&#x27;s intended use, yes, but it does not appear to be how it&#x27;s being used.  The article even says those 3,000 people were sent orders to prove they <i>did not cheat</i>.  That sure seems like you fail unless you can prove the software wrong.<p>Unless you&#x27;re claiming that they had human review of those and eliminated some, in which case the software flagged over 1 in 3 people for cheating.<p>Either way, the software is bad.  At the very least, there&#x27;s  a very high false positive rate.  You would have to be really sure you&#x27;re going to fail the bar, or absurdly stupid, to cheat at the bar.  I&#x27;m sure being caught cheating is effectively a lifetime ban from being a lawyer, so you&#x27;ve wasted all that time in school.  I would be utterly stunned if anywhere close to 1 in 3 law students cheated on the bar, and if that&#x27;s the case, it should immediately trigger an ethics review by the bar.')
