It tends to eventually cause problems when one implementation converts numbers to doubles, another to either doubles or longs depending on whether they have a . or e, and another which converts them to bignums (or passes them as strings to the caller).<p>One should remember that any sane application will be parsing the config file into internal data structures and validating it anyway so it gets little benefit from the numbers being already “parsed”.<p>There are also issues when something looks numeric but doesn’t parse (eg 1.2.3, 3&#x2F;2, 12in, 4h30m2s, 2:30, 2020-02-29, etc). One way to deal with these is a tokenisation rule like in Common Lisp: if it is a valid number syntax then treat it as a number, otherwise it’s a symbol, but this can lead to issues (eg you would need to know that when your number needs more than float precision or otherwise doesn’t follow the rules, it should be in quotes. It seems crazy to pass that detail on to the poor sod who has to write the config file).')
