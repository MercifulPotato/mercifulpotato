There is no way that a government-sponsored secret hardware backdoor would get any executives in trouble.<p>SEC rules are not a reasonable protection - or even consideration - when dealing with the US spying apparatus. If there was a hardware backdoor program:<p>(1) There would be a secret exemption to SEC rules.<p>(2) There would probably be a secret &quot;we will end you&quot; threat if the execs revealed details. Snowden &amp; Assange would be mentioned.<p>(3) Even ignoring those two points, the rules would be ignored and changed later if there were any legal difficulties.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;senate-endorses-retroactive-fisa-immunity-for-warrantless-wiretapping&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;senate-endorses-retroactive-fisa-i...</a>')
