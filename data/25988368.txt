As usual, &quot;the 1%&quot; are doing extremely well, but the vast majority of app developers are not making a lot of money. Apple&#x27;s recent small business program is tacit acknowledgement from Apple that many developers are struggling financially and cannot afford even the 30% cut.<p>In comparison, the so-called &quot;gig economy&quot; is also extremely large, perhaps even larger in total dollars than the App Store, but that doesn&#x27;t mean individual gig workers are doing well.')
