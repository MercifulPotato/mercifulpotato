Item(by='todd8', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605023573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25036036, text='I started programming in the days of punchcards. Since that time I have tried more editors and IDE&#x27;s than most people: ed, teco on teletypes, XEDIT on IBM 3270 terminals running on IBM Mainframes, CDC 6600 editors running on the Kronos OS, the editors on the University of Illinois Plato system, TextMate, Sublime Text, Jetbrain&#x27;s IDEs, Eclipse, Xcode, Visual Studio and VS Code, and countless other less important editors and IDEs.<p>The idea that I use Vim and Emacs because I don&#x27;t know better is simply uninformed. I use Vim because no other editor connects my mind so directly to the code I am working on, as fast as I can think of where I want to be in the code or where I need to make the change, I am there and made the edit with just a few keystrokes.<p>I use Emacs because of its phenominal collection of packages: <i>org-mode</i> for writing text, outlines, interactive agendas, literate-programming; <i>magit</i> for git,  <i>auctex</i> for composing LaTeX, <i>tramp</i> for editing remote files over ssh; <i>dired</i> for viewing and organizing my directory contents and hierarchies. In addition to the hundreds of commands and built in packages there are over 4500 contributed packages that provide amazing facilities. All of this in a self documenting, fully programmable system.<p>I pay for a subscription to the full set of Jetbrain&#x27;s IDEs, they&#x27;re great and worth far more to me than the much more expensive Adobe subscription that I have but use very little. PyCharm and CLion are great tools, and I&#x27;ve done most of my recent Java using IntelliJ. However, for writing code other than C++ and Java, I find myself most comfortable in Emacs.<p>I believe that I could put together the right set of packages to make C++ or Java development on Emacs a satisfactory choice, but one of the weaknesses of Emacs is its programability and extreme flexibility--at some point you have to stop sharpening your axe and start chopping and here having a Jetbrains IDE definitely pulls ahead.')
