Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[24904745, 24904923], score=None, time=1603776342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886659, text='The article is specifically targeting people in the Pacific Northwest (presumably of the US, though parts of PNW include parts of Canada). The US is prone to thinking &#x27;You go outside in nice weather&quot; and this article is aimed at rebutting that notion and explicitly saying &quot;You can enjoy the great outdoors in any kind of weather.&quot;<p>I live in a small town in Washington. Not long after I moved here, I saw a video that listed this town as one of the ten worst cities to live in for Washington state. It listed high unemployment, high drug use and the big zinger was fewest sunny days.<p>I hear all kinds of trash talk about the weather out here which both amuses and aggravates me because I moved here for the very temperate weather. I live without a car and it rarely gets below freezing here and it rarely gets all that hot. It rains a lot and I wish there were more awnings in the downtown area, but the rain tends to be light, so I don&#x27;t care that much. I grew up in Georgia which has terrible, terrible storms on a regular basis.<p>The article also explicitly states that Seattle has &quot;deep Scandinavian roots.&quot; So it is trying to appeal to locals in a way that they should be able to readily identify with and embrace.<p>This is not a generic article. It is very much a localized article with a particular audience and time and place in mind. And for that reason, the references make a lot of sense.')
