They&#x27;re no longer a reliable partner and nobody seriously believes we can rely on them if anything does happen. So we&#x27;re down to France and Germany, and I&#x27;m not sure Germany&#x27;s military is particularly competent. The way I see it, Russia is far more efficient at defense spending than most of the EU countries, so they&#x27;re a legitimate threat even if they &quot;only&quot; match France in spending.')
