Much of the trouble in the industry is because Google embraced the idea that writers and artists were people to be fleeced by selling advertisements without sharing anything. The approach in the Google books project was especially egregious. They just went ahead and made free copies of someone&#x27;s hard work all without permission. The engineers got rich. The lawyers threw up endless pettifoggery and the writers got nada.<p>The Google News project was another example. While Marissa Mayer was telling shareholders that the project was worth $100m to the corporation, the journalists who were putting their butts on the line were getting nothing. Google just kept the revenue.<p>What is also shameful is the way the company has funded, often secretly, non-profits and academics that undermine the intellectual property rights of hard working creators while celebrating the pirates who contribute nothing.<p>Journalists should have nothing to do with these leeches.')
