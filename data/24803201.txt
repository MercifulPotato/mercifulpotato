I think two realities are being discussed under the same term.<p>The way I see it, hospitalized can mean: I have great insurance and I went into the hospital for treatment because I felt some symptoms. I was feeling 80% well when I went in, I was only there because the doctors wanted to be thorough and check my vitals overnight.<p>It can also mean: I don&#x27;t have insurance and I waited until I was half past dead to go to the hospital because I have bad&#x2F;no insurance. By the time I got to the hospital I couldn&#x27;t even breath. I went straight to the ICU.<p>Both are &#x27;hospitalized&#x27;. But I don&#x27;t think the two examples represent the same reality. I&#x27;d imagine Remdesivir working very well on the first and not very well on the second due to viral load concerns mentioned in other parts of the commentary to this article.')
