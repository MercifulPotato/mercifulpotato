The real issue with masks is that (a) many people don&#x27;t wear them properly (I routinely see people with it only over their mouth, not their nose, or with a huge gap between their face and the mask) and (b) anything that covers your face qualifies as a &quot;mask&quot;, no matter how coarse the weave of whatever material it is made of.')
