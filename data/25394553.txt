Doesn&#x27;t mean you should get to silence them.<p>A bullshit peddler named Dr. Atkins was the only guy in the 90&#x27;s saying that eggs were good for you.  The rest of the establishment physicians said eggs were bad for you, guacamole was bad for you, all fat was bad, eat more pasta.<p>They were all wrong, Atkins was right (when it comes to eggs.)  But if Youtube had existed, people like you would have said he was dangerous and demanded he be removed.  That&#x27;s the problem:\nHow do you know the people you think are quacks are actually quacks?  What about when the establishment is wrong.  The Australian doctor who claimed ulcers were caused by bacteria was silenced, mocked, and ridiculed for decades.  He was right, as we know now.<p>Yann LeCunn was mocked and ridiculed for his neural networks.  He was outright rejected from conferences, and papers ignored, despite having groundbreaking results that set new benchmarks, because the established CS folks had decided that neural nets were garbage in the 80&#x27;s.  They were wrong, he was right.<p>But it&#x27;s cool, I trust you to make decisions for me on what I can hear.')
