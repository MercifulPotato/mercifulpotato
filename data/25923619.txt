Item(by='Gene_Parmesan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611715197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922281, text='Unfortunately every person who writes advice about how to break into the industry tells beginners to contribute to OSS as one way to gain experience&#x2F;a foot in the door. Most of them explicitly list things like fixing typos as easy ways to get a few under your belt.<p>I can understand the sentiment - it can be quite an anxious experience for a new dev to try to contribute major changes, so theoretically these are low-risk warm-ups. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good advice. It assumes that any contribution is welcomed by the maintainer, no matter how small (many explicitly claim this) and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. Small changes like that that have no impact on functionality, stability, performance, etc. just seem like they would take time and energy from the maintainer with only very marginal upside.<p>And unfortunately, it also makes the beginner look like someone who&#x27;s just trying to pad their github &quot;resume&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s for sure what&#x27;s happening here for you but it&#x27;s certainly a possibility.')
