Such a capability might have been a goal of the original MK-ULTRA project. Its original purpose was, by the evidence, to test, on the US public, methods of thought control. An early project, to get people to believe the CIA were trying to use ESP for spying, was a <i>rousing</i> success: to this day, a strong majority of Americans still believe it.<p>For another application of their methods, consider the ground-swell of support for invading Iraq, despite every scrap of actual evidence showing that its <i>casus belli</i> was completely fallacious. QAnon might be one of their projects; it&#x27;s weird enough, but just as likely someone else&#x27;s.
