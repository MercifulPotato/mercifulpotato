Since the lower receiver of an AR-15 is legally the &quot;firearm&quot;, it&#x27;s the only part you need to create yourself to bypass infringements. The lower receiver is also not much of a pressure-bearing component, so making it on a 3D printer offers few trade offs. There are other prints available for countries with even more restrictive infringements, where you can print or assemble the entire weapon from unregulated parts (which are commonly used in other situations, making them difficult or impossible to regulate).')
