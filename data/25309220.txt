Too many totally ignore the point.  Even among the better ones, Iâ€™m unsatisfied.  There is something different in the way you tell it.<p>I have looked at the beginning of your video and switched to your text.  It looks like you explain things differently from other people, which feels like you aren&#x27;t afraid of going straight to what is important. Even the arxiv link from a different author feels promising.  Thanks again!')
