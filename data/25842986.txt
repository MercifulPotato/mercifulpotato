They used cloudinary for image hosting and were paying some insane amount for image hosting. I think their cloudinary bill was $8000&#x2F;month or something. The client didn&#x27;t even know that was expensive. They just saw it as a cost of doing business, alongside their cloudflare bill and so on. (And what they were paying us.)<p>It took work over several weeks to convince them that that was a ripoff. I think their business people eventually called up cloudinary and negotiated a better rate, but by that point I was annoyed by the whole situation. The site used cloudinary&#x27;s HTTP based API from the browser. I configured cloudflare to redirect any request hitting example.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;... to act as a caching proxy to cloudinary&#x27;s actual servers. Unsurprisingly, that one configuration change made their cloudinary bill drop to about 1&#x2F;20th what it was. When the client was billed we got a panicked phone call asking why it was so low, and if something was broken on their site.<p>Anyway, tldr; lots of folks out there have no idea what a service like cloudinary should cost. Apparently more than enough to make cloudinary a profitable business.')
