Voter rolls are regularly audited by state election commissions to remove people who have died and&#x2F;or moved out of the state, and there&#x27;s no evidence of a non-negligible number of fake people making their way onto voter registration rolls. When two ballots are returned for the same person, or if a ballot is returned for someone who is known to be dead, etc, it prompts an investigation into how that happened. Not every registered voter votes, but by and large people register to vote because they intend to vote, so it&#x27;s infeasible for a systematic effort to submit fraudulent ballots to avoid colliding with the real votes of the people being impersonated.<p>&gt; And even if it was, shouldn&#x27;t the fraudsters be prosecuted?<p>They are prosecuted.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-fix&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;01&#x2F;0-000002-percent-of-all-the-ballots-cast-in-the-2016-election-were-fraudulent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-fix&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;01&#x2F;0-...</a><p>And really, &quot;grotesque&quot;?
