The database is also in high availability mode and has daily backup scattered all over the various regions.<p>All this is being managed by the cloud provider we are using.<p>One of the regulator has asked us to maintain a “local backup” of the database. When I asked what the reason is they just said “we require it”.<p>Since creating another copy of the database outside the managed environment increases risk I told them “based on my assessment we are deliberately increasing risk of a vulnerability, it’s my job to report and you to sign that you have acknowledged the increase in risk based on assessment”.... No response from the regulator that this is now required.<p>I can relate to what these guys are going through mostly I find regulators just read an old book and since they are usually regulators not engineers they use the rule book to make engineering decisions. While regulators have to follow a book and its their job its also important for them to understand that every system is different and that they are not experts, and that the book they follow are not always up-to-date.<p>Sometimes the regulators job is also to say “let me check on that” and find another expert or better yet consult with the person who wrote the book to “update” and improve on the “standard” to ensure that the highest standard is being propagated to all the parties they manage.')
