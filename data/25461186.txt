It&#x27;s normal looking traffic coming from the major CDNs, youtube, netflix, amazon, hulu, etc. And then from the big cloud providers (amazon aws, google&#x2F;gcp, azure, etc)<p>For a small ISP that&#x27;s purely buying transit, once they establish a presence at a major IX point and can peer with some huge content sources, it&#x27;ll drop their transit bill in half almost immediately.<p>Then you do have porno content coming from huge hosting companies&#x2F;entities such as Choopa.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peeringdb.com&#x2F;net&#x2F;813" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peeringdb.com&#x2F;net&#x2F;813</a><p>It&#x27;s actually pretty rare to peer directly with a porn host, if I had to guess at it, I&#x27;d say most of the traffic is coming in via transits such as hurricane, cogent, telia, ntt, etc.<p>one note, ISP traffic isn&#x27;t measured in disk space measurements like terabytes or petabytes, it&#x27;s measured in present tense Mbps or Gbps.')
