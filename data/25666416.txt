Several democratic senators are in favor of Puerto Rico statehood. (As is the territory of Puerto Rico, but putting that aside...) Several democratic senators are in favor of immigration amnesty, usually in the form of &quot;squatter&#x27;s rights&quot; or DREAM. Several democratic senators are in favor of less-restrictive immigration policies, essentially to reduce illegal immigration by making legal immigration easier and at capacity: Legalizing the status quo, in other words. These are all defensible policy positions on their own merits.<p>I&#x27;m too cynical to believe that these aren&#x27;t favored in part because they would help their chances are re-election, but it&#x27;s also not <i>necessary</i>, as a republican government and a majority of republican state legislatures could not stop the entire federal government flipping democrat.')
