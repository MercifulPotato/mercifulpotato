AWS can already terminate you at any point. In this case, they&#x27;ve very much not explicitly done that, and instead have given Parler warnings and clear requests to take specific actions to prevent their account from being terminated.<p>Parler has decided not to cooperate, and Amazon is taking the next step, which is terminating that relationship.<p>Amazon is a business, and can choose to do business with just about anyone they&#x27;d like, based on their stated terms. This isn&#x27;t some weird turning point, and in fact, the email provided shows that Amazon isn&#x27;t making this decision out of nowhere.')
