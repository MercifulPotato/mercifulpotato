Why did I make a claim about what you did over the weekend at all other than to signal to you about it?  And of course I care what you think, because that&#x27;s the entire point of social signalling.<p>I could say your entire response was a signal itself, and you&#x27;re not consciously aware of how signalling is driving your behavior.  At this point the theory becomes useless.<p>A good theory has hypotheses that can be (in)validated.')
