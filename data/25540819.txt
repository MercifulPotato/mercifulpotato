That data is literally given away to everyone but some people or organizations can&#x27;t have it? If you want to control access to it, maybe at least require people to register before they can see it? Is it even <i>proprietary</i> if it&#x27;s public with no access control whatsoever?<p>This for-profit internet is just really such a parallel universe to me.')
