I guess the closest you could pull in Christian religiosity there is the dabbling with Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.<p>&quot;Out of Control&quot;, Kelly&#x27;s first book, is still available online, and I think is a clearer idea of the genesis of his thinking that led to the Technium than trying to scry him based on his faith. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kk.org&#x2F;outofcontrol&#x2F;contents.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kk.org&#x2F;outofcontrol&#x2F;contents.php</a>')
