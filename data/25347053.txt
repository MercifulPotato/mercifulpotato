Imagine spatially aware zoom calls, being able to turn towards or lean it to someone&#x27;s voice.<p>I love high quality audio, but I&#x27;d pay $550 for a better video conferencing experience.<p>As an aside, I wonder what the latency is on these? Many BT headsets can have a 200+ms latency, which contributes to how horrible video calls are.')
