Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612088496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977592, text='&gt; The reason why freedom of speech is important, is because we want ideas that are counter to mainstream narratives to be able to set root in society.<p>We want ideas that <i>have value</i> to take root in society, irregardless of their relationship to the mainstream. Not all ideas that are counter to mainstream narratives have positive societal value, nor do all ideas have equivalent value to all others. Alchemy does not have equivalent value to chemistry. The belief that the earth is flat is not equivalent to the belief that it is round, even if neither is perfectly accurate. The Nazis were certainly outside the mainstream, but were also wrong, and evil, and and having their ideas take root again now that they&#x27;re no longer mainstream is never going to be a good idea.<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene (to pick an extreme topical example) has the right to believe in QAnon and Jewish space lasers, but everyone else has the right to call out her racist paranoid BS, and one force of speech must inevitably consequence the other. Freedom of speech that doesn&#x27;t allow the freedom to discern quality of speech isn&#x27;t really freedom, that&#x27;s just having society act as a dumb terminal for whatever noise comes its way.')
