The first time she mentioned the drug to a doctor he just snippily corrected her on the pronunciation but nothing else. My wife carefully documented everything the paper said in a “Cliff’s Notes” sort of version with links. The next meeting we had with them they were much less hostile, it was like night and day. I guess they were impressed by her careful note taking. Even so the doctor who did prescribe it sort of acted like it was his idea, my wife kind of rolled her eyes and just let him keep thinking that.<p>The way we think about it is a doctor has what, 15 minutes (if that) to spare thinking about our daughter languishing in the NICU. My wife spent literally all day, all night, ruminating and worrying about her. I had just started a new job, (I was unemployed when she was born!) and honestly poured myself into that position, maybe as a way to avoid living at the hospital (I’m not proud of it but that’s what happened). But it is weird we had to get the pulmonologist to prescribe a medication that’s something the neurologist should probably be prescribing.')
