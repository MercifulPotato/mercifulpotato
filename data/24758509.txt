In general, any task that requires you to allocate several hours of consecutive time with no interruptions (and coding is definitely like this) is much better from home.<p>So much better in fact that I wish I could continue to work from home at least a couple of days a week even after covid is over!<p>I suspect a part of this is due to the fact that developers&#x2F;individual contributors are more used to using tools like git, ssh etc. that makes the transition almost seamless; my workflow is completely independent of even my machine, I could pick up any brand new laptop on amazon and I&#x27;d be productive within minutes. Maybe less familiarity with the technology stack is a significant source of additional attrition.')
