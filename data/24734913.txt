These moves they have been making around fact checking, censoring things etc, make this problem <i>worse</i>.  They&#x27;re trying to increase people&#x27;s trust in twitter, which they shouldn&#x27;t be doing, they should be actively trying to do the opposite, and they <i>will</i> fail to remove all of the misinformation.<p>So the result will be that people will still see misinformation, but they&#x27;ll trust it more.  It&#x27;s the exact opposite.')
