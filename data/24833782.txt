And yet, in the USA, your right-wing uncle probably isn&#x27;t that interested in the truth. And the new generation of identity-politics liberals are the generation who have grown up taught in an academic world infested with post-modernism; they are also less interested in truth, but to their credit, very interested in improving the world.
