Because there are hundreds of them, especially since the logical conditions spec.<p>In my own Browser I&#x27;m trying to &quot;fake&quot; behaviours, so that it looks like an e.g. Chrome useragent is browsing the website. I&#x27;m also filtering a lot of CSS and HTML that could be abused to track users which is, honestly, a lot.<p>Even the Accept header alone is enough to identify the engine. If you then use a clever webfont you&#x27;ll have the navigator&#x27;s version and OS identified due to antialiasing behaving differently...<p>I&#x27;m also curious how you evaluated the fingerprintability...is there a project that you were using for that, which someone could maybe test their own browser against?')
