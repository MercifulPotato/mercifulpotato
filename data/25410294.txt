One flatlander might report the observation of a circle, while the other might say they saw a rectangle.  Both have observed part of the truth, but different parts of it, and to a flatlander it may seem these observations are irreconcilable.  A third flatlander who decides to simply average the observations together into a rounded rectangle is more wrong than either of the others.  The key to resolving the apparent contradiction is recognizing that the truth exists in a dimensional space higher than the flatlander is capable of perceiving.')
