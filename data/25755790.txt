Yet a landlord isn&#x27;t allowed to arbitrarily throw you out of your house on a moments notice. Even if your lease is on a month-to-month basis, the law requires giving the tenant a reasonable timeframe to let them find new accommodations.<p>This is false equivalency.  AWS didn&#x27;t &quot;arbitrarily&quot; kick them out.  If you are destroying the property you live in or using it to commit or facilitate illegal acts, a landlord can ABSOLUTELY evict you immediately in all sorts of states.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arizonalandlord.net&#x2F;immediate-eviction-action-in-arizona" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arizonalandlord.net&#x2F;immediate-eviction-action-in...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipropertymanagement.com&#x2F;laws&#x2F;missouri-eviction-process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipropertymanagement.com&#x2F;laws&#x2F;missouri-eviction-proce...</a><p>AWS gave them the time agreed to in the contract to remove offending content and present a plan for continued moderation to prevent the same thing from happening a second time. They wouldn&#x27;t even commit to moderating the speech Amazon told them was in violation of the TOS.<p>I think AWS can very easily make the argument that continuing to host Parler when they&#x27;re allowing calls for violence would do significant harm to their business.')
