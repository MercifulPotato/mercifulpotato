Sales of cars is proportionate to population size more than economy size in wealthy Western countries.<p>Honda will obviously have many EVs on the market for Californians (and other Americans, and Europeans, and Asians, and every other market that&#x27;s banning petrol and diesel cars) to buy, but they&#x27;re also going to continue to make and sell fossil fuel powered cars for <i>long</i> time in countries that don&#x27;t have the electrical infrastructure to support electrification of civilian vehicles.')
