Kaczynski definitely put his finger on something fundamental about the impact of technology on society. Among his fans are left-wing anarcho-primitivists as well as right wing eco-fascists and while they have fundamentally different views of tribalism and identity there&#x27;s a lot of overlap between them, and it&#x27;s not unknown to see people in one group drift into the other.<p>Kaczynski has also continued to write while in prison and his work is thought-provoking notwithstanding the paradoxes involved (eg how technology has facilitated the spread of his anti-technological ideas). His views don&#x27;t fit neatly into any political category.')
