They literally tell you nothing. They might as well put an empty space as what has changed.<p>The same goes for other companies that put useless messages:<p>- Netflix and the weekly updates (what are they possibly updating about choosing and streaming video and seeking to a point in time that requires WEEKLY updates????)<p>- Slack and their smarmy update reasons.<p>- All Google apps.<p>Nobody would accept if they released cars with the same lack of highlighting of new features. &quot;It&#x27;s better!&quot;')
