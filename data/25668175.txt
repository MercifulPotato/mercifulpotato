NYT and CNN have a much smaller number of people publishing news, who are hired and paid for their work. Twitter is just a host with a block button. For example Twitter doesn&#x27;t have a sign-up hiring interview so anyone could have an account. Another distinction is that Twitter is publish first, ban later while newspapers are filtering before publishing.<p>Demanding a rule that works for few people to scale to hundreds of millions is wishful thinking. It&#x27;s a different situation requiring different treatment.')
