Of course there were people who disagreed but they were at the margins and their voices were isolated to a few forums most people never heard of.<p>A demagogue came along and used mass media platforms to destabilize the norms of civil society and give a large platform to previously marginalized views. Being able to air those views on mainstream outlets perpetuates the problem and shifts norms.<p>We need to at least try to put this genie back in the bottle.  Most people will revert back to previous mainstream views. The significant segment needs to go back to an insignificant segment. That insignificant segment will be angry that they didn&#x27;t win, and likely some of them will be violent. But they&#x27;ve always been that way anyway.')
