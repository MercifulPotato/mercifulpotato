It&#x27;s basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data, inspired by the &quot;fuzzy finder&quot; search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, ⌘T in Atom, ⌘P in VSCode, etc.). It’s ridiculously fast - searches return in &lt;10ms and we don’t warehouse your data - it stays on your own machine in an encrypted database.<p>We&#x27;re now a venture-backed startup with a really strong team working on this every day, but I originally started building it after seeing information and data scattered across 20+ clouds even amongst a small team at my last job. I saw how Slack had applied a lot of polish on top of IRC and how APIs were reaching a sweet spot of standardization and maturation and decided the time was right to build something like this for other knowledge workers (and to bring the search pattern in our IDEs to all the other places we spend time as engineers).<p>We have 30+ integrations now, and I use it everyday to:\n* Quickly jump to our PRs in GitHub\n* Get into Zoom meetings with 2 clicks rather than digging into calendar events for the meeting link.\n* Instantly get back to Google Docs and Clubhouse tickets (we also support Jira, Trello, and Asana along with most of the tools your product team lives out of)<p>The product is free and I&#x27;d love any feedback - you can download the app here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcommande.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcommande.com</a>')
