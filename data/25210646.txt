Kind of like Laravel Livewire[1], but for React.<p>Ever since I first heard about Livewire a few weeks ago I had in my head &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t someone do this for React in Node, using ReactDOMServer?&quot; Perhaps now they have (again, if I understood it correctly)<p>EDIT: Actually on second thoughts, I&#x27;m not sure it is like Livewire. I&#x27;m not sure Remix handles interactivity in the browser at all. Livewire does, sending back and forth the things that need to change, without you needing to think about it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;laravel-livewire.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;laravel-livewire.com&#x2F;</a>')
