I can also cast to my TV and still use the remote in the Youtube app when casting (for example). It&#x27;s a pretty good UX and the C9 has enough compute resources for everything to be very snappy. I could drop more on something like the nVidia Shield, but I already have an HTPC hooked up to my TV, running a Plex server as well as letting me use MPC-HC if I need to.<p>I&#x27;ve made my peace with the telemetry ramifications though I have not accepted a number of privacy policy notices so things aren&#x27;t all that bad.')
