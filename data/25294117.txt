Zero tolerance policy on noise and cellphone screens (which they&#x27;ve actually enforced when I&#x27;ve been there).<p>Food prices are comparable to other theater chains, but the _quality_ is much higher. Real food (not concession stand quality), adult milkshakes, etc. Seats are lazy boy quality recliners.<p>Plus the ushers shimmy around on the floors to come take your order and bring it to your seat. You get these little menu cards you can fill out during the movie. The ushers look for folks who have a card ready and come grab it.')
