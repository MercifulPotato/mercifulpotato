Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not really possible to find real stats since they&#x27;re hidden by individual OEMs and insurance companies.  But you would need to compare comparably priced modern cars with standard ADAS features to Teslas with Autopilot to get a datapoint worth talking about for the general case.  You would also need to look at where Autopilot is engaged (mostly highways where accidents are rare in general) vs. not engaged (mostly city streets where accidents are common) to draw any real conclusions about safety.')
