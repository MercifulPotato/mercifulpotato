In most cases this works reasonably well.<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve read about the flu surveillance networks as well. However, these work well in theory, but not always in practice right? The past few years where I&#x27;ve seen the doctor in the UK, they&#x27;ve mostly dismissed anything wrong with me by just giving me some minor medication (this is probably in accordance to meet the waiting target), so things can always be missed out. I mean, there were reports that says the UK and US are best equipped to handle a pandemic, but in reality, we are seeing otherwise.<p>&gt; Because the first large scale outbreak occurred in Wuhan in December 2019<p>I would personally say that the outbreak in Wuhan is not really that large scale when you compare it to what&#x27;s been happening to the rest of the world. The largest scale of it is the media coverage of it since China did a full lockdown of the city. What&#x27;s even more is that COVID did not seem spread to much of other parts of the country.<p>&gt; Look - I guess the European origin is possible. But it&#x27;s a pretty out-there theory and it needs some pretty extraordinary evidence<p>I had been sceptical about the origin being anywhere outside of China as well initially. But given that more and more news of the possible early detection in COVID in much of Europe before December 2019 (France, UK, Italy and Spain), it does seem to me like there is a greater possibility that COVID could have originated from outside of China. Again, outside of Wuhan COVID was pretty much non-existant in other Chinese cities, even though Wuhan was only locked down late January 2020.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m not saying COVID-19 definitely came from Europe or didn&#x27;t originate from China, all I&#x27;ve been saying is to have an open mind instead of immediate finger pointing, which as my original comment alluded to, was what the Australian government did.')
