It REALLY makes a difference if you are into 22fps or 4-4-2 pulldown with movies.  Every once in a while Costco has the Sony OLEDs at the same price with the LG&#x27;s (normally the Sony&#x27;s are more) - that&#x27;s the time to buy!  Same OLED panel, but Sony&#x27;s video processing is better so if you catch them when they are price the same pick the Sony!')
