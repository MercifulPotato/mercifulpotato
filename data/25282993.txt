You can take it much further by heating&#x2F;cooling some thermal mass, and drawing on that mass when the electricity is cheaper.<p>That mass can simply be a pile of stones in a box with some ductwork added. It&#x27;s hard to find a cheaper &quot;battery&quot; technology than a box of rocks.<p>Frankly, I think people are way too focused on batteries and are overlooking the rather obvious.')
