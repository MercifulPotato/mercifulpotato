Years ago, I maintained a Java desktop application, using SWT as the graphics library (not even mentioned by the post author which is weird.) It wasn&#x27;t a big application, but also not stupidly trivial. It would start fast, run fast, and didn&#x27;t need much RAM at all.<p>There are of course examples of slow, heavy java applications, but I don&#x27;t think it has to be that way. I&#x27;m not totally sure what I did differently aside from consider my dependencies (e.g. using a lightweight dependency injection framework rather than something like Spring), but it&#x27;s definitely not a given that Java desktop applications have to use a bucketload of RAM.')
