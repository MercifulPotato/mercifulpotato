People would almost certainly die en route to hear your pontifications. There&#x27;s zero comparison with a browser address bar.<p>Even if you posit the top of Mt. Washington rather than a peak in the as-yet undiscovered (by northern Europeans) Rockies, the difference remains unchanged in more or less every essential way.<p>And actually, &quot;town square&quot; isn&#x27;t defined at all, de facto or de jure. In the USA, there&#x27;s essentially no standing right to speak in a public place. You can&#x27;t be stopped based on <i>what</i> you say, but you can routinely be stopped from speaking at all.<p>This is, perversely, one of the things that makes London&#x27;s Hyde Park Corner so unique: there is an accepted policy (not law) that you can&#x27;t be stopped from speaking there unless engaged in incitement. This fallacy of &quot;the public square&quot; is just that - a fallacy. Since independence (and certainly before it), there was no freedom to speak in a public space without being blessed by some authority.<p>It was only the printing press that was really &quot;free speech&quot; , in the sense that you could print anything and make it available and the 1st amendment could not prevent access to it.<p>And btw, &quot;kicked your teeth in&quot; as a description of that thread exchange seems like a great reason to avoid further interaction with you. ghaff was supporting my POV, and spoonjim&#x27;s comment was downvoted (and incidentally wrong). Even if they had both disagreed with me and presented a cogent argument supporting their positions, &quot;kicking teeth in&quot; is a particularly violent metaphor that I prefer to see left unused.')
