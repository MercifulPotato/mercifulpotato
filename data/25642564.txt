A few important points the article still missed.<p>1) Bitcoin Core (BTC) is not Bitcoin (capital B) according the the original White Paper and the subsequent writings of Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin Core GitHub repo was hijacked years ago, socially engineered by Greg Maxwell the his company Blockstream away from its original maintainer Gavin Andresen.<p>2) Bitcoin was designed to be Digital Cash, with low fees and instant transactions capable of competing with Visa. After wrestling the GitHub repo away from Andresen Blockstream funded developers and paid trolls started promoting an idea to limit the block size to 1 mb in direct opposition to what Satoshi intended.<p>3) Bitcoin (BTC) is a failed project by its very own definition, however, the original goals of Bitcoin live on in other projects like Monero, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and many others.<p>4) Bitcoin (BTC) is at best the worlds greatest digital Ponzi scheme and is a far cry from the fast and cheap Peer-to-Peer Digital Cash Satoshi built. Anyone pushing BTC today is either a scammer or too uninformed to know better.')
