Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25807180], score=None, time=1610843831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806578, text='This is a pretty biased take from that random person on Twitter that ArsTechnica is quoting (this is all sourced from just this person&#x27;s tweets). The proposed bill has value in terms of gauging legislative support, inviting copycat bills, in terms of building momentum across states, and ultimately leading to a better piece of legislation that meaningfully protects citizens from big tech censorship. It doesn&#x27;t have to be viable or &quot;succeed&quot; in the first iteration. You see this tactic (passing something that has no viability) all the time from legislators and activists that are left-leaning in states like California&#x2F;Oregon&#x2F;Washington, and now right-leaning states&#x27; politicians are adopting the same strategy as well.')
