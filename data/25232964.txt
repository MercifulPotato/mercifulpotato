I am a backyard mechanic. Honda and Toyota both hold their value and that is for a reason. Tesla is shiny and new right now and popular but if people start to think of them as less then reliable that can cost them greatly. Suspension failing in 4 years tells me either poor design or poor material choice. Either way it was a bad choice however it got there. Is Tesla going to become the next Dodge and design everything to fail just outside of warranty? Although maybe not news worthy definitely of interest and being a new company deserve this kind of scrutiny. I remember but can not find the source way back Tesla was talking about a one price car where you just paid “x” dollars and he would worry about the insurance and maintenance I believe it was for 20years. Like a promise you pay us this much and as long as you don’t crash will get 20 years of driving or they will fix it. That is confidence in a product. Now I really wish I could find the article this was discussed.')
