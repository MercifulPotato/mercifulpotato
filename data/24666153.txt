Though most children, at least when I was growing in up in the 90s are in far better shape than most adults. Sure a 12 kid couldn&#x27;t help move an oak dresser but they are better overall physical shape. If adults were just active playing sports, I&#x27;d suspect obesity and related health issues to decrease with mental health improving.<p>I know there are many here on HN that will loathe the idea of playing sports.')
