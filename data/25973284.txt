The only way to remediate this issue is to install InTune and the corresponding corporate security office&#x27;s profile so it can enforce our policy on the device. If you qualify for our corporate device program, we will cover the cost of the device and data plan.<p>Sincerely,\nCTO<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s very common at the largest public corporations and most corporate r&amp;d groups in the US. It&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t already do black box development or have strict vpn only enforcement rules. I wonder how risk assessment sees these kind of federated protocols because in theory you are right about it reducing liability if they run the system.')
