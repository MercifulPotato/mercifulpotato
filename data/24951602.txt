There is a full load of new limitations that restrain much the use for personal&#x2F;hobby users. For example, the g-code you export from Fusion360 to CNC machines (that cut objects out of a block of material), is now making the machine running slower (and therefore raising the production costs), for no apparent reason other than nagging the users into buying a subscription. As a result, we saw a massive migration of users to FreeCAD, and it&#x27;s really thrilling to see people discovering FreeCAD and learning it and liking it.&quot;<p>Seems also to be reflected in contributions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FreeCADNews&#x2F;status&#x2F;1321931951658422284" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;FreeCADNews&#x2F;status&#x2F;1321931951658422284</a><p>&quot;We&#x27;d like to take a moment to congratulate all the new devs that are stepping up lately to submit fixes for the #FreeCAD project. Thx for leaning in! The commit log is becoming quite diverse and exciting to follow&quot;')
