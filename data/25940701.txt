The faster you are the less you make.<p>I try to charge more because I do move pretty quickly, but I have been replaced by someone &quot;A third of my cost&quot; more than once. If you took the triangle for &quot;Fast, good, cheap&quot; and graphed the market demand for each, my gut feeling is that &quot;Fast, cheap&quot; is the leading demand by a long margin. To someone hiring  a freelancer, &quot;Fast, cheap&quot; looks close enough to &quot;Fast, Good&quot;')
