My guess is that there&#x27;s a lot of lower grade cheating. Here are a few ways that would be difficult to detect:<p>Run a position analyzer only to alert you to the existence of a strong move that you haven&#x27;t noticed. Don&#x27;t use it to find the move, just to alert you to when your position is strong. For instance, you might see that your position score is +10, but not realize why - this would indicate it&#x27;s a good time to put in more thought. You might be missing a subtle blunder.<p>Use lookup moves only for unusual positions to avoid traps in early games. Many eccentric openings are losing propositions against a skillful player who can sidestep the landmines, but are unfamiliar enough that an opponent either 1) falls into the trap, or 2) burns a lot of time avoiding the trap. A cheater could rely on a computer only so far as to avoid the traps, then play normally. Would that be detected?<p>Another cheater move would be to use a computer analyses only when things get sticky. Just for the occasional move. This is a cheating tactic in tennis, too. An unksilled cheater &quot;hooks&quot; constantly when it doesn&#x27;t matter. A skilled cheater does it only on a critical point. You can call out a line judge, but with the advantage secured, the cheater can appear scrupulous for the remainder of the match (making the person who called the official out appear to be a high maintenance player). That said, over time in high level tournaments, officials often do see the pattern and a reputation eventually develops.<p>Another &quot;advantage&quot; of these cheating methods is that cheaters are usually not totally &quot;drooling at the mouth evil laugh sinister people&quot;, I think people could use the methods above and lie to themselves that the weren&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; cheating. Cheating, like most sin and trespass, often results from temptation and self-deception rather than a determinedly insidious mind.<p>I&#x27;m only a little bewildered that people cheat and do these things (or worse). I personally hate the idea that my actual real rating in an in-person game would tank compared to my online record, and I love the human aspect of the game. But it does seem relatively easy to sidestep an algorithm that simply checks for inaccuracies. My guess (hope) is that these algorithms are probably more sophisticated than that. Fraud detection is fascinating to me, but unfortunately this is one of those situations where the algorithm probably does have to be somewhat obscure.<p>EDIT: it just occurred to me that I have done all these things when I play against a computer - though chess.com builds this capacity into computer games (not human games, of course).')
