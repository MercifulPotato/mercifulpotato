I argued that you can&#x27;t point to English having two registers by pointing out a usage of a single register and a non-existent example in another register.<p>e.g. &quot;There are two ways for offense to score in American football. One is a touchdown. Translating a touchdown into soccer is equivalent of saying the ball is kicked past the goal line, but when you literally reconvert that back to American football, you can&#x27;t score by kicking the ball across the goal line.&quot;. That does not prove that there are two ways to score in football. That proves that there is <i>at least one way</i> to score in football.<p>&gt; IDK if this conversation is worthwhile, to be honest. You seem to be actively evading the point.<p>Bizarre coming from someone who just said &quot;stop reading if you don&#x27;t like it&quot;.')
