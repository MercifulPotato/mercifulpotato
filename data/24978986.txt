Probably something with I&#x2F;O completion ports.<p>If you are interested, look into the new Windows I&#x2F;O scheduler that was implemented for GHC 9.0 (in Haskell, obv). There is also some preliminary work to integrate io_uring into the Haskell runtime if it&#x27; available, but the Haskell runtime philosophy is rather different from the Rust approach.')
