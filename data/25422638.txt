If all the content hosts&#x2F;providers are censored, then we better limit speech between individuals, and block it at the connection level.<p>Then we better start censoring individual conversations. Seeing (dis)information on iMessage will lend it an air of credibility, and that would be terrible!<p>I wonder if we can come up with a way to censor in person conversation. Maybe my phone can use voice recognition and alert me that my conversation partner (or I) am discussing something that has been debunked and fact checked. If I espouse too many debunked or unverified facts, maybe I should be fined? Or have my credit score lowered?<p>The possibilities are endless!')
