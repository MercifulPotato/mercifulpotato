Item(by='rswail', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610086709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25681667, text='Apple had no value to bring to music players in the early 2000s, they had no value to bring to mobile phones in the late 2000s, they had no value to bring to watches in the mid 2010s, they had no value to bring to audio in the late 2010s...<p>Apple sells an ecosystem as a brand. Whether you buy into the branding or the ecosystem is up to you. Their brand is about status, quality, privacy, identifying their customers as the people that buy their hardware and services, not people they can sell the data to.<p>Vehicles are about to become yet another electric&#x2F;electronic device you own. In the same way that my mobile phone has a network of cell towers that someone sells me access to, I could see Apple doing that with charger providers.<p>If charging stations become self-provisioning, with local power generation and storage, then the cost of actual power transfer to my vehicle has a zero marginal cost.<p>So in the same way that my mobile plan is &quot;all you can eat&quot; in terms of calls (and data, mostly), I could see how vehicle charging could work the same way.<p>So buying a car becomes:\n1. Choose a vehicle based on status, branding, equipment\n2. Choose a vehicle &quot;plan&quot; based on usage<p>So in the same way as iPhones and iPads sell Apple Music, Apple Pay etc, iCar sells all the existing services, plus allows Apple to co-brand with electric networks. So think &quot;Apple iCar and Shell EV, your safe and effective partners for travel&quot;.<p>When autonomous vehicles become available, you can integrate that autonomy into the Apple ecosystem, in the same way that Apple Maps learns your travel patterns and makes suggestions, Apple can use that data to send a vehicle to you when you &quot;need&quot; it.')
