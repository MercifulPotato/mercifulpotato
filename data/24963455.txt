In Wisconsin, the <i>only</i> thing that matters is that it&#x27;s &quot;not louder than stock&quot;. In Florida, you cannot exceed a specific decibel rating at a specific distance regardless of stock dbA [0].<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve always presumed that&#x27;s the case because Ducati and Lamborghini owners are sufficiently cashed up to ensure legislation is written to accommodate them.<p>Maybe in some states.
