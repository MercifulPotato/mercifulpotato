On the free tier of Netlify a site is deployed to 6 points on the Netlify Edge CDN (Frankfurt, Singapore, San Francisco, New York, Sao Paolo, Sydney, Moscow as of August this year, but it might have changed).<p>On the free tier of Cloudflare a site is deployed to 194 locations. That can knock a couple of hundred ms off of a page load time. It might be worthwhile if you need something to be especially fast.<p>That said, Cloudflare is much more of a hassle to set up. Netlify is ludicrously easy. That&#x27;s one of the many things I like about it.')
