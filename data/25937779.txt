Many kids die from the condition.<p>There’s a medication, piracetam, that a child with the same complication uses in the UK. It’s safe and has greatly helped the little girl in the UK. When we mentioned it to doctors we were immediately shut down and told it was impossible to get in the US.<p>Any chance of the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company seeking FDA approval for piracetam and drugs like it?')
