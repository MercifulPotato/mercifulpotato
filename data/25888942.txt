Do you have a citation?<p>What percentage of the population has to be &quot;elderly&quot; or taking their pension? What is the minimum percentage of the population that needs to be in &#x27;working age&#x27; years before it becomes a problem?<p>Unless there are models people are just throwing darts in making these statements. Show me that the math exists (even though I may not understand it as a layman). Pontificating is cheap.<p>Krugman in 1998:<p>&gt; <i>The purpose of this paper is to show that the liquidity trap is a real issue-that in a model that dots its microeconomic </i>i<i>&#x27;s and crosses its intertemporal </i>t<i>&#x27;s something that is very much like the Hicksian liquidity trap can indeed arise. Moreover, the conditions under which that trap emerges correspond, in at least a rough way, to some features of the real Japanese economy. To preview the conclusions briefly: in a country with poor long-run growth prospects—for example, because of unfavorable demographic trends</i> […]<p>&gt; <i>In the model of sections 1-3, a liquidity trap will arise only if future productive capacity is actually lower than current capacity. Before loosening that constraint, we can ask why one might expect Japan&#x27;s future capacity to be relatively low compared with today&#x27;s. And the obvious answer is demography: Japan&#x27;s combination of declining birth rate and lack of immigration apparently means a shrinking rather than growing labor force over the next several decades.</i><p>[…]<p>&gt; <i>Moving outside the formal model, the prospects for a liquidity trap also depend on investment demand. Here demography again comes into play: the prospective decline in the labor force reduces the expected return on investments.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~pkrugman&#x2F;japans_trap.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~pkrugman&#x2F;japans_trap.pdf</a>')
