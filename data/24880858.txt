If pregnancy were easy to prevent, folks would have done it well before modern times. But that simply isn&#x27;t the case. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they knew the rent was that high, and it isn&#x27;t like folks can avoid this in all areas.<p>Expecting a couple to never have sex is unreasonable and pregnancy cannot always be prevented. In some areas, access to abortion is abysmal, though in some areas, a woman can get the day after pill for emergencies - but that&#x27;s hardly prevention.<p>As far as pregnancy prevention: The best prevention is actually male sterilization. Condoms break. Every single prevention method for women have a failure rate, including sterilization methods. For hormonal birth control, lots of things affect it, including some medicines.<p>And this is all assuming folks can afford medical care and prescriptions, which you need for most forms of birth control. I&#x27;m not sure anywhere in the US will mail condoms to you for free (unsure of how well spermicide alone performs or if they still sell a sponge for women). Heck, a young woman who doesn&#x27;t want children cannot generally get sterilized, insurance often doesn&#x27;t pay for it, it isn&#x27;t cheap, and IIRC you need time off.')
