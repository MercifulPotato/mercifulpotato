Because otherwise wars start and atrocities happen.<p>Trump consistently blocks their rightful entry into the US, vilifies them as invaders, denies that they have rights to entry, and tries to scare people into thinking they are a threat.<p>The child separation from parents policy, and there are hundreds that have still not been reunited with their parents today, has been admitted publicly without shame. Vindictiveness. It is to scare immigrant and refugee alike so they don&#x27;t come here. It is to bully them in order to make American liberals angry, because making liberals angry is an inherent good in right-wing ideology.<p>Meanwhile Europe is having its own problems with refugees, and right-wing movements who hate them. So no we do not have freedom of movement, at least not everywhere and not for everyone who needs it. And that means we haven&#x27;t learned a few important lessons - all of which are relatively well contained and explained in the 1951 Convention documents.')
