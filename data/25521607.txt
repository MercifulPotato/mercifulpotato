At this point Web PKI is dealing with attacks from nation-states and other advanced threats that end-users aren&#x27;t really in a position to handle themselves.<p>Like, just last week the browsers had to remove a certificate authority from their root cert programs because Kazakhstan was issuing certificates to MiTM traffic. A TOFU model would make it a lot harder to detect and remediate this sort of attack and lots of other relevant attack vectors.<p>We&#x27;d also need to re-solve a bunch of adjacent problems like revocation, renewal&#x2F;rotation, and transparency, which would probably mean re-introducing the sorts of centralized architectural components and processes that I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re trying to eliminate with TOFU.')
