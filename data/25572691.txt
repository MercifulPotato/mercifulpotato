Because, I have the exact same condition with almost exactly the same loss curve (except at 8kHz where it&#x27;s ~10dB above yours), but I only need to wear my aids in conferences or lectures (school was particularly hard).

Not a single smartphone I know supports what you are doing on the PC. Are there any?')
