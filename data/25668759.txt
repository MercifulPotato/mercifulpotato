But with tinkering you can see those effects yourself and I played with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 &quot;pages&quot; which I assumed were 4KB each and didn&#x27;t see much difference.  Measured latencies do increase slowly, but you expect that as the TLB becomes progressively more of a bottleneck.<p>If you use a 1GB array and see full random with much higher latency than a sliding window then you can be pretty sure that the page size is much less than 1GB.<p>Getting the cacheline off by a factor of 2 does make a small difference since you get occasional cache hits instead of zero, but as long as the array tested is several times larger than cache the impact is small.<p>But all in all the M1 has excellent memory bandwidth, excellent latency, and shows significantly better throughput on random workloads as you use more cores.  Normal PC desktops have 2 memory channels (even the higher end i7&#x2F;i9&#x2F;ryzen7&#x2F;ryzen9), only the $$$$ workstation chips like threadripper and some of the $$$$ Intel&#x27;s have more.  The little ole M1 in a mac mini, starting at $700 has at least 8 memory channels.  So basically the M1 delivers on all fronts, larger and lower latency caches, wide issue, large reorder buffers, excellent IPC, and excellent power efficiency.')
