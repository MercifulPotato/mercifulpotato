There are exceptions where developers can disable a linter for specific pieces of code, but having it there encourages the code to be &quot;constrained&quot; in a consistent way.<p>2) Just because a design has a &quot;13px&quot; padding doesn&#x27;t imply the designer thought &quot;13 pixels is the best value here and 12 pixels is simply unacceptable&quot;.  A design linter would help with the &quot;expressiveness&quot; of the design and when things truly are &quot;exceptional&quot; cases.<p>Note 2: I&#x27;m obviously recommending a technical solution to the problem very early in the design process, but the way I solve it now is by discussing it with the designer over a zoom call.  I&#x27;ll show them the design and say &quot;does this look good?  I deviated a bit, is that ok?&quot;  It almost always is, which is a win for everyone.')
