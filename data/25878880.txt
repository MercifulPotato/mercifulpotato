Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611367908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878076, text='You assume that this year&#x27;s M1 MacBooks have a different camera package from the Intel MacBooks prior to them, and&#x2F;or that the camera package used in Intel MacBooks could be improved by Apple Silicon.<p>I think that the iPhone&#x2F;iPad camera package <i>requires</i> Apple Silicon, and that Apple simply hasn&#x27;t installed it (or one like it) in their MacBook yet, so that it doesn&#x27;t matter if it has Intel or Apple Silicon, it still looks terrible because it hasn&#x27;t been upgrade to one that takes advantage of Apple Silicon yet.<p>I don&#x27;t know who makes the sensor inside that package, but I have no assumptions that the sensor is the sum total of the package. Apple is all about bizarre integrations and coprocessors (such as the iOS&#x2F;bridgeOS&#x2F;whatever chip inside their Lightning-to-HDMI dongle) and I&#x27;m simply not willing to bet that the Apple Silicon package can operate on an Intel computer, or that it&#x27;s just processing of the sensor, without a teardown showing us that they&#x27;re the same in the face of a significant quality improvement.')
