It&#x27;s a means of internalizing the externalities, not deciding what, when, how and by whom to provide goods and services.<p>&gt; many people will argue that if a market is subject to such taxes, then it is no longer a free market.<p>They&#x27;re wrong. Externalities are pushing costs onto other people without their consent, which is not free market.')
