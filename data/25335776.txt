So long as Billy lived in the house his parents could stay too. (Parents effectively passed over, avoiding some taxation issue.) I had a standard approach to this:<p>So you don&#x27;t want Billy to join the army?  What if Billy wants to be a fighter pilot?  Then he won&#x27;t then be living in the house.  What if he is offered a great job in New York?  Do you want him to turn that job down in order to keep his parents living your house?  When Little Billy is 50 years old, and you have been dead for decades, do you still want him opening up your will to ask your permission before he makes a life choice?  Instead, how about we let him live in the house until he is 25 and then he can sell it?')
