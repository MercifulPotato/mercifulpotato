For sure it&#x27;s not trivial, but the thing you just said about REST is equally true for GraphQL -- you can literally solve performance in the same way. Ultimately fulfilling the data requirements for a use case boils down to composing the results of a bunch of I&#x2F;O calls, the only real difference between REST and GraphQL is how these calls are triggered and their results composed.')
