He retired at a pretty high position and was largely responsible for keeping that manufacturing from going overseas. He said by far his biggest difficulty was that he had to pay a living wage, conform to rigorous environmental standards, and worry about pesky things like people losing hands or digits, where none of his competitors had any of those concerns. We’ve passed much needed internal regulation without requiring the same standards from importers. This is one of the reasons the blue collar middle class has vanished here, and it’s a real shame.')
