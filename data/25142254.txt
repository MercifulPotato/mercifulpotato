It felt super wrong.  It felt like the long, slow nightmare of maintaining an early Boostrap site all over again.  But I got peer-pressured into trying it on a medium-sized project and yep: I&#x27;m in love.  I&#x27;m in camp Utility Classes now.<p>The only serious issue I had was when implementing designs provided by an outside designer:<p>1. The design says this width needs to be 28 px<p>2. That&#x27;d be &quot;w-7&quot;, which TW doesn&#x27;t provide.  Guess I&#x27;ll add it to my tailwind config file.<p>3. Repeat ad nauseam until I broke down and added all &quot;w-n&quot; widths to my tailwind config from 1 to 500.<p>4. Repeat for min-width, spacing, border-radius, etc.<p>The result is that A) I get really good at converting pixels to rems to tailwind-scale, then back again in my head and B) My tailwind config is huge - the saving grace being the purge tool that gets rid of unused styles.')
