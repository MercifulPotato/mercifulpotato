Intel and GlobalFoundries aren&#x27;t really replacements, but Samsung has been winning business for latest-generation flagship processors. Maybe it isn&#x27;t as advanced as TSMC and maybe Samsung will have problems, but a lot of the 2021 flagship phones will be shipping with Samsung-manufactured 5nm processors.<p>Samsung seems to be keeping it close.')
