If I really wanted to have a comment system on a static website, I think what I&#x27;d create is a system in which I have a server for the first visitor, but then for every other concurrent visitor, I&#x27;d use a P2P WebRTC connection to send the comments over. Signalling servers are free, if you know where to find them. And I can use my own server as a TURN server if needed.<p>So the model really is: offload whatever you can to the user. Or just don&#x27;t have comments :)<p>If the website wasn&#x27;t static, then I&#x27;d simply just use a server.')
