But of course it&#x27;s just an arms race at this point, if everybody has an SUV then the same problem occurs.<p>That being said, driving a small &quot;urban&quot; car in many european cities can be challenging (and parking even more so), I can&#x27;t imagine that having a big SUV would be more pleasant overall if you live in a city.')
