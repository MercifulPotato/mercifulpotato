I don&#x27;t trust others to run theirs. I know there is one obvious mechanism to ensure that I have liberty while others do not: to require great discretion of things that require personal liberty, and to harshly prosecute those incapable of that discretion.<p>So, for instance, as someone who uses substantial amounts of drugs, I support extensive prosecution of drug users - not because I don&#x27;t think people should be able to use drugs but because I think there is a threshold of responsibility for drug use.<p>People are unable to accept that this threshold exists, but absent that threshold, many will fall into the thrall of the drug-induced haze. I have tested my own abilities here, having used drugs extensively, then abstained for half a decade as a test, and then used again. But most have not. They are not as capable as I am.<p>Given that, and given that people will not accept a test of their abilities, there is one surefire way to enforce the threshold: make it illegal and then permit use among those capable.<p>This is the status quo. Walk around any tech office and point in any direction. A ray projected from your finger will likely hit someone who has used cocaine, MDMA, LSD, Shrooms, or some other Schedule I substance that is not marijuana.')
