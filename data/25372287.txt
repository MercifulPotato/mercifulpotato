Now that CentOS is dying, I uhhh, do not want to do this? I asked my manager and she is fine with me finding an alternative course to strengthen system engineering skills. If you had to recommend the best alternative for the RHCE program, which program would you recommend and why? To be clear, work will pay for either and they&#x27;re less enthused about the RHCE track going forward, especially with the focus on Red Hat operated Ansible in the prerequisite course for becoming a RHCE (the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) course). Any advice is suuuper appreciated. Thanks!')
