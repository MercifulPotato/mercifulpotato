Item(by='josephg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610793911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25801366, text='&gt; I have a similarly bad opinion on the average JavaScript developer<p>I write a lot of javascript for a living, and you&#x27;re not wrong[1]. I think the struggle javascript has is that an extremely high percentage of javascript programmers are pretty new to programming in general. So there&#x27;s an awful lot of javascript code written by unsteady hands.<p>If javascript is a magnet for novices, java feels like a magnet language for middle aged with kids &quot;programming is just a job for me&quot; indifference. I feel contempt for that mindset - but to respond in kind to your apology, I think the contempt I feel is probably reflected fear &#x2F; disgust at the idea of settling. To me programming still feels like casting magic spells. I think I&#x27;m terrified of that spark some day being extinguished.<p>[1] I check in on this issue every year or so and it never fails to delight and horrify in equal measure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChainSafe&#x2F;web3.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1178" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChainSafe&#x2F;web3.js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1178</a>')
