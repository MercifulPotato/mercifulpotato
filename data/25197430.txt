My guess is that he&#x27;s done it hundreds of times. That&#x27;s the definition of the word &quot;trite.&quot; The obvious champagne socialist firebrand dialogue has been had, in the same way, for generations now. Oscar Wilde. etc.<p>This article does mention &quot;champagne populists&quot; as a type example from the political right. The other obvious comparison is &quot;champagne religion,&quot; preaching chaste poverty while indulging like epicurean hedonism.<p>Despite being trite, I think there genuinely is something to &quot;if the shoe fits.&quot; Engels like other socialists &amp; epicurean hedonists (eg chris hitchens) &quot;get away&quot; with church marriages or baptisms. It&#x27;s hypocritical in theory but no one cares. Priests get away with greed, but not with hedonism. Hedonistic hypocrisy sticks to religion in a way that religious hypocrisy does not stick to epicureans &amp; socialists. Neither wealth nor hedonism generally sticks to the &quot;populist,&quot; but failure does.<p>Anyway... I do think that champagne shaped socialism in a negative way, personally. The position of Engels, Wilde and others pushed the ideas in certain directions. They tended to see communism as an indivisible. A slice of communism had no value... otherwise why not use their resources to create a slice of it themselves. Total revolution, or none at all. Seemingly unresolveable conflict at every turn breeds &quot;singularity&quot; thinking.')
