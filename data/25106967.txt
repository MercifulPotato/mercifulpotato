Latency is acceptable enough to play a first person shooter, and target latency is 16ms-19ms (and meets the requirement for the FCCs rural broadband contract [1], which is latency below 100ms).<p>For those with marginal service, this is a material improvement. It’s also firming up the case that StarLink will generate billions of dollars per year in revenue (eclipsing SpaceX’s launch revenues), from both government contracts (rural broadband and DoD) and unsubsidized subscribers. This doesn’t include revenue from StarLink’s contract building missile tracking satellites for the Defense dept (based on StarLink sats) [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;spacex-gets-fcc-approval-to-bid-in-16-billion-rural-broadband-auction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;spacex-gets-fcc-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;6&#x2F;21503165&#x2F;spacex-space-development-agency-contract-missile-warning-satellites-starlink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;6&#x2F;21503165&#x2F;spacex-space-dev...</a>')
