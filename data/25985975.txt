You&#x27;re better off listening to entrepreneurship podcast, audiobooks, youtube, ycombinator blogposts, etc.</i><p>As someone who has started 6 companies and runs a business as a tech partner for startups, I can tell you that you have it exactly backwards.<p>There is a huge industry of people giving entrepreneurship advice, and almost all of it is a distraction from learning and practicing the actual skills required. The least effective people I meet are the ones who can&#x27;t stop reading VC blogs, podcasts, and books.<p>Starting a successful company is mostly two things: 1) breaking free of analysis paralysis, and 2) excellent social skills.<p>Great social skills result in warm leads for customers, an ability to recruit (and lead) a great team, and -- if necessary -- closing a funding round quickly.<p>People who spend a lot of time consuming info about starting a company are typically people who are too risk averse for entrepreneurship, which is fine! Entrepreneurship is expensive gambling, statistically speaking. If there were a way to guarantee success, VCs would make good returns (they don&#x27;t) and book authors would be out starting companies instead of writing books.')
