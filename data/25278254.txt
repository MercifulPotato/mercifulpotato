Humans ARE unique in their capability to reflect on the morality of behavior at a high level.<p>Where I think your argument is strongest, as I said, is in response to the claims that humans are uniquely malevolent, as if most species aren&#x27;t constantly maximizing their acquisition of resources within the boundaries of their capabilities. That just doesn&#x27;t mean that we have carte blanche on all behavior we can observe in nature.')
