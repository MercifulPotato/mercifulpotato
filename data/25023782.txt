It&#x27;s not like the big shift in results was unexpected, as soon as the results for Miami-Dade came in even though Biden had a large lead the NY Times election needle immediately swung hard to Trump because they knew the lead would be wiped out by in person voting.<p>Funny how Trump isn&#x27;t complaining about the exact same thing happening when it winds up helping him.')
