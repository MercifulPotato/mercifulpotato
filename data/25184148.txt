What you are doing is generalizing the non-issue of most platforms allowing the silent majority to express their opinion about other people&#x27;s opinions. The funnies part about people complaining about getting downvoted is that no one is even removing or preventing you from speaking their mind even if they fucking hate the opinion. On reddit some extremist groups exist for quite a long time before they get banned. Firs they want a platform, ok, then they want to silence all opposing opinions within their small garden, and then they start going to other communities to harass and impose their content which doesn&#x27;t belong there after which they get banned and restart the cycle.')
