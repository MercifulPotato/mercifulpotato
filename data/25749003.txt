I mean, it can barely find 2 countries of the tens of countries with populations smaller than Staten Island to support its resolutions in the UN.<p>The major problem for the US is that the administration has declared war on everyone, including allies. So it doesnt find any support, even from allies, because even if they agree with the US&#x27;s action, they are worried that it will come back to bite them.<p>A classic example of this is that Trump spend years railing about China but only imposed tariffs on them more than 2 years into his administration. In the meanwhile, within months of assuming office, he had already imposed tariffs on Japan, much of Europe, Canada, Australia, etc...basically, all allies. So when time came to impose tariffs on China, none of the American allies were prepared to support the US, which meant the US had to go alone in imposing tariffs that turned out to be pretty ineffectual (China&#x27;s net exports to the US are higher than ever) and further, have damaged US exports to China considerably by forcing them to find alternatives to American supplies (Brazil for soyabeans as an example, which had the wonderful knock on side effect of accelerating the destruction of the Amazon...).')
