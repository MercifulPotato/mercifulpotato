It&#x27;s hard work. We went away to university, got jobs, settled down and bought a house. To move back close to family now would be an upheaval - there was probably only one short window of time when it wouldn&#x27;t have been as much effort. Persuading our parents etc to downsize and move close to us might have a better chance.<p>It would be nice to live around extended family. People definitely do, but, here in the UK at least and excepting big-city-dwellers, it seems linked to lower economic status - people for whom one job is much like another.<p>Maybe eventually the link between where you work and where you live will be weaker, for more specialised jobs.')
