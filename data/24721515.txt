Item(by='bserge', descendants=None, kids=[24721640], score=None, time=1602178272, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720643, text='Jesus, those prices... yeah they&#x27;re pretty compact, but if you do it for a desktop, you can do it for 1&#x2F;2 or even 1&#x2F;3 of the price by getting a portable air conditioner or a mini fridge (new or used) and modifying it for cooling. Way higher BTU transfer, as well.<p>There were a few of these DIY projects last time I checked, and they worked well. Downsides: big cooling unit right next to you, loud af unless you mod the fan, as well :D')
