It takes 8 months to a year; they will do a background investigation and send you an approval form if you pass.  Then you can purchase the (used) machine gun.  Fully automatic weapons are not currently manufactured in the U.S.<p>Florida, in particular, has banned machine guns like the AK-47 which is to say weapons that fire multiple bullets with one pull of the trigger.<p>Semi-autos are the dominant technology in firearms; when a bullet is fired, the energy released forces a fresh bullet into the chamber, ready to fire but you must pull the trigger again.  This is known as &quot;semi-automatic&quot; and is legal everywhere, for now.')
