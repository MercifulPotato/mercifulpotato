I am just stating the societal transformation as I see it for any xyz country out there that becomes wealthy over time.<p>However, this model ultimately ends up treating children and sometimes marriage (And even romantic relationships to an extent) as shackles and hurdles on the road to success. And for those who still want to get into relationship and have kid(s) unfortunately means you have to work and save for a lot longer time before making it economically feasible to have kid(s).<p>While this may still work out in case of males, for females, unfortunately, the more they wait to have kids (hey, I am not saying anything against this -- it is their body and their choice and their is nothing wrong with this and yes, all the power to them -- I get that, thx) - the more likely they won&#x27;t have as many kids as in previous generations (Due to their biological clocks).<p>Of course, it is always going to be down to individual will power and personality, but I am stating from common person&#x27;s perspective.')
