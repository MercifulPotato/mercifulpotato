If Zoom has a limited range, then CGNAT users may suffer from limited bandwidth even though Zoom&#x27;s network may handle this just fine. If they have additional IPs, they can give each participant an endpoint and circumvent whatever restriction there are on the ISPs&#x27; side.<p>TLDR: Except for companies requiring a dedicated proportion, probably to work-around CGNAT problems.')
