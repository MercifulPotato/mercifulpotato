These unions are successfully suppressed for the exact same reason that people are inclined to form them.  The labor class in the US simply doesn&#x27;t have (or perhaps more accurately doesn&#x27;t yield) the political power that the labor class does in many other countries.  The forming of unions will help them get more power, but the act of creating a union already requires a certain level of power which many US workers haven&#x27;t yet achieved.')
