The young are definitely hit harder, but the real issue is that &quot;work&quot; is not valued as it once was.  The &#x27;economy&#x27; is doing great.  Stocks go ever higher despite pandemics and money trends.  Taxes are low.  Luxury spending is at an all time high.  Investors, be them wealthy independants or pensioned former workers, are generally happy.  Young people own nothing and so the bulk of their income must come through wages rather than investments.  It is those workers, those who don&#x27;t own their sources of income, that are struggling to make rent.')
