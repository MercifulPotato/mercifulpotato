A couple hundred anarchists were not there to &quot;best&quot; Officers Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove when they shot 32 times at Breonna Taylor in her own home.[1] It is not just a few &quot;bad apples&quot; when the whole tree was planted to enforce and uphold slavery.[2]<p>&gt; The lack of access to medical care just spent $6 billion buy vaccines for everyone in the country.<p>We funded the development of these vaccine candidates, yet it seems like we are going to have pay to out of pocket if we actually want to use them. If we already payed for it, under what circumstance should we not already have it guaranteed for everyone?<p>On another note: losing a job should not mean losing access to healthcare. Healthcare is a human right.<p>&gt; The unchecked imperialism just drew down all their troops and is achieving real progress towards normalized peaceful relations.<p>Really? <i>All</i> their troops?
