Of the consumer USB webcams, I haven&#x27;t found any other makers&#x27; to be as good. Only 1080p 30Hz, but any more is demanding too much of your recipients&#x27; bandwidth and hardware in the general case.<p>Advice from my wife, a photographer:<p>- if you&#x27;re still having picture problems (after setting the camera&#x27;s anti-flicker to 50Hz&#x2F;60Hz as appropriate), put diffuse illumination on your face e.g. a full-screen browser window on <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blank.org;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blank.org;</a> or for more control--colour temperature as well as brightness--a cheap LED panel and desktop tripod (from a photo supplies shop).<p>- turn off any &quot;smoothing&quot; or &quot;beauty&quot;features  in the cam&#x27;s software.<p>- likewise, don&#x27;t use any fake background features. Pin up a plain bedsheet behind yourself if you think your place is too messy to be the background.<p>Anyway, once there is a picture of any kind, in my experience most people care more about the audio being unclear or laggy, so you&#x27;re well ahead.')
