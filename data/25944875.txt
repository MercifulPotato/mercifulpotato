We&#x27;re not &quot;on call&quot;, ever.  We don&#x27;t carry pagers.  On the other hand, when there&#x27;s an issue, I&#x27;m available.  I once got called in at 9 PM because we found a critical bug two days before we were shipping.  That&#x27;s happened <i>once</i> in eleven years, though.  I accept that as part of the job as long as it&#x27;s rare.<p>So:  Is that &quot;on call&quot;.  In my mind, no, but you might interpret it differently.')
