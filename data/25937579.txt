That&#x27;s how Sci-Hub and TPB have managed to stick around for decades, and they&#x27;ve shown censorship on the internet isn&#x27;t really a thing. God knows how many powerful forces have tried to censor them, to no avail.<p>While I agree that in some ways this is worse than the Parler case, it also is a free service that costs Discord a ton of money, especially with the hundreds of people constantly hanging out in voice chat [0]. A ventrilo server of that size would probably cost upwards of $100 a month [1]. So I&#x27;m not surprised with Discord wanting to enforce their ToS more readily than AWS who was actually making good money out of Parler.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tomwarren&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354532238524874753" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tomwarren&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354532238524874753</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ventrilo4.com&#x2F;ventrilo-server-hosting-prices.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ventrilo4.com&#x2F;ventrilo-server-hosting-prices.php</a>')
