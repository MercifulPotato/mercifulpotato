I think storing UUID as text in 2021 is not that hard.<p>Not going to store a text type prefix + UUID in a 16byte UUID column, you will need a variable length text column. All your DB will convert UUID to human readable plus the column name no need to store in the data reading for every value.<p>if your looking at network traffic or debugging the id will hopefully be keyed (json, query string, protobuf, etc) if your looking at plain text logs with no schema, sure emit the type-UUID for readability, in your logging code...<p>&gt;&gt;Depending on what is your use case.<p>Only use case I can think of is unstructured logging, or maybe using a file name as a key? I guess if your db is just key-value with string keys maybe (basically a file system).')
