If its inherently relational it&#x27;s still the best play. Scale and performance are much more tractable problems than integrity and consistency. One you can measure and be sure of, the other you need a Phd to fully understand all the edge conditions that need covering.<p>There are some pretty decent NoSQL stores now for simpler access patterns. As long as you stay away from nonsense like MongoDB and stick to real databases like Cassandra&#x2F;ScyllaDB&#x2F;BigTable&#x2F;etc you will do fine.<p>These stores are a fraction as flexible as PostgreSQL&#x2F;MySQL but do allow scale-out storage and fast primary key lookups and scans. Good for when the size of your data is well in excess of 1TB+ and you don&#x27;t need anything complex or consistency.')
