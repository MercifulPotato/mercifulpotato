Let&#x27;s say we had a wonderful company which would create an unimpeachable ethics board and which enthusiastically endorsed the findings of said board. This is good for today but what about tomorrow? What about when the company comes up with a promising product which violates one of those ethics? What happens when the companies stock stagnates? What happens when the company is in financial trouble? What happens when the company is coming up with promising new products every day for years that could get it out of that financial trouble? What happens when ethnically minded managers have to argue day in and day out that we should let the company fail rather than dain to implement one of these profitable products which violates just a few of these ethics? Eventually, some combination of desperation and profit motive will break the damn.<p>And often it is a damn that need only break once. Corporate ethics as a whole seems contradictory. The only ethical rules which a company may obey in perpetuity are those that do not for long conflict with profit and those which are backed by effective laws.<p>Even when done with a positive intent, I fear creating positions such as this is begging for eventual corruption.')
