Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=[25830361, 25831592], score=None, time=1611033786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826766, text='&gt; Nobody (except many frustrated readers) is officially complaining that non-fiction writing is needlessly flowery and sprawling across many more pages than necessary.<p>Actually people do (I do too). I find that many of these books take one point that can be expressed succinctly in a short blog post and labour on it for an entire book. So to read it for entertainment is ok, but to read them for information is .. an utter waste of time. I&#x27;ve even picked up some of these reputed books from a book shelf, just read the cover notes .. and realise later on that the author really didn&#x27;t have much else to say. I&#x27;m sorting of ranting here, but .. this needs to stop and I agree with the OP on this matter. My complaint is not against the authors themselves though. Its against the sheer waste of resources and mind time that such books consume.')
