This is what business does, VC is just a more direct way to screw people over.<p>&gt; A lot of time the business person on the team brings two things - 1) translates the tech into “business person speak” which is actually important for raising money AND getting customers excited and 2) they bring a completely different set of relationships that can help commercialize the product.<p>1) The fact that things need to be translated into &quot;business person speak&quot; should say all we need to know about how useless these business people are.\n2) stop viewing everything through the lens of how to commercialize and commodify it. Capitalists trying to put a  dollar sign on everything in the world is sickening, especially when per point 1, they have no idea what they are talking about and need things distilled for them to even do their &quot;job&quot;.<p>&gt; Also important are translating the business speak back to the startup - how do fund raising processes work? What do all these documents actually mean? Why do these terms in the contracts with customers matter?<p>this is a completely unnecessary step only needed because the business people had to be coddled in 1). The documents don&#x27;t mean anything, the contracts will never be read by the customer, you know it and take full advantage.<p>&gt; This all matters and a single person on the team playing that roll at an early stage can impact things. Just make sure it’s a business person with lots of relationships and experience doing similar things... “business” is general, so make sure it’s the right kind.<p>It&#x27;s laughable you think that your &quot;angel&quot; investor savior complex makes you and other VC charlatans these God like people saving some startup when you really just rape them for equity, ownership, and the ideas.')
