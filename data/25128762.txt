I already own a 13&quot; iPad Pro with the pencil, but for being a notebook, the RM2 easily beats the iPad. Yes, there is way better software on the iPad and you get all kind of fancy drawing tools. Where the RM2 beats the iPad is:<p>- it looks and feels like paper. No glowing screen, textured surface, it just feels like writing with a pen.<p>- the always-on display. I use the ReMarkable as my notebook while working and can have it in front of my all day long. You still can see the screen content when it goes to sleep after 20 minutes (sleep can be deactivated) and you can even have it preserve the content when it switches off after 3 hours. So you keep your notes in view. With the iPad, it turns itself off quickly and of course uses way more power.<p>- overall I think it has the better design for this purpose than the iPad, I have the book-like cover and love it.<p>- hackability. I need to learn more about that, but you can ssh into it and have a normal linux shell. Try that with an iPad :p. It seems to be very easy to cross compile Go programs for the ReMarkable.')
