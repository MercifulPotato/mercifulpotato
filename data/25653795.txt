Item(by='baron_harkonnen', descendants=None, kids=[25654045], score=None, time=1609897132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652833, text='&gt; hard to justify learning something because it&#x27;s &#x27;beautiful&#x27; or purely intellectually stimulating.<p>You might be surprised to find out that &quot;because it&#x27;s &#x27;beautiful&#x27; or purely intellectually stimulating&quot; is the essence of the &#x27;Hacker&#x27; ethos for which this site is named.<p>The Y Combinator itself is something that fits this description quite perfectly. You will never use the y combinator in practice, and it likely won&#x27;t help you to get a job ever, but it&#x27;s a beautiful, wonderful thing to learn about and play with.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first person to criticize PG on a range of topics, but to his credit he has been a great proponent of this ethos and it is no coincidence that this site is named after what would be now considered esoteria by many of the commenters in this thread.<p>It&#x27;s predictable that the VC ethos of SV would undo that of the Hacker spirit that built it, but it&#x27;s still sad to see.')
