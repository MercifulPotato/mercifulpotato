So once the chisel is in place, the only thing the left hand does is holding chisel, which is not hard at all.<p>Think of it as a nail: if you need to hammer in a nail in exactly the right place, you put the nail into exact position holding it with a left hand, then strike it with force using hammer in the right hand. And if you ever did this you know that the tricky part is hitting the nail the right way, so you don&#x27;t bend it.')
