Prior to that, I went into an open office every day for about 10 years.<p>Overall, if you subtract the time from a 1-hour round-trip commute, distractions from coworkers, and longer lunch breaks I had while going into the office, I&#x27;m definitely more productive at home.<p>At least most of the time.<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed that my boundaries between work and  home have been slipping. I&#x27;m less likely to tell my wife that I can&#x27;t help her with something in the house during my work hours. I tend to run errands in the middle of the day. I was doing better, but I need to tighten things up a bit. I&#x27;m still productive, but there are weeks that could have been &quot;highly productive&quot; but instead started merging into my home life too much.<p>I&#x27;d wager that a lot of people have an ebb and flow in their productivity at home as boundaries become fuzzy and bad habits come and then go as you realize they&#x27;re having an impact. And while I don&#x27;t have kids, I can see how having kids would make working from home a huge challenge.<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget that 2020 is a steaming pile of shit, and it&#x27;s had more horrific distractions than any year in recent memory.')
