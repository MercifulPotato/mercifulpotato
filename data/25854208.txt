In terms of dataflow if &#x27;b&#x27; is an &#x27;agent&#x27; then b.foo() is a message we send to it and then we use the result of b.foo() for further decision making. But in a typical dataflow-diagram data flows in one direction only, there is no link in the diagram from &quot;b&quot; to &quot;result of b.foo()&quot;.<p>A diagram could not (easily?) describe the fact that we get the &#x27;b&#x27; from one component and then we send the message &quot;foo&quot; to that component &#x27;b&quot;. The data-path from this component to &quot;b&quot; could hardly show in the diagram because &quot;b&quot; is the response to a previous request which could be one of many possible alternative responses.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I can express or even think about this very clearly but questions like this make me doubt the generality of dataflow as an alternative to current-day programming practice.')
