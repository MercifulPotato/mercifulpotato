Being the best at what you do, in my mind has little to nothing to do with charisma. It does help achieve the same results as being charismatic (people listen to you, want to be in your presence, respect your opinions more, more willing to go along with what you say), but not due to charisma. It&#x27;s due to the social capital of being the best at something people care about.<p>Charisma is more about people feeling that same way from someone the just met, from someone who just walked into the room, from someone they know nothing about.')
