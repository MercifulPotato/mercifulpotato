Item(by='jedberg', descendants=None, kids=[25165906], score=None, time=1605908335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164178, text='&gt; Do you know of any publicly traded companies that split out IT in their financials?<p>No, you&#x27;d have to be familiar with their internal practices.  But let&#x27;s be honest, you&#x27;re just being pedantic now.  It&#x27;s fairly obvious from the outside which companies are &quot;tech&quot; companies.<p>&gt; Do you consider Apple, which builds consumer electronics (e.g. hardware engineering) a tech company?<p>First of all, about 25% of their revenue comes from software services, and iPhone is the only segment with more sales.  More than 1&#x2F;2 of their profit (because the gross margins are much higher) come from software services, so Apple is probably a bad example.<p>But yes, of course they are a tech company.  One of the first.')
