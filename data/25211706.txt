My grip is this quote:<p>&quot;The upper class keeps all of the money, pays none of the taxes. The middle class pays all of the taxes...&quot;<p>It&#x27;s blatantly untrue, as are most things comedians say, but Carlin somehow is treated like a scholar. The spamming of his quotes only adds fuel to the culture war.<p>Consumerism is completely orthogonal to polarization. Video games and Netflix promote consumerism and keep the lower classes &quot;distracted&quot; from change. There&#x27;s no need to intentionally stir conflict.
