A different kind of cross-platform, if you will. For example, I have definitely run Git commands on the same repository from both Windows and (via WSL) Linux simultaneously in the past (I used to use Windows gVim and Linux everything else, and both could invoke their platform’s Git). That’s where cross-process locking concerns me. And WSL is hardly the only type of file system that may be accessed from multiple machines simultaneously.')
