[...]  a “modal” text editor, having special modes for editing text. Ox is easier to use than Vim because it doesn’t have modes [...] however it takes the idea of being a keyboard-only editor and being able to act just like an IDE after some configuration.<p>Interesting, mentions vim first in list of taking features from popular editors, and explicitly doesn&#x27;t take the one feature that everyone takes (when they take any)!')
