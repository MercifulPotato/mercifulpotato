Can you explain that a bit more?<p>As a manager, I expect my direct reports to do the work I assign them. As a good-faith effort I will do my best to assign work that is relevant&#x2F;interesting&#x2F;etc. But I accept that in the real world, there is a lot of work that is often boring, repetitive (some of that is going away thanks to automation). Especially in the scientific domain, performing the same experiment over and over isolating for some factor or the other, and there is sometimes very little intellectual stimulation. I think it would be the same in engineering fields as well.')
