Therefore running a FATCA compliant entity in say france requires you to comply with all french laws around fatca. Which also leads to issues with GDPR. This creates a cost of several hundred thousand USD per year just to deal with US clients for most western finance companies, per country they do business in.<p>Or - simply flatly refuse to offer services to any US citizens and rest easy knowing the IRS isn&#x27;t going to ruin your life just because a US citizen tried to open an account without even depositing a single cent, but you didn&#x27;t file your IRS stuff correctly')
