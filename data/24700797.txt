Unless you have a prior VO2max study it&#x27;s hard to _prove_ that you are worse off post infection but that is exactly what is happening with athletes being infected (loss of VO2max, which pretty much is a loss in peak performance for many athletes).<p>Another aspect is that a loss in cardiac output or lung capacity is likely also a loss in life expectancy but it is the type of thing you would need decades to prove.<p>My point is, with the information we already have the sensible approach is to use caution rather than trying to be stoic about it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32747875&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32747875&#x2F;</a>')
