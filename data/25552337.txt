In both cases there was no way to message the person via GitHub because they&#x27;d not publically shared their email address. In one case there was no way to open an &#x27;issue&#x27;. And in the other, it wasn&#x27;t relating to a repo, but a really excellent tutorial.<p>In the olden times, we all just used email all the time for everything. It would&#x27;ve been bizarre for someone to work in open source and not have their email publically available. The funny thing is, I haven&#x27;t shared my email on my GitHub either! I&#x27;m going to fix that today.')
