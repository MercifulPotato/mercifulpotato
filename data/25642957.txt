The whole idea can&#x27;t work with a nuanced argument. Either the company bows to the union or strikes start up. Either the employee joins the union or he&#x2F;she gets kicked out of the company.<p>It&#x27;s socialism for the majority. If you want a nuanced argument, meet your union leader at the church he goes to on sunday and see how fervently committed he is to his goals. You&#x27;re more likely to get a nuanced argument in the face of God, rather than these big dick, black and white union arguments people endlessly wave in our collective face.<p>The union structure is not free from religious, political and justice problems. Some of the largest unions in the US spend union funds on politically charged topics that easily divide it&#x27;s own membership.<p>You won&#x27;t get a satisfying answer because it has little to do with rational answers and more to do with sexual security. Union members secure and promote their progeny.')
