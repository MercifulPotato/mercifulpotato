I had a Clojure job for many years, and it was the only thing I wrote in that time. When I moved to a different job in a more conventional language, I also had that initial frustration from the syntax context switch in my head. But it was very short-lived. Now I find that there’s really no such frustration, it’s just a different way of writing code, going from either direction to the other requires some getting used to it.')
