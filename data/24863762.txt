There have been a handful of issues to iron out, but it is <i>really</i> nice having control over my own machine and not having to spend tons of time fighting with Apple.<p>I don&#x27;t know how representative I am, but I&#x27;m hopeful more and more devs get motivated enough to stop putting up with these kinds of changes from Apple. Given the direction things have been heading with them, I&#x27;d guess that the dev experience on MacBooks is going to get increasingly worse.')
