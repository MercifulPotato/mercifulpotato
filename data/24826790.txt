Item(by='durkie', descendants=None, kids=[24827141, 24827395], score=None, time=1603118414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826211, text='&gt; My experience (over decades) is I couldn&#x27;t sustain my family for a year on a 1-acre garden plot even if I had the time to work it intensively and used nothing but recycled organic byproduct (compost and, uh, other stuff) as fertilizer.<p>I find this surprising. I help run an Atlanta-area non-profit that has a ~1 acre organic farm that donates everything it produces. For the year 2020 we have already donated 3120 lb &#x2F; 1415 kg of food.<p>We&#x27;re not trying to produce a nutritionally complete output on the farm, but that&#x27;s still ~70 lb &#x2F; 31.7 kg of food a week on average.')
