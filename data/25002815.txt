At some point you have to realize that more money isn&#x27;t always the solution, you actually have to fix your beurocracy. It&#x27;s insane to me that the city with so many rich people and incredibly valuable companies is such a mess, your telling me that a small city with an incredibly wealthy population can&#x27;t figure out how to keep the tenderloin from being full of tents and open drug use? Or get some form of functioning public transit? Pretty pathetic.')
