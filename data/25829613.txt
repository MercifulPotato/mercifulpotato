Item(by='imgabe', descendants=None, kids=[25829986], score=None, time=1611026195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829204, text='&gt; Because politicians trying to have their political opponents harmed or killed is basically all one needs to have fake democracy.<p>I don&#x27;t follow this logic. Assume for the sake of argument that politician A attempts to have politician B killed (also not a historian, but I feel there has to be at least one instance of this happening somewhere, at some point in US history). Based on this event, we now conclude that the entire democracy is fake? How? All of the votes for all other politicians are now invalid? The electoral process (largely out of the control of any single politician) just ... goes away? How do you figure? What&#x27;s the cause and effect mechanism there?')
