We do know some bits about the effects of serotonin in the body, though I would be amazed if we really understood the whole story.<p>But more than that, we have no idea what depression actually is, and that goes for any other psychiatric disease unrelated to direct brain damage. It would probably be more correct to call these syndromes rather than diseases, as we do not know the mechanisms causing the disease enough to even be sure if &#x27;depression&#x27; is a meaningful diagnosis (in the sense that coughing is not a diagnosis).<p>We also don&#x27;t have proper neurological studies of emotional illnesses - there are basically no comparative neurological studies of people diagnosed with depression versus people showing similar symptoms who are expected to quickly recover (for example, people grieving for a lost one). We don&#x27;t know whether the brain chemistry changes we see in depression are the cause of the disease, or just the way &#x27;sadness&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;lack of motivation&#x27; looks like neuro-chemically.')
