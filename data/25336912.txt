This effort is much more reasonable than many similar efforts because unlike many of the people sucking up these subsidies, it actually reaches everyone. Most of the carriers who accepted subsidies to increase rural internet access just picked the low hanging fruit and often introduced new service in regions which were already covered by other services.<p>My old house was stuck on 10GB service for years while ISPs bumped up subsidized service to many closer in&#x2F; semi rural areas. I have good access now, but just a few years ago I&#x27;d have loved the option of getting SpaceX&#x27;s service at full price.')
