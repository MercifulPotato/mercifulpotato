It&#x27;s to reward landlords for using land more efficiently. If the land costs a fixed amount you want to build as many units as possible and make each unit as attractive as possible.<p>Compare that to a conventional property tax where you have to pay more tax for each unit of housing you build. You also have to pay property taxes for home improvement meaning old properties won&#x27;t be renovated ahead of time and therefore won&#x27;t be rented them out. Instead the house will only be available for sale with the hope that the buyer will renovate the property.')
