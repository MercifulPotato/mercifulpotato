And if it&#x27;s a feature I don&#x27;t want added at all, I can already turn it down at the proposal stage, before any code is written.<p>With UX, however, the contribution itself isn&#x27;t the proof that the contributor actually knows what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;ve been excited about getting a UX contributor in the past, but then with all due respect what they turned up with was even worse than what I could&#x27;ve done - and this was not just a matter of taste and expertise. But it&#x27;s rough to turn it down <i>after</i> the work&#x27;s been done.')
