It&#x27;s the rest of the field, it&#x27;s grad students, it&#x27;s undergrads, it&#x27;s researchers in other fields it might be valuable for.<p>It&#x27;s also for people trying to figure out even which subfield the author is approaching it from, to contextualize the paper -- is this political science paper being written by a structuralist or a culturalist, even when they never explicitly say so, but it makes all the difference for judging it?<p>It&#x27;s easy but short-sighted to assume you&#x27;re writing solely for your peers. <i>Thankfully</i>, the &quot;verbiage&quot; and &quot;fluff&quot; you disdain is <i>deeply appreciated</i> by many, many other readers.<p>To reiterate: there are very good reasons for these standards. What&#x27;s fluff to you, is extremely valuable to many others.')
