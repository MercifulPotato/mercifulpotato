Not surprisingly the line between Level 3 and Level 4 is fuzzier than I had in my mental model.   I view your first example as a Level 4 capability -- AFAICT, stopping to let a human take over is acceptable for Level 4 vehicles.   The other two are interesting.<p>Perhaps we would call the system you worked on &quot;high level 3&quot;, and Tesla type systems where you have to be able to take over in milliseconds as &quot;low level 3&quot;.    Marketing departments would be tempted to call your system level 4.')
