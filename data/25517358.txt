Reading the articles of that association (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riscv.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;Certified-copy-of-articles-of-RISC-V-International-Association.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riscv.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;Certified-copy-...</a>), there must be at least 5 board members appointed by different companies and individual members, so that seems good. It also says the general meeting cannot decide to merge into an entity with largely different goals. I don’t see anything forbidding the sale of IP, though (and the board is explicitly in control of that), and couldn’t figure out whether the board can lock out non-members from using the ISA, prevent companies from becoming members, etc.<p>Also, as is common with these kinds of associations, it is geared towards companies (premier and strategic members each appoint a director in the board, while all individuals combined appoint 2 others)<p>My (IANAL) overall judgment from cursory reading is that it looks fine, but isn’t 100% bombproof.<p>(I also noticed that site is using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sso.linuxfoundation.org&#x2F;login" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sso.linuxfoundation.org&#x2F;login</a>, but doesn’t seem to mention any link between those organizations. Is there any?)')
