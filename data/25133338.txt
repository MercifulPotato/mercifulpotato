It&#x27;s definitely doable to expose (and directly link with) the Mosh networking and terminal libraries if you&#x27;re unhappy depending on the executables. You&#x27;re not wrong that our release cadence has also fallen off a cliff, probably for similar reasons to you (this has been a tough year for our active maintainer).<p>Honestly I think of Mosh as mostly &quot;done&quot; at this point (with the exception of 24-bit color support which everybody wants and which we have in Git), and I&#x27;m wary of stepping back into the ring myself as the original maintainer who hasn&#x27;t looked at the code in a long time, and screwing up a release that ends up botching our so-far-good (knock on wood) security record. Which will just take up way MORE time...')
