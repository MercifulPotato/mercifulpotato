Though these days the only thing I have been using Windows for really is Matlab (anyone get matlab working in Wine or otherwise?), so I really probably could just run a VM now.<p>My progression has been:<p>-&gt; 2000 dual-boot Gentoo&#x2F;Windows (mostly because of gaming) \n-&gt; 2012 (? I think, maybe 2014) Gentoo host with Qemu guest Windows GPU Passthrough (which was still sort of a dual boot since I could actually boot into that Windows SSD normally)\n-&gt; whenever proton came out, Gentoo 99% of the time and rarely boot into Windows getting rid of GPU&#x2F;SSD passthrough because it was cool but ultimately too much hassle\n-&gt; now almost never boot into Windows (once every few months) except when working with one specific researcher who only uses Matlab, because Win is where my working Matlab install is ...<p>Inertia has kept the dual boot around because I don&#x27;t want to set it all up again in a VM really.')
