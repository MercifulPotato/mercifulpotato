There are a lot of college students and adults with irregular employment that would have been rounded up and sent to jail otherwise. I worked simultaneously for three different employers in my late teens&#x2F;early twenties including a part time job working for my city government. No one, especially the IRS, blinked an eye because this is 100% normal.<p>Now if you’re in an at will employment job then the employer can just fire you if they don’t like what you’re doing, but the same is true if they woke up cranky on a Tuesday.
