I don&#x27;t think I can change the way I feel and approach life, and I&#x27;m quite comfortable with my approach, but if you&#x27;re not and you want to make a change, you might want to dig into why that&#x27;s the case.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;existentialcomics.com&#x2F;comic&#x2F;101" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;existentialcomics.com&#x2F;comic&#x2F;101</a>')
