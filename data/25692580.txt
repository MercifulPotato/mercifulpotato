If you break into my secure location and steal my chat logs, but you can&#x27;t tell which are real and which are fake, you&#x27;ve still got work to do.<p>The Signal protocol has you covered, here. After the fact (ie, as long as you don&#x27;t watch me receive the message), there is no way to cryptographically prove which of the two participants wrote the message[0]. Thus, it is technically possible to forge a bunch of chat history, or claim that someone else&#x27;s is forged. <i>Cryptographically</i>, the &quot;spirit of forward secrecy&quot; is secure.<p>That said, this is far out of the reach of the average person. Even if the only evidence is a screenshot, that conversation probably happened. So in practice yes, you&#x27;ve got a point. That&#x27;s why I think it would really behoove Signal to add a &quot;forge a conversation&quot; feature. Make it trivial for either person to add a message to their local history that looks like it came from any of the participants, at a specific date&#x2F;time. Now you&#x27;ve got practical deniability, too.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;specifications&#x2F;x3dh&#x2F;#deniability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;specifications&#x2F;x3dh&#x2F;#deniability</a>')
