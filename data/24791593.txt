That doesn&#x27;t make their revenue is less than a expenses though (see also using share buy backs to avoid multiple levels of taxation).<p>* its often better for companies to spend excess cash than to hand it over (and thus let the government take 20 to 60% of it)<p>* idiots like buying shiney things and that includes shares sometimes<p>* the market can remain wrong longer than you can afford to be right (see for instance the last 20 plus years)<p>* if something has dropped 50% then gone up 20%, you&#x27;ll hear that it&#x27;s up 20%! In a pandemic&#x2F;financial crisis&#x2F;recession&#x2F;whatever. Not that it&#x27;s actually down 40% (that&#x27;s right, 40% not 30%, that&#x27;s how percentages work).')
