A lot of great ideas at tech companies get thrown by the wayside because aspiring PMs and Eng leads don&#x27;t think those project will get attention.<p>Im talking businesses that are easily $xxM ARR businesses if you were run them alone. The FAANGs just dont care. But there have been a lot of startups that started this way, so the downstream effect is that the smart people will just leave and do that project on their own and reap the profits.<p>The other way of looking at is that it is a misalignment of resources for FAANGs to work on small projects. They have so much power and resources, that they should probably leave the small projects to the smaller companies and focus on solving big problems others would not have the resources to tackle.')
