Its likely that sole income buyers are going to be priced out by couples, particular in the &quot;nice&quot; houses where the demand is. From a lenders perspective, a couple on 25k each vs a single earner on 60k, the couple is much less risky, their post-tax income is higher, less of a chance of a full default, living costs are split. They can be slightly more &quot;generous&quot; lending to couples, so it&#x27;s likely that most of the nice properties fall just above the 2x 25k earner threshold (adjusted for whatever that is locally)')
