It&#x27;s how we swap pictures of our kids.  The rest of my follows are web comics.  I follow a couple of &quot;famous&quot; people, but they are mostly people with compelling content and not vapid influencer content.<p>My experience seems to be that I see a whole bunch of fresh updates from friends, and then ads.  If I&#x27;m looking when there are few updates, it&#x27;s mostly ads.  If I see mostly ads I know that I should put the phone down and come back in a few hours. :)')
