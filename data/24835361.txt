Enigma evolved over the years, needing further work, but as of mid-1939, Enigma was broken by the Poles.<p>The British took over, and achieved huge things on their own too (while also excluding the Polish cryptographers, now UK-based, from the project), very possibly doing a lot more than the Poles ever did. But I see that even when saying Bletchley Park was &#x27;over-rated&#x27;, even then they can&#x27;t give credit where it&#x27;s due.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#Polish_breakthroughs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#Po...</a>')
