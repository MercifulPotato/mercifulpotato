The OTR protocol[1] takes the step of publishing its used MAC keys --- it releases private key material! --- to ensure that random people can forge messages once participants have authenticated them. Signal came up with a novel deniable AKE[1] that is one of the more famous parts of the protocol; by design, you can forge a Signal conversation from someone&#x27;s private key even if you&#x27;ve never talked to them before.†<p>When you think about it in the abstract, it&#x27;s easy to understand what&#x27;s going on, even if you don&#x27;t take the time to read the OTR paper. Once counterparties have authenticated each others messages, authentication has served its purpose. To allow a stranger to authenticate a messages is to concede information to them, and avoiding concessions is the point of messaging cryptography.<p>If you believe non-repudiable messages are necessary for public policy, it&#x27;s hard for me to understand how you&#x27;d support the rest of secure messaging. Most secure messengers also have &quot;disappearing messages&quot;, which have an even more powerful impact on the public&#x27;s ability to read your (or some disfavored other&#x27;s) messages. In fact, keeping the public from reading stuff is... kind of the obvious point?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just email, and the belief that email should not just be insecure, but be deliberately insecure? But, you all get how weird it is for me to read that after getting yelled at for writing a blog post about avoiding secure email, right? 547 comments[3]!
