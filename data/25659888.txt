Both Tibet and Bhutan&#x27;s recorded history goes back to the 7th century and I expect Sikkim to be similar (edit: Sikkim&#x27;s current dynasty dates back to the 17th century but its history is far longer).<p>The Kazi was the head of Rumtek Monastery which is not a simple achievement [1]. He subsequently led the formation of the Sikkim National Congress and was then the first Chief minster of Sikkim for 5 years. He was awarded the Padma Vibushan, the second highest civilian honor by India. But the Kazi is reduced to the status of a noble brute in the article who just utters two sentences: &quot;marry me&quot; and &quot;ignore my wife&quot;. The Chogyal gets a bit more ink but as an instrument of his wife who glamorized Sikkim, was a probably CIA&#x2F;State department plant but was not on the scene for more than a dozen years.<p>This story would have been very different if written by a Sikkimese or an Indian not beholden to Western framing. Digging deeper, the author is Indian but her bio states: &quot;Write on social justice, gender, culture. Medienbotschafter Fellow. Reporting Grant by European Journalism Centre.
