My son is 24 and is working on his Ph.D. in computer science, so he&#x27;s doing alright. But my wife and I worried about him the most while he was growing up.<p>For starters, an alarmingly high number of his friends and classmates were diagnosed with ADHD and so were drugged. Boys need more physical engagement - especially when they&#x27;re younger. Yet schools are reducing time for recess.<p>I taught my kids to take care of their own business and not tattle so long as: nobody was seriously hurt (no blood), no one was in immediate danger, and property wasn&#x27;t being destroyed. Those aren&#x27;t the rules they use at school. Kids continually tell on one another to try to get each other in trouble. Boys tend to be more &quot;ornery&quot; and so tend to get in trouble a lot. This creates an atmosphere where boys are viewed as being &quot;just bad.&quot; Sadly, boys learn that girls are &quot;sneaky.&quot; That has its own issues but that&#x27;s for another post.<p>Bullies are another matter. I was raised to not start fights but finish them. I raised my son the same way. That&#x27;s not AT ALL how schools work. They do nothing about bullies. Their &quot;no tolerance&quot; policies for bullies are laughable because they don&#x27;t do anything about bullies. Teachers have told me their hands are tied. They know who the bullies are, but now there&#x27;s such a stigma with being branded a &quot;bully&quot; the administrators won&#x27;t let them do anything about it. Eventually the bully will get their just reward and their parents will raise holy hell with the school and the tables get reversed: the bully is the victim. It&#x27;s disgusting. I&#x27;ve seen that happen time and time and time again. I did see a teacher once stand up to the bully&#x27;s parents and the school administrators and inform them the bully was, in fact, a bully and learned an important lesson in life. Thank goodness she had a paper trail tracking parents&#x27; complaints and had the backing of all the other parents.<p>As part of all this is parents today won&#x27;t accept that their children aren&#x27;t perfect little angels. I knew my kids weren&#x27;t perfect - they&#x27;re kids. Their teachers appreciated that they could work with my wife and I if they were having issues. They lamented that so many parents simply wouldn&#x27;t accept that their children weren&#x27;t perfect and refused to work with teachers to rectify a situation.<p>Finally, when my son went to college he had to contend with all the so-called Social Justice Warriors blaming all men, especially white men, for all the world&#x27;s ills. Never mind that my son and his friends had nothing to do with making the world what it is - just like the SJWs. The sad irony is in their eagerness to blame these young men for all the world&#x27;s problems they were undermining what I was teaching him about how we came to be in the mess we&#x27;re in and what steps we can take to get out. I was trying to raise my son to be a good man and the SJWs were making it clear that their world view didn&#x27;t include the concept of a &quot;good man.&quot;I could go on and on and on regarding this issue, but that would be for another post.<p>My daughters? They never had any of these problems. None.<p>Obviously things turned out okay and grad school has been completely different for my son than undergraduate school but - the whole point is my wife and I worried about him a lot more than we ever worried about our daughters.<p>The good news? Yes, you&#x27;re going to worry more about your sons. That&#x27;s just a fact of the times in which we&#x27;re living. Raising kids has never been easy and raising sons has become harder. My advice is to persevere and raise them to be a good man: a man who respects all people regardless of sex, race, religion, or sexual orientation; a man who knows it takes many different perspectives to solve today&#x27;s problems.  It&#x27;s not easy and it never has been - but the rewards are worth it!')
