Chess programming is a refreshing change from modern software development, because you don&#x27;t need any complicated frameworks or libraries, just a basic grasp of the minimax algorithm for searching a game tree. I have fond memories of writing an engine as a fresh college grad - it was my first &quot;big&quot; project and I made every mistake imaginable, but it was great fun and sharpened my coding skills immensely. It&#x27;s exhilarating to play against your own program and then try to improve it. Highly recommended!')
