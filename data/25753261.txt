The only issue is that almost no one is enforcing it (maybe some airports do, I&#x27;m not sure). It makes sense if it becomes like visa where airlines wouldn&#x27;t let you board the plane without it (until things are under control). It can be an issue for emergency travel though. Thinking about it, this should be of interest of airlines to protect their staff.')
