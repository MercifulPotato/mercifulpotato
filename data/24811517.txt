Item(by='defen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602955321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24809177, text='I kinda disagree with her characterization of the whole &quot;coup attempt&quot; thing, which she presents as &quot;totally fabricated&quot;, &quot;without evidence&quot;, etc. Which is true - some people sitting in a room wargaming isn&#x27;t a coup or a plot to take over the country in and of itself. It&#x27;s not a crime to do that. But the steelman &quot;extremist&quot; (her word) argument is that the <i>publication</i> of the WaPo essay (and Hillary Clinton saying Biden &quot;should not concede under any circumstances&quot;, and this essay itself, etc) represents the elite using free speech to establish a Schelling point, or common knowledge, of how to dispute the election. By now anyone with any political awareness knows, and <i>knows that anyone-with-any-political-awareness knows</i>, that the election results won&#x27;t be known for weeks or months after the election. And that mail-in ballots are going to decide the election. And that Trump is suppressing votes. It&#x27;s a kind of manufacturing of consent for the intellectual elite who hate Trump. But to them this sort of thing is totally invisible - that kind of speech is good and important for democracy, because it establishes a collective template for coordination-free cooperation to ensure Trump is not reelected. It&#x27;s the other kind of speech that is bad.')
