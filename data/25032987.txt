It&#x27;s even more meaningful to have that possibility when you are bootstrapping a new projects or are wholly unfamiliar with programming or graphics technology.<p>The feature scope of Dear ImGui has grown meaningfully over the years, and although the only &quot;required&quot; elements are still mouse pos&#x2F;buttons, time and rendering those vertices with scissoring, in reality there are many other desirable things which adds up to more work to provide (clipboard, keyboard, gamepads, mouse cursor shape, IME hooks, dpi queries, not mentioning multi-viewports).<p>You can see my reasoning for renaming examples&#x2F; to backends&#x2F; here:\n  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ocornut&#x2F;imgui&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3513" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ocornut&#x2F;imgui&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3513</a>\nIf anything, I found the tendency of my-weekend-engine people to do their first foray into Dear ImGui often improductive and detrimental to the perception of using Dear ImGui. They tend to struggle 4 hours to get a feature-incomplete backends done instead of first plugging fully working existing backends with &lt;20 lines THEN considering if they really need to rewrite that. I believe that did more bad than good to Dear ImGui because they end up using feature incomplete versions. It&#x27;s also that years fixing those backends to try to have them work everywhere has been helpful in growing the confidence of calling them backends.<p>I believe this is mostly communication issue: we should keep hammering that backends are reasonably easy to rewrite and keep documenting that process.<p>Ref:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ocornut&#x2F;imgui&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;BACKENDS.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ocornut&#x2F;imgui&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;BACKENDS.m...</a>')
