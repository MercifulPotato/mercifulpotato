Item(by='tgsovlerkhgsel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606523729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229291, text='&quot;Time spent working&quot; is a terrible metric for &quot;gives a shit&quot; and shows me that I wouldn&#x27;t want to work at this place, but I agree with the general idea that people who give a shit are worth a lot of money.<p>Even more important than hiring people who give a shit is not breaking them. Throw enough bullshit hurdles in their way, treat them unfairly, or show that you don&#x27;t care for long enough, and they will stop giving a shit, and you just reduced the value of that worker at least by a factor of 2, if not more. Even if they still put in the same number of hours.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between doing what&#x27;s right vs. doing what&#x27;s rewarded. If you have people who just do what&#x27;s right, you don&#x27;t need a strict reward system. Once you push them towards only going after your rewards, your reward system better be 100% aligned with what&#x27;s good for the company (spoiler: it isn&#x27;t anywhere near that), or you&#x27;re screwed.')
