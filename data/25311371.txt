It is only the 5% trips where you don&#x27;t get back home that you need a charger. Middle of nowhere is where that is likely to be. Look at truck stops, they are all stores and restaurants, everything someone going a long distance needs. They are never inside a city because land is too expensive and anyone in the city for the night has a parking space.')
