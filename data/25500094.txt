Can&#x27;t buy any replacement parts, overpriced service that can only be done at the apple store, and they completely stop supporting old models after five years. Cars having problems driving? Yeah well, looks like you bought it seven years ago, so we can&#x27;t do anything. We can recycle it to be eco-friendly though!')
