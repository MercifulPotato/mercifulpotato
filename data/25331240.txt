At work I had access to Premiere Elements and decided this was good enough for me, as a hobbyist, given that going with Pro would massively increase my existing monthly fee to Adobe. So I paid the one-off license fee for Elements.<p>I&#x27;m currently looking at BlackMagic&#x27;s DaVinci Resolve, which has a quite well featured video and audio editing package for free. But &#x27;all&#x27; the free version does is edit video clips. You have to pay for additional functionality. Premiere Elements, in contrast, has lots of useful things like creating&#x2F;handling non-video assets such as text for titles and credits, loads of (sometimes cheesy) clip transitions, etc etc. Resolve may be okay if you hate Adobe.<p>You&#x27;ll need something more sophisticated if you are targeting non-standard playback devices, or want to participate in collaborative workflows, or grade raw sensor clips (assuming you can get this data off your video device). As a real power user you might also want to look at ffmpeg, something I simply haven&#x27;t had time to get my head round.<p>Again, YMMV.<p>[Edit] I consider myself an &#x27;advanced&#x27; stills photographer, who is much happier using manual rather than auto settings. When I started with video, however, I quickly discovered how much I didn&#x27;t know. For example, what is the relationship between the shutter speed of the camera and the frame rate of the video? This was helpfully ignored in the camera&#x27;s manual, and took some googling to find out. Video autofocus is also pants, on the D850, for the type of wildlife and action photography I like (it always refocuses just as the bird lands). So I&#x27;m teaching myself to use manual focusing, just like they do in the movies. A video tripod head was also essential so I could pan, elevate and focus with only two hands rather than three.')
