Poker is genuinely very harmful for a non-trivial number of it&#x27;s players, and it can be a destructive force in a way that (say) chess is not. I&#x27;ve had more than one friend lose tremendous sums of money and had to go cold turkey on the game, lest it completely ruins their life.<p>Teach your kids Backgammon instead.')
