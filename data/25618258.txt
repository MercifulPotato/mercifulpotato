I&#x27;m a contractor too, and I share your pain, but ... I&#x27;m really impressed you walk out of paid work because of the issue tracker your client uses.. It sounds a bit like they dodged a bigger bullet than you did tbh mate.<p>All these systems suck. You learn to live with them, for me I do this:<p>Everything goes in OmniFocus, I have a keyboard shortcut to create a task that takes &lt;1sec, hit enter twice and it&#x27;s stored. Twice a day I go though all the tasks I entered this way, and I either mark them done or assign them to various projects&#x2F;tags&#x2F;labels I have setup on OmniFocus.<p>15 mins before I finish work for the day at a client, I update whatever ticket system they use (mostly Jira, but also sometimes even worse things like servicenow) and also whatever enterprise crapware my agency uses (usually some sap based bollocks).<p>The last 15 mins suck. But it&#x27;s part of the deal. I can&#x27;t imagine how strongly you feel to turn down contractor rates due to a ticket system.. I mean, come on?<p>Edit: Also - btw -- if you&#x27;re on a Mac the app-store &#x27;fat-app&#x27; version of Jira is about 10x better than using the web interface, I suggest you give it a try.')
