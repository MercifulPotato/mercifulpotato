The size, color, placement, etc... of road signs and markings is specially designed for human brains to process.<p>As for the hardware, our eyes have very good resolution, field of view and an unmatched dynamic range. Far better than the stuff in Teslas.<p>So I&#x27;m not saying that it is impossible for computer vision to get away with just using cameras, but it is competing with what our brain does best. So a little help in a form of a LIDAR isn&#x27;t too much IMHO.')
