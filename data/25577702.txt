Then you hold their passports and tell them they can&#x27;t leave until they&#x27;re paid up.<p>It&#x27;s illegal, of course, because it&#x27;s <i>literally slavery</i> despite the window-dressing of money changing hands. But the slaves are vulnerable and don&#x27;t necessarily know it&#x27;s illegal, or they&#x27;re threatened.')
