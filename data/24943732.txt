There&#x27;s no equivalent &quot;company you were working for&quot; to blame a process failure on, and picking the wrong licence isn&#x27;t even a process failure. It&#x27;s either an individual failure at the time, or it&#x27;s someone who changed their mind.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing whether or not it&#x27;s nice to do this, but I think it&#x27;s important to be clear that what you set out in your licence is important, and your fault if it&#x27;s wrong.')
