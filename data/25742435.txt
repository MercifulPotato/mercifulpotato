Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610427066, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739240, text='&gt; But if their problem is not being able to stomach the &quot;just-because&quot; explanations that every QM resigns to using to explain wtf complex conjugation has to do with reality<p>Having studied both engineering and physics, I can tell you that there is nothing observable in the universe that <i>requires</i> complex arithmetic&#x2F;algebra&#x2F;theory. We use it because it makes the math a lot more convenient.<p>BTW, the use of complex math for real world applications goes way beyond QM, and predates it significantly. Engineers use it all the time: AC Circuit theory is full of it. As is electromagnetics. As is power (motors, etc). As is <i>anything</i> involving Fourier or Laplace Transforms (i.e. almost all engineering). You can come up with purely real mathematics to describe all of the above, but it would be tedious.')
