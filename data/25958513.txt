Item(by='xpe', descendants=None, kids=[25958713], score=None, time=1611935445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958190, text='Well, I don&#x27;t think it is &quot;the&quot; secret, and probably not a &quot;secret&quot; at all. (At least, I hope not.)<p>Regarding happiness, Maslow&#x27;s model [1] is well-known and makes sense to me. As I understand it, happiness is built on a foundation by satisfying:<p><pre><code>  1. physiological needs\n  2. safety needs\n  3. belongingness &amp; love needs (i.e. connectedness)\n  4. esteem needs\n  5. self-actualization\n</code></pre>\nThough, per Wikipedia:<p>- &quot;There is little scientific basis to the idea: Maslow himself noted this criticism.&quot;<p>- &quot;However, it has been pointed out that, although the ideas behind the hierarchy are Maslow&#x27;s, the pyramid itself does not exist anywhere in Maslow&#x27;s original work.&quot;<p>And my views:<p>- I question the universality of #5. There are many people who could, technically, accomplish &#x27;more&#x27; that are happy doing &#x27;less&#x27;. Perhaps #5 would be better explained as &quot;agency&quot; -- the ability to choose a path in life?<p>- That said -- I agree with you -- there is something to be said for expecting &#x27;less&#x27;. This idea is compatible with &quot;make the most of what you have&quot;. But less relative to what? For example, should one expect to be safe from violence, at least most of the time?<p>- The studies around &quot;good&quot; stress versus &quot;bad&quot; stress come into play too. This is consistent with sayings such as &quot;the bad times help us appreciate the good times&quot; and &quot;we better appreciate the things we work for&quot;.<p>- Still, I believe that people, in general, are happier and more developed if they are not unnecessarily constrained. Unpacking this idea probably would requires a discussion of how individuals relate to society as well as normative theory of justice.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs</a>')
