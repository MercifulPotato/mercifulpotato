A world with 3 TV networks is a world of <i>limited airtime</i>, so of course people will not give their slots up freely for others.  That is not the world we are in now.  It costs no &quot;space&quot; to let messages of any kind go through your platform.  It costs (nearly) no bandwidth.  It is generally <i>profitable</i>.  The only reason messages are being restricted is because those who control the platform don&#x27;t like them.  A TV network wouldn&#x27;t give airtime to any old wacko because it was a limited resource.  Signal choosing not to give use of their platform to somebody they don&#x27;t like is categorically different.')
