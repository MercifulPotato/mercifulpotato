What I like most about nim is that it has generics, and produces binaries with small size. I&#x27;m creating a graphical program with a http server running in the background, and mixing asynchttp with UI threads is a bit of a pain in the posterior. Granted, I&#x27;m new to the language, I&#x27;m considering using channels, maybe that will make it easier to share state between threads. At least compared to golang, nim hasn&#x27;t been a smooth experience yet when it comes to threads.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m just voicing my personal gripe with the use of whitespace-sensitive syntax. Nim is a overall a good language to use.')
