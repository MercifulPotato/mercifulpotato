More gates = more impressive chip.<p>2) But logic gates weren&#x27;t equivalent from one process to another, and so it switched from &quot;logic gates&quot; to &quot;transistors.&quot; More transistors =&gt; more impressive chip. (this is when I left Intel for Sun Microsystems)<p>3) But not all transistors are created equal, and there were things (like copper metal layers) that made chips better even it it meant you couldn&#x27;t fit as many transistors so &quot;line size&quot; was what was important. Smaller line size =&gt; more impressive chip.<p>4) But now people had redesigned transistors so that they could be packed more densely and the limiting factor was how much silicon you needed for the gate (NMOS&#x2F;CMOS) and since that wasn&#x27;t a whole transistor, it was just a &quot;feature&quot; of the transistor, &quot;feature size&quot; became the new marketing term. Feature size was measured in nanometers and so the smaller nanometers implied more features per unit area.<p>It has all evolved over time so that it is harder and harder for any sort of comparative analysis between processes seems to make any sense at all these days.<p>These days, much like the TSMC presentation that is excerpted in the original article, semiconductor fabs rely on comparative measures like &quot;same stuff would be size &lt;x&gt; on this process vs size &lt;y&gt; on the previous process.&quot; All the really interesting parameters to me are things like how that effects leakage (thus idle power) and voltage thresholds (thus idle power and maximum frequencies).<p>I&#x27;d love it if there was some sort of SI unit you could demand which would give you a better comparison metric but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see that. Everybody wants to be &quot;the best&quot; and that is most easily achieved when you can dynamically define the metric for &quot;best.&quot;')
