One of things I used dropbox for was storing some of my college homework assignments.<p>I estimate that these assignments occupied ~10 megabytes at most.<p>Dropbox deleted my stored files due to account inactivity. Yes, they sent me an email (to a email I do not actively monitor anymore) saying they would do so.<p>Storing 2GB worth of files on S3 Glacier for 20 years would have cost dropbox less than 2 dollars.<p>They lost me as a customer for life, and do not deserve sympathy.')
