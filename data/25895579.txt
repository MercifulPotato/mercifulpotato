But the premise of the discussion here is that people do the desalination for its own sake, not in order to harvest Uranium.<p>This [1] article from 2012. It presents a Uranium extraction method from seawater that would put the extraction cost at $300&#x2F;kg. Nowadays the market price is about $70&#x2F;kg.
