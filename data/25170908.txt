The biggest part of the problem is that historically there are only three superpowers in the EU - France, UK and Germany. The UK is gone off the rails, the French can&#x27;t pick up the slack for everyone else alone and us Germans are (out of very valid historical concern) <i>extremely</i> wary of pulling our weight on the international stage.<p>Add to this that the EU is corrosively fractured, nowhere near as coherent as the US. We&#x27;re no match, hell (thanks to the Brits) the EU doesn&#x27;t even have a Foreign Minister, and the effective veto power of even a super tiny nation doesn&#x27;t make it any easier.')
