Copyright before digital goods seemed to strike a pretty acceptable balance. I can&#x27;t mass-produce and sell a textbook that someone else owns the copyright to, but I can give it to my friend who&#x27;s taking the class after me. The author makes a living, and purchasers gain a reasonable set of rights.<p>How do we get to a digital analogue of this? The physical-book copyright system probably wouldn&#x27;t work well if everyone had a printing press and unlimited free paper, which is effectively what computers have given us.<p>Or maybe it would work fine. It&#x27;s trivially easy (although maybe not legal) for me to download DRM-free copies of most ebooks that I want to read, and I still pay for them. Maybe enough people think that way that authors would still make a living.')
