Trump is reprehensible and his supporters are brainwashed. Big Tech conglomerates now openly disenfranchise and deplatform millions of people simultaneously through a coordinated effort. The implications for the future of speech and dissent are terrifying. Just disgusting and depressing in every way. An internet utopianist&#x27;s nightmare.<p>I don&#x27;t want to live in the United States of Trump. I don&#x27;t want to live in the United States of Dorsey, Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Pichai. The only way out is through sweeping antitrust enforcement against the entire tech industry.')
