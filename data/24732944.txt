And that&#x27;s the point for me at least; freedom of choice.<p>Writers should be able to write how they want, employing whatever literary devices they want, about whatever topic they want. There should be no restriction imposed.<p>On another note; writers can&#x27;t ignore reality, if they are writing about reality that is. Homeless people exist. They are smelly and unclean and in many cases can be violent. Ask anyone living in San Francisco, Los Angeles etc. Sure, not every homeless person is white, but the majority are. Trying to pressure writers into adding forced &quot;diversity&quot; due to wokeness is ridiculous. Reality is not woke, it is what it is.<p>If they want to use tropes, no problem. If they want to find different ways of representing real life situations without the use of tropes, no problem. Whatever. Choice.<p>What i disagree with is the imposition of language that the OP (Chris Winkle) is trying to impose; that tropes are somehow bad and to be avoided or &quot;cleaned up&quot; because they are somehow demeaning or offensive.')
