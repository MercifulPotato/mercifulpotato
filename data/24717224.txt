The neural plasticity thing is definitely real but I think the effect is often overstated. Adults a) rarely spend as much focused time on language study as kids and b) are more afraid of making mistakes&#x2F;less inclined to say things that they know are not 100% right. I&#x27;ve observed that people who care less about making mistakes (to the point where it&#x27;s embarrassing to watch) end up learning much faster.')
