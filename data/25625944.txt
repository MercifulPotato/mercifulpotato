The experiment is a great way to gather data. But the categorization made me really think about what people, in general, categorize as &quot;productive&quot;.<p>Maybe sleeping should be way more important than many job related things, but by default we assume sleeping is just a necessity, many times sacrificing it in favor of the others.')
