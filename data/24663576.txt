In that it’s just a giant bucket of data with ways to link it and connect it.<p>Is there something special about how Palantir does it that makes it better at analyzing data and thus more of a threat?<p>What’s weird about using it is that it just seems to be a specific way (like so many others) of just scaling up what I’ve seen for decades of making big databases and using them.')
