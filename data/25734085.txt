Our company&#x27;s board had a meeting today to discuss cloud, and vendor lockin (or translation... holy eff, this could happen to anyone, let&#x27;s pump the brakes on this cloud stuff).  What happens if for some reason an employee, customer, or some other event caused a similar scenario.  Twitter has had plenty of content filled with threats of violence in other instances, and much more direct, targeted, and deliberate.  They are still running.<p>I personally don&#x27;t have an answer, and it didn&#x27;t matter why the plug was pulled, but what it did was cause a pause, and a rethink on where the control resides.  Needless to say, our cloud strategy changed this morning, and I wonder how many other businesses had a similar conversation this morning.')
