Loopring is a bit more centralized than Raiden but its UX is easier, Raiden still is complicated to setup but can scale linearly with the number of nodes in the network.<p>&gt; Most often these libertarian interests align with criminal interests.<p>Get rid of the weasel-words and try again. What is your actual condemnation here?<p>For whatever it is you think it is a crime, ask yourself (a) if crypto is enabling criminal actions that would be otherwise prevented and (b) how much these activities would not exist if the institutions were actually working at the best interest of the people.<p>Money laundering, drug&#x2F;gun&#x2F;people trafficking <i>already</i> exist without crypto.
