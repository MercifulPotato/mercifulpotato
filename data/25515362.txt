For me ROI was insane. 33%-50% more billable hours (currently at 5h&#x2F;day), income after expenses rose by 50-66%. Nothing worked for me, to do lists, apps, pomodoro, organizers, calendars. But when someone watches me I just work. Every day I connect with that person at 9:00 AM sharp through Hangouts, share my screen and his webcam (I need to see the other person, I don&#x27;t need to share mine for it to work on me) and we spend  like this 8 hours a day. Unfortunately, focusmate didn&#x27;t worked for me either, I&#x27;m such a good procrastinator that I was putting off making appointments ;).')
