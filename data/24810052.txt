I don&#x27;t know them in the original (it&#x27;s not a language I speak), but I was able to compare the English version there in the store, and the prose just seemed much livelier in English. (The French Harry Potter is comparable to the English, for a control for this experiment.)<p>That wasn&#x27;t actual censorship, but unless it&#x27;s an unlucky sample or a quirk of my taste then the French were unfortunate with both authors.')
