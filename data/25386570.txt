Because I&#x27;ve got a pair, and I agree 100% with the author: the first time I tried some noise-canceling headphones was the last time I took my HD280PROs on a flight.<p>If that&#x27;s not your claim, then it doesn&#x27;t seem like your statement makes any sense.<p>Sure, HD280PROs are better than not wearing anything over your ears. But the flying experience is dramatically different once you have active noise-cancelling headphones, so different that, euphemistically speaking, there&#x27;s no going back.')
