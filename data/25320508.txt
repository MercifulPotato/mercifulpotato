Then read his book, The Relational Model for Database Management: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeblab.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2009&#x2F;12&#x2F;rmdb-codd.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeblab.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2009&#x2F;12&#x2F;rmdb-codd.pd...</a>.<p>It’s mind boggling how much he anticipated about data management, and was absolutely accurate about. As someone who unfortunately learned databases via ORMs, I started to dive into his writing directly and learn more about the relational model itself.<p>It’s amazing how much power is in the model that I was completely unaware of, like domains: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;9.5&#x2F;sql-createdomain.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;9.5&#x2F;sql-createdomain.html</a>.<p>It also inspired me to learn more about math, specifically set theory. Set theory is the most practically useful math you can learn as a programmer. It’s a shame that it’s not common to communicate in terms of set theory more at work, considering how much we intuitively use it. You can’t work in a complicated data model without talking about unions, and the relational model itself is just an extension of set theory, very clearly defined via set theory.<p>It’s funny. Almost every popular tool or technique we use has a clear and direct lineage from math, yet we have a huge anti-math sentiment in our industry at large. I mean. It’s not funny. It’s tragically ignorant.')
