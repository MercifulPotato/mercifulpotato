Because rust is statically compiled, there&#x27;s no runtime startup or anything involved with it.  From dead to alive is pretty much instant.\n    - Low memory footprint.  Because rust does not use a GC, it doesn&#x27;t need all the bits and pieces of memory storage that modern GCs require.  The memory allocated is (close to) the minimal memory needed to run the application.  Further, due to it&#x27;s low level nature, it&#x27;s a lot easier to avoid heap allocations all together and instead focus on stack allocations.\n    - It&#x27;s safe to deploy and expose to the internet.  You&#x27;d be a fool to setup a public facing C++&#x2F;or C application.  That memory model is simply too expensive to safely do even if you did want all the benefits of using a system language.  Not so with rust.  Client facing rust services or even just backends that may see client data are safe to push out.\n    - It&#x27;s fast.  Rust has no startup or warmup time.  From boot it is running just as fast as it ever will be.  This means you don&#x27;t have to have a warmup period or periods of slow runtime as you scale out rust applications.  That consistent performance is easy to plan for.  That speed and low memory usage have the added bonus of making rust really good if you are trying to optimize operation costs.  You can use smaller or less instances to get the same amount of work done.\n    - The model model not only makes memory safe, it prevents different types of concurrency bugs.  While rust won&#x27;t prevent ALL classes of concurrency issues, it will prevent several of them.  That makes it easier to write parallel applications.\n</code></pre>\nCertainly, if none of those things are issues for you, then there&#x27;s no reason to give rust a second glance.  However, I personally see rust as super exciting because of all of those aspects.')
