They also usually require very different skills and usually have different budgets for example.<p>I don&#x27;t want to take resources away from helping the poor but rather see more focus in the medical world towards aging&#x2F;longevity. Rather than spending a lot of money on trying to cure (for example) Alzheimer&#x27;s decease I&#x27;d like to see more of those resources spent on trying to solve aging, which seems to be the root cause of Alzheimer&#x27;s (and many other deceases.)<p>Does that make sense? Or maybe I misunderstood you again.')
