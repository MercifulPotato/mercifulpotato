You can still use AMD&#x27;s closed source driver on Linux if you need optimizations for those. If you don&#x27;t (and most people won&#x27;t) then Mesa works extremely well.<p>&gt; Khronos splitting the API to core&#x2F;compatibility was a mistake that made everything more complicated than necessary when what they should have done if they wanted a clean API would be to make something new like they eventually did with Vulkan and avoid messing up OpenGL<p>You could argue for drivers not providing newer features in the compatibility profile (and Mesa did that until recently) but as long as there are customers demanding support for newer features while refusing to move off the older APIs, this is what you will get. I don&#x27;t think having OpenGL Core and OpenGL Compat sharing some of the API hurt anything here.')
