I&#x27;m doing work in Jira to build metrics, rather than metrics being tracked from what naturally occurs in Jira. While I understand that most of these problems come from the setup and the decision to use Jira a certain way, I feel the system itself encourages busy work.<p>As a developer, I&#x27;ve felt the Fogbugz way of doing this most closely mapped to my natural workflow.  It is also built around the concept of a single person &quot;owning&quot; a ticket, providing a natural flow from person to person through the lifecycle of a ticket.  This can be done in Jira, of course, but it is a mental drain as it requires more bookkeeping.<p>edit: I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that Fogbugz in particular is a bit more opinionated and lines up with what I think is good.  Jira naturally guides management to all sorts of extra crap.')
