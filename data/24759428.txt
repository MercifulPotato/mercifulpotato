As a country we&#x27;re already struggling to create enough middle-class jobs and you&#x27;re suggesting we try to gut another whole sector.  So that owners&#x2F;executives of prefab factories can pocket the money?<p>If you think it&#x27;s going to reduce cost or benefit the consumer, you&#x27;re crazy.<p>I notice you downvoted without responding.  I presume you&#x27;ve got a plan to recreate those jobs vs. just transferring wealth upwards and are keeping it a secret.<p>It astounds me people on HN think that eliminating jobs without any thought to the social impact is somehow a righteous goal to strive for.  Yet you can&#x27;t even answer what the benefit is to society other than making some really rich dude a little bit richer at the expensive of hundreds of thousands of middle class jobs.  And most likely an end product for consumers that&#x27;s LOWER quality.')
