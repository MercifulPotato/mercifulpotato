I really don&#x27;t have that much time to split between fixing existing issues, adding critical features for paying customers, and supporting or troubleshooting for users that aren&#x27;t paying anything. That&#x27;s not to say at a point in the future the organization could have the capacity for a sick free trial, it&#x27;s just that free trials cost money.')
