They search for obscure answers, assume we must have all been misled somehow, or that we&#x27;re all secretly hate-filled tyrants.<p>Are we not like the &gt;&gt;90% of Obama&#x27;s racial kin who voted for him? Is it not the same phenomenon that has seen Khan elected in Muslim-populous London?<p>I saw Mindy Kaling tweet in tears of joy that she would have a VP who &quot;looks like us&quot;.<p>Am I not free to pursue that same goal? Should I not celebrate when our leaders promise a brighter future for <i>my</i> family?<p>We are not terrible. We are not stupid, as much as you want to believe that because it&#x27;s so convenient. We want the same things you do - and the unfortunate reality of a multiracial society and a deeply tribal species is that you can&#x27;t please everyone at once.<p>I don&#x27;t condemn others for voting for people who &quot;look like them&quot;. Don&#x27;t do it to us.')
