In the UK, the art of rhetoric doesn&#x27;t appear in the standard curriculum. I am confident in my ability to predict whether a UK politician has been to private&#x2F;grammar schools and Oxbridge or not - to distinguish those who have been taught elocution and rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful from an early age.<p>Not only that, but confidence and certainty are very charismatic, or at least, draw attention. That works fine as a mechanism for liberating people from concerning themselves with the minutiae of every part of life in society. But we all know some variation of that quote about the certain fools and uncertain wise. I&#x27;m thinking of those especially confident scientists who have used their platform to trash reflective subjects like Philosophy (not naming any names).<p>I suppose a good summary of my point is that charisma can transform interest into idolatry.')
