They are stuck in usage patterns from their former preferred language.<p>There is no alternative for generics in a strongly&#x2F;statistically typed language. Claiming people &quot;have not learned to use Go properly&quot; is why many people don&#x27;t like Go and its community, arrogant, dismissive and frankly outright insulting toward developers. &quot;You don&#x27;t need this or that with Go&quot; needs to die or Go will be stuck to a niche language. Developers aren&#x27;t stupid.<p>A language should adapt my needs and fit my requirements, I don&#x27;t need Pike to be over my shoulder telling me what to do as a developer.')
