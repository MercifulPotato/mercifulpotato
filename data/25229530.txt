People with passion about something might bring that passion to work.  In my experience, they&#x27;re more likely to bring something they&#x27;re already passionate about to work and make the rest of us passionate about it as well.<p>Trying to find candidates that are passionate about the company before they join doesn&#x27;t seem right.  If we&#x27;re only aware of how the company appears from the outside (press releases, company website) how are we supposed to have a real attachment to what the company truly is?  Best case scenario is them being attached to how the company markets itself, which isn&#x27;t a great approximation.   That said, there might be something here I can latch onto into the form of:<p>1. Hire people passionate about something.<p>2. Promote people passionate about the company.<p>However, I still see some problems with the above.  I would need time to chew on it before basing any personnel decisions around it.')
