Item(by='davidivadavid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607963935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25418329, text='&gt; Sometimes because they understand the domain well enough to understand the impact on function and benefit from the “artifact” and don&#x27;t need someone else spinning a narrative about benefit for them, sometimes because the “artifact” itself is a status&#x2F;aspirational item for them.<p>That doesn&#x27;t contradict, but actually supports the fact that people don&#x27;t care about artifacts in themselves.<p>Either they understand the function&#x2F;benefit and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re looking for, or they want them for status&#x2F;aspiration (which is just a special case of the former, since status and aspiration are other functions among many).<p>&gt; The actual lesson of “sell the benefits, not the features” is not “people care about results not artifacts”, but that motivating action in others who aren&#x27;t inherently motivated to that action without effort on your part requires understanding their individual interests<p>Yes, and their interests are the function and the results people get from the artifact.<p>&gt;It is not a lesson about what people care about, but about what you need to do to get what you want once you understand what they care about.<p>Erm, yes. &quot;Sell benefits, not features&quot; is a piece of marketing advice telling you what to do to get results (like any piece of advice). That&#x27;s missing the point.<p>The question is <i>why does it work</i>. And the reason it works is for the aforementioned reasons: people care about results and functions, not artifacts.')
