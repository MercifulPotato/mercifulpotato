Especially digital assitants like Amazon Echo.<p>* Don&#x27;t conenct anything to your Wi-Fi unless essential. (Yes that means not giving the password to visits at the victim&#x27;s house)<p>* Get YubiKeys or similar for the victim and the parents. (SMS 2FA is garbage)<p>* Tell the victim and the parents to never reuse passwords.<p>* Have a VM to use misleading social media. Post as if the victim were in a different city, etc.<p>* Use a VPN or Tor. (lower chances of finding the victim&#x27;s location through their IP or some sort of data leak)<p>* Use something like the Tor Browser even if you don&#x27;t use Tor.<p>* Don&#x27;t have any cameras inside the victim&#x27;s house.<p>* For victim and parents: don&#x27;t install anything that isn&#x27;t really necessary.<p>* Also for victim and parents: get a decent WiFi router with no known vulnerabilities and change the admin password.<p>* Pay in cash. (Victim only. Avoid data leaks that might record where you shop)<p>* Don&#x27;t let others take pictures of the victim or her kids, much less share them.<p>* Maybe use codenames when talking about location near the place the victim lives.<p>* Don&#x27;t use the victim&#x27;s real address for anything that isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary. Maybe set up a mailbox in a different city and use this addresses for most purposes. (Or the victim&#x27;s parent&#x27;s address)<p>* Install a non-https blocker and use only DNSSEC over HTTPS or TLS just in case.<p>* Use encrypted messaging for pretty much everything, including voice calls.<p>* If possible, register the car and utilities under other people&#x27;s names or addresses.<p>* Again if possible, register utilities in another city under the victim&#x27;s name.<p>* Use email servers that use TLS for IMAP and SMTP. (Or just use webmail if through HTTPS)<p>* Considering hiring a private investigator to stalk the stalker. Hopefully this will make him more cautious and maybe the PI can even catch the stalker commiting some crime.')
