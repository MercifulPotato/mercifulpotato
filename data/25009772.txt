The variable <i>is the binding</i> changing the binding by throwing away the old one is not distinct from mutating it because the binding &quot;isn&#x27;t a real thing, just conceptual&quot;, just as the variable isn&#x27;t &quot;a real thing&quot;; unlike a value which is actually a thing sitting in a memory slot in your vm.  If you can give me an example of where there is a meaningful distinction between the variable and its lexical binding I am happy to be enlightened.')
