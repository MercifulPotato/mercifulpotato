Even for innocuous speech.<p>With Twitter and Facebook, almost all of us have a platform that reaches potentially millions of eyeballs.  That didn&#x27;t exist 20 years ago - back then, we&#x27;d have to self-publish newsletters, or literally speak from a soap box in the town square.<p>That said, it is a balancing act, and I&#x27;m not certain where that balance point is (and it possibly moves over time too).  But, the posts that have been shared from Parler were possibly illegal - they were planning armed sedition at best and a coup at worst - both of which are very much illegal and prosecutable. It wasn&#x27;t just unsavory speech - it was illegal speech, that Parler itself refused to moderate.')
