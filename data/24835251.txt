Stalin, as an educated non-wealthy person (he studied to become a priest), can easily be seen as someone who is a member of inteligentsia.<p>&gt; Which literally means every person participating in Russian politics is intelligentsia by this definition.<p>Tzar family or many of the old aristocratic families were not a member of intelligentsia and would probably be offended by the association. The key factor of being in inteligentsia was (from Wiki): &quot;people engaged in the complex mental labours&quot;. The higher classes didn&#x27;t do any labor.')
