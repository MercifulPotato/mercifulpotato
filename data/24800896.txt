I&#x27;m the only fulltime SWE at my company and it just gets exhausting managing 5 different products on completely different code bases&#x2F;technologies. Plus a web portal that does device management and reporting.<p>So a big thing people should consider when building something to scratch. Am I making something I can use again when I make my next product. Its a much higher mental load if you have no commonality between products. Also it can cause problems for sales, support and management when they have to remember nitty gritty details about each of your very divergent products.')
