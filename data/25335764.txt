Also even people who came from Germany said that it&#x27;s hard for them, and Swiss people never really take them in their social circle, that took away all my motivation. I could do everything in English though except the tax returns, it just didn&#x27;t feel like home to me, so like many others I came away.<p>Good luck fitting in for you when you get there!')
