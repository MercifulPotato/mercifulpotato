But being able to use symbols in method names has both pros and cons. You saying that it&#x27;s the worst thing of Scala is just very exaggerated, at least from my subjective perspective.<p>And yeah, you are totally right. Most people indeed choose the way of the least resistance and don&#x27;t want to spend much time learning a language - for good reasons. Scala will never be as popular as Python or Javascript. It is a language for people that are ready to invest more time and dedication to get a higher productivity after some time. Not everyone wants to do that and many people find it too hard.
