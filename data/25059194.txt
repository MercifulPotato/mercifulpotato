It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been working on for the last year, though in a sense, for much longer!\nEtebase is an open-source SDK and backend-as-a-service for building end-to-end encrypted applications. Think Firebase but end-to-end encrypted.<p>More users care about the privacy and security of their data every day, and encrypted applications are becoming mainstream. However, talking with developers, many get encryption wrong, and they don&#x27;t even realise it. As good cryptography and bad cryptography look identical to the untrained eye.<p>The idea behind Etebase is to make an easy-to-use API to enable developers to build encrypted apps, and it&#x27;s based on our learnings from building EteSync[2] over the years. There&#x27;s still a lot more to get done, but Etebase is already used in GNOME, KDE, Tasks.org, EteSync, and more. With libraries available for Rust, JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript, Java, Python and C&#x2F;C++.<p>I hope Etebase will enable a new age of privacy-first and end-to-end encrypted applications, and that our data will no longer be used to track, analyze and manipulate us. Your data, yours only. Let&#x27;s end-to-end encrypt everything!<p>I&#x27;d love to hear about your experience building encrypted applications. Got any questions? Suggestions?
