Outages are long and regular, electrical lines are old and flimsy. Every time there&#x27;s even a small rain, there&#x27;s no electricity.<p>It&#x27;s so bad that while traveling in India, I&#x27;ve seen electrical lines burning multiple times.<p>Also, India lacks its own energy sources and huge solar energy project was stopped by USA&#x2F;WTO (because they were unhappy that India doesn&#x27;t buy expensive solar panels from USA companies).')
