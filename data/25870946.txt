Now assume we append a new record and want to get the new result. The traditional approach is execute this query again. A better approach is to process this new record only by adding its value in A to the result of the previous query. It is important in (stateful) stream processing.<p>Something similar is implemented in these libraries which however rely on a different data processing conception (alternative to map-reduce):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asavinov&#x2F;prosto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asavinov&#x2F;prosto</a> - Functions matter!
