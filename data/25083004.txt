C# is an easy to use language and I would love to write some common code &#x2F; business logic &#x2F; whatever you name it in C# and expose it as webassembly and C&#x2F;C++, this would cover mobile, web and desktop workloads. You can do something like that with Rust (or at least they claim it, I never tried), but with C# I don&#x27;t see any _easy way_ doing it. I would be happy if someone could correct me If I&#x27;m wrong.')
