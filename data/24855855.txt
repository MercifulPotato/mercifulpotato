Item(by='strogonoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603353841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848530, text='&gt; Because the stories have been on all the news sites, it&#x27;s common knowledge, and thus it would be superfluous to submit detailed documentation every time it&#x27;s mentioned?<p>Those are the claims, yet every time I dig deeper I see how from “actively collaborating with authoritarian governments to shut down pro-democracy activism” they are reduced to “complying with local laws” within a single brief conversation.<p>Sure, in some countries the latter is a superset of the former. In such countries, violation of ethical norms could be required in some situations to comply with local law. However, it doesn’t mean that <i>any</i> instance of the latter always requires the former, <i>nor</i> that Apple had ever faced this choice, <i>nor</i> that if put in this situation Apple would agree to actually do the former as opposed to exiting the market (which, exiting, I suspect is a scenario CCP would very much prefer to avoid).<p>I will roughly delineate the difference based on two concrete example situations:<p>1) Complying with the requirement to store encryption keys for Chinese user data on Chinese servers = complying with local laws.<p>2) Providing personally identifiable information about individual Apple users at request of CCP, or helping CCP representatives hack into Apple devices = collaborating to shut down activism.<p>If you have any evidence of anything along the lines of (2), I’m all ears (as I’m sure is any tech journalist worth their salt).<p>&gt; Are you seriously saying I should pack my bags and leave the Apple ecosystem forever and no longer write software for the Mac or write blog posts about it?<p>I’ll level with you here. I’m not a professional Apple developer making a living from selling my software to end-users, but I dabble, and I am very deep in Apple’s hardware and software, preferring them to any other alternative in the market. It would be an extreme lifestyle change, but if I had reasons to believe that Apple had indeed <i>collaborated with CCP to shut down activism</i>, due to my personal views I would have to exit Apple’s ecosystem and start hacking on a PinePhone or something.<p>That said, if a country like China doesn’t want its citizens’ data encryption keys to live on servers in a country like the USA, I don’t believe that’s outrageous; if you’re an activist, you’ll be aware of that and make arrangements. There’s a line, but this does not cross that line as far as I’m concerned.')
