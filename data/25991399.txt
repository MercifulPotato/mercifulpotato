That&#x27;s not how it happens.<p>Person A covers their short by buying a share from Person B and returning to Person C. Person D then buys that share from Person C and returns to Person E to cover their short. That&#x27;s 2 short shares covered with a single underlying share and no failure to deliver.<p>Yes, the SEC does track failure to deliver, but &gt;100% short interest does not mean there is naked shorting nor does it imply there will be failure to deliver.')
