One of the programs for girls is very well funded by local startup money and gets designers, marketers, etc to make them fun.  The one for both boys and girls is volunteer run and while I respect and appreciate the effort, frankly it not fun and exciting at all.  It&#x27;s little better than someone just handing you a textbook to read.<p>I&#x27;m all for making STEM (coding especially) inclusive and welcoming for all.  Nobody should face discrimination or harassment based on gender (or any other attribute).  Unfortunately it&#x27;s the boys getting the shaft right now.  I can&#x27;t imagine the outrage that would happen if someone started a &quot;boys only&quot; program, yet it almost seems like that&#x27;s what needs to happen.  We&#x27;re back to the days of striving for &quot;separate but equal.&quot;')
