The non-negative matrix factorization on the first level kinda highlight some semantic groupings : paragraph, verbs, auxiliaries, commas, pronouns, nominal propositions.<p>I tried to look at higher level layers, and the grouping were indeed of higher level : for example at level 4 there was a grouping which highlighted for any punctuation (and not just comma). The grouping were also qualifying more : for example (&quot;would deliberately&quot; whereas at lower level it was just would).<p>But it&#x27;s not as clear as I had hoped it would be. I hoped it would somehow highlight grouping of higher and higher size, that could nicely map to the equivalent of a parse-tree.<p>The problem I have with this kind of visualizations, is that they often require interpretation. Also, they don&#x27;t tell me if the structure was really present by the neural network but was just not apparent because the prism of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization hid it.<p>For my own networks, instead of visualizing, I like to quantify things a little more. I give the neural network some additional layers, and I try to make the neural network produce the visualization directly. I give it some examples of what I&#x27;d like the visualization to look like, and jointly train&#x2F;fine-tune the neural network so that it solve simultaneously his original task, and the production of the visualization which is then easier to inspect.<p>Depending on how many additional layers I had to add, and depending on where they were added, and depending on how accurate (measured by a Loss Function!) the network prediction are, I can better infer how it&#x27;s working internally, and whether or not the network is really doing the work or if it is taking some mental shortcuts.<p>For example in my Colorify [1] browser extension, which aims to reduce the cognitive load of reading, I use neural networks to predict simultaneously visualizations of sentence-grouping, linguistic features, and even the parse-tree.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;colorify&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;colorify&#x2F;</a>')
