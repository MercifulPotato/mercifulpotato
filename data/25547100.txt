It&#x27;s a clear message that the strategy of independent manufacturers and vendors is far less effective, at least in a modern context. We&#x27;re going to see Apple eating up increasing amounts of the market, which is concerning when I particularly care about freedom and Apple is all too eager to lock everything down. We&#x27;re going to see other companies increasingly look to vertical integration on a scale that we haven&#x27;t seen in decades. In 50 years, there might not even be any independent manufacturers anymore. Either you buy in to the Apple stack or whoever owns the only other competing stack, if one exists. We&#x27;ll get to reminisce about the good old days when we could still choose which GPU&#x2F;CPU&#x2F;MB&#x2F;RAM&#x2F;etc to buy from which manufacturer for the price that we prefer.')
