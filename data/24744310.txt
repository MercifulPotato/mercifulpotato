And yet the president is having a rally with hundreds of people at White House with no social distancing.<p>And we are somehow to believe that there&#x27;s a plan to identify and protect vulnerable population while keeping the rest of the country running normal?<p>All the talk of &quot;virus or economic doom&quot; is false dichotomy - the truth is that America had a total leadership failure, which cost us both lives <i>and</i> economy, and now that it&#x27;s everywhere and we aren&#x27;t even pretending to trace the spread, we&#x27;re stuck in the trench, and there&#x27;s no way to get out.  We can either stay at home, ruining economy, until vaccines arrive, or we can pretend the virus is gone, reopening, inviting the second wave, thereby killing more people <i>and</i> also ruining economy.')
