People act upset because they spend money on a product they cannot use. It&#x27;s not for me to discuss if it&#x27;s even legal, but if it is, then the only thing to discuss is if it&#x27;s fair, which is a philosophical question. I, on the other hand, wouldn&#x27;t buy this stuff anyway, I don&#x27;t want to do anything with Facebook, I don&#x27;t want to have an account. The problem is, it&#x27;s a fucking monopoly, so not wanting to do stuff is Facebook doesn&#x27;t align well with living normal life. Gyms, clubs and hobbyist communities don&#x27;t even bother making websites anymore. All news and meetup days will be on Facebook. But if I&#x27;m not a registered user, I cannot see them. Now, is this fair? This is just as philosophical question, as with not being able to use stuff you paid for.<p>So, of course I wish for Facebook to die. But it&#x27;s not very realistic to hope it actually will.')
