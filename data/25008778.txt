Item(by='barrkel', descendants=None, kids=[25009533], score=None, time=1604679862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008380, text='I think a battery sufficient to realistically replace alternator output would be too large and expensive.<p>Car alternator output is on the order of 1 to 2kW. A battery [1] which can do ~1kWh - 100A at 12V - is about $300 and weighs 12kg. It&#x27;s also big - 40x20x25cm - stick it in your boot and you&#x27;ll notice the space reduction.<p>That would just do 1 hour, at the lowest level of alternator output. If you need more power or more range, double it; more of both, double it again.<p>The next question to ask is do you trust keeping a $300 Chinese battery in your car without it blowing up? You probably want a reseller who&#x27;ll stand behind their products, ensure the supply chain maintains quality, has sufficient safeguards, etc. The price is going to go up even more.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;1KWH-Deep-Cycle-LiFePO4-12V-100Ah_60250913806.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;1KWH-Deep-Cycle-LiFeP...</a>')
