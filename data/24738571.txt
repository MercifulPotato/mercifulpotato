Item(by='madeofpalk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602333818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738411, text='My latest iPhone died after cycling in the rain with it for a little too long after it was previously dropped and cracked, and I&#x27;m back to my iPhone X (3 years old) and it&#x27;s perfectly fine, more or less indistinguishable in performance from my latest one.<p>I wasn&#x27;t planning on upgrading this year (a first), but this model has a dodgy mute switch that I never got fixed, so it looks like I will be after all.')
