When the electrical engineers pick the ecosystem they are not stupid enough to just use whatever tooling comes with the ecosystem for free, they spend $50k&#x2F;year per engineer(!) to buy adequate tools to make their engineers productive. In contrast, software engineers and their engineering organizations are happy to waste equally valuable engineers just to save a couple bucks; it is insanity. In what other industry is a $10k expenditure an instant deal-breaker when investing in the productivity of an employee who costs more than $100k&#x2F;yr? Companies invest more in the productivity of their truck drivers and admins than they do in software engineers. We are extremely valuable employees and we should demand that our companies invest reasonable amounts into actually making us productive instead of just tossing us the scraps since they are harming their own profitability by doing so. I mean, think of all the awesome tools that would make our jobs easier and more productive if our productivity were valued even half as much as the average electrical engineer.')
