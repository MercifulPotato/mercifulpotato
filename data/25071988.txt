I just moved to Austin without GF(s)&#x2F;FWBs, a friend network, or any social media other than anon posting here and there. I am noticing the females here are more receptive per attractiveness and cool factor compared to the relative to the west coast, but not as much as outlying college towns nearby, and that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m looking for more than getting eye f&#x27;d &quot;lucky&quot; by a Texas Tech or State cheerleader, unless she&#x27;s also a microbiology postdoc, reads Vonnegut or Nabokov, or welds reclaimed metal art installations. I can&#x27;t, and never could, stand party people who do nothing by float down the river of time without delving into anything substantially.<p>Don&#x27;t get married unless being together for a long time (10 years plus), require it for legal reasons, and not without a prenup.<p>Don&#x27;t let anyone move anything in without a palnup.

Do you trust them with your life?<p>4. Are you better together than apart? (Are they much more beneficial to you than a liability?)<p>5.

Develop your skills and lifestyle. People who do the bare minimum to satisfy the label of a database administrator and expect to land a supermodel astronaut are woefully unrealistic. For example, I&#x27;ve been restoring a mid 80&#x27;s VW camper soup-to-nuts except for major bodywork and upholstery fabrication, getting into paramotoring, and looking at dance studios for ballroom dance with the goals of Viennese waltz, dusting-off  Argentine tango, and salsa. And I cook like a m&#x27;f&#x27;cker, which is probably why I need to lose 40 lbs. &#x2F; 22 kg. of nasty-ass cutaneous fat, cut calories&#x2F;do IF&#x2F;up protein, and hit the gym like corona is going to close it forever. :)<p>Unfortunately, like hiring or investing, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a scalable way of pairing people or due-diligencing them thoroughly enough to lead to trust and compatibility. It seems only with focused filtering and meeting say many hundreds people (as the calibration phase of the optimal search strategy algorithm) that there would be enough worthy opportunities to pursue.<p>-&gt;&gt; Ask lots of questions and listen.')
