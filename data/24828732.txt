I, personally, work as a programmer while not having a doctorate of math (which would disappoint Turing) nor writing my code as formally proven statements (which would disappoint Djikstra).  I do my work (along with the vast majority of Americans in the workforce) on a computer which, if breaks, I can only hold up towards the sky and hope some divine intervention fixes - I don&#x27;t know the conductivity of copper nor the tensile strength of silicon.  I also can only guess at what the majority of people actually do with their computers.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m pro-computers because I&#x27;ve got enough familiarity to know it&#x27;s not a terrible idea and I know that some smart people are intimately involved with computers and so I trust it to all work out.<p>I am similarly unfamiliar with specific climate studies but trust that climate change is a real issue that needs to be addressed.  I&#x27;m not going to start calling out a climate denier at a party with specific points of relevance because I don&#x27;t have a solid grasp of things and, honestly, don&#x27;t tend to do that at parties - but I&#x27;ll still look on with judgement at climate deniers as I&#x27;m firmly of the opinion (based on popular science) that they&#x27;re making baseless claims.')
