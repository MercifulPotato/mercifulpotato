Nobody was stupid. We humans just can&#x27;t really predict what will work out and what won&#x27;t in the future, and this was one of those frustrating cases like carving in stone, where every mistake you make is permanent.<p>But a combination of various factors made the web an enormously impactful medium. It&#x27;s too important to take the approach of &quot;well, let&#x27;s just add some good stuff to the bad and live with it&quot; where we don&#x27;t have to. We have to in the browser, but we don&#x27;t have to on the server. I want to see the &quot;benefit of hindsight, rebuild it better&quot; design of TypeScript matched with a server-side equivalent, which looks like Deno.<p>I hope Deno succeeds.')
