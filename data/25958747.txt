Why does society owe floating a coder bros data science project?<p>Anything not science is a meme. That billionaires should exist is a meme. This is social philosophy, not truth. And it’s gamed.<p>America is a bubble in time and it’s having a real (environmental) impact on the future.<p>Billionaires are not experts. They’re rich and can pay the fines and schmooze.
