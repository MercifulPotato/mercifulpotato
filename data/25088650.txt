No mention of rendering audio&#x2F;video projects, for example. These are not the workloads Apple mentions when it wants to emphasize industry-leading power. (I mean, really, color grading?)<p>This MBP13 <i>is</i> a replacement for the previous MBP13; but the previous MBP13 was not a workstation either. It was a slightly-less-thermally-constrained thin-and-light. It existed almost entirely to be “the Air, but with cooling bolted on until it achieves the performance Intel originally promised us we could achieve in the Air’s thermal envelope.”<p>Note that, now that Apple are mostly free of that thermal constraint, the MBA and MBP13 are near-identical. Very likely the MBP13 is going away, and this release was just to satisfy corporate-leasing upgrade paths.')
