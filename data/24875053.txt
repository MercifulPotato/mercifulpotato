Actually, I don&#x27;t think that will ever happen -- look at how much effort&#x2F;innocent lives&#x2F;etc we expended for the Iran deal.<p>These countries will try to source fuel from their most powerful regional neighbor, who might not be on best terms with the US, which would inflame everyone, and for that reason, US&#x2F;the West will not ever give up the keys to the kingdom.')
