I specifically mentioned features that can easily be made zero cost on both CPU and GPU targets.<p>In fact, those aren&#x27;t special features  and there is no other subset. Those are the core abstractions on which everything in Julia, down to primitive types and wrappers for llvm intrinsics are built. Without them you wouldn&#x27;t have Julia.<p>Julia&#x27;s GPU ecosystem wouldn&#x27;t be where it is with just one or two people maintaining it without being able to reuse those features to plug into existing machinery.')
