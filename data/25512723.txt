And I feel bad about it. But aside from horrible spyware, I don&#x27;t see any good solution that would make exams more fair for the &quot;lone wolf&quot; students. My approach is to grade in a way that&#x27;s disproportionately harsh when I see multiple similar-but-wrong answers and lenient when I see a unique wrong answer.')
