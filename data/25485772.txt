I think they were saying that just because the OS has RAM compression doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s like doubling the RAM on other operating systems, and that&#x27;s even before you consider that those other operating systems have RAM compression too.  Saying something is like having 16 GB of RAM when you can&#x27;t actually use it as 16 GB of RAM deserves to be called out.')
