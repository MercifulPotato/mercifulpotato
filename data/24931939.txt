All existing predictions I&#x27;ve seen have been way out of error margins - and stuff like thawing ice and releasing trapped methane etc. can have huge non-linear contributions.<p>Saying that X% cut in emissions is going to reduce temperature increase by Y on Z timescale is just wishful thinking, and we don&#x27;t even have mechanisms to enforce X% cut across the world.<p>Investing in technology that could help settle Mars is a way to protect from the inescapable negative climate effects we will have to live with, the sooner we start to deal with those the better (eg. start building for hurricanes&#x2F;floods&#x2F;large temperature differences, etc.)')
