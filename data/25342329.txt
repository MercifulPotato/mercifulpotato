Just putting the fact that I just downloaded a user manual for a multi planetary spacecraft in PDF format into historical context, if you think about how thus all came together it really is amazing.<p>We went from &quot;this guy is nuts&quot; to &quot;oh yeah this is probably going to happen.&quot; When Tesla first came into public view, the idea that a car entirely electric powered that drives itself developed by a brand new car company was ridiculous to most people. This guy just said it matter of factly and everyone just kinda said OK dude. Then it happened. Then he said that there was going to be a rocket that lands itself, run privately. Then he says that they are going to build a human settlement on mars. Then worldwide high speed satellite internet. Now you can actually get it in some places. Now, they&#x27;re going to high altitude test this giant rocket that will be able to carry 100 people tomorrow morning.<p>100 people. That&#x27;s insane. Everything this guy says he&#x27;s going to do is insane, the timelines are insane, but now everyone is kind of like &quot;yeah, sounds about right&quot; as if the world has always been like this. In 20 years this guy and all the engineers he hired have done absolutely incredible things that we take for granted. Tomorrow they&#x27;re going to perform a high altitude test of a rocket designed to take 100 people to mars. I just read a user manual for an interplanetary spacecraft with the capacity of a small commercial airliner. I&#x27;m glad to be alive in this age.')
