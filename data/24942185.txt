I try to clamp down every unnecessary email, marketing message, notification, etc. that I receive and I still feel like I&#x27;m in a fog of &quot;engagement spam.&quot; Instagram let&#x27;s me know that some random person I might know just got on Instagram. Photos reminds me of some random dinner I had this day five years ago with an ex. Reddit says this random topic I don&#x27;t care about is &quot;trending.&quot; Facebook seems to have moved half the news feed into a parallel feed in the &quot;notifications&quot; area. &quot;Someone you barely know just posted for the first time in a while, check it out!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m borderline anal about managing which notifications I allow if a particular service lets you adjust them at all, but I feel like I&#x27;m constantly turning off some new one that they must have added and opted me into by default. I know I can turn them off for an app entirely, but sometimes I legitimately want a &quot;ding&quot; if a friend sends me a message. Yet I still feel like I&#x27;m in a constant haze of pointless &quot;notifications&quot; that are not about some event I need or even want to know about it. It&#x27;s just attention theft, where a hostile computer program acts of it&#x27;s own accord to cause my brain to have thoughts I didn&#x27;t intend to have and waste my precious attention. I didn&#x27;t ask for it to remind me of something, or let me know when a specific thing happens. This isn&#x27;t even a &quot;notification.&quot; It&#x27;s just spam funneled into a channel that spammers know we haven&#x27;t completely tuned out yet. They&#x27;ll strip mine it until nobody bothers to pay attention to notifications anymore, and then they&#x27;ll move to the next channel that still has any attention left in it.<p>If I could request any feature from Apple right now, it would be to treat &quot;attention grabbing&quot; as strictly as it has access to the device&#x27;s camera or photos. Instead of a blanket &quot;allow notifications,&quot; make developers register exactly which notifications they want to send with a predefined message template. Let me easily switch each of those templates on or off in the general settings app instead of having to hunt through the settings pages of the app itself (if it offers the option to tweak notifications at all).')
