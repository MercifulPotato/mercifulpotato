It strongly feels like he&#x27;s explaining how one point follows from the next, but he isn&#x27;t.<p>For instance: in Hypernormalization he tries to make the point that there&#x27;s some kind of relationship between Western algorithmic social media and terrorism. A lot of people would agree this is plausible.<p>But he doesn&#x27;t actually explore this point. Instead he just observes that Judea Pearl is a machine learning researcher, and his son Daniel Pearl was beheaded by al-Qaeda members, with the videos uploaded to YouTube, which also uses machine learning (never mind that it&#x27;s not the kind Judea Pearl worked on).<p>It&#x27;s just a bunch of correspondences without any actual relationship.')
