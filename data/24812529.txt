The following seem to be absolutely truisms:<p>1. The <i>second</i> a company is bought out by PE, all the good employees run for the exits. Corporate America isn&#x27;t exactly known for its empathy and compassion, but working for a PE-owned company means you can be sure the ownership gives 0 shits about anyone working at the company. I have never heard anything but horror stories of those working for PE-owned shops.<p>2. Given #1, it means the products of said companies always turn to shit pretty fast.<p>This makes me really wonder about how PE firms can really work their financial magic in the long term. Perhaps they&#x27;re just better at extracting value out of companies that are already declining in the first place, so they just suck the blood dry before they discard of the carcass?')
