They just don&#x27;t serve the information I would pay for, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the clickbaity &quot;free&quot; online &quot;content&quot; is a legit business model.<p>I want sober, on point, timely information on matters of shared&#x2F;common interest, filtered by journalistic overview, contextualization and reliable sourcing. With the option to subscribe to niche content additions, e.g. art, culture, but of course news shouldn&#x27;t be a comfort zone only, either. I don&#x27;t want to co-pay for the clear special interests like the sports&#x2F;soccer or housing section, at all. And I won&#x27;t ever pay for opinionated outrage and intellectual masturbation, because nothing else happened or feels like anything at the moment. I don&#x27;t want some mind-numbing four page zeitgeist piece on cancel culture which starts by making associative yak shaving a storytelling virtue. I want to be briefed in the morning, by my personal intelligence service, like madame president.<p>Publishers are not struggling, they are throwing a fit over a changing information access reality, for 15 years or something. If they cry just a bit longer now, their economic niche is gonna be completely absorbed by technological answers to the question of &quot;What&#x27;s going on?&quot;.')
