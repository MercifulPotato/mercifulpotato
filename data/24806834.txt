It&#x27;s that Excel is widely used and is its own programming language with a comprehensive standard library, and I don&#x27;t mean VBA - entering the = character in a cell opens up a massive library of functions which can be used in a fashion sort of similar to functional languages, since everything is nested functions.<p>There&#x27;s branching. There&#x27;s Boolean operations. There&#x27;s variables (cells, which is ultimately the point of the entire exercise). There&#x27;s even a switch construct. There&#x27;s even really simple web requests! All of these are of course functions. The only thing that&#x27;s missing is function definitions (which can be done with VBA, but I excluded that specifically for the sake of this exercise).<p>It&#x27;s not particularly pretty, but is usable by almost anyone, has good documentation, and a huge community of like-minded power users. As you mentioned, Excel doesn&#x27;t have any of the constructs which help developers for other languages to avoid mistakes. The simple syntax, users which are not necessarily aware of good practices, and a lack of methods to implement such practices produces a perfect storm of factors to introduce bugs.')
