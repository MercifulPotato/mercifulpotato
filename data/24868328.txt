Normal hammer with wooden handles, normal planes, etc etc.<p>But there are modern carpenters that have hammers that are 100% metal and never break and actually improve your hammering power.  The new electric hand planes work a <i>lot</i> faster, though you do have to be more careful because they can get out of hand quicker.  etc etc.<p>In the end, they both build houses.  The old-school carpenters might take longer, and they might have to know more techniques, but they get there in the end.<p>On the other hand, the modern carpenters sometimes go a littler overboard with their tools and have problems that old-school carpenters don&#x27;t have, especially with their tools randomly stopping working in the middle of a job.  It might not be often, but it happens.<p>To add to that, the old-school carpenters can actually use a lot of the new tools, too.  They fit into the workflow and can be adapted to their old tools.  It&#x27;s just that they primarily stick with their old tools because they&#x27;re used to them.<p>It&#x27;s kind of interesting how much the world of woodworking and software development overlaps in that way.')
