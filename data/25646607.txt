In interviews with Radio Free Asia in 2020, residents and officials of Shufu County (Kona Sheher), Kashgar Prefecture (Kashi) stated that it was no longer possible to perform traditional Uyghur nikah marriage rites in the county.<p>Such a policy against nikah marriages would also affect other Muslims, not just Uyghurs.<p>&gt; Combined with some forced sterilization and forced contraception and you get a “mild” form of genocide that destroys a people without producing mass graves.<p>Similarly, forced sterilization has been part of government restrictions on reproduction for decades, and although the limit has been raised with the abandonment of the one-child policy, there&#x27;s still a limit. So it doesn&#x27;t just affect all non-Uyghur Muslims in China as well, but actually everyone. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia&#x2F;after-one-child-policy-outrage-at-chinas-offer-to-remove-iuds.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;world&#x2F;asia&#x2F;after-one-chil...</a>')
