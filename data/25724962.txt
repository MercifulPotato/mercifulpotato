The US Capitol riots is the specific moment that made them all wake up?<p>Why shouldn&#x27;t it be?<p>For 4 years they said &quot;we won&#x27;t suspend a sitting president because we recognize our role in society but once Trump&#x27;s not sitting he&#x27;s fair game for bans&quot;<p>I mean POTUS threatened nuclear war on their _social media platform_ and they let it go...<p>-<p>It&#x27;s quite simple, allowing sitting POTUS special privileges was a means to avoid limiting the reach of the American leadership to its people.<p>Well now Trump&#x27;s a lame duck, and he was abusing the sitting president loophole to turn social media into a lightning rod for groups like the one that stormed the Capitol...<p>The math must have been very simple for them: give him 12? more days of increasing unhinged antics when he&#x27;s already supposed to have started transitioning power... or don&#x27;t.<p>tl;dr: It&#x27;s no conspiracy that he was deplatformed right before the end of his term, the combination of the Capitol attack being triggered by him <i>and</i> the fact he was already on his way out was all it took.<p>You ascribe the timing part to greed, but it&#x27;s even more easily easily ascribed to not wanting to censor the POTUS if possible while they&#x27;re in power...<p>Donald Trump didn&#x27;t suddenly become less profitable to Twitter after the Capitol attack, if anything he would have been more profitable.
