I wasn&#x27;t putting it forward as the sole factor but to me it seems more likely that this among other things like the police reporting differently because they&#x27;re mad playing a bigger roll in a bloody 112% increase. That&#x27;s a whole lot you realise that right?<p>Which brings me back to some of those questions left unanswered:<p>How do you tie a bit more than 1% decrease in budget to a 112% increase in shootings?<p>Do you have any reasonable argument for that?<p>Why do they spend such a ridiculously insane amount per employee, in total or however which way you want to calculate it?<p>Can you justify this given the results?')
