Once I use a different treshold than that, it becomes very difficult to fly at all.<p>I mean all else being equal (Two planes to London leaving at almost exactly the same time and exactly the same cost) then perhaps I&#x27;d prefer the A32X. But the point is <i>all else isn&#x27;t equal</i>. It becomes a matter of how many hundred you want to spend to fly the Airbus. Or how many hours you want to spend at the airport waiting for the non-Max flight. And I&#x27;ll happily take the MAX if it saves me 30 minutes or $20. And I&#x27;ll take my family along too without hesitation.')
