I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have very reasonable commutes in all my jobs, but WFH is much better than my 25-30 minute commutes. I no longer get the &quot;it&#x27;s 5:50PM but can you take a quick look at this because you&#x27;re the only one still here&quot; issues that had me commuting home at 7 or 8 pm every few weeks.  And then there&#x27;s the 20 hours a week of time I get to play with my kid, do chores, or relax.  Sure I still get the occasional slack message mid evening, but that was happening before WFH as well.  There are downsides around ease of communication and sense of camaraderie, but work life balance&#x2F;separation has been pretty much 100% win.')
