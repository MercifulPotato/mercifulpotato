Thus I wrote a program that does 99% of heavy lifting. It contains a database of ingredients I commonly use and their nutritional values. I have a set of recipes that I tend to make mostly the same way, the only thing that differs is the relative amount of ingredients that go into the sauce for example. I measure those when I meal prep, and then I only need to weigh the ~homogenic components of each portion. The program does everything else including macro tracking, daily weight loss estimates etc. This is extremely sustainable and it removes all of the guess work. So far it&#x27;s been scarily accurate which in turn has kept motivation high.')
