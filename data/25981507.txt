I am skeptical that you can convince every single poacher to stop poaching and become tour guides. I am also skeptical that the person paying money for ground elephant tusk elixirs is going to view a vacation as a suitable substitute.<p>Reducing demand certainly helps, but tourism and poaching are not exclusive markets, you can have tourism and poaching happening at the same time -- and demand for one isn&#x27;t necessarily going to reduce demand for the other. If 100 people are giving tours, and 20 people are deciding that they&#x27;d still rather just shoot elephants because they don&#x27;t like dealing with tourists, then you still end up with zero elephants. Reducing demand is only going to be one part of the puzzle, a slight reduction isn&#x27;t enough on its own to solve the problem.<p>And regardless, looking at market demand as a part of the solution is still kind of missing the point. Sure, we might be able to leverage some market forces to help with the overall problem, but it&#x27;s still a problem regardless of what the market says about it. The market in this case is at best a tool, it doesn&#x27;t define what the right outcome should be.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the vast minority of people rich enough to spend money on this prefer elephant tusks or tours. It should not be their choice to make. We don&#x27;t want the market to decide whether or not we have mass extinctions. If we end up with zero elephants, saying, &quot;well, the market just didn&#x27;t create enticing tours, so we&#x27;ll never have elephants again&quot; is not a valid response.<p>What percentage of the population is rich enough to go on wildlife tours to another country? They don&#x27;t have the right to choose for everyone else whether or not elephants go extinct.')
