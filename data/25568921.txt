In there I randomly picked from the bibliographic references, just to double check: is this so?<p>The second link I&#x27;ve provided above might be the us english language precursor of the book I&#x27;ve read.  It has the same primary author and it came up when I googled for the German one.  So they seem to be tightly related.  I don&#x27;t know if that has a comparably thorough bibliography, though.  And the referenced books from the bibliography were 90% German language papers, agriculture, weaving machines, nutrition, pharmacology, what have you.<p>So: I suggest the above linked books :-)')
