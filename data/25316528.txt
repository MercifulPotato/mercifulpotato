Item(by='camgunz', descendants=None, kids=[25317549], score=None, time=1607190415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310760, text='&gt; Persons B, C, and D are being paid a rate proportionate to the available labor market for their product building skill set.<p>The labor market doesn&#x27;t set prices based on value to society and scarcity. If it did, nurses and teachers would be millionaires (there&#x27;s a shortage of both and they provide high value to society) and middle managers would make very little (there&#x27;s a glut and they provide very little value to society). It assigns value based on prestige. Capitalist labor market folks would argue strongly otherwise, but the evidence is very clear.<p>The law of supply and demand also doesn&#x27;t explain or account for things like race&#x2F;gender pay gaps, monopsonies, and collusion. And generally this doesn&#x27;t pass the sniff test--if the labor market shifts and suddenly people in your profession are in higher demand, it&#x27;s extremely rare that companies offer pay raises to keep their employees. That&#x27;s because they know that while theoretically their employees can reenter the labor market to negotiate a higher salary with a different employer, in practice employment is very sticky and employees tend not to--for lots of rational reasons (some of which are &quot;oh you&#x27;re a job hopper, declined&quot;).<p>&gt; There was nothing stopping persons B, C, or D from being person A and founding a company for that idea.<p>This is generally untrue. Companies build moats with patents, litigation, monopolistic business practices, and corrupt, ladder pulling litigation. I think a lot of committed capitalists believe the market will sort this out, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t. How many upstart chip design houses are there? How many upstart medical device companies are there? Etc. Etc.<p>Furthermore and again, not everyone has the privilege required to be A. Being A takes more risk, and you have to have more resources to reasonably take that risk. It&#x27;s also been shown that it&#x27;s far harder for women, recent immigrants, and people of color to become As.<p>&gt; Anybody can make a giant sized, billion dollar company.<p>What?<p>&gt; Those workers chose to work as employees under standard labor terms.<p>Often people don&#x27;t have the resources to start businesses (let alone billion dollar businesses). It requires a lot of privilege, and it&#x27;s even harder for women and people of color. It&#x27;s not at all a simple choice.<p>&gt; The early Microsoft employees that made lots of money from their stock options probably aren&#x27;t bitter about their compensation.<p>While being pretty tough to prove, I would say a couple things here:<p>- Microsoft continues to post multi-billion dollar profits, and people still work there. I don&#x27;t understand why early employees are valued more than current employees here.<p>- It&#x27;s conceivable that even if you made a few million dollars, you might be bitter if the person next to you who didn&#x27;t work appreciably harder than you made a billion. Everyone&#x27;s different but, that seems possible.<p>- Even if these effects are less pronounced or acceptable at a place like Microsoft, concentrations of wealth and capital have destabilizing, corrupting effects on society and governments. Taking a per-company view is short sighted. It&#x27;s also worth saying that most companies aren&#x27;t made up of relatively wealth software engineers, and income inequality will be more pronounced.')
