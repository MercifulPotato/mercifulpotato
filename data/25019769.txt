Biden himself is dismissed as being not left enough by a lot the online population from what I can see.<p>Because he wasn&#x27;t the the fashionable choice for Democratic nomination (Sanders) he&#x27;s reduced to being just an old guy who isn&#x27;t Trump but is in the right party without anyone even bothering to even read his Wikipedia page or look up some of his speeches on youtube.<p>He&#x27;s a passionate politician and an empathic speaker who has the experience to be a realist and appeal to republican voters too. He&#x27;s exactly what is needed right now.<p>Sanders wouldn&#x27;t have had a chance to get in, but even if he did he would just polarise things even further.')
