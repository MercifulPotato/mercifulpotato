The study would need to have a wide variety of safety numbers, and all the cars are theoretical.  If 4-5x lines up with a claim about a real car, it&#x27;s probably a coincidence.  Saying there&#x27;s not enough data about real cars has no bearing on this research at all, unless the abstract is wildly misleading.<p>You replied to someone talking about <i>waiting</i> for autonomous cars to be 4-5x as safe.  That means they are waiting for a car to meet that threshold <i>with correct statistics</i>.  You can&#x27;t call out nonexistent statistics as being a lie!')
