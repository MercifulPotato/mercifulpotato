For example, I happen to know now (though I didn&#x27;t know when I started the stumblingon project) that there are a couple other similar sites that exist.  However, when I originally googled &quot;Stumble Upon&quot; and phrases like &quot;Stumble Upon Alternative&quot; or &quot;Stumble Upon Clone&quot; I never saw any of the others that do exist.  Instead, it is&#x2F;was mostly &quot;Top N Stumble Upon Alternatives&quot;-type listicles that weren&#x27;t very good and would suggest things like &quot;Facebook&quot;.  Oddly, the top result, for me, for &quot;Stumble Upon Clone&quot; is this weird website [1] which I think is selling Stumble Upon clones, like - they will make a Stumble Upon clone for you.
