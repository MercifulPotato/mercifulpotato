Adding missing specs is less creative than designing a software system. It’s weird that adding specs to a product requirement is your example of creativity.<p>2. The correct solution is the boring one? What on earth are you basing this assertion on. Is your worldview so reductionist that you actually think this kind’ve statement contains any true or valuable information?<p>3. Predictable, maintainable, error-free software is more dependent on choosing&#x2F;formulating the correct abstractions (which is very much a creative process) than following a checklist of “bricklaying” steps.<p>4. You seem to be confusing boring with correct and fun&#x2F;pet with creative. Neither of these are equivalent.<p>It’s a shame because I assume you hold these opinions out of ignorance, which means you’ve never had the chance to build software in a creative, challenging environment where following a checklist would certainly result in failure. And I sympathize with anyone who hasn’t gotten to experience what’s truly special about this profession: the creative process.')
