Of course you can find questions that don&#x27;t have a definitive answer for programs (or program parts) written in any programming language. Much more so in a less rigid language. That doesn&#x27;t say anything about problem solving abilities, though.<p>&gt; This same argument applies to all sorts of DSLs too. Many use a similar type-based approach, e.g. linear types forbid expressions like &#x27;if (bar()) { free(myMemory); }&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s nice, but the concern I expressed in my original post is - at what cost?')
