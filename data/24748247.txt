That said, perhaps the military would end up getting involved, if the threat was serious enough.<p>&gt;Sure this might be headed by the USA as per usual, but the current situation is not one I think we should desire as a global populace.<p>Okay, right now, remove the USA from their global role. Who do you want to fill the void? Remember that sudden power vacuums allow bad actors to fill in (ISIS being the most modern example of such).<p>As controversial as it may sound, the USA still allows for the greatest expressions of liberty of any country, period. It ain&#x27;t perfect, but no representative system is.<p>&gt;But don&#x27;t fool me that the USA does no such similar tactics as well, perhaps a tad bit more convoluted, through side companies for example<p>Of course we do.<p>Unless a treaty is signed explicitly condemning such behavior, every country possessing or seeking power meddles with domestic politics of other countries. Political power derives its strength from perception. If a domestic populace views their leaders as capable, political power increases, and vice versa. This reality is used by militaries and intelligence services to influence domestic and foreign nations.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re China, you attempt to convince the USA population to perceive their government as weak, ineffective, and non-representative, and you simultaneously tell the USA population that China is a worthy successor to the USA and is totally not a threat. If the population is unaware of these efforts (often spanning years if not decades), you have a fairly high success rate, as you are fabricating an alternate reality which is deemed plausible enough to pass as truth. Raise a whole generation on this reality, and you&#x27;ve laid a new foundation for that society. (For more information on the topic, look up &quot;psychological operations&quot;.)')
