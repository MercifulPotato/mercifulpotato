There is a lot of money to be made in options, but no one wants to give you free alpha. The market like any other system can be reversed engineered. I&#x27;ll give you a hint, learn how the VIX is calculated.<p>Also if you believe just buying the S&amp;P 500 is going to be most profitable, then why not buy deep ITM calls on SPY.
