Item(by='ulrikrasmussen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609953493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652943, text='I got hooked on peanut butter during a 6 month stay in the US and have also noticed a lot of variety in the products available here (Denmark). I really dislike most of the products, but have found a discount brand that is now my favorite.<p>All of them are 99% peanuts, so I also wonder where the variety in taste comes from. My own theory is that it is a combination of the following: 1. How much the peanuts are roasted. 2. How much of the peanut ends up in the product. Some have a strong bitter taste that I suspect is from skins that haven&#x27;t been properly separated from the peanuts. 3. Emulsifiers. 4. Oils and 5. Sugars.')
