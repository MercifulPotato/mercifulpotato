These resources that spammers have can be applied as easily to re&#x2F;hcaptcha (either through ML or clickfarms). No CAPTCHA will actually lock out targeted attacks.<p>The difficulty increase per IP can be seen as a form of soft rate limiting, it&#x27;s shared between all websites (which is where it&#x27;s different from ordinary rate limiting). In the future we may use IP reputation lists to guide the initial difficulty too - but we haven&#x27;t implemented that yet.<p>I think that no perfect captcha can exist, which is inherent to the problem. Proof of work makes different fradeoffs, and perhaps it is cheaper to attack still - I think it&#x27;s a much more friendly solution for users though (accessibility, privacy, simplicity, fairness, UX).<p>Maybe in the future the solution would be something like this: a long PoW-based captcha that runs in the background as well as a vision task for the user, whichever gets solved first.')
