As the angle of the sun lowers the UV rays get filtered by the atmosphere, which is why in winter you can&#x27;t make Vitamin D if you are too far away from the equator.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that if the body produces that much Vitamin D3 that it&#x27;s probably safe to take that much as a supplement.')
