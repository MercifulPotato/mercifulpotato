Our goal is to transform the way that business extend offers to candidates and information that candidates can use to compare offers. Our goal is to make the offer and compensation negotiation experience 100x better for engineers looking for jobs as well as the folks that hire them.<p>We&#x27;re going to be ingesting a massive amount of compensation data to build our total-compensation&#x2F;rewards engine. There are tons of super interesting problems around how to ingest, sanitize, normalize and present comp&#x2F;equity data in a way that allows candidates the best possible understanding of their salary and equity.<p>Join us if you are passionate about pay equity, transparency, and generally making the process of applying for jobs and working with candidates an overall more humane, fair, and equitable experience.<p>PYTHON, REACT, SQL, AIRFLOW, POSTGRES, SNOWFLAKE, DATA VISUALIZATION, DATA SCIENCE')
