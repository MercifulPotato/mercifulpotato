But, the first few told me &quot;this is the optimal solution&quot;, then I hit the xor gate, and I can get either &quot;this uses the fewest nand gates but it can be done with fewer components&quot; or &quot;this uses the fewest components, but it can be done with fewer nand gates&quot;.. Does this imply that there is no optimal solution, or just that I&#x27;ve not yet found it?')
