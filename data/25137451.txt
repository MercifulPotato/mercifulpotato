Open up iOS because it is actually an all-purpose computer system for the pocket and not an appliance.<p>800 Euro for the smallest iPhone? Well, that is incredible much. Okay Apple provides reliable upgrades and updates. And then you beat out 30% of 2 Euro for a small application out from a developer? Wow. That&#x27;s capitalistic greed. Aside from that Apple earned already money with selling an expensive Mac to the developer at minimum and another 100 $ for the developer access.<p>And all of that after Trump has allowed you to legalize all earnings for which Apple didn&#x27;t payed taxes. It&#x27;s incredible how a company like Apple still plays the role of &quot;the good hip guys company&quot;.')
