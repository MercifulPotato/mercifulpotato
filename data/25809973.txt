My old company’s HR added “university” to their regular internal training series (complete with a “certificate” that we would get after each mandatory class).<p>I took seminars throughout my career, and a number were dubbed “university” (Like Apple’s famous —and long-defunct— “Developer University” —DU. I still have the certificates they gave me).<p>Personally, I find it potentially misleading, but seldom actually nefarious. It does dilute the cachet of the word, though.')
