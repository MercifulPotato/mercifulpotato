I know, because here in Munich we have some infrastructure like this, not as much as the Dutch, but some.<p>Now, how many six year olds do you think can safely &#x27;take the lane&#x27; on busy American arterials independently from their parents? The idea is absurd on its face.<p>I have actual experience here with our son being as young as five, biking on city streets with us, and not just the calm local residential roads, something I would never do in the states at that age, and certainly not having him &#x27;take the lane&#x27;. If I did that, I&#x27;d probably be getting a talking to from CPS, and rightly so.')
