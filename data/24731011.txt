I am talking about how information is presented to us, and how we are put in a position of having to accept whatever is presented despite not being presented any evidence.  This is not a conspiracy, it is logic.<p>The video is saying that information is presented to us in such a way that it is impossible to know whether it is true or false.  When you edit the shots and do not present a single continuous shot, you have disabled the audience&#x27;s ability to discern for themselves.  And even if we were presented with an uncut edit, with CGI technology being as good as it is, we still cannot be sure nowadays.<p>The effect of being presented with endless streams of information like this, throughout our lives, in school and on TV, is that our ability to be clear about what we know is overwhelmed.  And our nature is that we accept it all.  We have been trained to sit back and accept whatever we are told.  What&#x27;s irritating to me is that we also have the front to call that &#x27;knowledge&#x27;.  When we see something like the crow &#x27;science&#x27; in that film, we think we know.  But we do not.  We have the illusion of knowledge, but in reality we are in the dark.  Without the deconstruction of that film, I think most would watch this and accept this as true.<p>This is a state worse than ignorance.  At least an ignorant person knows they do not &#x27;know&#x27;.  Thinking you &#x27;know&#x27; when you do not, is actually negative knowledge - its worse than ignorance.<p>When you reflect on this, you will see that this the default means of receiving information.  We sit back and let the news&#x2F;the scientists&#x2F;whoever make a bunch of claims.  And most will accept all these by default.  Simply because its on TV!  And everyone thinks they are cleverer that that...  whilst having verified nothing!')
