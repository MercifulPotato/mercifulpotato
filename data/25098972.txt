I&#x27;m also positive that at least one of these people has a fully featured emacs IDE and all the required dependencies as part of that expression.<p>Totally down to try it if anyone has it.<p>One thing good about just standalone vim though is how portable it is. I can ssh into any server and fire it up. I also want this for a IDE. I want a console level IDE to fire up on any server I ssh into and if it&#x27;s not in that server I want to be able to use any package manager to DL it easily.<p>I can&#x27;t see any editor&#x2F;IDE solve the above problem unless the editor becomes the ssh client itself. With that setup in place then my IDE can go anywhere.')
