The winners in this world are getting larger and larger and accumulating ever more capital, so it could arguably be late-stage even if that concept is probably best left behind as too vague.\nTherefore, is surveillance capitalism such a bad expression to use?<p>We can blame consumers for being unaware, or not active enough in defending their rights, or not careful enough in guarding their privacy and their mental models, but I am under the impression that it is more productive to work towards or at the very least orient ourselves towards a society where you do not have to be paranoid at every step instead of one that prioritizes simply assigning blame on an individual level and abandoning the idea of addressing structural problems.<p>In a sense, arguing over what is real capitalism or not in a defensive posture doesn&#x27;t really address the issue. Pointing out that a subscription model would be the same in terms of revenue misses the point that Google is growing too big to remain a positive force in people&#x27;s lives. In both cases we start from flawed premises.')
