But Canadians and Europeans make up less than 5% of the total number of undocumented immigrants in the US.<p>So I still stand by my point that poor white people aren&#x27;t likely to have undocumented people living in their household at all. Regardless of race.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve known a number of local households that had undocumented Canadians, Brits and Germans.<p>Also how many of those households were poor? There isn&#x27;t nearly as much incentive for a poor Canadian, Brit, or German to come here as an undocumented immigrant because they&#x27;d be giving up guaranteed health care and far more permissive social services.')
