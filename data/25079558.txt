But I address a specific need: be up and running in minutes.<p>For solutions like the self-hosted version of Hashi Corp Vault (and Pinterest Knox apparently), you need to install it on a server, run it yourself, maintain the thing... This is work, I&#x27;m doing it for you. This is time, I&#x27;m spending it for you. This is money, you are saving a lot here.<p>Managed solutions work too, but they are all an order of magnitude too complex, too expensive or both.<p>There are more than 200 topics complex enough in Hashi Corp Vault to deserve a complete tutorial on their website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.hashicorp.com&#x2F;vault" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.hashicorp.com&#x2F;vault</a>. And this is not even the full documentation. If we want to make proper secrets management mainstream in small projects, it needs to be much more simple. With Knox, you have one view per project and you need a couple of minutes to learn everything there is to know. It does less, but you probably don&#x27;t need more.')
