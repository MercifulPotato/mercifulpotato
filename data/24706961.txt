RoboSwarm is opinionated (with some flexibility) and can give you a good sense of how many users your WordPress site or WooCommerce store can handle.<p>Why should you use RoboSwarm?<p>- Peace of mind\n- Easy\n- Authenticated &amp; Unauthenticated load tests\n- Massive scaling (capped at 2000 users right now, but can go much higher)\n- Global distribution (we run load generators in all DigitalOcean regions\n- Custom WooCommerce load tests (every Woo setup is different. We&#x27;re creating each test by hand at first while we look for common patterns to automate)\n- Affordable (we spin up testing infrastructure on-demand, so our fixed costs are low)<p>I hope everyone checks it out!')
