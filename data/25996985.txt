We program surveys insanely fast for private equity and management consulting clients.<p>If you enjoy dealing with very smart clients in a somewhat technical and fast-paced environment, this role may be for you. The Survey Director exercises 3 different skill sets:<p>1. Client management&#x2F;communication skills: Interact with clients all the time<p>2. Business acumen: Learn about different industries&#x2F;niches and transfer learning across projects<p>3. Technical skills: Never-ending supply of short coding puzzles (think &lt;10 lines)<p>This is not a software engineering role, but some coding familiarity is required. It&#x27;s a tough role, but super interesting work!<p>If you&#x27;re interested in learning more, shoot me (the founder) a note with either your resume and&#x2F;or LinkedIn: hn2@&lt;our-domain-from-above&gt;. You&#x27;d be joining a bunch of other HNers who work here.')
