Federal government by and large didn&#x27;t fund local roads and sewers. Federal government did often help with interstate highways and large water works, but those would be built just the same even with the Strong Towns preferred high density development model.<p>By the way, the money that federal government spends is not created out of thin air. It comes mostly from federal income tax, which is overwhelmingly paid by the people living in exactly the kind of suburbs Strong Towns hates.')
