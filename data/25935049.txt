It also is used as a sales vector since their charging network is a huge selling point for their cars.<p>Consumers don’t want to be stuck with two standards for no reason other than corporate politics and pay higher prices via those licensing fees. Or be locked out from certain charging stations just because of the model of their car.<p>And other automakers don’t want to be put at a competitive disadvantage because they have little choice but have to license the tech from Tesla.<p>And the world doesn’t want to put up with having to duplicate the massive human effort of setting up a charging network n times just because of corporate politics.<p>I always thought this was the basically the perfect situation for gov’t to step in and “fix” the market by just funding the development of the charging technology and providing it to all automakers for free&#x2F;at cost so everyone gets the best charger on the cheap.')
