I also suspect that they have been working towards returning their initial investment - it was likely accepted that Parler might just be temporary anyway.<p>Regarding the security, it is appalling. Generally the website feels like they have one good dev working in the background - it doesn&#x27;t feel like an entire team working on this 24&#x2F;7. It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like there is some review process. Hopefully they fix the security before bringing it back online.<p>What seems crazy to me is that Parler have not been able to setup at least one server to provide a static page to explain why they are offline and what the next steps are (from their perspective). At least parler.com points to 127.0.0.1 I guess.')
