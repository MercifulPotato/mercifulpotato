Books are often lent out dozens of times, with no new revenue for the writers.<p>Why is that bad?  Writers need to make money on every single sale.  If they can&#x27;t, books will have to get longer and longer, to make it harder to finish reading them during a library checkout interval.<p>A lot of those problems go away if you just buy everything you&#x27;re going to read directly from the kindle store.')
