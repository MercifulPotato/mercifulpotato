We still need to interact with our lives, and many of the abstractions help us do that.<p>BTW if you just replace the word &quot;delusion&quot; with &quot;abstraction&quot; you&#x27;ll probably see how it makes a lot of sense. Every abstraction is a delusion by definition, is it not? Because the abstracted thing doesn&#x27;t really exist in the same way as source observation?')
