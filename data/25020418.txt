The Democratic party needs to focus on increasing turnout (a potentially huge pool of new voters) rather than swaying an extra 2-4% of consistent moderate voters over, IMO.<p>Republican voters don&#x27;t seem to have the same problem. I mean, Trump was probably the least &quot;electable&quot; candidate of all time. But he got a lot of people excited about voting.')
