I clocked <i>a lot</i> of hours on them over the years.<p>I admit, I was sometimes jealous of mac hardware, for example the new M1, magsafe, and etc (though not the terrible keyboards). Though I was never jealous of an iPhone&#x27;s hardware. I was never ever jealous of the software. I always found it buggy and user-hostile.<p>The line you quoted was specifically about the user-hostility. You are using a machine that you can&#x27;t control and actively fights you. It&#x27;s mind boggling to me that developers agree to use such a system. Is this such an unreasonable opinion?')
