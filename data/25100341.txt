The thing is, I actually thought I <i>would</i> like being closed up, because I&#x27;m pretty introverted and don&#x27;t mind staying at home after work. However, the last couple of years I&#x27;ve started going out more, meeting new people, and trying various activities, which really opened up my view and felt good. But I didn&#x27;t imagine that cutting these things off would affect me that much. Now I don&#x27;t even want to work, don&#x27;t want to play games either, can hardly force myself to watch a movie too. That subtle &quot;background sadness&quot; is a pretty accurate description.')
