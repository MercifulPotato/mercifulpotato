However, from the legal wording I&#x27;ve seen quoted so far this potential law appears to require a site like Google to pay up merely for linking to content hosted elsewhere, the most basic element of the WWW. If a news site doesn&#x27;t want people linking to it, maybe the WWW isn&#x27;t the medium it should use to publish its material?')
