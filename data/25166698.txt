Credit cards are old tech now, and so a country building out a ton of infrastructure today has no real reason to follow that path now that there are alternatives. But a country with a ton of infrastructure already built for them also doesn&#x27;t have much incentive to rip all that out and replace it. So something primarily determined by &quot;what was the state of tech when building out infrastructure for the first time&quot; now gets used to answer a question of &quot;who is a more advanced society?&quot;<p>(Here it&#x27;s more a question of &quot;what were influential design trends&quot; instead of &quot;when did you build your infrastructure&quot; but that&#x27;s a similarly arbitrary starting seed, as it were, not a reflection of &quot;progress.&quot;)')
