When I used Signal ~1 year ago on Linux desktop and Android phone, if I had it open on my mobile I would get the messages there, and then if I later opened the desktop client I didn&#x27;t get the same messages there. Sometimes I purposefully move from phone to desktop because _typing on a small touchscreen sucks_ and I want to type on a keyboard. But fragmenting the message history just ruined usability for me. Hopefully it is better now.')
