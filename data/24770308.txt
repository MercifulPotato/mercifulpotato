The scenario I&#x27;m thinking of is with APIs like asyncio.gather, which can be asked to return exception objects rather than re-raise them, for coroutines which fail&#x2F;raise. This isn&#x27;t in and of itself a case of long-lived exception objects, but I could see how this approach might lead some users to treat the exception as a long-lived results object, perform type checks against it, etc.<p>If you were in the position of having an app that was set up like this, it would be nice to know you had the option of trimming the Exception&#x27;s footprint while still allowing it to retain its Exception-ness.')
