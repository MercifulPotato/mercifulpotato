The studios got burned by Apple&#x27;s lack of support for a decade, combined with the Mac&#x27;s excessive costs and switched to nix and Windows (primarily nix) starting during the Great Recession.<p>Generally, Windows is in the mix simply because a lot of the software that the (non-technical) artists use is stabler or easier to support on Windows than it is on nix, like Maya, 3DS, Premiere, etc., and running these on Windows is a quarter of the cost, <i>or less,</i> of running the same software on Mac.')
