In some states, they could be charged for food mistakes, only if the mistake was directly their fault due to negligence.<p>&gt; in my experience, the latter is more effective at getting the best outcome, regardless of who is nominally at fault.<p>&gt; This is exactly my point. You are using politeness as a manipulative tactic to get your way.<p>They didn’t say the best outcome for them, they said the best outcome. Being polite and showing basic respect for others generally leads to better outcomes for everyone. You sound like how a robot might look at human interactions, not understand that humans are hardwired to be social animals and social interactions are not a calculated tactic to gain advantage.')
