Item(by='CryptoPunk', descendants=None, kids=[25646267], score=None, time=1609846809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644313, text=' &gt;&gt;Bitcoin isn&#x27;t worth fighting for here, sorry EFF, but it is a useful canary warning about the current state of low financial freedom and privacy (by historical standards) and surprising degrees of unofficial suppression of viable alt-moneys. I would be happily surprised if the FinCEN reg forced unlawful use cases out of the bitcoin ecosystem leaving a vibrant, healthy marketplace....<p>This is a completely incoherent paragraph. In the first half you bemoan the lack of financial privacy and freedom, and in the second cheer on privacy-violating and freedom-suppressing FinCEN regulations.')
