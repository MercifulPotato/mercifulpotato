Every app in the Manjaro distribution that ships pre-installed should at least fit on the screen; many apps have popups that do not.<p>2. Dialing should never cause a reboot; calling voicemail has crashed the phone for me.<p>3. Either give up on having a camera or make it _fast_.<p>4. Some kind of loading indicator for apps would be nice.<p>5. Either don&#x27;t allow X apps to be installed or make the X wrapper work; I can install gtk emacs but it doesn&#x27;t run.')
