I mean, your editor can&#x27;t even properly manipulate those expressions most of the time. In order not to go absolutely insane when dealing with JavaScript, C++, Java, you need absolutely top-notch editor support, and even then you can&#x27;t do everything that paredit does.<p>This gets even worse with languages where indentation matters (Python, and the horrible abomination that is YAML) â€” which aren&#x27;t even auto-indentable, because the editor has no idea what you actually mean. I&#x27;m not sure if you can avoid going insane with those.')
