My own domain (since 2000), and hosted on GSuite (the last 8-10 years). So I get the benefit of a robust email service but without the risk that I will get locked out. I access it using a desktop IMAP client and keep a copy of everything locally. And the icing is that I was an early user of GSuite when they used to offer free accounts. They no longer do that, but haven&#x27;t (yet) killed off the ones that were created earlier, like mine. The primary data that&#x27;s on Google without a copy are the photos backed up from my Android phone. Need to figure out a better solution there.')
