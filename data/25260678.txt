Item(by='arendtio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606781107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25243764, text='&gt; Lithium is crucial for the transition to renewables, but mining it has been environmentally costly.<p>From my limited insight into the issue, I got the impression, that the mining of lithium in itself isn&#x27;t the problem, but that is being done in the cheapest ways. For example, when mining it from water, the water is being evaporated and the wind carries it to other places. But shouldn&#x27;t it be possible to required miners by law to pump as much water into the ground as they pump out of it?<p>That would be more expensive, but as far as I understand it, it should reduce the environmental effects significantly.')
