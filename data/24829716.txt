Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603134376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829051, text='Sorry, I can see how &#x27;badly&#x27; would land badly. I just meant that it isn&#x27;t a borderline case. HN has that title rule for really good reasons and the submitted title clearly broke the rule. Let&#x27;s not get too worried about that though. It&#x27;s a good submission and that is 100x more important.<p>Edit: maybe one clarification would help. Factual accuracy is good and necessary but not sufficient; there are many facts one could choose from, and cherry-picking the fact that you think is most important and making that be the title is a form of editorializing. It&#x27;s actually the main form of editorializing.<p>I grant you that the title you used is probably what most of us would consider most interesting, when looking at that article from the present moment.')
