That is my side gig. Every four years since the Citizen&#x27;s United ruling until you guys amend the constitution, I&#x27;ve been selling as much stuff as possible to Super PACs as if its the last time I&#x27;ll ever encounter a passion driven organization which has no fiduciary duties, shareholders or knowledge of how to accomplish its own real purpose. I mean that occasionally happens in somebody&#x27;s poorly constructed self-funded LLC but they don&#x27;t have money, and definitely not reliably flush the more you yell about it.<p>This year I&#x27;m seeing tons of professionals doing the same thing - selling random stuff to Super PACs - under flimsier pretexts, specifically to Republicans. &quot;Hm <i>sure</i> I can file this lawsuit for you, you know there&#x27;s a fee for expediting the process&quot;<p>Patriotic Sounding PAC, FEC Filing: Administrative costs to LLC formed yesterday $800,000<p>Sure, plenty of <i>the people</i> believe these ideologies but they&#x27;ve never mattered. If everyone gravitates to extremes of their parties they never get consensus on stuff they&#x27;re actually passionate about. None of the professionals involved believe in ... really anything, and they&#x27;re just like me. They probably have at least four LLCs to contract to conflicting and opposing causes.<p>I&#x27;m a little surprised at the ruses being pulled, like I really looked up the FEC filings lately, all I got to say is that Georgia is a hoot! If you sleep you&#x27;ll miss it.')
