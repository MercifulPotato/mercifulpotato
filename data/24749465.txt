I reckon it&#x27;s done because the MVP tutorial they used when they got started used the CDN. Or they are using Wordpress and the theme decided to use it (... I just checked mine as I recently changed the theme, luckily it doesn&#x27;t do this). It might also be done because people don&#x27;t care. If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it.')
