Even if it made sense to grow using LEDs instead of direct sunlight, that could be done on rural land instead of urban parking lots.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever get enough food grown in shipping containers in urban parking lots to be anything other than a curiosity for the wealthy.<p>These things are small by <i>garden</i> standards, let alone farm standards.  How many people could one of these shipping containers keep fed?  How many shipping containers would you need to feed a city of a million people?')
