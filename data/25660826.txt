Nor are they likely to have any reason to care about my actions. While on the other hand, the USA has direct powers over me, and is likely to care more because I&#x27;m here.<p>So sure, China and the CCP are evil, probably much more evil than the US government. But even at that, the danger they pose to a typical US citizen is much less than that of their own government. So it&#x27;s rational prefer, say, a Chinese-made phone to a US-made one.')
