Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608144976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446259, text='&gt; Americans buy way more large SUVs and trucks than the rest of the world, even those with fewer than three kids<p>Having had two kids in the age where they needed large car seats, trucks are no help at all and even fairly decent sized SUVs don&#x27;t handle more than two well. Car seats for young children are a significant issue, and I suspect almost anyone whose had two or more children under the current safety regime would both recognize that fact and likely consider it before intentionally having a third.<p>&gt; From a pure financial standpoint, I&#x27;d look more to the cost of education, healthcare, and housing.<p>Young children don&#x27;t necessarily have a big impact on housing costs (they can share some easily), often because of the structure of health insurance costs don&#x27;t have much impact on healthcare costs after the first, and education costs are largely deferred if you aren&#x27;t going private&#x2F;homeschool. Day care costs &#x2F; career impacts are probably more significant than any of those given the frequency of two-working-parent families, but car transportation logistics are quite palpable.<p>(“Source”, have two kids under 5.)')
