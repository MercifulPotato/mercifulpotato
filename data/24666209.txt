The reason this is an issue here in America is because of the problematic ways that we adopted elements of other cultures in racist and demeaning ways, without understanding the deeper meaning behind them.<p>Some examples:<p>- Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben. Black Americans were historically referred to as &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;Girl&quot;, or &quot;little&quot; as a demeaning statement of class. &quot;Auntie&quot; and &quot;Uncle&quot; were reserved for older Blacks for the same reason. Use of Black figures as mascots for these brands is a form of cultural appropriation. [1]<p>- Cleveland Indians logo (other sports teams as well).<p>- People wearing Sioux (Lakotan) headdresses as fashion statements, which is offensive because that was a thing you had to earn in that culture.<p>Americans (and literally every culture) appropriates everything from food to clothes to language. Thats not inherently bad. It gets bad when you commercialize and propagate negative stereotypes about cultures that you have historically subjugated.<p>However, nuance is hard. So on twitter we have people who have embraced the mantra &quot;Cultural Appropriation is bad&quot; and go about shaming every little example of it without understanding the deeper meaning behind them (see what I did there? We&#x27;re not that different than what we hate). This culture of shaming is itself a form of cultural imperialism.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackvoicenews.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;01&#x2F;24&#x2F;boy-uncle-and-aunt-had-different-meanings-when-whites-used-them-referring-to-blacks-part-2-of-3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackvoicenews.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;01&#x2F;24&#x2F;boy-uncle-and-aunt...</a>')
