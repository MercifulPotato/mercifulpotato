They provided access to a database and said &lt;&lt; do thing &gt;&gt;. Implied was that I should &lt;&lt; do thing &gt;&gt; with a program rather than a query.<p>One of my solutions used Golang. It pulled data, looped a lot, then put results back. It took approximately 4 minutes.<p>I included a second solution, using SQL. It selected into the results table with a little bit of CTE magic. It took approximately 600ms.')
