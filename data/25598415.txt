Item(by='Glyptodon', descendants=None, kids=[25598991], score=None, time=1609456936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25591892, text='My opinion as a casual bicyclist:<p>* I bought a bike during the existence of these things and never knew they existed (and I&#x27;m casual enough that my bike has a cupholder).<p>* I&#x27;m certainly interested in less maintenance but have no interest in losing handbrakes, and if I did, would probably prefer fixie over coaster-esque.<p>* Seat storage seems neat, but bike seats are very finicky person to person in terms of circulation, numb feet&#x2F;toes, etc.<p>* In my view single shifter is great and newer style single sprocket stacks that do 5 to 15 speeds off one shifter are where it&#x27;s at.<p>* I suspect if there were good (in same price bracket) disk brake options on very upright riding stance bikes people who tried would like.<p>* A better default derailleur + shifter is probably an improvement casual bikers don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;d love, but have no basis for ever getting.<p>* Casual bikers need at least one very low gear because we find hills miserable.<p>* Storage options can really make a bike for a casual rider, but they&#x27;re less obvious to figure out than ideal.<p>* It confuses me that these would win design awards.')
