This year, 2020, when the Pandemic hit and our prospective Investor walked off, leaving me with a team I cannot support; I turn to extra reading for support. In early 2020, when I realized I read over 50+ books in 2019, I had decided to read slower, and more picky to digest the books better.<p>Unfortunately, I ended up reading lot more this year. By GoodReads counts I have already read 70+ books, so, with the re-reads and other physical books, I will be hitting 80+ books this year (I didn&#x27;t participate in their book count this year).<p>When I&#x27;m anxious, I either read or play chess. If I&#x27;m pitching or have an important meeting, I would have likely played few games of chess.')
