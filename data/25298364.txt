Last time I tried i3wm for example, there was no default support for sleep, energy saving and hardware keyboard shortcuts and you had to take care of all of that instead of the usual GNOME&#x2F;KDE to do it for you. The best option is to install tiled windows managers plugins within GNOME or KDE on Linux.')
