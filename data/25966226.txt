Wanna die on Mars? Maybe put it all in Space X, I don&#x27;t know.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that it&#x27;s a shame that we&#x27;re taught that the point of investing is to make money, rather than make a difference with a side effect of having more money. Because left to its own devices, money tends to motivate some pretty awful things.<p>I don&#x27;t want retire rich, I wanna retire post-scarcity. I hate letting my money sit in an account while smart kids can&#x27;t afford college. Those kids are gonna develop the tech that saves my ass one day--or not--depending on how we play our cards now.<p>Blindly picking a fund based on performance just feels like shooting my future self in the foot.')
