Nobody cares about people who are &quot;unconventional&quot; in a way that is at odds with reality. Conventions are merely cognitive shortcuts we use to apply previously determined knowledge. Sometimes that knowledge grows out of sync with the world, or there is a newer, better understanding of the world that represents an improvement, and we need to replace or update the convention. This is where we need unconventional thinkers to question assumptions and test new ways of doing things. Yes, even in fields like surgery and plumbing.<p>Do you think the current state of knowledge in surgery is perfect and cannot be improved? If not, you are depending on people to question the current conventions.<p>I promise you the first plumber who proposed the waterless urinal was met with a lot of resistance from other plumbers &quot;That&#x27;s not how we do things&quot;, &quot;That will never work&quot; etc. etc. It doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s also going to design your house so that shit has to flow uphill. Nobody is proposing that you just throw out conventions at random for the sake of calling yourself unconventional.')
