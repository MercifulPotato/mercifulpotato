Item(by='retzkek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608068427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431791, text='&gt; I make a mistake maybe once a year<p>That you know of. How many mistakes do you suppose you make that you aren&#x27;t aware of? Or maybe not even a real mistake, but a perceived &quot;mistake&quot; as seen by the other driver?<p>I suspect the latter happens far more often than real mistakes, due to information asymmetry - I know exactly what I am doing and intend to do, while I can only guess and infer what you&#x27;re doing, beyond the very meager data provided by brake lights and turn signals. If your real behavior differs from my expectation, I call you a bad driver who made a mistake, while you really did nothing wrong.')
