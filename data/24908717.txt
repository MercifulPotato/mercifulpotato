Softcores on FPGAs are indeed terrible but if you&#x27;re implementing some algorithm directly at the gate level for cryptography or signal processing or whatever then being able to arrange inputs outputs into dataflows is a big win with no roundrips to general purpose registers or bypass networks.  Not having to fetch instructions and being limited in paralellism is also a big win.  And generally if you&#x27;re doing something like mining bitcoin you should expect an FGPA to perform somewhere between an ASIC and a GPU.<p>The problem is that if a task is common then someone is just going to make an ASIC to do it.  And if its uncommon then the terrible FPGA software ecosystem and low prevalence of general purpose FPGAs in the wild mean that people will just do it on a CPU or GPU.')
