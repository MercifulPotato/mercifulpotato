If some user finds a bug in your GPL code, fixes it, and pushes that code to your repo?<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t own the copyright to that bugfix right? So how can you re-license it under a commercial license?<p>The way we do it in my project, and the standard practice for Apache (where we copied it from), is tohave a CLA that gives full rights to the original owner for any patches people want to PR.<p>&gt; What about meaningful improvements instead of bug-fixes? I can see a bugfix being trivial enough. But if someone works hard to improve performance, and then some other company starts selling that work without compensation for the original author?<p>This is a bigger problem, but in practice I assume it wouldn&#x27;t happen because if someone were to actually put in weeks or months of work into significantly improving the project, why wouldn&#x27;t you just hire them or pay them ? After all, the whole assumption here is that this is a model for a for-profit endevor.')
