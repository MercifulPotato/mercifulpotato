It usually results to 3-5 sessions per day. It&#x27;s such a great mental reset, and I haven&#x27;t since experienced the kind of complete depletion that you get from pushing yourself hard through the day.<p>I bet some Zen master would reprimand me for this being the wrong approach, but I found it quite difficult to get into the habit of doing, say, a single 30-60 minute session per day. Now I can consistently drop into the meditation session with no urge for procrastination and have also successfully experimented with longer ones.<p>[1] refers to the method of increasing your pull-up capability by installing a pull-up bar in your office &#x2F; bedroom doorway and doing a set every time you pass through the doorway')
