If I rebuild locally with podman, it correctly detects cache hits and the build is fast. On our Jenkins server (RHEL 8) with podman 2.0.5 it doesn&#x27;t. It randomly doesn&#x27;t cache hit, causing builds to take 20x longer than with docker CE.<p>- Podman is insanely slow at building images in general. COPY emptyfolder&#x2F; &#x2F;emptyfolder&#x2F; takes 2 seconds. We have dozens of things to COPY and it&#x27;s stupid slow compared to docker CE. Buildah doesn&#x27;t seem any better.<p>- Systemd integration has bugs. If you use the default generated systemd unit file, it does not kill processes when exiting and leaves them dangling. Even after removing the strange KillMode=none it says to put in there, it still leaves processes dangling.  Podman sometimes loses track of the container. It will list nothing in &quot;podman ps&quot; but the processes will still be running.')
