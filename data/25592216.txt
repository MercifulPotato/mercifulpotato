Item(by='trymas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609419497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25589833, text='I probably will be very wrong, but some places in Europe are urbanised over vast areas (in a sense making &quot;endless suburbs&quot;) and to my knowledge have descent public transportation, usually a combination of trains, metros, busses, tramways.<p>In places like London, to my limited knowledge public transport is the only valid choice for transportation, as car traffic is in constant jam, parking is impossible to find and costs a fortune.<p>Countries like Belgium and Netherlands are highly urbanised and from my experience it&#x27;s the same story - you do not take a car to go to work (if you work in the city&#x2F;downtown). People even have jobs that they have in different cities and they take express trains everyday.<p>I agree though that US&#x27;s suburban and car-centric model, with endless cul-de-sacs is not designed to have public transport. To retrofit public transport into this - is a colossal task, though it&#x27;s also an effort to change peoples minds, that not relying on a car is &quot;an attack on freedom&quot; and public transport is not only for poor people.')
