The SPA loading will still consume good energy on each client computer. Would love to see some numbers.\nLots of hype, lots of projects and approaches, and lots of opinons about what is more convenient, but few numbers measurements of resources (space, time, what more?). May be It silly me, and the difference in energy terms is irrelevant.')
