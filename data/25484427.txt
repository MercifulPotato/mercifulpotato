You&#x27;re still thinking. It&#x27;s not like I can&#x27;t watch a YouTube video and think to myself at the same time.<p>I think the aversion I have to being alone with my thoughts is the feeling that doing that won&#x27;t help me. It&#x27;s sort of like a neural network that I&#x27;d alone with its weights with no inputs to process except itself. I feel when I think to myself alone, I can&#x27;t make any decisions because what I know is already what I knew before I started thinking to myself. Yo make decisions, I need external answers to questions. I need new information and evidence to start me to some conclusion.')
