To control it, you need a flying tail, and swept wings and &quot;waisting&quot; the fuselage reduces the amount of power needed.<p>So almost all of the planes in WW2 were &quot;too thick&quot; and incapable of supersonic flight, though could have exceeded Mach 1 with modified wings, tail and in a dive.<p>The US P-80 (1945) and F-86 (1949) jets had underpowered engines, in the sense that all early jet engines had limited power.<p>However the F-86 had swept wings, and later versions of the F-86 had a flying tail, so if you pointed it at the ground, you could get a sonic boom without losing control.<p>Source: I study aerodynamics.')
