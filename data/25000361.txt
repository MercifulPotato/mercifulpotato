There’s a desire among Washington and New York power brokers and journalists to knock big tech off its pedestal, which creates an insatiable appetite for anti-tech narratives.<p>I think this explains why so much of the conversation around the 2016 election blames Facebook for the result, when it was one of 100 factors, and some of the more proximate factors were choices of institutions like the FBI and the New York Times. Facebook and Twitter’s measures to visibly suppress Trump’s claims of winning the current election can be seen as attempts to head off this kind of scapegoating, neutralize the narrative, and bow to those east coast institutions. These actions are legally unrelated to antitrust, but seem to be part of an effort to cede ground in the larger conflict the antitrust actions are part of.')
