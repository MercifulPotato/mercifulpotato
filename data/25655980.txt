My boys are very into building things with redstone in Minecraft and I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of programming with them.<p>What I would say is that 7 is still very young - the important thing at this age is that they are enjoying it, which it sounds like your son is and with you as a mentor, I don&#x27;t think you can go too far wrong. If you weren&#x27;t a programmer, I might be pointing you in various directions but don&#x27;t think I need to.<p>I&#x27;m mostly thinking about resources that might be helpful. It&#x27;s worth being aware that on the Raspberry Pi there is a Python API which might be a good way to introduce Python for a Minecraft fan. There are some articles about in old issues of Hello World magazine (PDFs available for free here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloworld.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;issues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloworld.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;issues</a>). You might find the magazine interesting generally. There&#x27;s also a book Adventures in Minecraft by Martin O&#x27;Hanlan and David Whale. Typing ability is one of the big issues with python at that age though I find (that and the ability to make syntax errors which you don&#x27;t get in Scratch!).<p>In terms of Scratch, there&#x27;s the Code Club curriculum <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;codeclub" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;codeclub</a> which isn&#x27;t perfect, but is fairly well road-tested.<p>The BBC Microbit is also fun and not too expensive if you are looking for something a bit different and has a visual programming interface. I prefer that to lots of the robot kits etc. out there because it&#x27;s so flexible and you can extend it into electronics if you want to. Having said that Lego Boost went done extremely well with our boys and is well thought through, but not cheap.<p>But the important thing at this age is that they enjoy it, so I think there&#x27;s an art in terms of following what interests them and encouraging them with that.')
