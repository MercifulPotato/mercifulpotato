People on WSB have been YOLOing entire accounts to zero for months, where was the concern when people were losing money? Why the concern when they are actually making money?<p>Also, if there is a good regulatory explanation, why not just give that, instead of thin statements like “we’re blocking these trades for your own good.” I’m open to reasonable explanations with evidence.')
