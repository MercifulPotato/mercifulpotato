Not to mention the call for Venezuela-style nationalization.<p>That&#x27;s a non-starter, and rightly so.<p>If you can&#x27;t put aside power-grabs and partisan politics to tackle climate change, then you clearly do not care about fixing climate change.<p>If the GND passes, the important-to-humans part (carbon) will go to the back of the political bus, and the important-to-the-oligarchs part (more power! more money!) will be put in the drivers&#x27; seat.')
