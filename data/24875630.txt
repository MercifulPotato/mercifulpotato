That includes maintaining the best physical and mental health you can so you can handle inevitable setbacks. Even if you&#x27;re an introvert, that includes relationships.<p>Starting your own company to &quot;escape&quot; civilization usually doesn&#x27;t make sense unless you can self-fund it for several years, or your existing contacts can quickly be paying clients.<p>What happens when you&#x27;re not prepared is that paranoia will dominate your relationships, depression will deepen, etc. so your startup marathon doesn&#x27;t have a chance of finishing.<p>Having said that, manic people can accomplish a lot during their manic phases, but to sustain that over several years means they need to follow the preparation above.<p>If you&#x27;re a non-technical founder, understand that engineers are very expensive to make payroll (which adds to your stress), and have options (don&#x27;t really need you or other mentally ill people in their life.) So ensure you have adequate runway, or structure your staff relationships, so that you don&#x27;t stall your project.<p>Also, in the US, ensure you&#x27;ve considered health insurance expenses before doing the startup thing. Most small businesses struggle with that, and it gets worse every Jan. 1.')
