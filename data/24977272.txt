And we do not know the tensor(s) that help us to move between the coordinate systems.<p>- - -<p>So we are not going to be able to use even 2016 polls (because then folks did not realize how Corrupt the RINOs+Dems are )<p>- - -<p>My prediction is that Trump wins, GOP takes House and retains Senate.<p>This will also be the largest percent wise vote for a GOP president, by Latino and African American voters.<p>- - -<p>Will check back in 9 days or so, to see if I was right !<p>Cheers.')
