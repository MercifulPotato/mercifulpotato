They&#x27;re very insistent on the fact that voting shifts or errors between states are generally highly correlated.<p>That&#x27;s exactly why their probability forecasts tend to be more conservative than other forecasts. If you see a whole lot of possible paths for a candidate, and assume the errors are random, then that candidate will almost certainly win. If you know they might be correlated, then you know that a huge number of paths may shift at once.')
