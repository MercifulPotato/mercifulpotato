I see a lot of people using norton or whatever else and imo they&#x27;re all just a waste of resources and time.<p>I personally just uninstall Malwarebytes and bitdefender after I clean up and make sure windows defenders up and running and I&#x27;m ready to download all kinds of shit off the internet again.<p>I think the best way to find niche software on windows is to search for open source alternatives.<p>Making a system restore point from time to time can help greatly too on windows! (make sure you change the setting so that it doesn&#x27;t delete your old system restore points due to low disk space making the whole thing useless)')
