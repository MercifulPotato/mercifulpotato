I first used one for a summer job with our local city, taking down street-damage information for our roads department. We&#x27;d drive all over town, take random samples of stretches of streets, and measure cracks, holes, etc., entering all the data into the 100, which would then be uploaded to a 286 (12mhz turbo!) for number-crunching to determine which streets in town needed attention first. The 100 took a lot of punishment and just kept working, with no memorable hiccups. The keyboard was perfectly adequate to the task, and the screen, though small even for the day, was easy to adjust to (as long as the light in the room &#x2F; outside was right).')
