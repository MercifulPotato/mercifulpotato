Item(by='__ryan__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603382776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857773, text='&gt; The edit? No. Why would it be a typo? You assume everyone&#x27;s first language is English, right?<p>No, I was asking if it was a typo because I interpreted it as being a counter-point to the point you were trying to make. Here it is again, emphasis mine:<p>&gt; Edit: also, searching for &quot;<i>prolog</i> web framework&quot; gets you stuff about using prolog for web application development. [...] And no sniff of this new framework.<p>I interpreted this as being critical of fuzzy matching, but I realize now you may have been giving an example of a transliteration a hypothetical searcher would make themselves, which makes more sense. Since what you described is what I consider to be the ideal behavior of a search engine, I thought it was possibly you meant to say &quot;also, searching for &#x27;<i>prologue</i> web framework&#x27;&quot;. I&#x27;m sorry I misunderstood.<p>&gt; The language is an implementation detail [...]<p>I don&#x27;t personally agree with this. If the language is important to the project (in this case, it is since this is a web framework for Nim), I would probably make a point to add that context.<p>&gt; I think I looked at your history, and this is not the first time you got in to a debate like this, so I&#x27;m out...<p>Sincerely asking (it sounds snarky but I don&#x27;t know how else to ask): is there something wrong about the way I&#x27;m arguing my position? I am not trying to be rude or anything, I just sincerely disagree. Would it be better if I just conceded or simply stopped responding?<p>&gt; it&#x27;s a bad name - the creator should probably rethink it or prefix &quot;Nim&quot; to make it unique, but whatever.<p>Disagree. I suppose it&#x27;s my fault for arguing what clearly comes down to your opinion.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; My position is that you are massively underestimating the issue with the words basically looking and sounding the same.<p>I totally understand the hypothetical issues that can come up in this kind of situation.<p>My position is simply that <i>in this case</i> the arguments against using this name are contrived and furthermore are resolved with the slightest pinch of context.')
