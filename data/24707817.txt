We&#x27;ll have to waste brain cycles coming up and alternative spellings of methods to stay away from copyright infringement.<p>This isn&#x27;t how copyright works though. It&#x27;s neither necessary or sufficient. If you copy an API but change the words using a thesaurus you are still <i>copying</i> it so it would still be infringement. If by happenstance you come up with the same wording in your API, then that would not be copyright infringement because you didn&#x27;t <i>copy</i> anything.')
