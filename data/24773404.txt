I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.  My old high school friends are different people who I don&#x27;t know anymore (save for a few who who I&#x27;m still close with, who coincidentally also don&#x27;t live in our hometown and wouldn&#x27;t move back).  My friends are mostly people I&#x27;ve met in my new town, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave them without good reason.<p>Sure, people who grew up in $COOL_PLACE but moved to $OTHER_PLACE for a job might want to (and be able to) move back to $COOL_PLACE now, but I don&#x27;t think that generalizes to most of America.')
