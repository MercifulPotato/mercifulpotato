There were meetings that I would be the only one who was not invited<p>&gt; my manager [...] started laughing and making fun of my last name<p>&gt; My manager was giving indirect negative feedback through the iBuddy rather than speaking with me<p>&gt; I would enter the meetings and they would stop talking and make really strange gestures. I was ignored, ridiculed and attacked in the team meetings<p>&gt; “You escaped a war zone; it is obvious you have many mental problems.”<p>&gt; “My husband worked for FBI and I can get you deported on a cargo boat if I want.”<p>Sounds like a bunch of bully high schoolers that never mentally graduated from high school.<p>I also would like to point out that this post is ranked way lower than it deserves on HN homepage, despite having higher points and shorter time than many of the posts above it. That’s quite unfair. It dropped from #1 to #7 within an hour.')
