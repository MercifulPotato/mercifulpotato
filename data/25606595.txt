There were meetings that I would be the only one who was not invited<p>&gt; my manager [...] started laughing and making fun of my last name<p>&gt; My manager was giving indirect negative feedback through the iBuddy rather than speaking with me<p>&gt; I would enter the meetings and they would stop talking and make really strange gestures. I was ignored, ridiculed and attacked in the team meetings<p>&gt; “You escaped a war zone; it is obvious you have many mental problems.”<p>&gt; “My husband worked for FBI and I can get you deported on a cargo boat if I want.”<p>Sounds like a bunch of bully high schoolers that never mentally graduated from high school.')
