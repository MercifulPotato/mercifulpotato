And BOH (cooks, dishwashers) doesn&#x27;t get any of that mind you.<p>Bourdain&#x27;s Kitchen Confidential was, at times clearly embellished for attention grabbing purposes to sell books, a very accurate depiction of the Industry. Which is why he became the patron saint of sorts to the Culinary World, despite being an admittedly mediocre chef.<p>There was a time I really wished everyone had spent a summer working in a kitchen to gain perspective on what that thing really is, now it&#x27;s very unlikely to occur after COVID.<p>Still, it&#x27;s pretty eye opening.')
