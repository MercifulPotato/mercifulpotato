The DOCKER chain in the nat table gets hit by inbound traffic on the PREROUTING chain before UFW&#x27;s chains on the filter table. IIRC, can get around this by directing UFW to write its rules to the DOCKER-USER chain.<p>Firewalld is implemented differently and will exhibit the expected blocking behavior: traffic targeting docker ports will encounter firewalld before it encounters docker.')
