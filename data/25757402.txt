Large parts of the country are tax burdens when we look at the big numbers. For example, California and Oregon make a profit for the USA, while Mississippi and Alabama are more expensive to operate than they return in tax revenue.<p>This pattern also emerges on a county-by-county level within states. For example, Oregon and Washington are bisected by the Cascades, and the eastern counties are much poorer than the western counties and depend on the profits made in the west.<p>This uneven burden is an important ingredient in explaining why it&#x27;s not just rural folks resenting city folks, but also city folks resenting rural folks. It is not fun to know that one&#x27;s tax dollars are disproportionately funding welfare for folks who politically desire to see one&#x27;s way of life burnt down because it&#x27;s immoral or wasteful or simply not as sexist and racist as in the past.')
