From what I understand it&#x27;s about classical music engaging your brain in specific ways that counter the depressive spiral. There are studies and data on this. It isn&#x27;t about liking it, though study helps. (If you understand why Bach is remarkable you have an easier time liking his music. I&#x27;ll warn you about Mozart, though, his compositions are hypersensitive to correct performance. If the performance isn&#x27;t nearly perfect, it falls apart... anyway...)<p>Video games can do this as well, if used properly. Set a goal, meet it, set another goal, meet it. Being active is the opposite of &quot;ennui&quot; or &quot;malaise&quot; (earlier poetic descriptions of depression). Regular doses of goal achievement can also reprogram the brain away from a depressive spiral.')
