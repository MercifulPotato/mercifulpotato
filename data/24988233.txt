Rust&#x27;s type system helps prevent those. There are CVEs for double-free bugs in OpenSSH, OpenSSL, and Kerberos. Again, Rust&#x27;s type system helps prevent those. There are CVEs for null dereferencing in the Linux kernel, CUPS, and OpenSSL. Many languages have type systems that help preventing those.<p>There&#x27;s many more classes of bugs that can be prevented by judicious use of robust type systems. Dismissing strong, static typing as &quot;a crutch for bad programmers&quot; is just plain wrong.<p>All of this, of course, assumes the only use for static types is preventing issues. Algebraic data types actually allow you to write simpler, more concise code in languages that support them. Typeclasses make for a whole model of polymorphism that&#x27;s just incredibly painful to implement in languages that don&#x27;t support them.')
