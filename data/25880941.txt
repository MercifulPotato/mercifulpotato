The same applies to pipes of all types. But even things like a drawer slide is often not the advertised length. Saw blades thinkness is converted from 2.5mm to whatever the closest inch the salesperson felt that day.<p>From having spent quite a lot of time in big box stores in France and the USA. I can tell you that in the USA 3&#x2F;4&quot; (19mm) can be anything from 16mm to 24mm.<p>In short almost everything is built in metric and the USA likes to pretend it&#x27;s not and gets confused by rounding up randomly.')
