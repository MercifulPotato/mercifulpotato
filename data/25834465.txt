As this has commonly been the main measure of non-electric propulsion it is still valid to invite the comparison as part of the goal is still reducing mass by reducing fuel usage.<p>It does seem the efficiency they are referring to is efficiency in ionization.<p>And I agree it is a bit odd that they bring up the claim of &quot;superior efficiency&quot; and quote the power usage of the thruster (50W) without any notes about the actual thrust capability that it provides.')
