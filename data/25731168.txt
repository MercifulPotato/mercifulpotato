It kept giving error codes and the door won&#x27;t lock.<p>I called the company who said the model is way to old to have warrenty, which is true, and then said they couldn&#x27;t assist me in repairing. They said they could only send a (paid) technician.<p>I Youtubed the model and found an array of DIY repair videos. I used those to dissassemble the door lock mechanism only to find out it had short circuited. Here&#x27;s the pics: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;ECM5AuI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;ECM5AuI</a><p>And after I called for replacement parts they started berating me for trying to fix it myself, saying it could be dangerous and a potential fire hazard.<p>I hope this new law will help in this aspect; it&#x27;s ridiculous I have to go to YouTube to find out how to repair a washing machine and the company itself refuses to help...<p>And 2 year warrenty is way too short anyway. I hope they change it into something dynamic like 1 year per â‚¬200 sale price or so.')
