Item(by='marzell', descendants=None, kids=[24743023], score=None, time=1602366813, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739762, text='I can&#x27;t help but honestly feel that tech&#x2F;AI will always be fundamentally without will&#x2F;motive, and that all the sci-fi stories about &#x27;uploading consciousness&#x27; or sentient tech will never truly be actual conscious entities. We can make them complex, and we can make them act various ways, but their existence will never be meaningful or in any way deserving of civil rights. Maybe that can change in the future, but for now I don&#x27;t see any indication that it will.')
