Specifically looking at functions like Sales, Marketing, Talent etc. and their interactions with tools that do the trick for their functions eg. Hubspot, Intercom, Salesforce, Lever.<p>Core Idea: Trying to imagine if these functions would want to use an IDE&#x2F;SQL workbench like option available inside these apps. Essentially exposing the underlying data stored for my organization. Theory is two fold:<p>1. Admin dashboards are never adequate\n2. Customized dashboards are cumbersome to set up (Eg. Hubspot)\n3. Data crunching from SaaS apps is essential for reporting and measuring impact<p>Something like what Stripe Sigma (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;en-in&#x2F;sigma) did but for all major SaaS apps. Would you want to use something like that?')
