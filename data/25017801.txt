But that Trump is authoritarian there can be no reasonable doubt.  He has a long record of using his power to fire anyone who speaks against him, to harass anyone who speaks against him who he does not have the power to fire, and to protect and grant favors to anyone who supports him politically, even if they have been convicted of crimes.  That kind of behavior is the textbook definition of authoritarian.')
