In more congested and wider streets it could get more delaying. But if the planning has been done by a software before the driver took the truck, the software might have avoided as many left turns as possible without telling the driver, and without having any need to ask the driver to micro-optimize themselves, they just follow the GPS (you probably can&#x27;t do better), or the most sensical path ca&#x27;t do better), or do a slight detour to get a snack (unforseeable).<p>Long story short it might be a software policy without being a driver policy, that would be enough to have a significant statistical result, I don&#x27;t think drivers re-plan their shift.')
