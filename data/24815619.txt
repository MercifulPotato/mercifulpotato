If you are cought with one it&#x27;s a violation of current weapons laws, and you&#x27;ll get fined and a record.<p>Funny thing is, crossbows and bows in general are <i>not</i> :)\nMaybe because they are larger and difficult to carry concealed.<p>Had much fun with a slingshot(without arm rest) as a kid, using steel balls out of old ball bearings and glass marbles at distances up to about 50 meters with <i>very</i> surprising results against brick and concrete walls. Made large parts of them simply chip off, or deep dents into trash bins, traffic signs, and similar things.')
