They probably should.<p>But humans will always attempt to make their own work easier and less time-consuming, and this is a tool for that.  Eventually, something like this is going to exist for distance learning.  This is unlikely to be the final configuration of that tool, but it&#x27;s a step on that road, no matter how much people don&#x27;t like it.<p>What&#x27;s needed are proper controls on the usage of the tool. And proper training.  And proper oversight.<p>If your argument is for something else instead of the above, then I don&#x27;t know what your solution would be.  &quot;Don&#x27;t have school&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t worry about cheating&quot; aren&#x27;t acceptable.')
