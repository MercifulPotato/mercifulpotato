I use ivy[0] but helm is also popular and there are others.<p>The main draw in this case is instead of having to tab through completion candidates, they appear as a vertical list which is updated as you type.  It also allows more advanced filtering, for example by regex which I find a lot easier to use than shell completion which only supports prefix.<p>For example say I want to navigate to a directory called `the-project` but I always forget whether it&#x27;s named `the-project` or `a-project`, it doesn&#x27;t matter because I just type `project` and would see `the-project` as an option so I&#x27;d navigate to that and select it (using `C-n` and `C-p` to navigate the list).<p>If that isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re looking for then another option is `emacsclient` [1] which let&#x27;s you open files in an already existing Emacs process.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abo-abo&#x2F;swiper" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abo-abo&#x2F;swiper</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emacswiki.org&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;EmacsClient" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emacswiki.org&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;EmacsClient</a>')
