Item(by='kawfey', descendants=None, kids=[25039544], score=None, time=1604950994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038683, text='I know a few teachers so I asked around.<p>The status quo - like in the classroom - is to still just use ___________&#x27;s and whitespace on printouts. Some teachers even print the students completed work, just because &quot;grading is easier that way&quot; (read: they&#x27;re unaware that computer based solutions for this problem exist, or they&#x27;re not very computer savvy to begin with.).<p>Science and math classes are a different ball game. A HS chem teacher I know wants to use all the fancy modern teaching, assignment, and grading tools, but the district disallows it. Since the student&#x27;s work involves drawing chemical structures, stoichiometry , and &quot;showing your work&quot; it&#x27;s far easier to just have students print, handwrite, and scan&#x2F;photograph their work than to persuade the district to buy software to perform the task. However, several students have been using iPads and drawing tablets to avoid printing and scanning, and a few overachievers use their own science&#x2F;math drawing&#x2F;graphing software, even LaTeX, to produce actual graphics and formatted equations.<p>I can imagine the same is true for math classes, where it&#x27;s a huge PITA to properly format algebra, long division tables, etc on computers without expensive proprietary software (that includes MS office!).')
