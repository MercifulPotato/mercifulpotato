While these problems can be mitigated by strong boards of directions who adhere to a larger mission, I think the better idea is to have many small organizations that promote problem solving while being part of a larger network that has the goal of solving the problem, and hope that the morally competent people can be spread about the network enough to encourage the solving of the problem, instead of the working on the problem.')
