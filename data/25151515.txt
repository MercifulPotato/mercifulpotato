It took a year or so including the transition phase.<p>1. Set up incoming E-mail forwarding from mydomain.org to Gmail. Exim will do this, probably all popular mail packages support forwarding well.<p>2. Start sending E-mail (from Gmail&#x27;s interface) as me@mydomain.org, and tell your friends to use that one.<p>2.5. (optional) Get your local mail client to work with Gmail&#x27;s IMAP and SMTP.<p>3. Take a deep breath and change that MX record.<p>4. Block out one or two evenings, pour yourself some Scotch, and go through each and every online account you have, changing your E-mail address. A password manager helps with this because it&#x27;s also the definitive list of every online account you have. While you&#x27;re at it, you might want to use me+company@mydomain.com so you can tell which E-mails come from which company, and know who is selling your E-mail address around.<p>5. Wait until people switch over and the vast majority of your E-mail is going to me@mydomain.org instead of your Gmail address. For me this took a year or so.<p>6. In the mean time set up locally hosted E-mail at mydomain.org. In my case I use exim4+dovecot+spamassassin. Don&#x27;t forget to set up SPF and DKIM correctly.<p>7. Pick a time in your life when you don&#x27;t expect to be getting urgent or important E-mail, like you&#x27;re not buying a house or applying for jobs. Take a deep breath, and apply the exim config that changes you from forwarding to self-hosting.<p>8. Ask all your friends to send you some test E-mails, preferably from different providers. Make sure you can at least deliver mail from gmail, yahoo, comcast, verizon, etc. Send mails to them and make sure they&#x27;re being delivered.<p>9. Assuming no problems in 7, pat yourself on the back for being part of the solution rather than the problem.<p>10. Periodically keep your eye out for trouble. Audit your logs every so often to make sure you&#x27;re not having trouble sending or receiving. I had to change my IPv6 at one point because comcast decided mine belonged to a spammer, but other than that it&#x27;s been smooth sailing.<p>11. Decide whether or not to keep your Gmail account. I kept mine, but it pretty much only gets spam now. Maybe once or twice a year I get a legit one there from someone I forgot to tell I changed my address. I keep an eye on my Gmail to find out when there are hot singles in my area or that there&#x27;s a new sure fire diet pill that sheds fat instantly.')
