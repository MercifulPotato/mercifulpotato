Whatever he thought about the prospects for that story, the acquirer surely had had their own plans, and those plans funded the Stern&#x27;s subsequent work and lifestyle.<p>Knowing what we know now, Stern surely would have bargained harder and perhaps gotten more money from RKO --- as is the case in any business transaction where we&#x27;re given perfect information about outcomes. But that doesn&#x27;t change the underlying moral rights involved.<p>I think this appeal to Stern is a pretty weak argument.<p>Further: the argument about copyright lapsing on Its A Wonderful Life is misleading. RKO let the copyright lapse, but if they hadn&#x27;t, it would properly have been copyrighted --- under the 1909 rules! --- until 2000.')
