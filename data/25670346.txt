I&#x27;m currently using Signal, but I&#x27;m not entirely satisfied. My major issues are that I don&#x27;t like their stance on a couple of issues: third party clients are not allowed, mobile first and desktop is only synced, phone number required, and distribution only over the app stores. Also we frequently get &quot;encryption errors&quot; and everybody ignores them, this is worse than with SSH key errors :-).')
