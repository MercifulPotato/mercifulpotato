The clock ticks at the same rate in internal reference frames, it is only different when looking at two different frames. But if you&#x27;re talking about them acting at slower speeds or faster, then that brings along other problems similar to the mechanics ones we discussed (assuming we&#x27;re not counting that they are in a slower reference frame). It really shifts the probabilities around. Even trees act relatively quickly because forces act fast. You&#x27;d have to be in a pretty extreme environment for other things to happen.<p>As to chemistry, if they are moving faster then that means that they have more thermal energy. That comes with radiative problems (why humans stand) and this is much more difficult the smaller you are because you have less surface area. Which then puts large energy requirements on intake. And then the inverse is true.<p>The thing is that aliens would still have to follow the laws of physics. There is no reason to expect that wouldn&#x27;t be true and reasoning otherwise would take some pretty extraordinary evidence and probably win you several Nobel prizes.')
