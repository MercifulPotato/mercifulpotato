I think that the tenure process creates a lot of weird incentives. That being said, I think another part of the system that is at least as important to fix is admissions. Right now we&#x27;re admitting people to PhD programs that we know the system can&#x27;t absorb. Those same people go on as postdocs, and it&#x27;s not really until the faculty stage where people get filtered out. One of the reasons I left academia after my PhD was that I didn&#x27;t want to have to wait another ~10 years to know whether or not I had a job. If the PhD -&gt; Postdoc transition had been a strong indicator of future success, I might have stayed in the system, but as it&#x27;s currently structured there&#x27;s very little information gain in getting a postdoc.')
