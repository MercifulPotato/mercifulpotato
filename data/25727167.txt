Might be. I am 50&#x2F;50 about it, people do dumb mistakes with self-rolled crypto all the time and that&#x27;s a sad reality. But who knows, it might be the first try to embed a backdoor.<p>My point is: being too sure one way or the either makes you biased. I err on the side of incompetence but I am open to the possibility that it was a first sloppy attempt at backdooring Telegram. Sadly we have no proof of either, so we speculate based on what&#x27;s available.')
