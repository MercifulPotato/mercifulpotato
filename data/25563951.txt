Humanity and the virus are assumed not to have evolved very much in the past year.<p>You give fifty thousand people injections, 25k get the vaccine and 25k get placebo, but noone knows, because there are two layers of indirection between the person&#x27;s name and the actual content of the vial. Then you wait until 250 people have fallen ill. If 247 of the 250 were people who got the placebo and 3 got the vaccine, then you assume that actually 247 vaccine recipients would have fallen ill, but only three did, therefore the vaccine protected 244, for an efficiency of 244&#x2F;247 = 98.7%.<p>All numbers pulled from a virtual hat, of course.')
