We did not have it at that time.<p>If it&#x27;s at a reasonable time (e.g. after all people have normally begun work), then have a low tolerance policy for those who come late. Sometimes our standups were about 5 minutes, because some people were on vacation and some were late. When the late people showed up, it would be to an empty room. We didn&#x27;t wait for them beyond 1 minute.<p>There&#x27;s no way we would tolerate 30 minutes, let alone an hour. If it was going beyond 15 minutes, many&#x2F;most of the developers would abruptly leave. You have to have an idea what you&#x27;re going to say before you enter the room, and not go into technical details - the standup is not a problem solving session. People who randomly droned in giving their update would be &quot;coached&quot;.<p>For a while we had the manager in the room. Then we booted him out - he was no longer welcome (it was an amicable parting :-) ).<p>&gt; but what I just described is the standup reality virtually everywhere.<p>I can believe your experience is more common than mine, but I can also say I wouldn&#x27;t work with such sloppiness in the team. In our case, our team wasn&#x27;t the standout. This discipline was drilled in at the organizational level and had support from the leaders.<p>It may sound bad the way I write it, but it was actually <i>very</i> easy to cultivate this culture, and everyone liked it. This was literally the easiest and simplest part of the work day.<p><i>Edit:</i> Lest this come off as a pro-scrum comment, I assure you it&#x27;s not. There are things I don&#x27;t like about Scrum, and am not sure I&#x27;d like to go back to working scrum-style. However, the complaints in the parent post are not problems with scrum, but cultural problems. As one of the pro-scrum people in my company put it: &quot;I&#x27;m not really sure Scrum does a great job in improving productivity. But it&#x27;s <i>excellent</i> at exposing existing problems in teams.&quot;')
