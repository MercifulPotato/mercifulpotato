Where does the power they have over us reside?<p>1) I believe it&#x27;s the alienation created by mean-of-exchange currency. While we use money in our day to day lives to buy goods and services, capitalist firms use complex software called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, that closely tracks the actual scarcity of all material resources used in their production processes.<p>2) Capitalist firms&#x27; use of trade secrets and patents (trade secrets often consist of vital negative research that lays out for us to see what has already been tried) to lock up our shared inheritance: the scientific commons, which unlocks inventions and tools that bring joy to many people&#x27;s lives (who doesn&#x27;t like the latest laptop computers or smartphones, or [insert technology of choice]). Unfortunately, the end goal, as Peter Thiel gave away, is always to achieve a monopoly position - which results in massive power imbalances, extreme labor exploitation and widespread environmental destruction. Exactly the kind of power imbalance we can see today between the bourgeois class in the global north, and the humans in the global south who face incredible poverty.<p>So, what is the most promising path or future that I see forwards?<p>1)<p>a) An exciting and novel distributed application framework, called holochain, allows for fully distributed apps that use peer validation, like Bittorrent&#x27;s DHT, and are thus version controlled self-healing networks that can be used for all sorts of networked social applications.<p>b) Valueflo.ws and hREA (both led by Mikorizal, with early co-development with Sensorica), builds on holochain&#x27;s novelty, and allows an underused accounting method, called Resources Events Agents (REA) accounting, to flip today&#x27;s dominant ERP system on it&#x27;s head, and instead allows for a radically participative system, which they call a Network Resource Planning (NRP) system. [1]<p>2) The knock on effect of (1) is that it could makes today&#x27;s alienating means-of-exchange money redundant. This could in turn allow us to see today&#x27;s scarce capitalist appropriated knowledge for what it is: an artificially constrained intellectual commons. In other words: since digital information has a zero marginal cost reproduction, any limits to copying are contrived and are there to keep privileged people in, and working class people out. By using a Network Resource Planning system to make visible all the material flows in a community&#x2F;village&#x2F;city, we can democratically decide what we use these resources for - instead of relying on corporate central planning behind closed doors [2]. We can then be free to use a decentralized&#x2F;distributed Github system (e.g. Git-SSB or Radicle.xyz) to turn the intellectual property system inside out. To have it be a system for building all of society open source&#x2F;free, completely out in the open and transparent, and celebrating new contributions; and not for giving out state-sanctioned monopolies (the so-called Intellectual Property systems).<p>Bottom line: humans copying each other is not theft. Our systems makes it seem so, yet it allows the capitalist elite to do exactly that by receiving privileged access to all the knowledge that has been privatized by capitalist firms [3]. Our current systems have us literally throw away functional components, because as a whole the products are single use black-box proprietary tools, that take away our freedom to continually grow.<p>Imagine if everything was modular? Could we become a solarpunk, DIY, modular and low-energy-tech, society? A society where we share information freely, and where we can radically change our fate in regards to climate change.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikorizal.org&#x2F;futures.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikorizal.org&#x2F;futures.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobinmag.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;economic-planning-walmart-democracy-socialism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobinmag.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;economic-planning-walmart-dem...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;stream&#x2F;GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto&#x2F;Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;stream&#x2F;GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto&#x2F;Goamj...</a>')
