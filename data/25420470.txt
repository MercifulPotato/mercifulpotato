If a person finds it unfulfilling, well, such a person will be motivated to branch out and start doing something else.<p>Depends on what we are &quot;fulfilling&quot;. Just think about an extremely overweight person who cannot stop overeating. Yes, they are fulfilled in terms of food, but (sometimes) they are self-loathing and consider the fact that they cannot stop eating a personal failure, so in that sense they are the farthest from &quot;fulfilled&quot;.<p>Same is true for porn, you might be fulfilled in a sense that you get to orgasm in 10 minutes, but there are other facets of life where regular porn consumption or masturbation might have a negative effect.')
