Some influential portion of a population agrees (organically, culturally) that certain ways of behaving are more valuable (or unacceptable) to the community, even if not every individual necessarily agrees. This can obviously result in <i>extremely</i> non-free societal structures, as you suggest, but community at any significant scale will always require some compromise of individual freedoms.<p>This is necessitated by the very diversity of individual human proclivities and interests. To refer to the compromise, sacrifice, or diminishment of some of those interests as &quot;oppression&quot; strikes me as selfish and melodramatic, even if it is often regrettable from certain perspectives. Certainly sometimes it <i>is</i> oppression, and it is frequently unfair, but extreme individualism doesn&#x27;t fix or even address this fundamental tension.')
