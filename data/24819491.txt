It&#x27;s bringing in a ton of unnecessary dependencies for such a simple task. Just using walkdir directly (which globwalk depends on) and filtering on the file extension would be just nearly as simple and use oodles less code.<p>This is IMO a good example of poor choices that an &quot;npm-like ecosystem&quot; can encourage. Obviously there are deep and fundamental trade offs here, but other than watching crates compile, you&#x27;re almost completely removed from just how much code you&#x27;re bringing in relative to what is really necessary.')
