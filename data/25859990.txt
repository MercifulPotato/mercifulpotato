We do this all the time with regulations and laws because people can&#x27;t always be trusted to make decisions that aren&#x27;t selfish.<p>It&#x27;s not as clear-cut like you make it out to be and there are real ethical questions here. So let&#x27;s Steelman OP&#x27;s argument. This vaccine was developed very quickly and there are potential side-effects. And like OP said, the vaccine doesn&#x27;t necessarily prevent transmission (though in fairness, it must have some effect because it does reduce the viral load). So you&#x27;re mandating a healthy individual (who may not even be in the at-risk group for COVID either) get inoculated with something that did not follow traditional healthcare protocols for vaccine development, can cause adverse reactions, and doesn&#x27;t prevent spread.<p>Are we OK with signing off on that kind of policy without some debate? What complicates it for me is that dissenting opinions from credible virologist and epidemiologists and clinicians is routinely suppressed and blocked by social media right now.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m 100% in favor of requiring vaccines and keeping the antivax crows in a silo, away from the general population.<p>I know you say that, but you&#x27;re not because you&#x27;re never going to fully trust health authorities with your health (remember, health authorities are people and they make mistakes, see what happened in Flint when the State was telling people water was safe to drink when it wasn&#x27;t).<p>For example, let&#x27;s say there are reports[1] of clusters of really major adverse reactions - do you fully trust health authority&#x27;s guarantees that vaccine is perfectly safe? Are you really really sure this wouldn&#x27;t be a repeat of the 1970s flue vaccine fiasco - another vaccine that was rushed into production? And again, the context here is also important. There is a higher risk factor associated with this specific vaccine than a traditionally developed one.<p>[1] Again, social media has decided to editorialize on this point. That is, even if credible reports come out against the vaccine, they will suppress these reports if it goes against health authority guidelines. Which, paradoxically, leads to reduced trust.')
