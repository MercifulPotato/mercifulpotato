Item(by='singron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611677983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916820, text='1 mostly applies to update heavy tables since index only scans use the visibility map, which would be frequently invalidated.<p>3 is definitely true, especially the larger the table. I&#x27;ve had success splitting frequently updated columns out into their own much smaller table, or any other trick to concentrate updates into a small table. Also MVCC bookkeeping requires updating pages, so an UPDATE that doesn&#x27;t change any field and SELECT FOR UPDATE will cause the same problem.')
