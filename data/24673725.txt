I&#x27;ve largely abandoned the platform, as it seems all it is, is an echo chamber of people I know of all political leanings posting shit that strongly, and often inaccurately supports their political viewpoint.<p>Its no longer a platform of people causally sharing their personal lives, its seeming an endless stream of worthless shares and repost.<p>I really want to see a social network that limits the ability to repost and &quot;share&quot; content like this, maybe go so far as to even do copy and paste content checks to make sure its not just shitpost copy pasta.')
