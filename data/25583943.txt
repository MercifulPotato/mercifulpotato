The REPL and the debugger&#x2F;inspector are amazingly powerful.<p>I still find Lisp itself very hard to read, though. I understand the whole homoiconicity thing, and how S-expressions are one of the simplest implementations of that, but it&#x27;s things like &quot;car&quot;&#x2F;&quot;cdr&quot; instead of some reasonable memorable name (say, &quot;first&quot;&#x2F;&quot;rest&quot;) that kill me. Just don&#x27;t seem to have the brain space for it.')
