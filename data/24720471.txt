Item(by='mybestaccount', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602173336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713655, text='A &quot;free speech&quot; platform is not enough of a value proposition for mainstream users to migrate. The only people who will be incentivized to move will be toxic&#x2F;fringe&#x2F;controversial people and their followings. If you want to make a community for those people, go ahead. See gab.com, voat.com, 4chan.org, parler.com etc... All these places are similar to reddit&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;twitter but without censorship. However, the whole point of a &quot;free-speech&quot; platform is to encourage an open exchange of ideas. If you only serve one side of the political spectrum, what ideas are you exchanging? It&#x27;s just an echo chamber.<p>My point is that a real competitor to reddit will be highly dependent on some technical innovation that convinces a &quot;normal users&quot; to migrate. Our only hope is that this new platform will be wiser in terms of censorship policies. No normal person is going to waste their time signing up, actively post, check, and sink their time into a platform who&#x27;s whole pitch is &quot;a twitter&#x2F;reddit clone with less users, but you can say racial slurs&quot;.')
