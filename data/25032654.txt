They&#x27;ve extracted all the blood they can and given us back scraps.</i><p>That is simply not true. A great deal of the open source software I use on a day-to-day basis is funded by some of these companies. The number of GitHub repositories they publish for all to use, under permissive licenses, is immense.<p>&gt; <i>The web is bloated with ads and tracking, AMP is given preference, Facebook and Twitter are testing the limits of democracy and radicalizing everyone to cancel one another.</i><p>You are right about this, but this is at best tangentially related to open source.')
