Remote-machine threaded debugging (like you see with driver and embedded stuff) makes one wake up screaming for <i>years</i>.<p>In the eighties and nineties, there was this famous low-level Mac debugger, called “The Debugger V2 &amp; MacNosy.”<p>If anyone remembers that, I may have just reawakened trauma.

These were big-ass machines that had a PGA that you would plonk into the processor slot, and they would emulate the processor. You <i>really</i> could dig out those nasties with an ICE.<p>Processors are way too hairy for that, nowadays.')
