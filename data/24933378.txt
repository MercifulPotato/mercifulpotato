Life on Earth has evolved to live in hundreds of dissimilar environments. Heavy salt <i>is</i> toxic, yet fish manage the ocean. Yellowstone has life in mud pots at hundreds of degrees. Air doesn&#x27;t exist underground yet bacteria thrive there. Hell, there are living things on the surface of the space station.<p>To get people to tolerate more salt, we&#x27;d have to have a fish&#x27;s ability to regulate it. Ok, genes for that. Air issues? Filters, microstructures to migrate particulates out, baffles (like many creates already have). Deep-ocean pressure? Only a couple of issues there, and certainly life thrives at the bottom of the ocean.<p>It&#x27;s not optimism; its simple observation of what we have already on Earth in existing life forms.<p>And 30,000 years changes not a thing. The log of 1 Trillion base 2 is 39. In 40 generations of space colonization, that&#x27;s 40 times 30,000 times however long it takes to rebuild the capability on each colony. In a dozen million years the galaxy would be covered. Its 20B years old. So, nobody&#x27;s tried it yet.')
