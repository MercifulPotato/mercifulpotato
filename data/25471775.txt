A format&#x2F;protocol validator? An interoperability matrix? What&#x27;s the ratio of SHOULDs and MAYs to REQUIREDs, SHALLs, and MUSTs? Does the RFC reference other RFCs? What are the answers to these questions regarding those?<p>I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t ever describe the task of implementing a SOAP[0] or WebDAV[1] library as &#x27;kind&#x27;.<p>Oh, and if you&#x27;re working at a sufficiently large org, be prepared to battle it out with a competing internal implementation for the coveted position of &#x27;company standard&#x27;.<p>Note that you (or your boss) may not actually want to win that battle, as internal customers will make all <i>sorts</i> of unreasonable demands[2], and implementing them all will cut into your real work and negatively affect your evaluations and career advancement. Also, refusing to implement those requests will get you labelled as &quot;not a team player&quot; and negatively affect your evaluations and career advancement.<p>Fun times!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shlomifish.org&#x2F;humour&#x2F;by-others&#x2F;s-stands-for-simple&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shlomifish.org&#x2F;humour&#x2F;by-others&#x2F;s-stands-for-sim...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;tobyS&#x2F;webdav-the-good-the-bad-and-the-evil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;tobyS&#x2F;webdav-the-good-the-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dilbert.com&#x2F;strip&#x2F;1995-11-17" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dilbert.com&#x2F;strip&#x2F;1995-11-17</a>')
