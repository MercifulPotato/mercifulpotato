Inflation isn&#x27;t determined as a function of &quot;steak&quot; but rather as a function of &quot;protein.&quot;<p>For instance, industrial agriculture, the farm bill subsidizing corn to below the cost of production starting in 1933, and many other things may change the relative cost of beef over time as compared to, for instance, pork and chicken. That&#x27;s not inflation, and as such it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to define inflation in terms of these factors which affect only a specific industry.')
