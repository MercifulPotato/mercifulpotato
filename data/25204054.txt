On my (actually similarly sized) desk, I typically have two monitors, two table lamps, one notebook, a USB-C dock and a wired keyboard&#x2F;mouse. Do I have to climb below my desk to undock the notebook? Are there holes in the desk for the wires of my input devices? I would not want to miss my mouse and I also prefer being able to move the keyboard instead of having it fixed.<p>Furthermore, what&#x27;s about regularly changing the ordering? I can clean and streamline my ordinary desk right now with a few cable straps and extension chords. This will take me 15min and look fine. But tomorrow I decide to use other hardware and need to decompose all that clutter. A management solution definetly needs to be flexible to allow me to save time when cleaning up the desk.')
