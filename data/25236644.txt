I meant that I&#x27;ve deleted these &quot;random&quot; files as the user. As a user I have no faith that application developers will properly manage disk space usage for what they cache. If an application like Chrome has no problem taking up 10 GB of space mostly due to caching, then I have no expectation that most other software will do better. Perhaps this information gets communicated to the user somewhere, but it tends to not be done in an easy to understand manner.')
