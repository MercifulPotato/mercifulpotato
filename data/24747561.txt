OTOH the minimum economic size is probably somewhat larger.<p>I would imagine there&#x27;s similar issues as with nuclear power plants on land, that is, to get the best return on the invested capital you want to run them with as high capacity factor as possible. So some short-range ship that spends a large fraction of its time in port is probably a poor match, whereas a trans-oceanic liner with quick turnarounds, like a container ship, could make for a good fit.<p>Nowadays there&#x27;s &quot;New Panamax&quot;, after a new set of locks opened in 2016 enabling (much) bigger ships.')
