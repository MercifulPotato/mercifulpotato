Any tool that works at the code level either focuses on very simple properties (memory safety), complex but local properties of a small code-unit (Ada SPARK, Java&#x27;s OpenJML), or deep properties of tiny programs (like seL4 and CompCert).<p>This may be true in a sense, but then a TLA+ specification is also a &quot;tiny program&quot; of sorts. There&#x27;s no reason why one couldn&#x27;t use a &quot;code-level&quot; (end-to-end) interactive proof tool to verify TLA+-like specs. Even model checking can be subsumed elegantly within such a tool; a model checking run is simply a search for a <i>refutation</i> (as opposed to a positive proof) of some claimed properties wrt. the proposed spec.')
