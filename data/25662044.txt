I&#x27;m hearing very similar things happening in other countries as well. The hilarious part is every political side believing they are the only ones with facts. It sort of reminds me of how civilizations collapse - esp. the &#x27;barbarians&#x27; overpowering &#x27;civilized&#x27; Europe. All current mainstream political parties have these barbarians within them. They don&#x27;t all take violent forms, but they infect people with memes and thoughts that go counter to facts and logic. In general though, I think its the slow decline of hard news with a corresponding amplification of emotional porn&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;drama. The massive amount of noise that is generated makes it hard to find the signal, and social media isn&#x27;t helping because they make money when &quot;news&quot; is more entertainment&#x2F;drama than boring facts. In short, we&#x27;re f?ked, and we&#x27;re going to say f?ked for a while.')
