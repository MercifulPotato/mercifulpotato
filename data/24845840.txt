It depends, very much, on context.<p>There&#x27;s contexts where good knowledge of the ORM, and of SQL, is part of the bar of working in the environment. This often happens in stacks where there aren&#x27;t a zillion different choices but rather curated default choices for things like ORMS.<p>Combined with having a large and sophisticated system (or many similar small ones), then the complexity saving of being able to use a good ORM (and LINQ) provides a significant savings in time, and complexity.<p>This helps the systems to last, and be passed on to other developers.')
