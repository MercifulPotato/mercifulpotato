Liberia is (as far as i heard) not really comparable to SL, Nigeria or most other &quot;more civilised&quot; african countries. Even black colleagues from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Kenia who were deployed at the same time experienced a culture shock (though not quite as extreme), so neither &quot;africa in general&quot; nor the racial background can explain the experience, i think it was really a uniquely weird place on earth. But the country life is probably quite different to Monrovia so there may be a huge gap in experience of people you met that just drove through some nature and village. As i had to work all the time anyways i did not mind the rain too much and it was usually on time like a clockwork and maybe one or 2 hours a day max. As far as my understanding goes, there was no such thing as real tourism, you could not just book a flight to Liberia without family ties or an invitation by an NGO or Government with a reason, but that may have been due to lockdown from ebola.')
