Now most android phones are sliding more and more towards glued together bricks while iphones are mostly the same to the point where most android devices are actually harder to repair.<p>I took my Pixel 2 in to a store for a battery replacement and the person told me that there is a chance the screen will shatter when they remove it. If a person with all the tools and training can&#x27;t reliably replace the battery something is seriously wrong. Apple might be doing a lot of things horrible but they are the only ones who actually have a store in my area and offer repairs on their own devices.')
