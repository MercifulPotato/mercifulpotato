The OP explicitly referred to cryptocurrencies&#x27; inherent high volatility, and volatility is not a mere transaction risk.  Seeing your debt explode, because you either borrowed or deferred payments, due to cryotocurrency volatility is not a transaction risk. It&#x27;s simply the fact that cryptocurrency fails as being money.')
