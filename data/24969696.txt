You just have to QA them on arrival. Set up an RMAed-parts box with a shipping label in advance; you’ll need it.<p>&gt; broken connectors<p>The microSD connector? In an educational context, that shouldn’t be end-user exposed. It’s essentially a maintenance port. Stick some tape over it.<p>In the computer labs of the 90s, kids would break the CD-ROM drive trays, too. MDM software was developed that would, among other things, lock out the CD-tray eject mechanism unless&#x2F;until a teacher enabled it (presumably for working through some whole-class “multimedia” product that never materialized, because who’d trust kids to <i>insert</i> the CDs?)')
