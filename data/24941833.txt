Also suppose each politician has varying degrees of dirt, from minor mistakes, not in bad faith, to full on treason.\nThen suppose there&#x27;s an adversary capable of hacking any of the politicians&#x27; aforementioned secret media. This adversary can now pick and choose which politician they release damaging evidence of. They don&#x27;t need to release all of it, implicating the politician with the most severe grievances. Just the one the adversary decides they disfavor.\nIn this case, your argument is saying &quot;let&#x27;s focus on this small mistake, because that&#x27;s all the info we have.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not advocating that in the real world, the bigger story is about who&#x27;s releasing the info, rather than the info itself. However, there are issues when not taking both into account.')
