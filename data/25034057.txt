Item(by='brabel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604925058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25033367, text='&gt; I&#x27;m sure that politicians are just envy over China and want to replicate their measures.<p>China has the same goal as the Western powers have: to be able to keep spying on anyone they deem enemy of the state.<p>The difference is who they define as enemy of the state. In China, that includes pretty much anyone that criticises the Government, as well as what they see as hostile nations (probably the USA, maybe UK, which openly call China their enemies mostly without real provocation, and perhaps Japan due to its closeness to the US and its past of barbarities committed during the occupation of nearly half of the Chinese territory).<p>In most western democracies, the enemy would be terrorists (they claim) and, as we now know, pretty much any other Government, ally or not... and that&#x27;s what we currently know, there is probably a much wider reach still that we may never know for sure... the Snowden leaks show that they will collect mass surveillance not only on foreign heads of state, but on their own populations without any restrictions, just in case they need it later. Given that, I am not even sure China actually has more surveillance in place than the USA and the UK, for example. It&#x27;s a huge disappointment for anyone thinking the western world holds the moral ground, we who live here need  to get our Governments understand we will not accept this!<p>Europe and some developing countries did not really react when it was revealed the US was mass-spying on its Government officials because they obviously are doing the same, they just didn&#x27;t get caught in the same way yet. The people behind all this spying believe they are doing good as they&#x27;re keeping world peace. I think they do the opposite: because other governments&#x27; counter-intelligence probably know more or less who is doing what against them, they&#x27;re kept in a constant state of readiness for conflict. True world peace can only come when there&#x27;s mutual trust between countries... While everyone spies on everyone else, we&#x27;ll continue to live in a world on the brink of WW3. You think WW3 is impossible? Well, read about WW1 and how basically no one expected it at all. Circumstances today are even more heated than at the time WW1 broke out. Funnily enough, the only thing that&#x27;s holding WW3 back is the nukes behind the big armies which make full-on conflict a very uncomfortable prospect indeed.')
