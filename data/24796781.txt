But when your position becomes, &quot;actually, you can delete only spam, but nothing else&quot; then you&#x27;re back in the exact same situation we are currently in - some things are removed by judgement call and not everyone is going to agree on every judgement. It completely removes the very core of the argument - that judgement calls should be unnecessary or not allowed.<p>If you&#x27;re suggesting crowd sourcing moderation in a democratic fashion, I would contend this both isn&#x27;t effective and also that by providing systems that facilitate this, companies would be implicitly affecting the &quot;censorship&quot; of their platform. After all, someone has to decide what the voting algorithm is, what the chance of being a spammer before you are blocked is, etc.')
