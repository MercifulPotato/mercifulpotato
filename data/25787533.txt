Item(by='questionasker57', descendants=1, kids=[25788151], score=1, time=1610690358, title='Ask HN: What would you do about a possibly violent person?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi.<p>I know a person that’s essentially gone insane and has become an immediate threat to everyone around them. They’re currently openly talking about using their substantial armory of recently purchased guns (and as far as I understand illegal tracer-round ammunition and other things I don’t understand) to shoot anyone related to BLM and anything even resembling mainstream liberalism or progressives. They’ve also recently hospitalized their partner with multiple skull fractures and a shattered right femur.<p>This person has also been setting up rogue APs during the protests in Minneapolis over the summer and dumping protestors personal data on various Discord channels.<p>Here’s the problem:\nThe ATF, FBI and DHS have all been made aware (by close to a dozen individuals around them), as well as local police, and they’ve made contact multiple times without anything substantive happening at all. This person maintains their armory and an online presence to this day.<p>I am not asking about fantasies about vigilante justice or taking matters into one’s own hands. I am asking about literally “Who would you call that has some ability to address this issue within the law in the instance that the FBI, ATF and DHS have failed to do so despite hoards of public information and countless reports already on file?”<p>This is not some sort of thought experiment. It is actually happening and I’d like to know if the community around this person has perhaps missed a possible resource.')
