If Chrome doesn&#x27;t support my compliant minimal web server, that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t useful, or even that I should have to change it.<p>HTTP is the lingua franca of the internet. We need to keep a simple, text-based version of it around, so that the barrier to entry for competing with the big boys remains reasonable. We&#x27;ve already lost that fight with browsers, but HTTP is still in a pretty good place. Even HTTP&#x2F;3 is reasonable for a small startup to implement. And if you can&#x27;t manage that, you can implement HTTP&#x2F;1.1 and sacrifice some performance for simplicity.')
