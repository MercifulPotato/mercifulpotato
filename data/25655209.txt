I can&#x27;t find it on the web now, though.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea compared to other gravity storage solutions because<p>- It&#x27;s the volume of the buoy rather than the mass that&#x27;s important<p>- It could be colocated with and hooked up to offshore wind farms to smooth their generation<p>- You don&#x27;t need to build a super-tall crane or elevated reservoir (but you do have to assemble the thing at the bottom of the ocean which sounds hard)<p>I haven&#x27;t heard anything about it in ages so it must have turned out not to be practical.')
