Item(by='OnlyLys', descendants=None, kids=[25317720], score=None, time=1607190325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316326, text='Ebook DRMs are truly some of the most annoying things ever.<p>I just want to click &quot;Pay&quot;, and then click &quot;download PDF&quot; so I can annotate the books in my favorite app. Why do they have to make it more complicated than that.<p>This reminds me of a few months ago when I accidentally bought a 90 USD Ebook that came with DRM. I didn&#x27;t realize it until I clicked the download button and got some Adobe digital editions file. I immediately Googled for a PDF copy of the book and saw that there were plenty on the first page of Google, so I don&#x27;t know what the point of the DRM was other than to make me have to download some crappy reader just to read it. Thank goodness the company that sold the Ebook was willing to refund me.')
