On the other hand, people from L.A. told me the same things about Villaraigosa, and in any case he failed to even beat Cox to get on the general ballot so the point was moot.<p>I don&#x27;t know why anyone would be disappointed by Newsom going to dinner with some lobbyists, unless they had simply adopted a default-neutral view of the man. Newsom only knows lobbyists.')
