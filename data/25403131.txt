A bunch of words. What do those words mean in combination the the surrounding words? Uh oh, we just hit subjectivity.<p>“Originalism”, “Textualism”, “Absurdism”, etc. are all pure nonsense. Judges, and most particularly Supreme Court judges are definitively expressing their unique opinions as to what a law is, which is identical to “what a law should be”. Someone could attempt to argue that a judge’s opinion of what a law is may not align with what that judge actually believes it should be, but the evidence of consistent partisan split votes makes such an argument particularly weak.')
