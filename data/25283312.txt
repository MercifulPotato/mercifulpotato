I&#x27;m just struggling to cross the giant gap between the baked in assumptions in my mind and the baked in assumptions out in the world and there never seems to be a good way to do that.<p>Trying to be diplomatic about it ends up making me &quot;look stupid.&quot; Trying to be confident about my views ends up making me look like a narcissistic and contemptuous asshole who thinks everyone else is stupid.<p>My mental framing for the space is different than yours. That doesn&#x27;t, per se, mean I&#x27;m wrong or stupid.<p>My mental framing is rooted in having lived with a genetic disorder my entire life and having raised a child with the same disorder and getting diagnosed late in life.<p>The problem space for a dominant genetic disorder like Huntington&#x27;s Disease is fundamentally different from that for a recessive disorder. Mental models for how to address them <i>should</i> be fundamentally different as well.<p>So telling me &quot;That doesn&#x27;t work for a dominant disorder&quot; isn&#x27;t really a valid rebuttal of anything I&#x27;ve said. I&#x27;m not suggesting it as policy for dominant disorders.')
