A core tenet of at least one political ideology in the United States is the idea that one&#x27;s rights only extend as far as another&#x27;s unharmed state of existence. i.e. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;liberty-fist-nose&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;liberty-fist-nose&#x2F;</a><p>Such limitations in the case of the first amendment are pretty well captured here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_free_speech_exceptions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_free_speech_exce...</a><p>Credible threats of violence and incitement register with <i>exceptionally strong</i> precedent. Fighting words and threatening the President-Elect of the United States are two such categories of unprotected speech with, again, exceptionally strong precedent.<p>Anyone claiming their freedom of speech is being violated in this scenario by pushing fighting words and specific threats may be failing to understand:<p>1. that such freedoms don&#x27;t extend as protection from being barred by private property and enterprise, and<p>2. that even if they did, their words are exempt... again, with strong law and case law.<p>I do agree that there&#x27;s value in exploring registering social media and communications platforms as utilities. I don&#x27;t yet know the implications of such.<p>And on another note (and borrowing from an earlier comment of mine), I do wonder how many of the Parler removals that have taken place used Wednesday as the justification but in reality were done for FOSTA&#x2F;SESTA cover, which ironically is a law passed within the last few years.')
