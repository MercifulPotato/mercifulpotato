The only way it can flourish is censored away into manipulative misdirection and secretive groups.<p>There is also the <i>immunity to bad ideas</i> aspect; Its important that the propaganda is heard openly and argued against in public, as this makes people immune to these arguments.  Censor these bad ideas and we make the next generation vulnerable to them.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can offset this with education, as with drugs, we never give the kids the very best <i>bad idea - argument</i> when we try to teach the dangers of drugs, this is why so many are vulnerable to the dealers quiet persuasion.  I really feel like the more we silence movements like the alt right, the more vulnerable our society becomes to their bad ideas.')
