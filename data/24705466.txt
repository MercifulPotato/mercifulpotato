(I mispoke - it won&#x27;t replace &quot;heavy&quot; logic, but most UI needs aren&#x27;t heavy) But for many the logic really isn&#x27;t that complex; they just want reactivity. There&#x27;s a frustration with needing to roll out a complex build process, JWTs, state management, etc, just to speed things up a bit. This is an alternative to that, in a way that really doesn&#x27;t differ much from React in terms of speed or reactivity.<p>For those truly complex UI logic cases, React components are still a tool you can use. The approaches aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive.')
