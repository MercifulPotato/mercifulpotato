It asks her right there in setup. Do you think your mom knows that Apple tracks every location she has ever been, and she can&#x27;t make them stop? Even you don&#x27;t know it, and you&#x27;re arguably tech literate.<p>The correct way to handle privacy is giving users the choice between usability and privacy. Android does this correctly. Google&#x27;s Android devices default to usable, which gives you services that are actually useful unlike the iOS apps that are missing functionality, and allows the user to install apps that are actually private and set them as default if they prefer. Other Android distributions default to the other side. iOS is worse both for people who value functionality and for people who value privacy because it gives you defaults that are neither private nor usable that you cannot change.')
