The download times halved.<p>However, benchmarks with F12 developer tools showed that while downloads reduced from 200ms to 100ms, the overall load times were still seconds, of which about 50% was actual CPU time.<p>(This is typical of large, complex sites built by non-experts  or organisations where performance is not a primary concern.)<p>Web sites like these perform <i>very</i> noticeably better if you have more CPU cores or faster CPU cores.<p>Essentially, CDNs are easy to deploy and 5G provides nearly gigabit download speeds, so the bottleneck has shifted back to the CPU for a lot of the web.')
