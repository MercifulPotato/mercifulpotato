In my experience, Svelte does a great job of just getting out of the way and letting you start coding.<p>The ecosystem isn&#x27;t there yet, and I probably wouldn&#x27;t try to use it in a work project. For my personal projects though, I use it for everything front-end. More than that - I&#x27;ve stopped making desktop apps and just default to using svelte instead.<p>Happy to answer any specific questions you&#x27;ve got! Bottom line - given the opportunity, I will use Svelte.')
