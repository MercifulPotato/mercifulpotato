There are huge profit incentives for a cure. If a biotech company comes up with a cure they will instantly have the business of every afflicted person on the planet. The market for that and price they can charge will be way larger than a slightly different treatment.<p>Beyond that, there are labs all over the world funded by public dollars to research avenues to a cure, it’s just way more complicated than effective treatment.')
