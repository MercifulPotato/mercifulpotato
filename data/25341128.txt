There are plenty of real ways to criticize TW—the choice of variants is quirky, dev builds slow hot reloading a lot, it doesn’t cover a lot of cases which leads to “Bailwind”, and more I’m sure that I’m not thinking of now—but the criticisms that “it adds too many classes to HTML” or “semantics!” are boring and not useful.')
