All the crypto advertising inside Brave asking users to connect wallets has nothing to do with the BAT rewards system, but they present it in a way that implies it’s somehow related. BAT itself is not really what they claim either because as a user you are not actually given tokens, you are given entries in a database which they then reconcile monthly and send you some amount of BAT of their choosing once you’ve passed KYC with a single sketchy KYC provider. There is no way around this if you want to actually sell your tokens. So the fact that it’s a “token” is for marketing only.')
