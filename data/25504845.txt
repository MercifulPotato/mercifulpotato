Always have a support car? Only do circular rides from home?<p>I&#x27;m sure there are some people whose lifestyle lets them treat a bicycle like a musical instrument. I really don&#x27;t think most people could do it, not while riding with any real frequency. I count myself lucky that my office has underground bicycle parking (and we&#x27;re still talking wheel-bender racks next to the A&#x2F;C exhaust vents). I stand by the statement that a bicycle that needs to be looked after that carefully isn&#x27;t, by the usual standards of such things, a practical bicycle.')
