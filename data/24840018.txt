I&#x27;m not sure if Matrix&#x27;s reputation system can be used to &quot;call out&quot; individuals or groups, like Twitter callouts (or blocklists&#x2F;blockchains) operate. However, I have the experience of seeing someone on Discord being called out on Twitter for being a pedophile (though I didn&#x27;t see that because Discord doesn&#x27;t let you subscribe to reputation services which comments on users as you see them), and then reregistering under a different Discord identity and joining servers without saying the original identity. So this is already happening.<p>Twitter now shows posts liked (not just retweeted) by those you follow. I&#x27;ve heard that has led to &quot;like policing&quot;, in addition to avoiding people based on who they follow.<p>Are reputation feeds going to be subject to threats of libel lawsuits if used for false reporting?')
