We are giving instant &quot;street&quot; addresses to whole world. People can get an instant address to their doorstep, backyard, or any place of their choice. That&#x27;s 7B+ people, 7T+ addresses, no streets required.<p>- WHY? Because, we think our current addresses are old, broken &amp; inadequate for todayâ€™s needs. And, existing solutions such as What3words or Google Plus Codes aren&#x27;t enough.<p>- THE BIG PICTURE: We are building a scalable platform to power e-commerce 3.0, last-mile logistics, drone deliveries, uberized mailboxes, universal &amp; even space addresses.<p>- TRACTION: Currently in partnership talks with 3 businesses across logistics, postal sectors, and food delivery. Also, in talks with 3 tier-1 VC firms.<p>CONTACT: schandra@smartaddress.io<p>LinkedIn: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;srays&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;srays&#x2F;</a>')
