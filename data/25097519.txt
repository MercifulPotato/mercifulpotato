I also doubt that the location savings are that substantial. you don&#x27;t need to lease the prime real estate that everyone walks by, but you still need to be within a 15-20 minute drive of your customer base. any property within 20 minutes of a dense area tends to be expensive to rent.<p>there are already a few take-out&#x2F;delivery only places in my area. the only ones that seem to be doing well have pretty bad food for the price.')
