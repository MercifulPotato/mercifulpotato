Wall Street has deeper pockets. Robinhood manages $20B in total. A small-ish hedge fund has like, a few billion dollars AUM. There are many such hedge funds, and a couple dozens much larger ones.<p>A couple funds with large short positions have popped, but short interest hasn&#x27;t budged; they were just quietly replaced by other funds.
