Digital technology, however, is still in its infancy. Many users are brand new to the internet in the last ten years. I have learned to pace my time on the internet, but this is after 25 years of practice and burning out on the novelty of it. We are all figuring out that new does not mean progress.<p>Case in point: I recently started back with the DVD side of Netflix. This is what I remembered being so awesome: find a good movie list, add it to your queue, pop envelopes in the mailbox when you&#x27;re done.<p>It is 1000% better than endless scrolling on 5 different streaming services. I think about what I want to watch twice a month, and when I have time, I don&#x27;t have to deal with any ads or worry about a spotty night on a cable modem.<p>I avoided the whole smart-home fad because there&#x27;s nothing wrong with physical controls and buttons that have been developed over generations of human interaction. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m waiting for a good built-in-the-USA electric instead of buying a chassis with a touchscreen.<p>But someone else may hate controls and love touchscreens -- cool. The market lets us pick and choose.<p>If we can continue to reign in the inequality and environmental impacts produced by technology, use the incredible wealth we have as societies to finally end poverty, and continue to make progress against injustice, the future is incredibly bright.')
