You wouldn&#x27;t wear it in the office, at a dinner, or at a party. Of course those are some extreme examples that aren&#x27;t 1:1 comparable with a garmin. But the general principle to me is the same, to me a garmin 945 looks great on people doing sports, and out-of-place on people not wearing sports clothes.<p>I think this looks really classy for example, and could easily be worn on something casual (that&#x27;s not sport clothes) or formal, without looking out of place: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.karousell.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;photos&#x2F;products&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;ready_stock_iwatch_strap_with_rose_gold_milanese_loop_stainless_steel_for_apple_watch_series_14_38mm_1555342861_6cdda916_progressive.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.karousell.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;photos&#x2F;products&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;15...</a><p>The way that the watch is mostly screen and that screen can show a style compatible with any situation, with swappable bands, is a lot more stylish and versatile than something bulky, with a very large bezel, limited watch face choices, a dim low-resolution screen, often not always-on etc. (not sure &#x27;bout the 945 on all of these btw, just my general impression).')
