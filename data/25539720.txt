Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608936841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537078, text='&gt; Git will be replaced by something that uses intuitive metaphors like &quot;save&quot;, &quot;load&quot;, &quot;undo&quot;, &quot;go back to old version&quot;, &quot;update my work with work from colleague&quot;, &quot;update the official state with my work&quot; and others.<p>Those are the usecases that Git already handles. Each and every single one of them. Somehow you conspicuously left branching out of it, which is the main value added by any version control system along with merging. Thus I really don&#x27;t see the point of arguing that Git will be replaced by a tool that does exactly what Git has been doing by design since it was released.')
