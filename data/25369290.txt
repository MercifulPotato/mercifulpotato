Just came here to say that I&#x27;m enjoying similar benefits in the relationship with myself, so to speak. I go strictly by the book (the book being &quot;Trust, Surrender, Receive&quot; in this case) with exact dosages, a trusted and sober friend&#x2F;attendant, and the intention to learn and grow from the experience. It&#x27;s helped a ton with behavioral patterns that I needed to leave behind, a victim mindset that turned out to be the sole cause of my depression, and has really helped turn my existential curiosity into a source of fulfillment rather than panic.<p>YMMV as well, but +1 to the comments here wondering how this medicine can be illegal for therapeutic use.<p>Two caveats: always test your stuff (DanceSafe sells test kits), and remember that the drug is just some extra help&#x2F;horsepower behind whatever therapy you do and the intention to treat yourself right.')
