It remains objective, it just now tests expertise by objective standards, not merely wealth or income. (Which are, at best, more distant proxies for expertise than the new ones.)<p>&gt; Expect many more regular people to be scammed out of their life savings.<p>The new added standards are <i>less</i> &quot;regular people&quot; than the the old, continued standards, so I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. If licensed professional investment advisors and the like are getting scammed out of their life savings because they are able to invest directly in unlicensed securities, than there is a real problem with the licensing systems or the process allowing the investments to be offered at all, regardless of investor qualifications.')
