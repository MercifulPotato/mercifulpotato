Item(by='Udo', descendants=None, kids=[25832865], score=None, time=1611058795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832642, text='<i>&gt; Sorry, yes, I meant nondenominational.</i><p>I know, and actually that&#x27;s how I assumed&#x2F;read it.<p>I think we both agree that nondenominational deities are not religious material (by definition). They have a certain appeal because they don&#x27;t immediately contradict observation, but they&#x27;re currently just as impossible to prove as, say, any of the Christian god variants. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s a mistake to postulate non-religious gods but allow religious claims to take shelter in them, on account of some perceived common property.<p>It&#x27;s true that making a &quot;god&quot; more generic increases the likelihood of existence, on a statistical level. But our scientific models do fine without any supernatural consideration at all right now. I would argue to keep it that way until we actually see supernatural agency at work. Until then there is not really a reason or need for it.')
