I think that a wealth tax is a great idea, but I dont see any good way of implementing it. The constitution (16th amendment) only specifically allows for income taxes, not property taxes. What makes the famous carriage tax legal is that its a tax on consumption and spending, and is therefore not a direct tax. The carriage tax was never argued to be a property tax, thats the key distinction here. The only way to pass it is to argue its a consumption and usage tax, or get every state to pass a wealth tax.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_tax#U.S._constitutional_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_tax#U.S._constitutional...</a><p>There&#x27;s actually a decent amount of precedent that holds the property tax as a direct tax, and therefore unconstitutional on the federal level. Even a liberal court would make this decision I think.')
