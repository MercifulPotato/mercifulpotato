That by giving much more than necessary to employees, he is pro-employee. He is legally entitled to the profit, after all.<p>I see it as: his employees created the vast majority of the profit he enjoys. He didn&#x27;t work thousands of times harder than his $15&#x2F;hr workers after all. I&#x27;m not making a moral judgement here. Notice I&#x27;m not saying what he should or shouldn&#x27;t do. But I think it&#x27;s a mistake to call him pro-employee.<p>In fact I do applaud his personal actions. We both understand the employees are not entitled to the profit. His giving back is a wonderful move for his employees. He seems like a wonderful CEO to work under and probably a great person.')
