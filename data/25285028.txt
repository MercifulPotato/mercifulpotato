Where did you come up with that? However right-to-repair and other freedoms and ownership over the hardware you purchase, especially when it&#x27;s so critical to your life and centrally controlled, is worthwhile to pursue.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;giving the government this much power is shortsighted at best&quot;</i><p>Either the corporation or the government has the power. The challenge is finding the right balance, because neither should have complete authority.')
