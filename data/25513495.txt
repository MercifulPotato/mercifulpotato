I am not sure how I could contribute much insight without quite a bit more detail, this strikes me as &quot;Should I hire a lawyer?&quot; to which I&#x27;d say &quot;yes.&quot;<p>Without knowing how your partner is inclined to act or respond to negotiations, or what your negotiation strategy is and how likely it&#x27;ll be effective in this dynamic it&#x27;s all a giant question mark.<p>Essentially it&#x27;s like asking a website &quot;How do I win a fistfight?&quot; except unlike actual fistfights, there&#x27;s an entire profession and industry dedicated to people that can (hopefully) act effectively as your proxy.<p>If you&#x27;re genuinely dead-set on not getting a lawyer, then you&#x27;ve got a fistfight scenario on your hands. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, make sure that you&#x27;ve taken stock of your capabilities and those of your adversary and form a strategy accordingly. This answer is basically as vague as the question though.')
