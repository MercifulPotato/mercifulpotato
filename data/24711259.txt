You can fail. It’s ok. What did you learn? You can skip college for some fields and be totally fine. You can even shun your old existence and live a life of a hermit, that’s cool too.<p>This isn’t the first time I’ve read something like this from an Indian household (or Asia in general). Yes, your family experienced great pressure to do well in order to prove they belong. But in keeping up with the “Jones’s” you aren’t enjoying it, you aren’t doing things that bring you joy, and you are doing things to conform. We all want to “fit in” but it’s when we let our diversity shine we can truly appreciate each other.<p>Good read though and I hope you realize it’s not all about performance, even in the workplace. Prioritize your mental health and happiness over your career. You’ll live a happier life.')
