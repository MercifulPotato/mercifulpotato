Item(by='adrian_b', descendants=None, kids=[25583333], score=None, time=1609345901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581459, text='I also didn&#x27;t understand the hate for systemd until I have attempted to use it for the first time !<p>This was a few years ago, so it is very likely that the particular bug that annoyed me was solved since then. Nevertheless, the bug was so unbelievably stupid and it was not only just a coding error but also a problem caused by the wrong architecture of systemd, so I could not accept that it is possible to trust software developers that can make such mistakes.<p>After that bad experience, I have never touched systemd again.<p>Even if this was several years ago, systemd had already been in use for several years, so the bug could not be excused by systemd being experimental or something like that.<p>I use mostly Gentoo Linux, which fortunately does not use systemd, so I had been shielded from its problems. I had heard about some systemd-related controversies, but I had paid no attention to them. I had seen some systemd presentations, which seemed reasonable enough.<p>One day I was in a hurry, but I had to install Linux on a new computer. Gentoo is nice, but if you do not have a pre-prepared customized installation image, so that you have to install it from scratch, it may need a few hours for compiling everything from sources and for editing the configuration.<p>So I decided to install Arch Linux, which used systemd. The installation was fast and everything seemed to work OK.<p>Systemd was always praised for its supposedly fast boot times, but I have seen no improvement in that, compared to my carefully configured Gentoo systems. On the other hand, the computer with systemd was the first computer that I have ever encountered, among many thousands of computers, from the days of Intel 8080 and until the new Zen 3, which was slow at <i>shutdown</i>.<p>So while the boot time of systemd was OK, the shutdown time was very long, sometimes more than a minute. What is much worse, sometimes the shutdown <i>failed</i>, which is something that I have never experienced before or after. This was on an Intel NUC with a Skylake CPU, so it was not some esoteric, non-standard hardware.<p>The shutdown failed sometimes due to a race condition, because the systemd daemons exchanged some messages between themselves through dbus, and, IIRC, sometimes it happened that some daemon died before the sender expected and the sender remained stuck in attempts to send to a non-existing recipient, or maybe the dbus daemon died, so there no longer was who to relay the message.<p>Race conditions may happen in concurrent programming, but to have a shutdown procedure whose success depends on the success of inter-process communication, that shows that everything was ill-conceived at the highest level.<p>So then I said farewell to systemd, I wiped Arch and I installed Gentoo, which worked perfectly on that hardware, without systemd, but with its much simpler and more reliable openrc.')
