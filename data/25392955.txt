That&#x27;s still far above what you would usually expect for serious side effects of a vaccine (and I&#x27;m comparing death with serious side effects right now, so the actual comparison would be even more favorable to the vaccine).<p>I&#x27;m not in the risk group, and I would take the vaccine right now if it was offered to me.
