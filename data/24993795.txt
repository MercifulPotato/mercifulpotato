No idea of the gram dosage but... a lot. Effect lasted about 6 months, then tapered off slowly.<p>Repeated again roughly yearly. After 4 difficult and unpleasant trips I&#x27;m fine. Never reached the sense of utter well-being I have for the few months after a trip but I&#x27;m <i>fine</i>.<p>I will say that drinking any alcohol basically negates the positive effects for me for a while. As in, I&#x27;ll have a cocktail and then won&#x27;t feel &quot;right&quot; again for a month or so.')
