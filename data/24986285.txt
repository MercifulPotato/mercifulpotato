I said this is crap and it&#x27;s taking me more than 5seconds to understand and I ended up simply changing some variable names and refactor the function. It took maybe 2 minutes to do but now I don&#x27;t need a comment and it&#x27;s cleaner code for future changes. (It&#x27;s in a file we are actively working on and WILL change)<p>tl;dr: Refactor not comment')
