The vast majority of the shares are sold to institutional investors. There are explicit or implicit lock-up periods in place. And most of the pre-IPO investors will typically have a 6-month lockup. So if 10% of shares are sold in the IPO and 10% of those shares are actually trade-able, only 1% of the total stock is liquid. That can lead to very large price swings (i.e. the pop).')
