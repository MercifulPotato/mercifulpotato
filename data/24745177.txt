It uses quite some memory because it does (too) aggressive caching and prefetching of messages (I have enough RAM, fast access was more important to me).<p>It is worth noting that the official Slack app has gotten massively more memory efficient about a 1.5y ago, its bad reputation comes from the time before that (when it easily used more than 1GB of RAM). (I think it still has other performance issues, but they aren&#x27;t as big anymore, it is doing quite well IMO)<p>Having said that I&#x27;m working on improving memory consumption in Shrugs.app - it is a tentpole feature planned for v1.1 (it&#x27;ll take some time until this will be ready though).')
