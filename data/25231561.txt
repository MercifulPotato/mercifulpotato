I generally found that in a sequence of ~3 interviews for a position, the order will generally be<p>* a personal interview (i.e. the one for sociability - mostly with HR people)<p>* a more technical interview (generally with tech people who don&#x27;t answer questions about non-technical stuff)<p>* an interview with stakeholders (i.e. a potential future boss, or a department head who can answer questions about long-term career development, perks, etc.. This also tests for sociability)')
