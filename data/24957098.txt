I should have been more specific. I am aware most of the protected class laws had some kind of exception.<p>I&#x27;m aware of the specificity of the ruling but the basis on which the ruling was made is much more general. Depending on the entity different laws would be in question; a fully private entity would probably be violating the civil rights act of 1964, while in the case of university admissions and funding the current systems are still in violation of the equal protection clause. Interpretations of the civil rights act of 1964 that advantage groups for no reason other than race are <i>also</i> unconstitutional.<p>Note this is a lot different than allowing race to be a factor of a multifaceted evaluation -- it&#x27;s inappropriate to have race <i>at all</i> be part of the evaluation. Instead substitute it for socioeconomic background.<p>I&#x27;m not sure yet how to fully clarify this, so consider the Missouri government&#x27;s statutory commitment to spend X% of the budget with women or minority owned businesses. In a degenerate case this means e.g. even the most unqualified  candidate could be awarded a contract solely on the basis of race, violating the equal protection clause.<p>(Practically this expenditure law means larger companies have &quot;independent&quot; women and minority owned businesses as subcontractors who might contract the work back to a business owned by the larger company that can do the work.)')
