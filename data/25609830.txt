I think you&#x27;re right that the average person wants punishment for someone who has wronged them, but (for reasons only God knows) I think the average person also wants punishment for people that haven&#x27;t wronged them at all, but just did something they think is immoral.  I&#x27;ll never forget seeing a neighbor call the cops on my friend who was smoking a joint in her own car.  He only knew she was doing it because he was <i>trespassing</i> on her property.  I couldn&#x27;t believe someone would be such a dick to another person.  I sure hope we can change cause what we do now is sick.')
