The point wasn&#x27;t to <i>share all of</i> one&#x27;s work, but to <i>do</i> a substantial amount of work and also to share work that can garner good feedback.<p>Being prolific isn&#x27;t the same thing as doing a lot of repetitions. &quot;Prolific&quot; refers to a quantity of creative works. The weightlifting and musician examples aren&#x27;t apt, any more than saying &quot;don&#x27;t be a prolific author because there&#x27;s a high risk you&#x27;ll slouch in your computer chair when you&#x27;re doing all that writing.&quot; Ergonomics are orthogonal to exercising one&#x27;s creativity.')
