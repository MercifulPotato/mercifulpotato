Item(by='SamReidHughes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606186384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183193, text='&gt; If he could do that with a female roommate why shouldn&#x27;t he be allowed do that with his male roommate?<p>Didn&#x27;t I already give the reason?  Because it could be used as a loophole in the tax law, that men and women in temporary relationships didn&#x27;t exploit, even if divorce is instant and the high earner can keep all the wealth that had been taxed at a lower rate.  (Because women generally don&#x27;t let themselves get used like that.)  On the other hand, in a community property state, with no pre-nup, that loophole is closed.<p>It&#x27;s also generally reasonable, as a structural concept, to object to the idea that laws should treat men and women equally, or men&#x2F;women and men&#x2F;men pairings, as some kind of universal principle.  California&#x27;s legislature adopts this stance: it outlaws same-sex boards (at least all-male ones) in publicly traded companies.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s reasonable to examine the question of same-sex relationship laws with more nuance than saying everything should be the same as marriage because equality.  Maybe the divorce and taxation laws should be different, because the straight ones ought to be written with children and rapidly declining female fertility in mind.  Maybe the &quot;next of kin&quot; definition or inheritance laws should be adjusted, when it comes to extended family.  Maybe gay marriage should have a fine-grained series of check boxes to opt in to each of the privileges and duties and consequences, because that&#x27;s just good customer service for gay citizens, but straight marriage should be all or nothing, for good reasons.')
