A 2014 $150 entry-level phone like the Motorola MotoG G4 has eMMC controller, SD-card interface, two separate camera systems, WiFi, BT, 4G modem, GNSS (GPS&#x2F;Beidu&#x2F;GLONASS), USB 2.0 (client), USB OTG (host), accelerometer, gyro, proximity sensor, compass, FM-radio plus the usual stuff (DRAM controller, GPU, audio subsystem, battery controller, etc.).<p>That&#x27;s a lot of components that the OS needs to initialise and load drivers for on boot. And all that needs to happen on 1 GB 533MHz LPDDR2 RAM and 4 Cortex A7 cores at 1.2 GHz.<p>Just to give a point of reference: that&#x27;s less computing power than a $35 Raspberry Pi 4 and significantly slower memory and storage.<p>A 10 year old laptop would likely feature a dual core Intel Core i3, i5, or Core i7 with 35W up to 75W TDP clocked at between 2.5GHz and 2.9GHz, dual channel DDR3 memory running at ~530MHz with a 4x multipler (i.e. 2133MHz effective vs 1066MHz on the phone) and your BIOS is most likely set to &quot;fast boot&quot;, meaning it&#x27;ll skip 90%  of the hardware initialisation anyway. I also doubt your 10 year old laptop would last that long on a 2070 mAh battery (my own 9 year old model has a ~44000 mAh battery - just for reference).<p>TL;DR yes, even a vintage muscle car is still faster at 0-100 (or 0-60 if you prefer) than a 5 year old compact car. That shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise if you compare the specs.')
