CA (like NY) pays more into the system then it takes out, so about ~$50b of the annual budget of TX is literally bumming money from other states, albeit indirectly.<p>This isn&#x27;t true. According to the SUNY Rockefeller Institute of Government report dated Jan 8, 2019 (which used the data from the <i>Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2019</i>) the fifty states all had differing Federal expenditures vs Federal receipts but Texas and California were close. See page 15 at [1].<p>On a per capita basis, here are the federal expenditures per dollar of receipts for a few states:<p><pre><code>    Connecticut      0.74     50th\n    New Jersey       0.82     49th\n    Massachusetts    0.83     48th\n    New York         0.86     47th\n    North Dakota     0.94     46th\n    Illinois         0.97     45th\n    New Hampshire    0.98     44th\n    Washington       0.98     43rd\n    Nebraska         0.98     42nd\n    Colorado         0.99     41st\n    California       1.00     40th &lt;=== CA\n    Texas            1.03     39th &lt;=== TX\n    Utah             1.04     38th\n    Wisconsin        1.06     37th\n    Wyoming          1.06     36th\n    Minnesota        1.09     35th\n    Iowa             1.13     34th\n    Nevada           1.14     33rd\n    South Dakota     1.15     32nd\n    Kansas           1.23     31st\n    Florida          1.24     30th\n\n    ... \n\n    Virginia         1.97      6th\n    Alabama          1.99      5th\n    West Virginia    2.17      4th\n    Mississippi      2.19      3rd\n    New Mexico       2.34      2nd\n    Kentucky         2.35      1st\n\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockinst.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;1-7-19b-Balance-of-Payments.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockinst.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;1-7-19b-Bala...</a>')
