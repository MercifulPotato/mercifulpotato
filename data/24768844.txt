But that&#x27;s not where China&#x27;s productivity comes from.  China does have some centrally directed resource allocation, but it&#x27;s at a very coarse level. See &quot;Made in China 2025&quot;.[1] That&#x27;s industrial policy. Japan became an industrial power in the 1970s and the 1980s through good industrial policy, run by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. It&#x27;s a help when you&#x27;re developing a country, if done well. Most of the &quot;Asian tigers&quot; did that. Done badly, it&#x27;s a disaster.<p>What seems to make China go now is a large number of medium-sized companies aggressively competing. Like the US up to the 1980s.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Made_in_China_2025" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Made_in_China_2025</a>')
