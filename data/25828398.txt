The US is much worse. Foster care does not offer stability, so every kid has to be found a new foster home on average every 8 months.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wehavekids.com&#x2F;adoption-fostering&#x2F;What-does-being-a-foster-parent-really-pay" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wehavekids.com&#x2F;adoption-fostering&#x2F;What-does-being-a-...</a><p>$800 per month per kid is very well paid for foster care. All the other money goes to government services. The child receives, at most, $250 per month (in cases where they care for themselves).<p>Studies point out that if you take outcomes, it would literally be better (children helped vs children harmed) if these services just outright did not exist. But I guess the problem would be much more visible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;aer.97.5.1583" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;aer.97.5.1583</a>')
