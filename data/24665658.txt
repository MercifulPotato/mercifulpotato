It suggests a useful insight.<p>Even better if they take an unusual angle, predict some differences from assumed existing laws but only in unusual circumstances nobody has tried to observe so far, and are consistent with those laws in areas already observed.<p>Or ones which explain existing laws better than current explanations.  Notably the inconsistencies between general relativity and quantum mechanics mean that <i>anything</i> which can explain both at the same time and give correct answers to both is quite interesting.<p>The ones that get dismissed quickly are those which aren&#x27;t consistent with laws of physics that are already assumed, especially at the level of existing observations.')
