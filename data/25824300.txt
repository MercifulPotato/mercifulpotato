Used to be owned Nokia, now it seems to be a big partnership between VW, BMW, Daimler, Intel, Mitsubishi and NTT.<p>Here has our complete transit system; Apple only has our 2 light rail routes and is missing our 80-some bus lines. Here has walking instructions and is adding Biking (still poor, but at least it has something). They have pretty good business contact information and hours, reviews aren&#x27;t great since they&#x27;re partnered with Trip Advisor, which is about a wash compared to Apple&#x27;s Yelp partnership though.')
