It won&#x27;t work if you just have a checking account but most places like a local Scottrade or similar can give you a referral to a proper Tax Accounting firm.<p>Outside of that, call a few tax accountants and interview them. To be fair this isn&#x27;t that rare or complex of a situation or problem and most tax accountantants will be totally fine. Just avoid places like HR block on the corner as those aren&#x27;t going to be much help.')
