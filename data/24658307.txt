Symbol soup for lambdas, &quot;using&quot; can now mean a type alias, initializer lists, move syntax, &quot;decltype&quot; function returns etc. Each by itself is not complicated but when you start mixing them in template heavy code, suddenly reading difficulty increases exponentially.<p>I think a lot of things were added in just to &quot;get away&quot; from C roots and make C++ its own language which IMO was a bad idea. For me, C++ is first and foremost a &quot;better C with Classes&quot; because i can keep that subset of the language in my head easily.<p>PS: Relevant other HN discussion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24649992" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24649992</a>')
