You can look for articles in 2018 and 2019 mainly.<p>&gt; That assertion makes absolutely no sense in france, specially as you&#x27;re referring to one-off protests where activists plan to riot and assault people and destroy property.<p>You don&#x27;t know much about what has been happening in France apparently. I&#x27;m not talking about the actions of far-right parties to discredit protests or the few people that joins protests just for the fight but people who are protesting in the first place.')
