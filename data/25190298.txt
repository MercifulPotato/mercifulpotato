Item(by='JamisonM', descendants=None, kids=[25191451, 25193645, 25190368, 25191210], score=None, time=1606158097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189287, text='&quot;I still believe you need some newer machinery in the mix, and my harvest equipment is where youâ€™ll find it.&quot;<p>I find this very interesting because on our farm the main source of savings has been running 7 (3-4 in the field at a time) 1480 and 1680 combines valued at $5-8,000 each. (and about 15 headers to match, equally worthless). We keep them well maintained but if we do have a failure that is not an instant fix we literally just pull another one out of the shed and carry on.<p>Where we farm late-90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s seeding equipment is now cheap as dirt too, we run two air seeders worth a combined $50,000, maybe?<p>I have a Steiger, branded as a Case 9170, they have weak spots (wiring, rear diffs &amp; planetaries) but they are cheap horsepower. Around my parts the &quot;Rome&quot; tractors would be older Versatile 4WDs that are easy to repower and have nice big cabs.<p>All that said, I find the large savings claims here to be a bit suspect. Dropping new electronic engines in these frames, even if you do a lot of the work yourself, costs real money. Once you are 80-90k into a 1980 tractor.. they made a lot of good equipment in the 90&#x27;s that you can walk up and buy for those kinds of dollars. And he isn&#x27;t doing the work all himself, those hours cost real cash out of pocket (a small farmer like myself that fixes himself.. well you can just keep whittling down your personal hourly rate by putting in more hours).')
