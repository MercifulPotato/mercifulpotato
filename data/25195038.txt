I never claimed let&#x2F;const&#x2F;Arrow Functions were syntactic sugar, just that they were improved syntax. I don&#x27;t see our two arguments as mutually exclusive, because I feel syntax can imply the addition of new features, as long as those features are directly tied to that syntax (by this definition, I would argue that JS classes <i>are</i> actually syntactic sugar, but that&#x27;s a whole other can of worms).<p>I will concede that I failed to write a function definition, thanks for catching that. I guess I unintentionally refactored the outer function away because development brain took over? Sloppy on my part, regardless.')
