Internet latency is actually very low - even e.g. Paris to NZ is only about 270ms RTT, and you _do not_ need multiple full round trips to the application server for an encrypted connection - on the modern internet, connections are held open, and initial TLS termination is done at local PoPs.<p>For services like this - as they are sharded with customer tenancy - are usually located at least in the same vague area as the customer (e.g. within North America, Western Europe, APAC etc).<p>For most users of things like Atlassian products, that typically results in a base networking latency of &lt;30ms, often even &lt;10ms in good conditions.<p>Really well engineered products can even operate in multiple regions at once - offering that sort of latency globally.<p>&gt; Im pretty sure he doesnt because if he could he would go there<p>Yeah, we don&#x27;t use any Atlassian products - partly for this reason. We use many Atlassian-comparable tools which have the featureset we want and which are drastically faster.<p>&gt; when you dont even have the response time to move your mouse and click on the next item in .5s.<p>There is clear documented understanding of how UX is affected by with various levels of latency - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;response-times-3-important-limits&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;response-times-3-important-...</a><p>&gt; Sometimes techies just love to argue<p>Not really, I have no particular investment in this - I don&#x27;t use any Atlassian product, nor do I plan to even if they make massive perf improvements.<p>But I do have an objective grasp - for tools like this - of what&#x27;s possible, what good looks like, and what user expectations look like.<p>&gt; no dont give into this guy<p>I don&#x27;t expect Atlassian is going to make any major decisions entirely based on my feedback here, but it is useful data&#x2F;input for exploration, and I do feel it&#x27;s right to point out that they&#x27;re looking in the wrong ballpark when it comes to the scale of improvement needed.')
