Spend a week in a rural place near you and you&#x27;ll find that people there legit think that &quot;big tech&quot;--who they know is insanely powerful and think are biased against folks like them--attempt to a.) censor people and b.) censor claims about election fraud specifically in regards to &quot;their president&quot; winning. Think about how that might come off to you if you were Trump supporter. You can disagree with that viewpoint but you have to admit you can see what lots of people who totally buy it would think about those actions. Those are people who aren&#x27;t going to stop talking with each other either, regardless of what we <i>in</i> the &quot;big tech&quot; think.')
