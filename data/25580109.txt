We will then of course in a few weeks see the impact of the government attempt to &#x27;Save Christmas&#x27; so things will probably get worse again in January.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.data.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.data.gov.uk</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.data.gov.uk&#x2F;details&#x2F;deaths" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.data.gov.uk&#x2F;details&#x2F;deaths</a>')
