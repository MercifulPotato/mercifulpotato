I could do other things in the future, e.g. a blog &#x2F; Medium &#x2F; Substack publication. Would you have any preference?<p>The book, as I wrote in the first comment to this thread, is interesting but I would have written it differently and more concisely.<p>But I&#x27;d like to dig a bit more there: when you say &quot;vague&quot;, what was missing from the summary? Or can you give an example of a sentence that wouldn&#x27;t be too &quot;vague&quot;?<p>Also, do you like the idea of the &quot;one sentence summary&quot; at the beginning of the Twitter thread?<p>Thanks!')
