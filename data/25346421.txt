These are wired, open-backed and have planar drivers. Going from a pair of $100 headphones to these was like night and day. I’m not an audiophile by any stretch, but wow is there a big difference. If you enjoy music, and are in a position to use open-back headphones, I’d <i>highly</i> recommend trying something like them in the ~$200 range. With proper care they should last many years.')
