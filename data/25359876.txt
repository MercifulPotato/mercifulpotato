Some of the examples are integration examples, and I fully expect we&#x27;d have at least one example for Mapbox, Google Maps, ArcGIS, and hopefully more providers in the future.<p>The rest of the examples are to show deck.gl&#x27;s capabilities. They currently use Mapbox GL JS v1 (recently changed to use Carto&#x27;s basemaps so that new users can test deck.gl without any API key). Those examples focusing on deck.gl are what I meant to refer to originally; it seems unlikely we&#x27;d move them to GL JS v2, at least, because we aren&#x27;t currently using Mapbox services with them. (But again, the team hasn&#x27;t had full discussions about this yet).')
