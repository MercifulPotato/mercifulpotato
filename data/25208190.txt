When they figure out how to marry it with even basic reasoning and memory, it&#x27;s hard to imagine how that will enhance its powers.<p>This is Kurzweil&#x27;s fundamental mistake, which undermines basically everything he is saying: Extrapolating exponential growth trends into the future.<p>There is absolutely no reason to believe exponential growth trends continue indefinitely. In fact, every single such trend in the past has come to a stop. Exponential growths are always exceptions, not rules.<p>GPT-3 will not be &quot;thousands of times as good&quot; within a decade. It is a very limited model, and it happens to be doing well at the moment, but it doesn&#x27;t just keep improving. This approach will hit its fundamental limits at some point, and then the growth just stops.')
