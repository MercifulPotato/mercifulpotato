We can share with family, and with good friends, but not with strangers.<p>Another thing: car is used not only to drive, but also as a storage space for things that you want to have always with you: a bottle of water, duffel bag with gym clothes, umbrella, etc. With rented car pools you&#x27;d have to carry all that with you.<p>Also, society where no one owns a car or an apartment, where everything is rented, &quot;pooled&quot;, would be a totalitarian dystopia - try to misbehave, post a negative comment about government on Facebook and you&#x27;re banned from a car sharing service as a punishment. Seizing your property is of course also possible, but much harder.')
