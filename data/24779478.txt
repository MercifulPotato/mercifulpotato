Per my other comment I was thinking that maybe the government had some controls over doing things like night shifts for non-essential work, but wasn&#x27;t sure, and welcome insights from people who understand German labor laws about why Tesla&#x27;s operation is OK but 24-hour stores are mostly nonexistent even though they would theoretically also operate by the same type of shift schedules.<p>In the US I am surrounded by 24-hour supermarkets and that&#x27;s because the US government doesn&#x27;t give a crap about the existence of night shifts for non-essential things, and I thought initially that the lack of 24-hour supermarkets in Germany was due to explicit regulation against that practice, but I may be mistaken.')
