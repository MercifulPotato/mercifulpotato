When you turn on your kitchen faucet to make chicken broth, plastic is coming from your faucet.  If you eat fish or chicken, the plastic is found in the meat.  When you wash your clothes, you are generating new microplastics that get dumped into the sewers that slowly make it back into the meats of chickens and your bottled water.<p>If you want to completely avoid microplastics, you&#x27;ll have to use reverse osmosis water for everything, grow animal feed using this purified water, raise chickens using this animal feed, etc.  Live in a bubble where the air is ultra filtered.')
