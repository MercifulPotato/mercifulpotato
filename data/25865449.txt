There is more empathy for people protesting racial injustice and the murder of minority groups than there is for people waving hate group symbols and trying to kill political leaders. I don&#x27;t see a need to demand a system void of empathy.<p>It&#x27;s not a one side issue. It&#x27;s not right vs. left. In the case of parler, it&#x27;s largly Nazi vs. not Nazi, and that&#x27;s a particularly easy case to judge. Parler does not represent conservative America, even if the extremists at the rally claim otherwise. It represents a mix of violent hate groups and conspiracy theorists. The small proportion of BLM activists that were actively violent do not represent liberal America.<p>Everyone has a choice. Everyone identifying as conservative can point at the white supremacists in DC and say &quot;Those are my people&quot; or &quot;Those are not my people&quot;.')
