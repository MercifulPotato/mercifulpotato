As a result, the buyer ends up not owning it and the stock fails to deliver - called a fail.<p>There are a lot of easy penalities that could be applied here. Reprice based on lowest price in intervening period prior to deliver. Provide a 10% rebate per day if not delivered T+3, up to perhaps a 200% rebate. Etc.<p>But instead, nothing happens, the fail to deliver just continues. I took a look at Gamestop on the fail to deliver list. It&#x27;s been there forever.<p>I don&#x27;t trade, but the whole fail to deliver game seems rotten.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Failure_to_deliver" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Failure_to_deliver</a>')
