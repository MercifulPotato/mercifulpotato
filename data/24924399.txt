Wayland&#x27;s problem with screenshots and all the bugs from not having a decades long lineage.<p>Strategic issues are less obvious. As this blog pos alludes to the standard X server is reaching a maintainability crisis where long term devs don&#x27;t think the project is a good idea.<p>I think Wayland is a tactical mis-step myself for reasons you and GP mention, but I think now that the bad has been covered someone needs to mention the good:<p>The reference X server cannot practically be replaced. The reference Wayland compositor quite possibly isn&#x27;t ever going to get established before being replaced. This is an excellent thing - it beings evolutionary pressure to the display system.<p>Wayland has problems, but unlike the current X ecosystem the problems can be fixed by replacing bits of software. The Wayland protocol seems light enough that Wayland+1 can implement it as a compatibility layer. When the dust settles, leaving X will have been a good idea.')
