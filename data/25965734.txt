If so, I say pack it up, go on to something else, and hope that they succeed wildly and your equity becomes a huge windfall somewhere down the line.<p>If not, it&#x27;s just a job anyway, and if the CEO really doesn&#x27;t want you there, you&#x27;re probably not going to be happy even if you somehow win this fight. In which case, I say negotiate as hard as you can for the best possible severance deal, preferably cash in hand and not equity, and then move on to your next thing. Wish them luck if you feel like it.<p>In the end, remember that you are not defined by <i>someone else&#x27;s</i> judgment of your merit and abilities. The only that matters is your view. Go start something new, and kick ass. Laugh at those guys when you roll past them on the street in your Aston Martin Victor.')
