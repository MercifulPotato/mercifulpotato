I&#x27;m left in a lot of ways that the right would never agree with. I am in favour of cherry-picking from socialist traits like proper welfare, affordable health care and schooling, higher taxes.<p>But the left-wing people just go to the next extreme, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll hear populist rhetoric like &quot;take it from the billionaires&quot; and other such nonsense that will accomplish nothing for obvious reasons.<p>I don&#x27;t assign loyalty to the Republicans nor the Democrats. I think both are terrible for the USA.')
