I would expect a pro-rated refund for subscriptions as a minimum, and some sort of pro-rata for the $300 (e.g. over 5 years).<p>Besides - why are you trying to emulate other people’s shitty practices? If someone isn’t happy why not let them at least request a refund?<p>My personal advice would be - just get some generic terms written by an actual lawyer and put them in instead. Or just copy&#x2F;paste some pre-written terms you can find available on any number of websites. It will look more professional, protect you more, and be more reasonable to your users :)')
