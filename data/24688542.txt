I have a 4GB Nano. Comparing the Pi 4GB and Nano 2GB. The 4GB of the Pi is an important factor vs the 2GB. Personally I would recommend the 8GB Pi.<p>There are many more Pi&#x27;s out there so the development community and support is stronger than Nano. The Nano has support, just not in the same area. I have had problems with the Nano where memory gets chewed up in some way and I just reboot it after a while. The Nano does have the advantage of an Nvidia GPU, but it appears that is of no benefit to you.<p>Although the Nano does not have built-in wifi I don&#x27;t think that is a substantial issue, but it does mean you need to get a wifi dongle. Of more concern is the need for a fan on the Nano. I have found that it gets hot fairly easily when pushed.<p>Bottom line is that in my opinion the small amount of memory is a substantial to avoid the Nano 2GB, the 4GB Pi is good and for about $30 more the 8GB Pi is a definite step up.')
