I.e. three disks of 4+3+3 Tb in RAID1 will happily give you 5 Tb of usable space. AFAIK, no other filesystem can do that.<p>Quoting @matheusmoreira further:<p>&gt; I can slowly buy drives of different capacities and add them to the file system one by one. I don&#x27;t have to plan ahead of time like traditional RAID and ZFS setups. This is excellent for home data storage!')
