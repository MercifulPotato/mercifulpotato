Sure the bits that make up your software don&#x27;t &quot;rot&quot;, the compute environment under which it operates is always changing and will lead to it no longer working.<p>Try taking any PC, whether it&#x27;s Windows 10 running IE or it&#x27;s Ubuntu running Firefox, and just stop updating it. How many years will you feel comfortable using it? _Eventually_ you&#x27;re going to need security updates, interface with new protocols, support&#x2F;function on replacement hardware when it dies, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll acknowledge that in reality, there are internet routers, industrial machines, and the like that can probably run for decades on the same software revision given enough babysitting and like-replacement of the hardware. But even the security software around those like firewalls are going to need to be refreshed and upgraded which costs money. In the grand scheme of things, somewhere in the stack, something is constantly being upgraded and refreshed, and SaaS fits perfectly into that model.')
