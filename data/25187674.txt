Reading through that gives me the impression that money is never a factor at Valve, and it&#x27;s all about 1) whether anyone cares enough to work on a project and&#x2F;or 2) whether someone is trying to impress&#x2F;kiss-ass to climb the social pyramid.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine the idea of rewriting CS:GO from scratch just to improve maintainability is going to get very far.<p>Plus players will 100% notice even the tiniest changes, and will complain about it forever. A game like CS:GO will never die, just look at the player numbers for its predecessor which has 6000-7000 daily active players.')
