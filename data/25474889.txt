The really insidious thing about coupling is that it can transcend module barriers â€” you can make changes that cause problems in places that seem to be entirely unrelated. Whereas e.g. cyclomatic complexity can be tough to tease apart, but it&#x27;s at least limited to a single module that you can work on in isolation.')
