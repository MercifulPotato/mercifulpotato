As long as it&#x27;s not someone super old on a very large van then they go maybe 10k&#x27;s less than speed limit.<p>Note most people driving in NZ at around speed limit. Going faster feels unsafe. Roads are pretty twisty and mountainous. Driving 2hrs in NZ is not same as 2hrs on highway with cruise control on.')
