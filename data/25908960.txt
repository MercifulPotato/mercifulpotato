I only really know about Japan&#x27;s culture 12th hand honestly so the only thing that&#x27;s really filtered down is that it seems kind of repressed in public having gotten a big infusion of US laws and ideas post WW2 and there&#x27;s some issues with creeps in public?<p>&gt; I find that in U.S.A. romance fiction, more often than not, the protagonist is the party who falls in love<p>I think a lot of that is due to the target audience being largely women so it&#x27;s written from and towards what the audience wants to read. Most TV and movie romances show a predominantly predatory almost (sometimes explicitly) coercive romance especially in media aimed at men.')
