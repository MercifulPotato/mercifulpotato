Has it ever been more than a niche curiosity?<p>It&#x27;s more like translation tools will make a comeback. Already have.<p>They&#x27;ve gotten so good, you don&#x27;t even need to learn a new language to learn something that&#x27;s only available in English (or other languages).<p>Incidentally, this was a major reason I learned English. There was so much more information available back in the early 00&#x27;s that I just had to do it.<p>Romanian Internet was... abysmal. Thankfully, I knew Russian, and their Internet activity was far better. Lots of information and software. But that paled in comparison to the English Internet.<p>At the moment, I find the Chinese Internet very active and interesting, even though translation is pretty poor and sadly, the language is very difficult. Plus, I don&#x27;t have a real incentive to learn it.<p>I don&#x27;t know what part of the culture makes people write and share information, but some countries definitely have less of this activity. Perhaps it&#x27;s just raw numbers, more people = more content.<p>With Google Translate and the like, it has become much easier to access all of it, any kind of information, the best content.')
