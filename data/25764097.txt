These include, but are not limited to:<p>Rudeness towards other Redditors,\nSpreading incorrect information,\nSarcasm not correctly flagged with a &#x2F;s.\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.<p>I don&#x27;t believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.<p>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.')
