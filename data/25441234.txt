That&#x27;s a principal reason I installed  Phoenix in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t auto-update because people running projects do what for me are stupid things like break all the add-ons, knock holes through my adblocking, remove key settings, add non-removable addons, etc., etc., and they do it without warning or option.<p>Not to mention the UI changes which annoy and confuse elders that I support.<p>I don&#x27;t have time for supporting forced beta testers (family &amp; friends, I&#x27;m a home user) so auto-update stays off for projects that think it&#x27;s their device one is using.')
