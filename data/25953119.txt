But the package managers and ports systems that regular users rely upon, still use tarball releases, not VCS checkouts, as their upstreams.<p>For example: Homebrew. If you tell Homebrew to --build-from-source, it&#x27;ll pull down a release tarball from its release URL; unpack it; set up the shell environment just so; and then run the same very same .&#x2F;configure script the upstream generated with Autotools.<p>It&#x27;d actually be kind of a problematic bootstrapping problem if that .&#x2F;configure script <i>did</i> require Autotools to run, as there&#x27;s no real legal way for (proprietary) macOS to ship (GNU, GPLv3) Autotools.<p>And that&#x27;s much the same problem many <i>other</i> proprietary UNIXes were in, back when: wanting to support &quot;standard&quot; tooling, but being too wary of this new &quot;copyleft&quot; thing to be willing to ship any GPLed software as part of their OS. Thus, the broadest industry support came out for the tooling that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> force the upstream&#x27;s tooling&#x27;s licensing choices on the downstream. (Ironically, that tooling happened to be from GNU, the precise people whose software they were trying to avoid shipping.)')
