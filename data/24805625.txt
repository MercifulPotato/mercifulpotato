Now, as it was always the same psalm, illiterate people could memorise the psalm and recite it as if reading.<p>(of course this was a legal fiction to allow courts to avoid handing out death sentences to all comers).<p>The thing is fizzbuzz is like Miserere Mei - it&#x27;s a quick proxy for a form of literacy.   Yes, anyone already literate could easily swot up that psalm.  But anyone not literate could only learn the words off by heart - and any simple test such as read the next psalm, would unmask them.<p>So the easiness of fizzbuzz is kind of the point - we are not trying to work out if you are Phd or undergrad level.  Just literate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Benefit_of_clergy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Benefit_of_clergy</a>')
