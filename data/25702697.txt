Cross-platforn and open source here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nuttyartist&#x2F;deus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nuttyartist&#x2F;deus</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;awesomenessnotes.wixsite.com&#x2F;website-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;awesomenessnotes.wixsite.com&#x2F;website-5</a> (didn&#x27;t update it for a long time)<p>Code is in C++ using Qt. Uses Porcupine for wake-up-word detection and Google API&#x27;s for speech-to-text and text-to-speech.<p>It can play music, move your windows, you can shout google searches at it, tell it open Gmail, take screenshots, etc.<p>After launching it I found people didn&#x27;t find it useful, including myself, after some time. Still, I open sourced it in case somebody will find it interesting. I loved developing the NLP engine part using tree structure to load the database and travel on it to find the most suitable command based on the user input.<p>Moved on to the next idea (:')
