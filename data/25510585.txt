Mark will also be able to check out students’ work, and may occasionally answer questions and give feedback.<p>&gt; We can’t guarantee that Mark will comment on your work directly, but we’ve designed the class so that you’ll get thorough feedback from your peers. You’ll get personalized feedback by submitting your projects on time, documenting your process, and playing an active role in your group.<p>&gt; Mark will also have access to the peer groups to answer questions, give feedback, and post responses during class. You will have complete access to all the feedback and answers Mark gives within your peer group and even within the other peer groups in the class. There’s a lot to learn from this ever-growing library of real student feedback.<p>This kind of sounds like a potential recipe for disaster. $250 for some pre-recorded videos and peer (i.e. a group of other learners randomly assigned to you) assessment? I could also see people being easily upset by a relative lack of direct involvement from Rober (esp given how much this course page hypes up his involvement outside of the FAQ).')
