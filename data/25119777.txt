And it went like this for a couple of months.\nNot only with Chinese, but also expats.\nI mainly got my accomodation though CouchSurfing (I wasn&#x27;t aware of BeWelcome nor TrustRoots back then)\nThe hosts seemed to have guests very often and we were never asked to pretend to be friends from home or anything.\nThis happened not only in the main cities, also in some prefecture-level cities.\nIt happened on a tourist visa, back in 2015')
