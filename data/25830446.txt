I’m much more inclined to think it’s just religions imposing order on people as a litmus test for conformity and followership. Mormons have the Word of Wisdom, Islam has haram and halal, Catholics have Lent, Good Friday, Ash Wednesday, etc... They don’t seem to follow any prescriptive health benefit. It’s restriction for the sake of conformity.')
