It&#x27;s pretty great.<p>I used to use model-ms but they became hard to get, and I gave away far too many of them back at a time when they weren&#x27;t scarce. (I still have two, but can&#x27;t replace them at a reasonable price if they fail)<p>The extra keys on the model-f terminal keyboards are handy too.<p>There was a window where I worried that my two remaining model-ms were going to have to last me the rest of my life.<p>Fortunately there are now a lot of mechanical keyboards available at reasonable prices.  I like the model-m and model-f keyboards somewhat better, but many other mechanical keyboard choices are pretty good too.')
