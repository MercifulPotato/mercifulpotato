In one experiment, only 20 percent of people tested were able to assess the intelligence of others with higher accuracy than a random number generator.<p>[…]<p>To assess intelligence, which is colesely related to competence, there are, however, some generally valid factors. The following items are charcteristics of an actual high intelligence¹:<p>• speaking quickly\n• using easily understandable speech and standard English\n• making eye contact while talking\n• displaying self-confident behavior\n• reacting quickly and with little hesitation<p>[…] Unlike many of the previously discussed points, however, these five items are also indicators of <i>actual</i> high intelligence. All of these points can rather easily be evaluated by mere observation. Interestingly, it is easier for us to make an accurate evaluation if we only hear people and do not see them - visual factors often are misleading.&quot;<p>[0] Reynolds, D.J. &amp; Gifford, R.
