But biological motivation is quite common in neural networks. Name a popular technique (backprop, dropout, etc.) and I can probably find you a source arguing it&#x27;s biological relationship. It&#x27;s just at an engineering-style level of approximation that scientists may abhor.<p>The ReLU was originally introduced by computational neuroscientists as a more biologically accurate approximation compared to the other activation functions.
