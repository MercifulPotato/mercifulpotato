Some of us might find Joe frustrating, but he&#x27;s a genial and entertaining interviewer. He&#x27;s further on the entertainment spectrum than Lex, who is probably a better bet for most of us because we&#x27;re probably more interested in the content.<p>That&#x27;s not a knock against Joe though. The fact he&#x27;s so entertaining and relatable attracts in a huge audience his interviewees would otherwise never reach, and that&#x27;s fantastic. OK maybe they don&#x27;t get to expound their ideas as broadly and deeply, but the fact that they get exposure to so many people at all is a huge win.')
