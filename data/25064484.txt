I think it goes much deeper than internet ad dollars personally.<p>The more important questions are why people are consuming what amounts to fake news and conspiratorial worldviews. Trust in institutions is at an all-time low, censorship and surveillance are at all time highs leading people to seek the outsiders and outlets that agree and tell them &quot;They are lying. They hate your guts and want to destroy everything you love&quot;. This basic message resonates as true for so many because everything around them is being destroyed and no one (else) is even offering to fix it.<p>This has nothing to do with being right-wing IMO, in fact I think right wing outlets are the only ones doing this because the American government crushed the far left so thoroughly its impossible for them to seek funding to build any such movement.')
