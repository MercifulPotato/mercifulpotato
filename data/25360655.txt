I think constraints in general also bring about great creativity in the artist. Having little to work with forces the artist to look at the essence of what they&#x27;re trying to create&#x2F;communicate and &quot;do more with less&quot;, which leads to a sort of innovation.<p>One of my favorite drawing exercises I have done in a drawing class is speed drawing. You&#x27;re asked to sketch a model in different poses, but at first you are given 1 minute per pose, and then 30 seconds per pose, then 10 seconds per pose, then 5 seconds per pose. It really forces you to look at the core shapes you see and translate them into as few lines as needed.')
