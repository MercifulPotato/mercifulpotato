A lot of us associate music listening with activities, and curating your own personal playlists, while fun, is cumbersome. Think of DiscVibe as your personal Spotify assistant to help you wade through the overwhelming space of familiar music and the (vast) amount of music you haven&#x27;t yet listened to but would like to discover.<p>Spotify does have contextual mood-based playlists, but they are not personalized to your music library. The daily mix playlists and radios are personalized (and do a really good job), but they don&#x27;t give the added control of context that some of us need to hit the nail on the head while taking a shower and jamming to our favorite tunes.<p>DiscVibe gives you a mixture of context and personalization - after logging in through your Spotify accounts, you can set your Energy Levels and your Mood (positivity) levels, (optionally) select a genre and a novelty factor (a measure of how much you are willing to explore new music vs settling on familiar tunes).<p>There are quite a few Spotify Playlist Creators but as far as I am aware none of them capture the &quot;novelty&quot; factor. It is underrated how much patience it takes to wade through a playlist of songs, none of which you have listened to before (as can be seen by my reluctance to go through any &quot;Discover Weekly&quot; playlists on Spotify).<p>As always, this is far from a polished product, and I need your feedback and criticisms to figure out which features need to be added&#x2F;refined. So go ahead and Discover Your Vibe!
