One <i>almond kernel</i> requires 3-4 days worth of drinking water to grow.<p>Also, humans in many places are using groundwater that&#x27;s <i>thousands</i> of years old. In those places we can&#x27;t observe any effect humans have had, because we&#x27;re effectively tapping into reservoirs that predate human usage of that water. Eventually that&#x27;s going to run out.')
