It is very fast, so I was happy with it. Additionally the implementation I used[1] is comprehensible enough that I could modify it in various small ways.<p>One property I anecdotally observed about it is that it is a little sensitive to the values you choose for its seed.  Too many zero bits or making two generators with nearly-identical seeds would create visible correlation in the outputs.  It worked much better if all values were hashed before using them for seeding.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tlauterbach&#x2F;unity-pcg-csharp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tlauterbach&#x2F;unity-pcg-csharp</a>')
