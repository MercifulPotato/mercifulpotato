As in Charpentier and Doudna’s work, this report also demonstrated that Cas9 cleaves within the protospacer, that cleavage specificity is directed by the crRNA  sequence, and that the two nuclease domains within Cas9, each cleave  one strand. However, the researchers did not notice the crucial importance of tracrRNA for sequence-specific cleavage of target DNA [29].<p>So I guess it&#x27;s a bit more complicated than just having missed the publication.')
