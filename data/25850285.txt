Complexity, source code volume, data volume and amount of users naturally introduce failure states that are not found in a simpler system. They also reduce your facility for reasoning about the whole, and the amount and type of assumptions you are allowed to make.<p>Google, an indie game, a SaaS, or a custom web app shop all have different security engineering requirements, including authentication, often per project.<p>Also outsourcing auth and not having full control over it is not feasible or even allowed for some domains or projects for a multitude of reasons. Not to mention that using an external service has at least a constant complexity cost.<p>That said, these kind of services are definitely worth considering for many. There is something to be said about advantages of specialization and cost-benefit as well. Reliability is not optional for an auth system, and I&#x27;m sure these engineers are really good at what they do. However the challenge would rather be convincing business, not engineering.')
