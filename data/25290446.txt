This is similar to how our Connect product lets our regulated entity do money transmission on behalf of a demand economy company without them needing to do money transmission themselves.<p>Goldman Sachs is one of our financial partners for Stripe Treasury. Specifically, they provide custodial services for the money management accounts. For more details on this sort of thing, I&#x27;d recommend reading or having your lawyer read the contracts.<p>KYC goes through Stripe&#x27;s processes. This is both operationally complicated and something that we generally do not go into detail on.<p>Given that the implementing SaaS business will control the UX around initiating a payment, they could control how much or little bookkeeping to do at time of a payment or transfer. Let me know if that doesn&#x27;t answer the thrust of this question.')
