Item(by='comp_throw7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610698780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773433, text='The person I was replying to didn&#x27;t specify any particular baseline for living standards, so I reject the assertion that my example was inappropriate.<p>If you want to raise a family in SF proper, I agree that 100k&#x2F;yr total income would be insufficient for what most people consider a reasonable QoL, even if one spouse stayed at home to take care of the children to avoid childcare costs.<p>Of course, in SF, 100k&#x2F;yr is &quot;entry-level engineer at an early stage startup&quot; territory in terms of earnings, which is not the typical profile of someone trying to raise children.  You&#x27;d have to be trying really hard to not make double that as a mid-level engineer in the Bay, though.<p>Keep in mind that even once you get past the flashy comp numbers at FAANG, there are a huge number of publicly-traded tech companies in the Bay which pay enough that you could afford a mortgage to buy a house in SF on a single engineer&#x27;s earnings without breaking 35% of post-tax take home pay.  (A bit of a stretch at 200k, easy at 250k.)  Even startups are getting there: a friend of mine recently got a new job in the Bay (not in SF, but close) paying over 200k in cash comp (base + bonus) with less than 5 years of experience, plus some options (which are probably not worthless, but can&#x27;t immediately be used to pay a mortgage).  He&#x27;s a good engineer but this isn&#x27;t an unusual outcome; some of the engineers I know aren&#x27;t as good, but they make more money because they took the interview grind seriously and went for companies with publicly-traded stock.')
