I could follow the first example just fine (because I know how to deal with linked lists from Lisp), but the second gave me rather a headache (two levels of indirection!).<p>However, I think that once you&#x27;ve <i>really</i> understood the concept of pointers - and I&#x27;d expect that from all kernel developers - the second example really wouldn&#x27;t be any harder to understand than the first. And yes, then it is the cleaner way of doing things, and therefore to be preferred.')
