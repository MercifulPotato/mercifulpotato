They encrypt the link between each participant and the central server. This makes implementation simpler in a few ways.<p>A good E2E-encrypted system would involve Zoom never having the keys at all, so &quot;key storage&quot; would be irrelevant.<p>The issue here is merely that Zoom claimed to be E2E-encrypted when they were not. They could have simply said &quot;encrypted&quot; and there would be no issue.')
