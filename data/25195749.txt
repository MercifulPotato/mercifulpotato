Opening a large file, closing it, then opening more smaller files doesn&#x27;t cause further growth. If VS Code was holding onto old references from opening files:<p>A) It would be spotted immediately, opening files is core behavior for VS Code<p>B) The memory usage would continue to grow after closing old files and opening new ones<p>What this bug is seeing is memory fragmentation and&#x2F;or reluctance by V8 to release a large allocation block. In either case, those kinds of details are way outside the arena of what VS Code deals with.<p>Importantly, it&#x27;s also not anyone&#x27;s job to explain this to random Github commentators or HN. If the maintainers say its not a bug or outside the scope that&#x27;s the end of it, and if you don&#x27;t like that you are free to use other software or fork the project for your own needs.')
