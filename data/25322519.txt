But for people like me who have severe cases of inattentive ADHD, it&#x27;s a once-in-a-blue-moon state of flow. Off medication my life is a perpetual hot mess, in large part because my self-image of who I am is not reflected in how I act, moment to distracted moment.<p>Adderall (or Vyvanse in my case) gets me a 0.95 batting average. Every moment of every day I&#x27;m on-task, energized, and achieving what I want to achieve. It makes the person I am, moment to moment, reflect the person I want to be.<p>Most people get prescribed Adderall because of failings at work or school. People come to think of ADHD as an unable-to-work-hard personality failure. But really it&#x27;s a my-life-is-a-hot-mess-and-I&#x27;m-struggling-to-stay-afloat condition that you just can&#x27;t escape.  Adderall is a magical drug that makes this failing go away, leaving us on top of things and feeling normal.')
