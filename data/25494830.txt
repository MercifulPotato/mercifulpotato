Just the physical sensation of the friction of feeling the glans penis rubbing against the vagina? Nothing more, about validation, recognition, bonding, status, power etc?<p>Simply &quot;sawing away&quot; without emotion or &quot;stakes&quot;, it loses value.<p>People don&#x27;t just want to have sex, they want to have sex with <i>some</i> people, in <i>some</i> circumstances. Men are less picky (both out of necessity and due to lower consequences), but still <i>somewhat</i> selective, if for no other reasons then opportunity costs.<p>Nothing is simple about sex.')
