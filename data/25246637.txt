I would just find an easier job. I&#x27;d invest a significant portion in etfs and whatnot (100% up to you) just cause inflation is gonna make $1mil in 40-60 years be like the new 100k. I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t buy a lot now, but it most certainly can&#x27;t buy as much as it could in the 70s. Also factor in COL areas. $1mil will get you buy farther in a small town in the midwest than it will in a major metro area. Find a nice quiet place that rich people aren&#x27;t exactly excited to flock to. Get a mortgage for a decent home or condo as well. Lastly, run a tight budget.<p>Tbh, $1mil isn&#x27;t enough to retire with at an early age. It&#x27;s certainly a lot of money, but depending on your lifestyle, it won&#x27;t exactly cut it til the end. $5 mil at 20 would be a &quot;set for life&quot; number for me factoring in I&#x27;d live another 60 years&#x2F;720 mos. That&#x27;s factoring in for inflation. This is why you need to tie up money in investments. You can be pretty risk averse too. But just as long as it&#x27;s not sitting in a bank account.')
