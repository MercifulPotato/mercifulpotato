In the event that a city was destroyed without physically or psychologically hurting anyone even indirectly, which would mean material restitution, and as long as the intent clearly wasn&#x27;t to threaten human harm, I don&#x27;t know that it would be considered violent.<p>Take this scenario, for example. Would hacking a factory to damage some sensors be violent? Of course not. If you think that some cases of property damage are indeed violence, you&#x27;d have to find a reason to draw the line, and I&#x27;m not sure you can without referring to human harm.')
