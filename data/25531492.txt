I tried Stadia a couple months ago. Note: I’m on a Gigabit connection.<p>I found the library of games generally unappealing. I did play a few titles, including Player Unknown. The stuttering and lag in the game reminded me of playing Quake 3 Arena on a 56K circa 1999.<p>Also, graphically the game wouldn’t run at my monitors 1440p. The graphics generally looked washed out. I thought it was just a poorly built game, but then I saw gameplay (non Stadia) on YouTube and realized the Stadia version was itself awful.')
