Item(by='gxx', descendants=None, kids=[25074090], score=None, time=1605202779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071087, text='The biggest difference between Macbook trackpads vs the best for Windows is the super low hysteresis of pointer motion vs finger motion.  I recently bought and returned a Microsoft Surface Book with &quot;precision touchpad&quot;.  The main reason for returing it was that pointer control feels sluggish compared to the Macbook and its pointer speed was too slow even at its fastest. The best Dell touchpads are no better and Lenovo trackpads are even worse.<p>I understand that this may be because PC touchpad hardware reports jitter, sometimes higher than it really is, and this causes the Precision Touchpad software to increase the hysteresis.  Macbook touchpads have low jitter and the driver is tuned to benefit from it.<p>If anyone Microsoft with input into the Precision Touchpad reads this, why don&#x27;t you fix it or work with your licensees to fix it?')
