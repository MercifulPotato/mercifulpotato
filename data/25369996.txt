It’s just too good for engagement.<p>To be fair they are clearly fighting a delicate balance of censorship and community moderation. It&#x27;s different from say a forum of yesteryear, because a forum can have a clear set of community values that should work for everyone.<p>Facebook and all social media is a single platform for many communities, and so given the new role of moderator they are in the impossible position of making a set of community values that apply to all communities.<p>I think the reason a lot of material isn&#x27;t outright banned where you or I would see obvious misinformation or hate is because of this.')
