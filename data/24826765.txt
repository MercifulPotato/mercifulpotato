If you never disassemble it then it&#x27;ll stay solid for long past the point where you&#x27;ve gotten your money&#x27;s worth. IME that&#x27;s true even having exclusively used the tools that came with the pieces, and never using any additional steps (power tools, glue, loctite, etc.).<p>If you disassemble it, it immediately starts feeling like you got what you paid for.')
