She agreed with the proviso that she could have a meeting to figure out what she was and was not permitted to publish.<p>I think that is in dispute. Jeff Dean claims she did refuse to fix it.<p>&gt; It’s entirely plausible that the paper is bunk; however, when someone is willing to come down that hard to prevent an idea being published, I tend to err on the side of “worth finding out what”<p>But they weren&#x27;t trying to prevent the idea from being published. They certainly knew by firing her they&#x27;d give it far more attention than it would otherwise get. What they wanted was not to put their name on this idea.')
