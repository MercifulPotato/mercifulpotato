So a Firefox user wanting Flash would download Adobe&#x27;s Flash installer and (if they didn&#x27;t watch the installer&#x27;s default settings carefully) would be switched to Chrome. If a Firefox user wanted to switch to Chrome, they would have downloaded Google&#x27;s Chrome installer, not Adobe&#x27;s Flash installer.<p>Adobe had no incentive to change this relationship because they got paid by Google twice: for bundling Chrome in Flash and bundling Flash in Chrome.')
