Oh, you also have to step on the face of a future golden boy to reach it on the shelf. You also have to divert your legal team of several $1000+&#x2F;hr staff from million &amp; billion dollar cases to this for a month or two. You then have to tell your investors that actually allow you to live that you made a really smart decision and returned them $50 instead of $500MM.<p>To any normal person or small business, that&#x27;s a lot of money to be captured and ignoring it is mind boggling, but again for them it&#x27;s not worth the time and effort. The relationship or good will is worth a lot more, not to mention whatever write off stuff they get and the opportunity cost of their team. There is nothing careless about this.<p>If you wouldn&#x27;t work with a VC because they aren&#x27;t a penny pincher then man you are really going to be in for a reaaaalll treat!')
