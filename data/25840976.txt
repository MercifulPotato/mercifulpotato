Includes great stories about Feynman, Oppenheimer, other heavy-hitters of mid-century physics. The format was surprisingly narrative, makes me wish I wrote as many personal longer-form letters with family and friends.\nAlso Siobhan Roberts&#x27; biography of Conway, Genius at Play[1], told another great story. Low on math content but Conway&#x27;s personality and the narrators attempts to corral it were quick fun.<p>Both are recommended. Does anyone have recommendation for a popular-science level book on Graham? I&#x27;m only familiar with him from the Numberphile video series.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harvard.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;maker_of_patterns_an_autobiogra" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harvard.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;maker_of_patterns_an_autobiogra</a>...<p>[1] short snippet from it <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ias.edu&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;2015&#x2F;roberts-john-horton-conway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ias.edu&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;2015&#x2F;roberts-john-horton-conway</a>')
