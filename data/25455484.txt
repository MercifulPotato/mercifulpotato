Just when readers starting to like the terminal and the culture, the author goes &quot;anyway, terminal sucks, let&#x27;s get a graphic window! here&#x27;s 100 lines of code you&#x27;ll never understand&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t understand the bloat of introdocing gtk, meson and ninja, more deps means more code, more code means more bugs, more steps and more difficult to compile, I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will fail to compile this, which is very frustration for beginners who&#x27;re not familiar with error messages. You  might think meson and ninja makes it easy for building, but that&#x27;s wrong, that might be true for engineers who build 1000 times a day, not for one off beginner situations like this.
