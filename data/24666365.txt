At best, data can provide us with a rough approximation of the landscape it attempts to describe. In this particular case, I think that landscape is smaller than the territory established by the OP&#x27;s linked blog post (which seems to transcend the easily-measurable world of simple economic indicators).<p>Would you consider it prudent to dismiss one&#x27;s lived experience offhand, at the mere site of a few quickly-pasted links to tweets containing simple, decontextualized data points? What, then, if another commenter subsequently provides contradictory data? Scrolling through a typical HN thread would turn into a nauseating ride on some sort of intellectual see-saw.<p>If the commenter you responded to is &quot;not convinced&quot; by some tweeted factoids claiming that Americans are working less and making more than ever, does that imply that they&#x27;re ideologically motivated?<p>I don&#x27;t think so, no more than I think your reply to them implies that your own motivation is ideological. Without additional context, those &quot;facts&quot; don&#x27;t significantly imperil any specific worldview.')
