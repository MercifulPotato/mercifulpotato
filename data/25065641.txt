It makes for a really weird (albeit pleasant) effect that to my eye makes the image look more like a printed&#x2F;reflective image. I&#x27;ve long wondered if you could duplicate that effect by replacing the backlighting in a junk LCD with something that can adjust color temperature and adding a color sensor, but haven&#x27;t had time to try it.')
