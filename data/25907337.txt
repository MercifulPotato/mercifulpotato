I want a dumb TV. Apps built into TVs generally suck because to keep the BOM cost down they put in the cheapest SoC that will function, leaving the apps sluggish, jerky, and frequently cut down in features. On my previous LG TV I couldn&#x27;t turn off motion smoothing on the bui8lt in video streaming apps. With the Samsung TV I just don&#x27;t connect it to the network because there are ads that you cannot disable.')
