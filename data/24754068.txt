The number of nuclear weapons in the world is in the 5 figures order, that is fact. Nuclear weapons are a fact.<p>&gt; and yet they still engage in conventional warfare because they really don&#x27;t want to trigger a nuclear holocaust.<p>Most experts assessed the chance of a nuclear war during the Cuban missiles crisis at 1&#x2F;3. Maybe that is a number you feel comfortable with, I dont. In +70 years of nuclear plants the 3 &quot;big&quot; accidents (3 Miles Island,Chernobyl, Fukushima) are nothing compared with that.<p>&gt; On top of that, terrorist organizations, guerrilla fighters, criminal organization and so on never managed to launch an ICBM.<p>And never managed to sabotage a nuclear installation and cause an accident so your point is moot.')
