That should definitely be part of your personal calculations (evaluating your personal risk without concern for any risk you create for others is sociopathic, if common).<p>But the truth is that even the most <i>basic</i> measures of isolation would suffice to properly mitigate the community risk if the community would broadly take them, and the most <i>severe</i> personal isolation on my part will not protect the community in any meaningful way if they don&#x27;t.<p>Wearing a mask when it&#x27;s appropriate and avoiding crowded&#x2F;unsafe spaces is really all we owe our community. Anything further you do should be based on your personal evaluation of risks - I&#x27;m more isolated because we have high-risk relatives that we see regularly.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s worth noting that this position is specific to the pandemic in question - it&#x27;s totally plausible that we will get another pandemic later that requires us all to take more stringent isolation measures. And the evidence suggests that we will probably all die.')
