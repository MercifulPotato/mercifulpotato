If you take a look at the real world places that the existing diesel locomotives serve (on non-electrified lines) you have a lot of places where you&#x27;re basically using one or two trainsets to go back and forth a rural line. They usually don&#x27;t sit in stations for more than a minute or two, maybe 5-10 mins at each end. If each one is out of service to charge for 30 minutes once an hour, you&#x27;re either demolishing the schedule or adding significantly more trainsets ($$$$).')
