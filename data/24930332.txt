Before COCs were a thing, projects would still arbitrarily\nenforce rules, and not always the right way. This is nothing new.<p>I personally applaud the idea of a COC, much like software licenses. It&#x27;s just a\nbummer that a lot of people out there in a leadership position don&#x27;t know how to\nfairly enforce them. It also doesn&#x27;t help that many COCs are poorly written,\nmuch like when an engineer without legal experience tries to write a license.\nHopefully this will get better with time.')
