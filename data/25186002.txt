You used to see lots of posts complaining about how Apple didn&#x27;t innovate and just slapped hefty price tags on generic components. That line of criticism has not aged well. Now there are lots of people complaining about minor transitional issues that are essentially caused by the <i>low end</i> macs - that aren&#x27;t intended for demanding pros - having enough raw performance (but not enough RAM or ports) to almost be good enough for them.<p>Apple have successfully executed a bigger R&amp;D project than any PC manufacturer in history. (In fact, the R&amp;D costs probably wouldn&#x27;t even have been a good investment if Apple <i>only</i> sold laptops and desktops.) As a result, the base model Macbook Air now offers objectively better value for money than any competing laptop, when considering just the basic metrics of performance, form factor and battery life. To me that&#x27;s outrageously impressive.<p>I suspect Apple are going to move to a Mac product line structured more like their iPhone product line. When you buy an iPhone you always get way more performance than you really need, even if you buy the cheapest model. PC manufacturers have to differentiate on performance because Intel and AMD won&#x27;t sell their fastest chips for cheap, but Apple has a lot more flexibility now.')
