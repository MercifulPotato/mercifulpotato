Most programming challenges, even at FAANG-scale, ultimately decompose into some family of classic interview problems (usually a graph or a hash table.) Everything else I do at work is implementation or stack specific. The average programmer will pick it up with enough exposure. But problem solving is somewhat binary (yes I realize thats an oxymoron) and not easily pick-up-able, at least on the time horizon a hiring manager wants to deal with.<p>I realized this when I got a lot better at whiteboard interviews after a FAANG job for a couple years. A coding challenge that I took the full hour on and bombed out of college was now done in twenty. I just picked up the problem solving intuition by writing a ton of code.')
