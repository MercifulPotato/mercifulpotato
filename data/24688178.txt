I bet even this $59 computer can play games surprisingly well. Obviously not modern AAA titles or anything like that, but there&#x27;s many decades&#x27; worth of games it can play (including ones originally released for non-PC platforms). There&#x27;s lot of interesting Pi-powered handhelds and mini-arcade setups running emulated games; this seems like it&#x27;d be significantly better at that.')
