They reward people for creating &quot;new&quot; things, whether they&#x27;re the same as something they&#x27;ve already got or not, and allocate very few resources for existing products that aren&#x27;t already the company&#x27;s bread and butterâ€”getting put on something like Hangouts or Voice was considered to be almost a punishment detail, based on some of the comments I read, and could torpedo your chance at any kind of promotion.')
