You get more of a potential slice of the market making a cool 2D puzzle.<p>The tech was cool, worked reasonably well until -A- you moved a lot -B- low light. But unfortunately the market is about playing on the toilet, in public transport; or playing late at night in bed, in the dark. None of which really worked with AR.<p>As far as I see this going, it&#x27;s still is looking for a &quot;killer app&quot; (I hate that term).<p>My best guess is we&#x27;ll see this used a lot more in a business environment and even then, glasses are a far better approach (hint hint, hold on to your whiskers).')
