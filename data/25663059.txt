Item(by='cmurf', descendants=None, kids=[25663513], score=None, time=1609969763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662242, text='This is nonsense, it&#x27;s not how it works, Congress cannot choose the president unless no candidate gets a majority of Electoral College votes. Trump unquestionably lacks a majority of state certified Electoral College votes. And Biden unquestionably has a majority of state certified Electoral College votes - and per the Electoral Counts Act those certifications made by the safe harbor date, which was December 8, <i>cannot</i> be disputed by Congress.<p>Everything else going on is a show. And it is working insofar as Trump&#x27;s sore loser supporters have sent him more money after the election than before the election. They love the lies. They hate the truth. They lack the coping skill to deal with truth, so they sign up for the lies. They purchase lies as a product, that is what Trump sells. It&#x27;s who he has always been and always will be.<p>Trump right now: <i>we had an election, that was stolen from us, it was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side...but you have to go home now, we have to have peace.</i><p><i>they took it away from me, from you, from our country</i><p><i>this was a fraudulent election...so many are treated with evil...go home in peace</i><p>Translation: We won, but you gotta go home. They stole from me, from you, from the country, but you gotta go home. They are evil, but you gotta go home.<p>He is unfit for office. He&#x27;s ill. The proper thing to do is wrap up the counting of ascertained Electoral College votes, declare Biden the winner. And then the House should immediately impeach Trump. And then the Senators can choose to remove him from office and ban him from ever holding public office again. That is the proper way to end this.')
