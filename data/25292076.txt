It&#x27;s not the most scientific approach, but generally speaking, your gut is probably reasonably healthy if:<p>* you do not experience intestinal discomfort on a regular basis<p>* you can eat a wide variety of foods without getting unexpected diarrhea or constipation (i.e. when eating foods that typically do not do this to a wide range of people)<p>* your bowel movements are consistent, complete, a good colour, not painful, not loose, not hard<p>* you are not overweight&#x2F;underweight<p>And of course, you can help all of this along...<p>* basically never eat fast food if you can avoid it, especially shitty McD&#x27;s ground beef<p>* avoid taking antibiotics unless you&#x27;re really sick enough to need them <i>they can wipe out your microbiome and set you back months or years of progress)<p></i> take supplemental calcium and vitamin D<p>* eat a wide variety of foods, including oily and spicy things; you can &quot;train&quot; your system to handle things by eating them in smaller quantities as you get started and then gradually eat more<p>* but avoid eating too wide a variety of foods in one meal as that&#x27;s most likely to overwhelm the gut&#x27;s capability to effectively digest things<p>* yogurt, cheese, fermented stuff of almost any sort (without alcohol) all seem to be beneficial<p>* while we&#x27;re at it, make sure you get enough iron, from red meat and dark green veg!<p>It&#x27;s anecdotal of course but you can find any number of studies supporting this stuff. For me, taking my diet seriously didn&#x27;t mean restricting in any serious sense how _much_ I eat, or even _what_, so much as balancing things to ensure I don&#x27;t overwhelm the system.<p>In 2017 I had to take antibiotics for something and it seriously set me back years, I was back to having a horrible time at least once or twice a week from things I had been eating no problem before, and only by late 2019 was I really feeling confident to go and eat, say, spicy Mexican food again. At this point in time I would have to be sick enough that I&#x27;d be missing months of work to take antibiotics again.')
