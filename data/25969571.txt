The diversity hires, that I was aware of, tended to favor White and &quot;model minority&quot; candidates over equally (or better qualified) URM candidates, even though it&#x27;s obvious that the students would be better served by hiring more professors that reflect the demographics of the student body. There are plenty of highly qualified candidates these days, so to me the biggest problem is bias on the part of many hiring and tenure committees.')
