There are so many problems with wireless charging that I don&#x27;t see it becoming truly mainstream. Not being able to use your phone while charging is the most visible one (maybe 15W via magsafe will make it fast enough it doesn&#x27;t matter). I also have trust issues with wireless charging in general - I got a free wireless charger from TripleByte once that overheated my phone and only got it to 60%. I&#x27;m still hoping for USB-C')
