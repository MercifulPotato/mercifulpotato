If you want to whole day, you can fly out on Friday, for €23, and find accommodation for €45, totalling 68 euros[1]. \nTraveling by train is sadly way more expensive.<p>Consider instead Berlin -&gt; Budapest, it&#x27;s €10 on Friday, direct, with Wizzair, but &gt;100€ on Saturday with stops. The train is both cheaper and faster!<p>[0] this is where I live and where my family lives, the route I fly most often<p>[1] prices are from skyscanner, airbnb')
