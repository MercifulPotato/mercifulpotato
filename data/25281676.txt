If there&#x27;s any suspicion that you may have used your personal device to communicate with co-workers, then they&#x27;ll want to see it. You can&#x27;t prove you didn&#x27;t without turning it over. If they find you didn&#x27;t use it, then thanks. If they find you did, game over. That&#x27;s the point of the discovery process. They don&#x27;t know what information is out there, so they&#x27;re going to get as much of it as they can and sort it out later.')
