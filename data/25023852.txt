Yet it is by far the most effective conduit for getting me cheap food. Effective systems simply are not very good at empathy and agreement on non-core issues is unimportant. Empathy in particular recommended at a personal level but not especially useful in politics. The critical tool is the ability to comprehend, negotiate, compromise and articulate why things are necessary.<p>Having &quot;empathy&quot; for &quot;the left&quot;&#x2F;&quot;the right&quot; isn&#x27;t possible. The groups are too large and diverse. Ditto for major components of the left or right like &quot;the black vote&quot;, &quot;the evangelicals&quot;, &quot;people in cities&quot;, &quot;people from Detroit&quot;, &quot;the wealthy&quot;, etc, etc. Entities that you can have empathy for or agree on facts with are too small to be politically important like individuals or families. Politics is done by large groups who&#x27;s beliefs are too nebulous to align.')
