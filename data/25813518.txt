I&#x27;m now looking to expand, but often people don&#x27;t really know they need a software consultancy to help until they have the specific way in which software can solve their particular problem explained.<p>Maybe naively this rules out Facebook marketing, email, Google ads and those channels. I appreciate the question is quite open ended, but wonder if there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve missed.')
