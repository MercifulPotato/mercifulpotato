It&#x27;s so free that you are not just not paying, you even have the freedom to fix the issue yourself.<p>And contributing the fix upstream is not selfless either. You don&#x27;t want to keep dragging the patch along with every new release. You want it upstream so that you can forget about it.<p>Just as much as the maintainer can now fix a bug which somebody else for free reported and even contributed a patch. Refusing to even listen is mindbogglingly stupid.<p>Of course there can be disagreement about whether the bug is worth fixing or whether the patch is a good solution. But that&#x27;s a different story.')
