IMO, some fair, some not. &quot;Google Buses&quot; taking space at MUNI stops was one for quite a while. Contributing to increasing housing costs is a long time favorite.<p>But a lot of these come from a culture where you build your company on top of the infrastructure provided by the local community and government. Then build a very successful business on top of that, but have minimal engagement with the local government and community. So you create a perception that you&#x27;re just taking, and not actually part of the local community.<p>It seems to me that the Coinbase case just doubles down on this attitude.<p>In contrast, Salesforce has the largest building in San Francisco named after them, and a huge urban park.
