There are obvious code density benefits to the x86 variable length approach (especially in immediate encoding), but I guess the need for realignment creates long critical paths on the frontend. I wonder if the more constrained variable instruction length of RV64GC (32- and 16-bit instructions only) will be able to similarly scale up to 8-wide instruction decode like Apple has been able to do with AArch64.')
