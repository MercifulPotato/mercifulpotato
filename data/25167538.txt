It sounds like I&#x27;m being glib but you really are onto the nut of things once you&#x27;ve combined those two poles,<p>I agree, it is confusing! I wanted to make sure you meant &#x27;chat in Gmail&#x27; before getting more specific: in that case, we are caught in a cycle of repeatedly noting Google has a deprecation timeline for cutting people over from Hangouts to chat.google.com, that&#x27;s what the grandparent was referencing. It&#x27;s virtually identical to Hangouts, just with modernized UI and Google sez a more stable backend. Everything works _just as it always has and will_ for your day to day user.')
