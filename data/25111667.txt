It&#x27;s like saying that for somebody who watches a taping of a soccer match the result is not yet known, yet for somebody who watched it live it&#x27;s a foregone conclusion. I don&#x27;t really get what&#x27;s the paradox here.<p>Or maybe more to the point: if you were watching a soccer game Earth from Proxima Centauri, you could only get the result about 4 years after the game took place on earth, so for you the issue is uncertain while for somebody on Earth &quot;at the same moment&quot; the result has been known for years. But of course then the whole concept of &quot;at the same moment&quot; is pretty ambiguous and fuzzy.<p>I don&#x27;t really get what&#x27;s paradoxical here.')
