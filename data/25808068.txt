Of course it&#x27;s a mathematical abstraction.<p>This project required high performance, high throughout, distributed computing with exabytes of data.<p>The person applying for the job should illustrate they can deal with that and knows when to ask what kind of question.<p>If they think chalkboard algo analysis is the end of the game, that they can just pack up and go home, not looking at the actual hardware specifications and capabilities, the real world implementations and costs, and just blindly trust the mathematical abstraction without any type of evidence, analysis, testing, or considerations of a system as complex as the physical hardware they are using, then good luck.<p>For example, if there is a &quot;slower&quot; implementation that&#x27;s embarrassingly parallelizable and trivial to distribute, those are actually important factors.<p>If they have a &quot;slower&quot; implementation that also allows for a quicker mark and sweep or cache invalidation, those are also actually important.<p>If input data can be tightly characterized, that&#x27;s actually important, it changes the real world expected results.<p>Bursty and continuous traffic are different problems so average throughput is insufficient for characterization.<p>This guy disputed all that. Basically the midterm I took 20 years ago as an undergrad when I 18 at the University, that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s all of HPC.<p>By the end I was just giving him the college freshman level answers and he was genuinely surprised as if he thought I didn&#x27;t know it.<p>Again, last I heard, the project is still on the rocks.')
