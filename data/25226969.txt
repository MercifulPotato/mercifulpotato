Idea for this app is stolen from 8 prahar concert<p>2. Why we have to pay money when the SAME classical music is available freely on YouTube and other platforms? Just bcuz is playing under the app.<p>3. Is legal permission taken from the musicians or their heirs to play their tracks as many musicians are no more.<p>4. Are they honestly giving any money back to musicians by playing tracks as a profit share. Pls make the info abt &quot;no. of paid users and % money paid to musicians&quot; public.<p>5. India being a country of 1300 million people, only 5000+ has downloaded the app means Indians have totally rejected this app.<p>6. Why non of musicians is promoting this app? something is drastically wrong with this app.<p>7. Due to corona, music industry &amp; musicians all over the world are promoting their music thr their own channels hence apps like this are not required.')
