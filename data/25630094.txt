From an economic standpoint, articles like this one are really just arguing that the supply and demand in several different markets should be lumped together and aggregated.<p>No, it is not. This article is arguing the opposite. The article is arguing that you should ignore the fact that the labour market changes and still demand that you get market rates for some arbitrary other market which is no longer the market that you are operating in.<p>If this article was arguing we should artificially merge all markets they would not have a problem with getting a pay cut when the market becomes the whole of US instead of SV.')
