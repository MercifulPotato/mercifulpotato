Just found out a couple weeks ago (from HN) how in the Netherlands and Germany you can request to work 4 days a week instead of 5, for 20% less gross pay, I guess its a smaller cut after taxes because you might drop down a tax bracket.  As long as the company has 15+ employees.  I partied a ton in my early twenties so I&#x27;m early in my career despite my age, but the plan is to live very frugally and buy several 2 family houses in low CoL areas to rent out.  Then after 5 ish years depending on if I have a family or what, semi retire to Europe.')
