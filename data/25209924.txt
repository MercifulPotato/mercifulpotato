Using value types is of course a valid point, regarding how you should use the language, but it doesn&#x27;t change the overhead of the GC, it just keeps the heap it manages smaller. If the overhead was counted against the total memory use of a program, then we wouldn&#x27;t be talking about the overhead of the garbage collector, but more about how much the garbage collector is actually used. Note that I&#x27;m not arguing against tracing GCs, only trying to keep it factual.')
