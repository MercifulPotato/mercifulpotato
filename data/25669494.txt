All of the HN comments about how dangerous this is and how the police needed to be more aggressive are effectively calling for more people to have died - because that&#x27;s the inevitable consequence of what they want. (I&#x27;ve seen people in communities less polite and aggressively moderated than HN, but pulling from more or less the same tech community, outright calling for the police to open fire.)')
