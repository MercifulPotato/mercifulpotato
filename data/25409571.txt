Then I read the article you linked. I don’t think it means what you think it means. He’s talking about users of the software, not developers. And I know, I know, developers are users of software too, perhaps more than the average user.

Who could possibly design software better than us superusers? What most developers don&#x27;t realize is how freakishly outside the norm we are. We&#x27;re not even remotely average-- we are the edge conditions.<p>Honestly, if you’re a hobbyist or moonlight as a FOSS contributor, fine, nbd. But if I found out an alleged professional working for me writing software was content to never figure something out like a git branch issue in the short term and grow over the long term in their total skillsets, I’d want them gone.<p>I wouldn’t want a lazy, mediocre carpenter to build my house either. I’m perfectly content to let them build a ramshackle residence for themself where nobody has to suffer because of it.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.codinghorror.com&#x2F;the-rise-and-fall-of-homo-logicus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.codinghorror.com&#x2F;the-rise-and-fall-of-homo-logi...</a>')
