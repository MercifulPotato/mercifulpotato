It&#x27;s a distortion of the market.<p>Precisely. Spec sheets, unbiased reviews, ratings systems that vet purchases, those add value. Almost by definition, what we consider advertisement is designed to distort humans from making rational free-market choices. Stretching the analogy: Attention is finite, therefore every ad you consume moves you <i>further</i> from perfect information.<p>That&#x27;s a purely pragmatic argument without getting into the whole bit where ads use all sorts of psychological tools to shape behavior.')
