I&#x27;ve heard that licensing my code under the AGPLv3 will prevent its widespread use by industry, and my answer to that is, good! I licensed the code under the AGPLv3 because I intend for it to be used under the terms of the AGPLv3. If that puts companies off because they want to use it for free,  but don&#x27;t want to use it under those terms, then my licensing requirements are working as intended.<p>If you want to pay me, that&#x27;s a different story, and I leave the door open for commercial licensing.')
