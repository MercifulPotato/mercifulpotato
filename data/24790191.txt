My new printer works perfectly on Linux but took quite a bit of fiddling to get to work on Windows.  Scanning from iOS is a mess (the official app <i>works</i>, but it has a hardcoded list of integrations instead of proper &quot;share&quot; support, so actually using the scanned results is a pain).  I haven&#x27;t even tried scanning from Windows.<p>And the very best part: on Fedora 32 or better, scanning Just Works!  This is the result of a project to implement both Microsoft&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s scanning protocols in SANE, and somehow the result seems substantially better than Apple or Microsoft&#x27;s implementations.')
