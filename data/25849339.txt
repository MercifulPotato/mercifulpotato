The moves up to that point don&#x27;t matter. Only the current state of the board matters and you make the best move given the current position.<p>That is an immensely myopic view. Analyzing the game up to now and understanding the opponent&#x27;s style of play and tactical preferences are very useful in planning your next move, especially when you have multiple, equally weighted choices.')
