Of the companies that you could be talking about...<p>- Planet Computers are a very different company<p>- Mediatek don&#x27;t seem to be mentioned at all in the project you&#x27;ve linked<p>- IndieGogo (and others, like Kickstarter) are simply platforms (like Facebook or Ebay) and yes, while they definitely need more protections in place ACROSS THE INDUSTRY, indiegogo itself is not inherently scammy. And to their credit, Planet Computers - without being required by any law to do so, seem to be processing refunds when asked.<p>The very concept of crowdfunding is, by definition, a risky proposition. The point of the original post was not to complain about the crowdfunding model, because that is not really in question. The problem is when established, supposedly reputable companies pull the rug out from under smaller operators, and then those small companies are left with a choice between building an inferior product or abandoning the project completely.')
