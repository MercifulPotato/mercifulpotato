The main eruption was heard as far as 2,600  kilometres away. The estimated energy was more than 4 times that of Krakatoa. Before the eruption it was a mountain 4,300 meters tall. Afterward it had a crater rim with a peak height of 2,850 meters with a crater depth of over 500  meters. It shoved more than a kilometre and a half of mountain into flying debris and produced over 100 cubic kilometres of pyroclastic debris. The eruption lasted for over a month!<p>It also got right back to building a new tiny volcano in the crater in less than 30 years. It’s one hell of an active volcano!')
