But unfortunately the USA is still using an early alpha release voting system that was invented in the 1700s before voting theory had been even understood.<p>The result of a majority win voting system is that it only legitimizes 2 parties in practice. This worked &#x27;ok&#x27; so long as the 2 parties acted in good faith.<p>However the last 20-30 years the Republican party got twisted into a movement to undermine government, enrich themselves, and narrowly focus on a couple of right-wing Christian interests to distract a populist base. They&#x27;ve maintained their relevance by turning Fox news and other right-wing owned outlets into effectually state-run propaganda machines. Leaving only the Democrats trying to govern with the Republicans trying to undermine and obstruct that very government.<p>The only way out of the USA&#x27;s problems is to have a modern preference voting method, or in the long term the country may be doom to fail.')
