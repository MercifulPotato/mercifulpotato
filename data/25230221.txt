Item(by='dirtyid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606495630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230036, text='Growth is relative, my friend from Mississauga grew up around farms now surrounded by suburbs, but from 80s-20s , dwellings &quot;only&quot; increased from 120k to 240k. Population 350k to 650k.<p>Building 120k dwellings in 40 years &#x2F; 3000 per year is pathetic. Export some Chinese construction over capacity. The residential district I lived in China housed 80,000 (condos). It was built in less than 5 years, every unit was larger and nicer than Toronto new constructions.<p>Regulations, NIMBYims plays a part, but at western construction also simply isn&#x27;t competitive enough to address changes in immigration patterns.')
