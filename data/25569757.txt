Everything the average person spends six dollars a year on is a multi- billion dollar industry.<p>&gt;Each of the largest companies will have PR agencies, personal contacts within the FDA, revolving door of staff between the FDA and the corporate, positions on standards committees, board members who have spent a life time in food safety governance<p>Think about how many people someone will work with and befriend over a lifetime.  You&#x27;re pretending that&#x27;s a high bar when it&#x27;s a low bar.<p>I work in a company that just barely meets the US (BLS I think is the organization) definition &quot;medium sized business&quot; and (extrapolating out from who I know the people on my team know) we could call in favors at nearly any financial regulatory agency in the US or UK.  In reality we can&#x27;t do that though because despite knowing people we don&#x27;t own people, they don&#x27;t owe us big favors and they wouldn&#x27;t stick their necks out like that.<p>&gt;The same complaint from a small company will never get the same attention.<p>What you&#x27;re missing is that these big companies (unless they have a massive white collar presence concentrated at a HQ) rarely have enough presence in any one particular place to get that much more attention than the other things in the district unless there&#x27;s basically nothing else going on in the district and generally speaking the biggest operations tend to be in the most economically busy districts where they have more competition for a rep&#x27;s ear.<p>If something dumb happens and it screws up Potato chip manufacturing whoever is responsible for Cape Cod Potato Chips is gonna try and swing their weight around, their rep will tell them to screw off because they&#x27;re small potato in that district.  They&#x27;ll go up the corporate chain and maybe the Cambell&#x27;s guy will try and call the New Jersey rep.  But the New Jersey rep will still blow them off because there&#x27;s bigger business in the district.  Heck, Frito-Lay can&#x27;t swing their dick around because they&#x27;re big, but not that important in the DFW area.  Maybe their parent Pepsi can (I dunno what district they&#x27;re in but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a small one).  Of course, if a complaint is legitimate you&#x27;re more likely to be listened to.  Point is that only the most massive of businesses can reliably get legislators to do shady stuff for them.<p>If anything, laws to the tune of &quot;and regulatory agency W will act in accordance of X and investigate Y within Z days of being notified of a violation&quot; are a primary driving force for this kind of selective enforcement because the congress-people&#x27;s staff are just doing their jobs and forwarding stuff and following up but only the big companies have the resources to notice their competitors violations and tip off the regulators (this is my impression from having members of my household work for under-staffed state regulatory agencies).<p>&gt; A competitor breached a pointless regulation [1] from the last century which has prevented their product from being sold for a year.<p>&gt;[1] Many of these food regs are designed to enrich staple foods that were the main source of nutrients for low income families. That&#x27;s just not an issue anymore and just prevents (high quality) imports.<p>The last century was 20yr ago.  HN would be out for blood if someone was caught importing completely functional catalytic converters or bicycle helmets that didn&#x27;t meet some irrelevant to performance nuance of the law.  HN is sympathetic in this case because the product in question is an upscale-ish pasta.  If regulations on some ingredient were being manipulated in a way that was only affecting production of cheap lite beer we&#x27;d be reading through several hundred snarky comments about how this is a good thing.')
