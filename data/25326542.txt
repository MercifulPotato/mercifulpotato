As a FOSS lover, I pay for a lot of tools. Both development related and unrelated. Moreover, some of the tools that I pay extend on FOSS software (Tower, Viscosity, Permute) and some of are FOSS already (Cyberduck).<p>The thing is, as a person I don&#x27;t want to feel ripped off. I don&#x27;t subscribe to JetBrains since my work doesn&#x27;t require these tools (also, I use Eclipse for 15+ years and it works well). The subscription culture allows developer to pump features indefinitely but, I can&#x27;t subscribe to all tools that I like.<p>There are many services that I subscribe too (Dropbox, Spotify, Netflix, IFTTT premium, Evernote, etc.) but, they give me a service which touches my life everyday. I have no budget to subscribe to a tool to test for a year. It&#x27;s not feasible. I need to eat.<p>So yes, I&#x27;d rather have a good FOSS tool which doesn&#x27;t want $100+ from me every year and I&#x27;d rather patch it myself. But, if you provide me a good service which I can&#x27;t replicate easily, or don&#x27;t want to manage myself, I&#x27;d pay you good money. I&#x27;d be also very happy if the tool I&#x27;m paying is FOSS.<p>Also the biggest obstacle driving me away from paying is the tools are closed source and I&#x27;d be locked in if the tool&#x2F;company lets out the magic smoke. All the services I pay are not locking me in. I can get my data out of them. So it&#x27;s not always wanting to earn money for free.')
