It is to be modeled as a threat not because it is malign, but because it doesn&#x27;t notice you exist as it takes another step forward.<p>This is a concept that I think deserves more popular currency. Every so often, you step on a snail. People actually hate doing this, because it&#x27;s gross, and they will actively seek to avoid it. But that doesn&#x27;t always work, and the fact that the human (1) would have preferred not to step on it; and (2) <i>could</i>, hypothetically, easily have avoided doing so, doesn&#x27;t make things any better for the snail.<p>This is also what bothers me about people who swim with whales. Whales are very big. They are so big that just being near them can easily kill you, even though the whales generally harbor no ill intent.')
