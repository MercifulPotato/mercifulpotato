I&#x27;d be interested to see websites that hit the benchmark that you&#x27;re aiming for.<p>I just tested a HN profile page (famously one of the lightest weight non-static websites) and it takes between 300ms and 600ms to load. I&#x27;m not saying that Jira can&#x27;t improve, but if HN isn&#x27;t hitting 250ms then I think telling the Jira guys that nothing less than &lt;200ms is the minimum standard is unrealistic.')
