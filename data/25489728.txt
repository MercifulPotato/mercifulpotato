Back in the days my internet was so slow I went to the university and copied KDE down on 5? floppy disks.<p>I used KDE through all iterations and looked at Gnome in dismayal.<p>Two years ago I tried Gnome. I was fed up with KDE screwing up with Wayland. And should I tell you? I love Gnome!<p>I was productive from day two. Ok, its opinionated and there is much less to configure than in KDE. But otoh it keeps me focused on work instead of fiddling with the DE. Imho a DE should just do two things: Make frequent steps easy to do but otherwise go out of the way. Gnome does that for me.')
