It&#x27;s not convincing me that it&#x27;s in any way original. I bet large parts of these pictures actually do exist, and it&#x27;s just mashing its memories of these pictures together, instead of actually having internalized how to draw manga pictures.<p>Maybe the source dataset was too small, and it was not trained strictly enough, or it should have actually trained on anime stills instead of these Moe manga style drawings.<p>The state of the art, for example that site that generates images from sentences is much more impressive to me.')
