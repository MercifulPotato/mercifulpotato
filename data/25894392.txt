Much like we recognize distinct traits between people from California, Texas, Minnesota, and New York in the US, Japanese people have distinct characteristics depending on which region they are from: Okinawa, Kansai, Tokyo, or Hokkaido to name a handful. Beyond that each of those regions is geographically different and has their own local customs and cultural quirks which I&#x27;ve always enjoyed learning about.<p>I think such a narrow view of what &#x27;homogeneous&#x27; means is only used to serve a specific goal, and not to analyze the topic as a whole and in good-faith. Disclaimer: I grew up in Japan as a foreigner and still have much to learn, but it&#x27;s my favorite place in the world by far.')
