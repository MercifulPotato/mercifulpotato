Some people think that fairness is defined as something that affects everyone equally in some clean-slate world, while others think of fairness as equalizing the effect of something in an already unfair situation in the world as it is. To the first camp it seems that &quot;suppressing&quot; a particular story on a particular platform is unfair regardless of circumstances because it is not done to other stories; others think that if that particular story has a de facto unfair advantage of being amplified by an army of bots on that particular platform, then &quot;suppressing&quot; it is the fair thing to do. The question is, is it always unfair to tip the scales or does fairness depend on whether or not the scales are already tipped? Should the fairness of laws, rules and regulation be judged with or without consideration to existing circumstances?')
