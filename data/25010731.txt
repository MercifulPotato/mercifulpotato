Sometimes when I&#x27;m trying to pay down the balance, I end up adding a lot more to it. What I understand well enough, I then have a hard time communicating effectively.<p>I&#x27;m a pretty bad influence, so when I end up spending a lot of time working with any other developers I eventually catch them doing the same thing. Some more than others. What&#x27;s worse is that we are the only ones who could possibly know anything about the technical debt that we understand so fuzzily.<p>All that management can hope to get is a secondhand account of all this, so I tend to award mine only partial blame for being pretty consistently terrible at making technical debt decisions.')
