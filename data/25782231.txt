It is called 14 words, if I where on the receiving end of a donation with that phrase I would be quick to distance myself from it and donate the proceeds to a worthwhile charity.<p>While I know it is routine to paint the right and specifically the alt-right as all being racist white supremacist&#x27;s the reality is they are a small minority that has banded onto the right given their conservative views on certain items. The right needs to do a better job of making it known that they are not welcome but things like this really don&#x27;t help them in doing just that. I know the guy with the buffalo headdress has a Valknut tattoo prominently tattooed on his chest so I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to assume he is a white supremacist&#x27;s. So to me it looks like a small band of white supremacist&#x27;s organized to incite the mob into action. People should really be aware of who they are throwing their lot in with.')
