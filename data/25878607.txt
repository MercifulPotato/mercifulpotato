Item(by='seppel', descendants=None, kids=[25882358], score=None, time=1611365134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878328, text='&gt; Yes redundantly encoding type everywhere in your id will be easier for a specific kind of bug yet you&#x27;re adding that overhead all the time in both your db mapper and extra bytes everywhere.<p>I can safe the extra bytes by just removing the &#x27;-&#x27; from the uuids and using the more compact enconding (base what ever). And at the same time I&#x27;ll safe countless of debugging hours, because everybody is aligned what kind of ids we are talking about.<p>&gt; Or we are getting reports of invalid order ID let me run a scan across db&#x27;s and see if its valid anywhere, oh hey it shows up in persons somebody mixed them up somewhere or no it&#x27;s just invalid somebody messed up in some other way.<p>Because you have access to all the DBs and you can easily write a query over all your dbs. That is the naturally assumed.')
