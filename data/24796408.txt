Thank you for checking it out.<p>&gt; The model seems like it&#x27;s a bit more digestible &#x2F; open for reading than Twitter&#x27;s infamous threading model.<p>Yes I agree! Twitter wasn&#x27;t designed for realtime conversation, it was designed over 10 years ago when pagers were a thing. The idea is to take a slight twist on that model and build a new site that focuses on open conversation in a familiar but slightly new way.<p>&gt; I have difficulty seeing the chat model scale well to many users.<p>I agree here too, and have some ideas for features that will help scale the conversations, such as chat modes, and side-channel ideas etc. For now it&#x27;s &quot;mvp&quot; and I&#x27;m just focused on making it work with smaller groups of people. Certainly is a problem that will occur down the line though!<p>Right now this is centralized, it&#x27;s just me building it so I&#x27;m trying to get the &quot;mvp&quot; out and test the idea. There are lots of potential ideas for how it can play out in the future.<p>Let me know if you have any other questions, I appreciate your feedback, feel free to mention me on there @guac, cheers.')
