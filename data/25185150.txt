I may be called a hater and I may be raining on everyone&#x27;s parade, but I opened this thread expecting to find horrors and I did (plenty of metaprogramming).<p>The very notion of there being tricks and that knowing them makes you better is something I hate about C and C++. Most tricks I read here are bandaids over usability issues the languages have. Yes, they alleviate an issue but may introduce unexpected consequences and distance your dialect from the rest of the community.<p>I am so very thankful that C and C++ are no longer the only options for low level, non garbage collected programming.')
