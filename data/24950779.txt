Curved screens are more fragile and are more expensive to replace.\n  * Good battery life\n  * Spare parts available (e.g. main camera for $15 shipped)\n  * Cheap\n  * Decent processor, RAM and storage\n</code></pre>\nThere are some downsides, so not for everyone:<p><pre><code>  * Comes with bloatware, some of it can only be disabled with root\n  * Rooting is a pain\n  * Spare parts in China, so might take a while to arrive\n  * Launcher is not great, but can be easily replaced\n  * Camera is not best in class</code></pre>')
