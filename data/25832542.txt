One is a set of very specific but unsubstantiated claims about the nature of the universe, and the other is a scientific theory supported by observation and models. Since it is way easier to churn out unsubstantiated claims than viable scientific theories, relying on a mindset that gives equal consideration to everything is a surefire way for science to be simply drowned out.<p>In this specific case, I&#x27;d also like to point out that the big bang model does not claim to yield, or is required to yield, information on what came &quot;before&quot;. There are multiple hypotheses around for what could have happened, a fundamental part of which is usually a proper definition of what &quot;before&quot; means in this context. Again, none of these are doctrinal claims, they&#x27;re just a process of finding out more about the universe. Religious claims on the other hand are a method of asserting you already know something.<p><i>&gt; While If I were any denominational god, I&#x27;d have created the rule set and frameworks for the entire system and then boot it up.</i><p>Consider that most religions want people to behave in very specific ways, mostly because deities and their spokespeople say so. The &quot;god&quot; you are describing does not fit into that. You are being very charitable towards religious claims by allowing them to retreat into this generic fold.<p>On a scientific level, your hypothesis is not immediately contradicted by observation. But it&#x27;s also not clear how an unsupervised universe would be different from a curated one. If it doesn&#x27;t really matter to the outcome whether the universe was created intentionally or not, a good bet is to assume the simpler model.<p>Any such god would themselves have to exist in order to create a universe. They would presumably also have to have had a creator themselves, or have come into existence by natural means. This pushes the problem of the origin of the universe up the chain without necessarily resolving anything. It&#x27;s not impossible that the universe is such a stack of simulations, and I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s worth looking into that, but it&#x27;s not a solution to the question what the root of existence itself is.')
