Unless you&#x27;re going with laser propulsion or solar sails.<p>Moreover, if you can fit a compact reactor (fission or fusion) on a space ship, then you can run nuclear thermal (ISP &gt;800), or nuclear ion engines with extreme efficiency. (&gt;15,000 ISP!) Considering NASA&#x27;s Kilowatt reactor weights 2tons, assume a dry mass of 10t and a payload of 2%, you end up with a 500t ship (wow, do we even have 498 metric tons of xenon in the world?), but with a delta-v of 500,000 m&#x2F;s.  That gets you to Pluto flyby in 99 days. (I didn&#x27;t count the Kilowatt reactor fuel weight, I&#x27;m not sure how much uranium is needed for a 15,000 Isp burn, I was just interested how much delta-v 15,000 Isp buys you.)<p>SpaceX starship, if it works, could launch this in about 4 refuelings. (&gt;100-125t to LEO)')
