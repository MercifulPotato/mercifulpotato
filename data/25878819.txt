I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> 80% of humanity to die, particularly since when you do out the math on resource usage and projected population peaks, there&#x27;s a good chance that everybody could live just fine.<p>But I&#x27;ve spent a good deal of time studying game theory and situations where the behavior of the whole is significantly dumber than the behavior of each individual actor, because the individual actors&#x27; interests are not aligned.  I think global warming is going to be one of those.  Sure, if we could come to a rational collective-action agreement, we could solve it.  The history of collective-action as a solution is pretty dismal.')
