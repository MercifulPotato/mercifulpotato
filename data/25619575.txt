And, theoretically, the F-35 can be used for operations before that happens, which is part of why they&#x27;re being put into service.<p>Not to mention &quot;this plane works fine if we get the Navy to do the hard part first&quot; is going to go over well with a <i>rather limited</i> subset of Air Force personel. (The Air Force has wild weasels too - generally F-16s though I believe the F-35 is planned for that role in the future)')
