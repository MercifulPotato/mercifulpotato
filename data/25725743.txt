But you&#x27;re 100% right that &quot;hashed out&quot; needs more elaboration, which I think I covered here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25725727" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25725727</a><p>All that said, I don&#x27;t intend to personally get into the nuances there today&#x2F;here as I just don&#x27;t find it to be good energy spent, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find many others in the comments going into that :)<p>Edit: I may return to this tomorrow if I have time, I actually really appreciate the wording of this reply. I&#x27;m just about to go to bed!')
