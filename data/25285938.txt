If they don&#x27;t play by the rules, and want to stop you, they will. They&#x27;ll take your knee caps, your finger nails, your life, or the entire nation&#x27;s internet service down. No amount of math will change that.<p>Here&#x27;s a worked example. North Korea. Their leadership has amassed a few billion dollars of cryptocurrency they&#x27;ve used to finance their nuclear program. How much has crypto helped the average North Korean? <i>Zero</i> because it&#x27;s super illegal, they&#x27;ll get sent to the gulags, and their internal internet likely has it disabled seven ways to hell.<p>Think of this like blowing smoke in the face of a cop. Is it illegal? Probably? Hard to say. Will you immediately be arrested for something else you happen to be doing at that very moment that just so happens to be illegal? Oh yeah. Technically correct is not the best kind of correct in this situation.')
