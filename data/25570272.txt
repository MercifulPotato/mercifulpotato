Pipelines are far superior in just about every way, and cheaper to boot- there isn&#x27;t even a cost component like there is against the argument for nuclear (another head scratching issue to me).<p>It&#x27;s one thing to make a case that this is infringing on their property rights, and that may have been a true and valid concern, but for it to get coopted as an environmental cause, was just strange and made environmental advocacy as a whole look bad IMHO.')
