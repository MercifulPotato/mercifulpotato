Articles that wouldn’t hold up under academic scrutiny, and woe betide the fool who bases their life outlook on an Office-based theory, but are fun to muse about, and to overthink a little bit, as you say, over beers with friends.<p>How do we allow for work like that to be done?  I would hate for this kind of silliness to be lost because it isn’t rigorous enough.<p>Besides, the very people who would take this seriously are the same people who aren’t actively thinking and applying insights on how society interacts in their daily lives anyway.')
