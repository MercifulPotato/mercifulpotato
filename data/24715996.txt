I am at a bit of a loss for how to set this system up. Here is my wishlist:<p>- Store a set of mainly text-based files, in total less than 100mb (annex for large files would be a nice bonus)<p>- Version control semantics<p>- Git&#x2F;rsync style distributed architecture. Ideally I can sync to multiple filesystems like multiple personal computers, flashdrives, and generic file hosting like s3<p>- Merge semantics for conflicts between versions<p>- Encrypted at rest &#x2F; in packed form, with simple password-based access. Low risk of losing data if I don’t lose the password. Reasonable degree of protection from everyone below state actors, even if the encrypted archive is exposed.<p>- Reasonably mature technologies that will likely be maintained for the next decade or two for all critical parts of the stack. Again, concerns about data loss are the most important thing here.<p>Should I just be using git with some kind of encryption wrapper around it? I’m happy using CLI tools here but very much don’t want to lose years of data because I screwed up a command at some point.')
