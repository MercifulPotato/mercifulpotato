There was talk of impeaching Trump before he took office. Heck, Hilary Clinton called Tulsi Gabbard, a fellow Democrat, a “Russian asset.”<p>This partisan dichotomy about all this is extremely hard to credit. For two years we were subjected to Rachel Maddow dropping one “bombshell” after the other about how Trump colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. What was proven in the Mueller Report was a fraction of that, with scant evidence linking <i>Trump himself</i> to wrongdoing.<p>What’s worse, a story that’s 90% made up or one that’s 100% made up? The latter, obviously, but I have zero sympathy for partisans trying to make hay out of that distinction.')
