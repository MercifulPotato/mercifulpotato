Does anyone have a reference for this?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;a-closer-look-at-tethers-blockchain-5c3032328e52" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;a-closer-look-at-tethers-blockchain-5...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincap.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincap.io&#x2F;</a>')
