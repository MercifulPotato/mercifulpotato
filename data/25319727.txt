I haven&#x27;t used claw myself, but I know cl-autowrap makes wrapping C libraries <i>really</i> easy.  It took me about 4 hours and &lt;200 lines of code to have a complete, usable binding for GDAL, and most of that was in convenience functions.<p>I&#x27;m curious to see what happens with the C++ support in claw.  They&#x27;re working on it, but I&#x27;m skeptical.  I haven&#x27;t had much luck using arbitrary C++ libraries from any language other than C++.<p>And I don&#x27;t know what the author means by &quot;somewhat rarer&quot; in this context, but I personally use C libraries from CL all the time.  Almost every CL project I work on, now that I think about it.')
