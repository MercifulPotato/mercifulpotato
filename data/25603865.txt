This app offered reference guide type information for a niche. To set expectations, my family member paid sub $10k for the entire app to be developed when mobile apps were new.<p>After a few years it had attracted a few thousand users but needed updating and the developer was non-responsive. The family member of mine was non-technical and had allowed the developer to publish the app under their own developer account.<p>A saga begins that I won&#x27;t bore everyone with the details but basically this family member didn&#x27;t want to lose the thousands of users. They tried to get the developer to send them the app to maintain but the developer was non responsive. They tried to enforce their trademark on the app but Google would only delist it.<p>Now they had no listing at all for their company so they tried to start over. They tried to create a new app with the same name but Google&#x27;s review process wouldn&#x27;t let them because another app had already existed with that name. Armed with a trademark and people we knew who worked at Google we got exactly zero steps further after three months of trying to work with Google on the issue.<p>Eventually, we tracked down the mother of the developer who had ghosted on us and paid them to give us their developer account. Where we showed the trademark, had the app re-activated, and moved it to another Google account we controlled.<p>Basically, Google couldn&#x27;t help us at all. It was a mess. Eventually we got things sorted but we had to go around Google.<p>Was this Google&#x27;s fault? Heck no. The family member got unprofessional help from a student developer who ghosted on them but Google didn&#x27;t make it easy to fix the issue. They made it impossible.')
