Item(by='Treegarden', descendants=None, kids=[24717875], score=None, time=1602151639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717433, text='Have been reading reddit since 5 or so years now, but pretty much only the frontpage. I like reddit but it has gotten so political and toxic. Many posts boil down to &quot;haha look how stupid this person is&quot;. I sometimes skim the controversial comments to see what the hive mind disapproves of. Recently, on the mega threat of Trump being covid positive, the controversial comments were along the lines of &quot;I don&#x27;t like Trump but I hope he gets better, nobody deserves covid&quot;. So not wishing someone death is bad? Overall reddit is pretty toxic.')
