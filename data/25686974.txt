But let me quote myself from a sibling comment:<p>&gt; it&#x27;s more of a hyperbole than something I truly suspect. It&#x27;s just that their opinions are in line with the hacker community 50% of the time, and in line with surveillance organisations the other 50% of the time. Of course, he always has some reason for having the opinion, it&#x27;s all covered up just fine, so it could also be perfectly legit. It&#x27;s just weird to argue both sides at the same time.<p>His being an alleged anarchist, how does that hold with the prohibition for forks to use Signal&#x27;s servers? Or the insistence that Google is the only place you should get the apk from? Shouldn&#x27;t we all build from source, not trust a central distribution point? They argue both sides and I find it hard to tell what they really believe in.<p>That said, I definitely see your point and, as said, he does plenty things to improve the status quo. It&#x27;s just his rejection of other things that would be even better.')
