This is a question that Twitter will be confronted with this once, and never again. No new policy need be created. If principles are compromised in doing this, it is a one-off.<p>Putting aside debates about cancel culture and ideological bias, Twitter already censors various kinds of uncontroversially harmful speech, and the President&#x27;s claim--to the small but not insignificant segment of his supporters who are angry, credulous, and well-armed--that the election was stolen will surely qualify as such a statement.')
