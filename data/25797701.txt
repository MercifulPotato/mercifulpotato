That I can go without them is a <i>luxury</i> many don&#x27;t have.<p>Lastly, people being outspoken about technology not working for them has led to countless improvements and innovations, often with benefits to the entire population (&lt;curb-cuts-cliche&#x2F;&gt;). Telling people not to express their criticism and complaints helps nobody.')
