Item(by='ambivalents', descendants=None, kids=[25574771], score=None, time=1609274591, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573827, text='&gt; A new report has also revealed that 19.3% of children and young people, aged between two and 19, <i>had obesity</i>, with 6.1% of kids identified as being severely obesity.<p>Small point but I found it interesting that &#x27;obesity&#x27; is used here as a condition one can have, rather than be. Maybe that&#x27;s the norm in science writing but first time I&#x27;ve seen it.')
