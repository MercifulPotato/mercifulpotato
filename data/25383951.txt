The policy is to delete content that alleges that there was widespread fraud. That doesn&#x27;t reference the sincerity or faith of the actor, but the object-level claims that are being made. It would seem that means they are deleting content they disagree with, regardless of whether it is put forth in good faith or not.<p>How many cases of fraud has there been in this election? 1? There has been 0 evidence of widespread fraud. The only possible way any argument could be made in good faith is if you have the naivete of a child. I&#x27;m not saying that as a value judgment, but as a matter of fact.<p>&gt; &gt; There is no silencing of good faith actors<p>&gt; Can you support this statement? It seems like an article of faith to me. How would you know that all the videos that had been removed are put forth in bad faith?<p>I can not prove a negative, other than the absence of evidence of the contrary. Do you have any examples of good faith actors being silenced that we can discuss the merits of?<p>&gt; Does that mean you acknowledge the possibility of error in judgment with respect to this issue?<p>Yes, but I have seen no evidence of this, so I reserve that hypothetical for when it happens.')
