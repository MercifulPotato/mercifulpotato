I am not sure what the balance is.<p>I see you added to your comment after I&#x27;d responded:<p>&gt;&quot;It makes no difference to insurance companies if the premiums are paid by the employer with pre tax dollars or the directly by an individual vis healthcare.gov with post tax dollars. &quot;<p>It actually makes a huge difference to their business model who is paying, and whether the dollars are pre-tax or post-tax. When the dollars are pre-tax, people try to get the most comprehensive coverage possible, so that everything, even routine expenditures (like eyeglasses) are covered by insurance, which increases insurance company revenue. Additionally, selling to businesses is very different from selling to consumers; with the former, you&#x27;re in more of an enterprise B2B market, which is totally different from a B2C.')
