Raised 2 kids, putting them and also wife through college on less than these whining amounts. Nothing about sitting at a computer is even close to actually working (as a lineman, cook, gardener, construction, etc.) My take is that for the people who spend like that, money is easy come easy go. Complaining about how expensive the city is when you don’t need to be there (Caltrain, etc.) is whining. You can spend on all the things to keep up with Joneses but that’s just silly.')
