It does put things into some perspective but I am still wondering.<p>So something analogous to owning a part of the network, would it be correct to say that, for instance, governments own and auction telecom spectrums to businesses. They do make money out of that ownership through the initial auction price and then potentially tax you later. So a cryptocurrency could be looked at in a similar way in the future. When you later sell the currency you have owned for a while (given that it takes off well over the couple of years), you are basically transferring that &quot;spectrum&quot; ownership to another party.')
