This is probably something too complex and large to robotically assemble on the Moon, and a human mission could also use in-situ lunar resources (e.g. lunar concrete) to help build such a thing. You could build a <i>massive</i> telescope up there that would be able to outperform anything we currently have by many factors.<p>Even better would be an array of them precisely positioned and bound together.<p>I wonder how big you&#x27;d have to go to actually <i>see</i> exoplanets? Wow.')
