It doesn&#x27;t do the filesystem layer, but IIRC eMMC&#x27;s don&#x27;t either.<p>AFAIK the only reason SDs are less reliable, is because they&#x27;re cheap and the socket can be loose, causing corruption during a write (or wear level). It would be interesting if you know of something logically different that also makes them less reliable.')
