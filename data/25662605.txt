I&#x27;ve always been a fan of polyglot programming and use of languages oriented towards specific use cases, as opposed to language-centric ecosystems. Now Java doesn&#x27;t exactly fit that criterion ;( but makes up for it by being portable, relatively open, and cross-platform, and being instrumental in having prevented Windows dominance on the server-side in the 1990s.
