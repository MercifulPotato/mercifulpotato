Both are systems&#x2F;dev roles. Clearly, neither is a position from which one is qualified to contravene the WHO.<p>Her degrees (per her own LinkedIn page) are in <i>Geography</i>. Take a look at the degree requirements at Syracuse (which offers both a BA and a BS (Jones earned the BA option)) [2] and LSU [3]. Next, go look at a few DS job postings and tell me the requirements are aligned (they are not).<p>I&#x27;m sure Jones is smart. I&#x27;m sure Jones is well versed in Geography. But she&#x27;s not a data scientist. Even if she were, her skills and experience would not qualify her to overrule WHO guidance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;stormjones&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;stormjones&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;coursecatalog.syr.edu&#x2F;preview_program.php?catoid=3&amp;poid=858&amp;returnto=255" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;coursecatalog.syr.edu&#x2F;preview_program.php?catoid=3&amp;po...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsu.edu&#x2F;ga&#x2F;programs&#x2F;msgeography.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsu.edu&#x2F;ga&#x2F;programs&#x2F;msgeography.php</a>')
