I&#x27;ve worked in aerospace too, on smaller parts and sensors (didn&#x27;t require a large office&#x2F;factory).<p>The office was somewhat compartmentalized with biometrics between some rooms, classic in aerospace&#x2F;defense work. IMO we were at zero risk of having an open office plan or noisy neighbors because of the domain.<p>The higher manager believed in giving double displays to those who did EE (layout and routing). Eventually every engineers was officially doing that to qualify for the double displays.<p>We were buying a fair amount of parts&#x2F;electronics&#x2F;hardware as part of the activity, some of it rather expensive. It wasn&#x27;t too difficult to slip displays into the larger orders and get them approved. I recall every test bench I made came de facto with a PC and dual IPS display in the bill of materials lol')
