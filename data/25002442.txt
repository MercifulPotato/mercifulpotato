So, is it ok to have sex with 12&#x2F;13 year olds, since most girls a few years older (18) can do it with anyone? (and in Europe from 16?)<p>I am sorry but I don&#x27;t understand. I hope it isn&#x27;t what you are trying to say, but if you think a behaviour of an 11 year old is ok because a 17 year old also does it, I just can&#x27;t agree and hate that train of thought.<p>* this coming from an european liberal with an 8 year old boy')
