Who hasn&#x27;t been given a PPT file as a manual for something?<p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s all in the powerpoint&quot;.<p>Or been given the same kind of file to familiarize yourself about something at your (new) workplace. Issue is you rarely have any of the material the speaker used to present the whole thing so you&#x27;re left wondering about the meaning of it all while reading bullet point lists...<p>No, a powerpoint is not a proper doc...<p>So in a way, I have to applaud MS as they did great with these but almost too great...')
