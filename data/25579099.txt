Right now the food deliveries like DoorDash take a cut from the restaurants, add a delivery fee, a service fee, a small order fee, a city fee (if the city caps their maximum commission), a tax and then try to guilt the customers into tipping the drivers 20%.<p>This nonsense needs to stop. All prices should include all the fees so customers can comparison shop.<p>Worst of all at some grocery stores I&#x27;ve come across POS devices that ask for a tip. It&#x27;s annoying. These need to be outlawed.<p>I&#x27;m all for drivers and restaurant workers making more money but mandatory &quot;tip&quot; and various hidden fees is not the way to go.')
