It should be said I do prefer these less traveled sections.<p>Anyway, if I have an bad accident[1], I might not be able to operate the phone. Either the phone could get damaged or I&#x27;m passed out, hurt or similar.<p>Sharing the location in real-time with my gf, Google and possibly various governments seems preferable to lying hurt alone deep in the woods without anyone having a clue where I am.<p>[1]: Friend of a friend had a front wheel puncture in a turn at the bottom of a hill, causing him to crash into some rocks. By sheer luck someone found him. He was passed out. The crash crushed his jaw, and he sustained severe brain damage. It&#x27;s years since and he&#x27;s still not recovered 100%.')
