In the past you could risk account suspension if you chargebacked purchases or redeemed stolen keys, but even that got changed years ago to just remove the specific game&#x2F;license from your account instead.<p>Only large-scale fraud would get you banned, and even then I doubt they would disable your account entirely and not just disable future purchasing.')
