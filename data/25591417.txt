In practice however, at least IMHO, Safari isn’t really a competitor to Chrome at this point, but rather a means of Apple to curb the web and to conform to it’s standards. Think WebP, WebM, WebA (or Ogg&#x2F;Vorbis - no support for any free&#x2F;libre codecs at all), PWAs, offline support, push notifications and the list goes on. A serious competitor like the Firefox from a few years ago would have been awesome, but Safari really just seems to push people away from the web platform, much like IE’s lack of support in the past has done. The alternative to a (kinda, but not really) monoculture web platform is IMHO preferable to a platform of fully proprietary native platforms.')
