Prior to buying this I had no idea that tyres transmitted data via radio-waves (is it obvious I don&#x27;t drive?)<p>I setup some wireless temperature sensors which transmit over 433Mhz, but eventually abandoned them.  It was just as good to sniff the temperature-reports the tyres in the carpark beneath my flat were transmitting!')
