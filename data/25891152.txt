These health hazards exist in varying levels all over the world, some places more than others, in some cases less, much thanks to environmentalist organizations that have put pressure on governments to regulate and install the required sewage cleaning etc.<p>While a spontaneous and completely sane reaction to this is to save oneself by privately installing filters, buying organic etc. these are problems that ultimately and obviously require collective solutions, i.e. by government and through treaties between governments.<p>But if the last year has taught us anything, it is that any government action is likely to be met with equal and opposite reaction (in the west), a reaction that seems to stem in large part and primarily from a section of society that lives by the adage &quot;Après moi, le déluge&quot;, and secondarily from the section of  the populace that has been spoon-fed conspiracy theories (by the former?) about the government and its nefarious nature.<p>I suspect there are readers here that might disagree with the above, and it&#x27;s  not my intention to start a flame war. Instead I&#x27;d be interested to hear if there are any rational reasons why the government should not be given adequate means to regulate and follow up that regulation with the required inspections to make sure toxins are not released into the general environment that forms the basis of our, as well as other biological, present and future, life.')
