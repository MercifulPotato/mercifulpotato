If not, how would you know you&#x27;re implementing the best known version of the algorithm?<p>It seems to me that hardware is a route to improvement, but only after all of the software improvements have been done. If you want to spand your career making computers do stuff faster there&#x27;ll always be more work to do in software, simply because if you can make something fast enough there you don&#x27;t need to implement it in hardware.')
