Sure, today there is a nostalgic twinge for my long-trashed yute, but not so nostalgic to pay for reliving it.<p>These days, I want a cybernetic-augmented vision-nerves-proxy that projects as many windows and other visual artifacts as I want into my visual cone, and typing directly keyed off my brain&#x27;s Broca&#x27;s Area (or maybe the area for neuromuscular control of my fingers if using Broca&#x27;s Area proves to yield too slow an input response). Hopefully powered by nano-powerplants hoovering up fatty acids and adipose cells from my blood, oxidizing into ATP, and generating electricity from the ATP. Hopefully thermal management is sufficient by drinking more water and exhaling more water vapor.')
