Free speech is not a synonym for the US 1st amendment. That part of the constitution only protects government interference, which implies that there can be other types, and there&#x27;s more than one country in the world. Are you really going to claim that social media companies cannot censor?<p>&gt; Besides, they are smart enough to never call for violence directly. They say &quot;I wish someone would call SWAT on this guy&quot; or &quot;this kinda behaviour ends you with a broken nose wink wink&quot;.<p>This sounds to me like conspiracy theory talk, as does the bit about rich people. I&#x27;m sure both happen but to paint everything or everyone that way lacks nuance at best and sounds like something you&#x27;d hear from a quack in a tinfoil hat at worst.<p>&gt; In the US, a lawsuit isn&#x27;t about who is right but who has enough money to keep the lawsuit going for longer.<p>This is partly true, but it is no doubt true that the law - explicit as it is - states the opposite. Again, who was claiming that the system was perfect?<p>&gt; Disrespectful and violent speech is not free speech, it&#x27;s violence.<p>&gt; Reread, I don&#x27;t conflate them.<p>If you didn&#x27;t then you just have. I suspect you, either knowingly or unknowingly wish to tie disrespect to violence because it&#x27;s convenient for arguing against disrespectful speech being free. Well, SCOTUS has ruled that even some forms of &quot;violent speech&quot; are covered by the 1st amendment (speech containing threats must be credible and imminent to lose coverage), disrespect is definitely covered.<p>Can I blashpheme or is that too disrespectful? Is satire allowed or is that too disrespecful? Would I be committing violent acts by dismissing God? I&#x27;d expect that kind of talk from religious fundamentalists.<p>&gt; It doesn&#x27;t have to be infallible, just reasonably provable or not disprovable<p>You&#x27;re circling back to a court system with judges, but…<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re lying on purpose then this entire point is moot anyway, no need to prove anything. Then you&#x27;re just out for harm.<p>…you appear to have discarded presumption of innocence along the way. Terrifying.')
