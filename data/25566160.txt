Japan&#x27;s space agency spending money on scientific research is not stopping climate research and mitigation from occurring.<p>The US on the other hand truly has hamstrung their ability to react to climate requirements with outsized military spending. It&#x27;s lucky the universities all benefit from the economic perversions of their massive endowments else I would be surprised the US would have any Universities left to do climate research.<p>Not to leave myself out and rag on the US alone, Australia is just lucky the economic incentives are changing in favour of renewables else we would keep rocking coal like it&#x27;s 1800 until we all lived in Cooper Pedy style holes in the ground.')
