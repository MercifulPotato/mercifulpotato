Is it trying to get more pain meds to primarily fuel addiction&#x2F; selling? Or is it seeking attention and so can be ignored?<p>Would they be a seeker if they took home the meds and not actually take them? The drs would then think &quot;why more pain med, they are already on some?&quot;<p>or of they didn&#x27;t accept and take home the meds from the drs? So then the drs would think when they return &quot;they are here asking for more help when they rejected the help we gave them before, are they seeking attention?&quot;<p>Perhaps it means something else?')
