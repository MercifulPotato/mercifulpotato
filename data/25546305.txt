By default, none of the current templates add any libraries to the swing. However, I&#x27;m planning on adding new template galleries to make it easy to create&#x2F;explore ideas using popular frameworks. I&#x27;d love to hear if you have any suggestions for what you&#x27;d like to see me prioritize (e.g. React, Tailwind, etc.), since I&#x27;ll be working on that this weekend :D<p>That said, when you create&#x2F;open a swing, there will be a &quot;CodeSwing&quot; view on the Explorer tab, which displays all the files in the swing. One of those files will be called &quot;codeswing.json&quot;, which is the manifest for the swing itself. If you click on it, you&#x27;ll see two array properties, called &quot;scripts&quot; and &quot;styles&quot;, which list the libraries that have been added to the swing. When you add a new library via the &quot;Add Library&quot; command, it will add the selected library to that file: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codespaces-contrib&#x2F;codeswing#external-libraries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codespaces-contrib&#x2F;codeswing#external-lib...</a>. Let me know if you have any feedback on that experience!<p>Regarding sharing: I maintain another VS Code extension called GistPad (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad</a>) that allows you to login with GitHub and then manage gists&#x2F;repos without cloning&#x2F;committing files. GistPad has an integration with CodeSwing that allows you to create swings as gists, and then edit&#x2F;share them with others: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codespaces-contrib&#x2F;gistpad#codeswing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codespaces-contrib&#x2F;gistpad#codeswing</a>. Since GistPad shows your starred gists, and lets you follow other GitHub users, you can also share swings by simply starring&#x2F;following others that are creating swings in gists.<p>Additionally, since you can create new swings as local directories (using the &quot;CodeSwing: New Swing...&quot; command), you could store a swing in a GitHub&#x2F;BB&#x2F;GitLab repo, and then when others clone and open that repo in VS Code, the CodeSwing extension will detect the swing and automatically launch the right coding environment. The gif in the project&#x27;s README shows that in action using GitHub Codespaces.<p>Let me know if any of that sounds interesting, or if you have feedback on how I could improve the overall experience. Thanks so much for checking out CodeSwing!')
