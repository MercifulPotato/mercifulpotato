Having been a tech generalist for over a decade, I&#x27;m now looking to bridge the gap between casual freelance work and serious front-end engineering using React or Svelte. My ideal role would be an entry&#x2F;mid-level position at a small&#x2F;medium sized company working remotely. I&#x27;m ardent about writing clean code, adept at asynchronous communication within distributed teams, and eager to write tests, docs, and code reviews too.')
