Windows Vista Aero support, Support for building native apps for the Microsoft Store, etc.<p>Delphi never shipped with bindings for 100% of the APIs, but the beauty of Delphi was I could create my own bindings with only a little code from Delphi, so it wasn&#x27;t a roadblock. That is the huge difference between Delphi and non-native development tools: You aren&#x27;t held back by lack of libraries or API bindings.')
