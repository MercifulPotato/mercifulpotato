While everyone else was fighting container wars, Nomad was quietly executing and building a following. \nIt’s not a threat to Kubernetes and it will probably never be, but it definitely has a dominant position in a niche of container orchestrators that just work. It doesn’t attempt to solve every infrastructure-related problem under the sun. Its main value proposition is that it’s simple to operate and reason about. That’s a no small feat, given how complex and fragmented Kubernetes and the ecosystem around is.<p>Kudos to Hashicorp for staying true to themselves and always keeping the interest of their users at heart.')
