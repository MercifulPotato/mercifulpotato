The company I work for (fairly large tech company) uses Go, and is hiring in NYC, but has no roles listed on Dice. I know of at least two more definitely-not-small tech companies hiring in NYC that use Go, and their job listings say Go, but they have no job listings on Dice either.<p>Seems there may be a &quot;cultural divide&quot; on where job listings for different types of companies&#x2F;languages show up.')
