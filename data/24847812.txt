But even if you create an amazing tree&#x2F;hashmap-based type-signature-tuple inheritance-aware multiple dispatch object, you still have to think about how to make other packages use it.<p>I would also be interested how you would deal with the dynamic case of type erasure in this setup. Suppose I have a base class Base and derived classes A, B, and C. There&#x27;s a set of functions<p><pre><code>    f(A*, B*, A*)\n    f(C*, A*, A*)\n</code></pre>\nfor some combinations of pointers to A, B and C. Given a<p><pre><code>    std::vector&lt;std::tuple&lt;Base*,Base*,Base*&gt;&gt;\n</code></pre>\nhow do you apply the correct f to all its values?')
