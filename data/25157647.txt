It was easy for anyone to create a website for recipes or knitting designs and to publish it to your corner of the web.<p>For the longest time, I&#x27;ve felt that an open source project that basically mimicked it would be a great idea. (And for all those widgets, it should be easy to have those operate in asp.net or php... Bring back the page counter!)<p>For all those static site generators out there (I&#x27;ve written 4), I&#x27;d still use a FP clone that edited HTML, rather than markdown, or other.<p>The closest thing seems to be WordPress, but it lacks one fundamental thing: it&#x27;s not a desktop app, and requires server config (db and user login).<p>I think it fair to state that with the demise of FP, (&amp; then flash), the web became too &#x27;professional&#x27; as the grandma and 10yo were pushed aside for the semantic web.
