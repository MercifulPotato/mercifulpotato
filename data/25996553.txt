It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that it was a big deal driving a car from the USA down south.<p>Once you have built a boat with a sail or oars or both, that flat blue thing is a rather quick way from A to B.  OK the sea can be very unforgiving but it is worth the risk and with skill it is a manageable risk.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;pagan Anglo Saxon Britain&quot; means.  Just like say &quot;pagan Goa India&quot; makes no sense.  The Brythonic tribes of pre &quot;Roman times&quot; and the tribes prior to them traded in iron and much more for millenia with peoples at least as far as the Med sea.<p>I say Brythonic and that is a term coined by a bunch of Greeks, I think.  A Greek bloke called Pytheas (with crew) circumnavigated these islands back in the day and wrote it up.  He used the term &quot;Pretanike&quot; to describe the locals.<p>There is a dangerous fallacy to believe that modern constructs, societietal forms, sensitivities etc are applicable to the past.  They really are not.  There really is no such thing as an Anglo-Saxon per se (note my use of Latin there 8)<p>So given that these isles have rather a lot of sea and rivers available means that it was actually inevitable that artifacts made from the natural resources from these parts are found right across quite a huge part of the globe.<p>Once you&#x27;ve flogged off your iron for something useful, some pretty gewgaws for the wife is a good idea, otherwise she might not let you out next year ... 8)')
