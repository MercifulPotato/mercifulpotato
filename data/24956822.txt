If OPEX is reduced (lower electricity costs), it&#x27;s logical to assume that it will be replaced with CAPEX, given how competitive mining operations are. If that&#x27;s the case, that will mean electricity being used to power ASICs being replaced with chemicals required to fab semiconductors (along with electricity for those fabs). It might be better in terms of GHG emissions, it would be a wash for overall environmental impact.')
