It’s the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly “feminine” traits—which can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual—are the means by which your status as “man” can be taken away.<p>It seems to be a catch all term for the problematic parts of the way men are idealized by society.  IE stuff like how men can be expected to hide away their emotions or be perceived as weak.  Stuff like that shows up in suicide statistics.<p>Part of the problem with understanding the concept, IMO, is that ideological forces have managed to sway part of the public (or at least certain echo chambers) into believing that the people talking about it really mean &quot;all men are bad&quot; or &quot;traditional masculinity is bad.&quot;  I think there&#x27;s something real here that needs to be addressed though.<p>Edit: Case and point... somebody further down in this thread accused the term &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; of being designed by &quot;academic Marxist feminists&quot; who are waging culture wars in order to hyper-feminize small boys.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodmenproject.com&#x2F;featured-content&#x2F;the-difference-between-toxic-masculinity-and-being-a-man-dg&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodmenproject.com&#x2F;featured-content&#x2F;the-difference-b...</a>')
