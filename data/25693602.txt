As I said, Google Scholar already indexes all of these sites, with many nice features.<p>Personally I&#x27;m very fonf of exploring the two &quot;citation light cones&quot; emerging from one articles - those cited by the article (past) and those citing the article (future).<p>&gt; <i>Notice the modern media consumption patterns. The publisher doesn&#x27;t matter. Only individual articles do. People land at articles through Google queries and links shared on social media. I believe scientific papers show the same pattern to a large degree.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re absolutely correct about this. But what I&#x27;m proposing (many repositories, indexed by search engines, together giving complete coverage) is exactly like that. A single archive, Sci-Hub style, is more like what Google is trying to do with AMP.')
