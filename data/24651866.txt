C++ Connoisseur?<p>Join us on our journey to build the best cross-platform messaging and communication platform in existence. We&#x27;ve seen tremendous growth the past couple months and are on a vendetta to make the audio and video experience the best it can possibly be for our 100m+ monthly active users.<p>In our quest for excellence we&#x27;ve built our own hardware-accelerated video encoding and decoding pipelines from scratch (in Rust!), dug into the guts of Chromium and WebRTC, and worked around some of the most esoteric OS constraints I&#x27;ve ever seen in my career.
