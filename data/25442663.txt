After more thinking it&#x27;s not that new, it&#x27;s &quot;panem et circenses&quot; all over again, just way more scalable.<p>Also, I think Americans are culturally just much more market-thinking and transaction-oriented. In many other places it&#x27;s a much higher threshold for people to give out money for something. Now, surely this is a function of disposable income as well, but &quot;paying for stuff left and right&quot; is just a basic thing for many Americans, while e.g. Germans would much rather save up. So marketing also has to adjust to local circumstances: Germany has very cheap supermarkets (discounters) because brand loyalty is lower and price weighs in stronger.<p>This also means that innovative people much rather go to the American market, because there&#x27;s just more willingness in normal people to try and pay for new things there. It&#x27;s both good and bad.')
