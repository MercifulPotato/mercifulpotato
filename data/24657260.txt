My record has caused me to be fired from and denied several jobs, and at my lowest point I was kicked out of an education program despite succeeding otherwise. &quot;None of my charges are violent or sexual. There&#x27;s no reason to conclude I&#x27;d be a danger to children. Look at them. Failure to appear. Disorderly conduct. Criminal mischief...&quot; &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter, look how many there are. Parents will find this, you, the school, and our program will be held accountable.&quot;<p>Bottom line is people are absolutely horrible to each other if they&#x27;re given even the slightest pretense. It&#x27;s just a disgusting facet of our psyche, I guess. Those convicted of a crime are condemned to continued punishment by anybody who cares to look at their record, long after they&#x27;ve repaid any debts. I remember asking a police officer when I was in my early 20&#x27;s why every time I handed my Id to an officer I was searched, arrested, or charged with something. She replied simply, &quot;Because you have a yellow stripe painted down your back.&quot;<p>The fact I had an outstanding warrant for a speeding ticket in another state and doing stupid and illegal things aside, once you have a record it is very hard to escape it. Most are relegated to menial minimum wage jobs. I was lucky, I have a social safety net, confidence, I knew I could get around it. Decided to focus my studies on something so specialized an employer wouldn&#x27;t try looking for reasons not to hire me. I don&#x27;t think anybody has actually checked my record since I graduated. The only applications I&#x27;ve been handed were basically a token for HR and I simply mark, &quot;No&quot; under the, &quot;Have you ever been convicted of a crime?&quot; question. Because it doesn&#x27;t matter. It should be illegal for anybody to access resolved criminal records if they don&#x27;t have a direct reason pertaining to the safety or security of others. It&#x27;s not your job as an employer or hiring manager to judge someone&#x27;s mistakes, only their aptitude to perform a job.')
