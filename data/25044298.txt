Upgrading my display makes me slightly off-game myself, until I get used to the new one. Same when getting a new car, where the brakes are way more sensitive than on a old car. Doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t like the brakes to be more sensitive, just means I&#x27;m not used to it.<p>And yes, the first few weeks of sensitive brakes are irritating, just touch the pedal and the car grinds quickly to a full halt. But now I do like it better compared to when you fully press down the pedal and the car slowly stops.')
