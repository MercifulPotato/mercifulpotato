We finally decided to show Welder to HN.<p>We built Welder for ourselves as we are a small product team that was forced to go remote and wanted to produce content.<p>We used Zoom, but the quality was.. Well, S*t.<p>It’s a super easy way to record full quality recordings remotely as each participant is doing local recording which is progressively uploaded to our servers so as soon as the call ends, it’s ready for editing.<p>We’ve validated the product in 2 weeks by doing LP and running YT ads. Built MVP in 1 month and found out no one used it as we did a mistake by not validating if Electron app is ok for people to download.<p>Lessons learned, Welder is now browsers based. We decided to stay bootstrap and right now we are trying to find a pivot from a tool that “Allows you to record an interview in HQ remotely” to a tool for a team like us to produce meaningful content with ease from start to end.<p>I would love to hear your feedback either about the tool or about your content creation process. As we are doing extensive research on the topic of how startups and product teams produce content.<p>P.S. We have now quite a lot of experience with running online video service in production for some time, so if you have any questions regarding this topic, let us know we will be more than happy to answer.')
