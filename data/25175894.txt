In the name of security they killed most of the ways you&#x27;d expect to be able to pass on information to users who fall anywhere outside the norm.<p>For example, you can&#x27;t fetch the mouse position, you can&#x27;t fire mouse events, you can&#x27;t get the window z-index. These are all pretty vital for accessibility.<p>Whilst there are efforts to get around this terrible-ness, you can expect most accessibility tools to segfault or misbehave.')
