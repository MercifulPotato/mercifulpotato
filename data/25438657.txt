For example instead of opening a :vsplit in vim I just split my terminal and open a second instance on vim on the same file. You lose pretty much all the advanced buffer handling that vim offers, but I never used them much in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s a bit crude but I really like how it results in a uniform way of working in the terminal.
