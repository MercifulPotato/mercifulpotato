Do you?  How do you know it?  If I was to sit next to you, would you be able to walk me through all the steps whereby I would be able to say that I know it too?<p>What does &#x27;know&#x27; mean to you?  Is it like believe, or like a hypothesis?  What is the difference?<p>If you don&#x27;t verify something for yourself, can you know it?  If someone says that something is true, does that make it true, even if you haven&#x27;t confirmed it for yourself?  If so, who do you trust?  Should you trust teachers?  Do they mean well?  If they mean well, is it possible that they have made a mistake and are relaying wrong information that they haven&#x27;t verified for themselves?  If they are relaying unverfied information as knowledge, are they liars?  Are you lying if you do the same?  Who has the authority on truth?  Is it the schools, as funded by the government?

If you do want to reply to this, no problem - it just may take a while for me to respond.  Cheers.')
