Gripes about Git&#x27;s UI choices aside, Git was designed around human-readable text files and just doesn&#x27;t do large binary files well. Sure, there&#x27;s Git-LFS, but it sucks. The future of version control will: (1) Make use of deduplication to handle large binary files, (2) Natively supports remotes via cloud storage, (3) Doesn&#x27;t keep state in the working directory so that projects can live in a Dropbox&#x2F;OneDrive&#x2F;iCloud folder without corrupting the repo, (4) is truly cross-platform with minimal POSIX dependencies.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing around with a proof-of-concept in Go based on the Restic chunker library:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;akbarnes&#x2F;dupver" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;akbarnes&#x2F;dupver</a>')
