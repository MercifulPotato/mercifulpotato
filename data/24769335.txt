And so on for other parts of the stack. On AWS, for DB, that might be Dynamo (lock-in heavy) or, say, Aurora Serverless (no real lock-in if you don&#x27;t use the RDS Data API but instead use the normal MySQL or Postgres API, but that&#x27;s higher friction—more involved VPC setup—to use from Lambda than RDS Data API is, so the path of least resistance leads to lockin.)<p>Lambda or other FaaS is often part of a serverless solution, but is rarely a serverless solution by itself.')
