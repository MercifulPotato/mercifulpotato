You have a higher initial outlay, but the results last longer, can be repaired much easier, as well as broken down and repurposed. Most furniture can be assembled with a cheap hand saw and chisels, or if you&#x27;re lazy, skilsaw, drill, drill bit set, and screws.<p>I don&#x27;t know that i&#x27;ll ever buy a piece of furniture again unless it&#x27;s second-hand and deeply discounted. There&#x27;s so much good shit out there already.')
