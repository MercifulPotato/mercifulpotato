It&#x27;s actually very easy to reduce consumption (0.5 GPM faucets, 1 GPM showers and 0.7 GPF toilets), stretch the supply (grey water systems), reuse it almost indefinitely (teriary treated water), increase real supply (pipelines&#x2F;aqueducts&#x2F;water trucks&#x2F;desalination), etc.<p>Even if your locality has to foot the bill for some huge, expensive water projects like those, it&#x27;s still going to cost a tiny fraction of your household expenditures.  Whereas scare land in popular cities will cost you the bulk of your income for decades.')
