But a person with the freedom to do the things they want and the energy to embark on ambitious projects will have no trouble having a genuine social circle and having great experiences barring some serious psychological obstacle in doing so like Howard Hughes.<p>This is far more important than this vague idea of reputation. Just because a person has a good reputation doesn&#x27;t mean they are respected or loved. It could just be that they do not figure at all in people&#x27;s minds. You can live up to people&#x27;s expectations and die having never really lived.<p>Honestly it&#x27;s somewhat reflective of the infamous slave morality vs. master morality debate')
