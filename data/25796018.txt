We get audited annually against 27k Annex A (basically ~95% of full one) + UK Gambling Commission extras.<p>The audit focuses far more on technical aspects of business continuity than actual security. There&#x27;s certainly plenty of overlap, but other than the parts about access controls and &quot;who watches the watchmen&quot; aspect, ISO27k is almost entirely about your ability to recover from even the most devastating disaster. The pragmatic security parts have a bolted-on feeling to ensure the recovery path remains largely uncorrupted.')
