Also, exponential doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;happens too fast to react&quot;. If the number of your users doubles every year, you still have exponential growth, if you only have paid users you still have a very nice growth of business and you also have time to react.<p>It&#x27;s indeed pretty rare to see services that crumble under the exponential increase in traffic. Especially if it&#x27;s not a spike from publicity (I don&#x27;t know how you would say &quot;being slashdotted&quot; these days). It happens, but it&#x27;s rare. But because it&#x27;s usually newsworthy or at least interesting it gets more attention and it will feel much more of a danger than it actually is. Both for software developers and entrepreneurs (or even for the general public) it feels lame. Ha! They should have expected this! But the truth is that most of the time you should not prepare for this, because it&#x27;s pretty rare, it&#x27;s not even necessary for success, not even for startup scale success at the beginning.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to see actually: (almost) all of today&#x27;s successful services provided by startups started as monoliths (or maybe more realistically some kind of SOA, because monolith vs. microservices is really a false dichotomy). It did work a decade ago with weaker hardware, why wouldn&#x27;t it work now?')
