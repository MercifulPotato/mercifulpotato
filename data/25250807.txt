Item(by='fy20', descendants=None, kids=[25250818], score=None, time=1606711386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25247211, text='If anyone wants a self-hosted password manager I&#x27;d highly recommend BitWarden.<p>I originally used pass (with some custom scripts to read the current URL from Chrome and copy the password for that domain), but then switched to 1Password when they came out with their cross-platform browser extensions. Having a browser extension to automatically generate and save usernames and passwords, and something that supports syncing out-of-the-box makes password management a whole lot easier.<p>Earlier this year I switched to BitWarden (with bitwarden-rs as the server) and it is 95% as good as 1Password. I&#x27;m happy to have something self-hosted to manage this.')
