The Xcode GUI only allows one build at a time, but you can run multiple `xcodebuild` command line builds using the same or different versions of Xcode in parallel, even under the same macOS user.<p>For running tests, there used to be problems if you were trying to invoke the iOS Simulator for different versions of Xcode in parallel, but those issues were fixed 4 or 5 years ago.<p>I&#x27;ve setup and used a set of bare-metal Mac mini CI runner, each configured to run two jobs in parallel, and the Xcode pieces of that are rock solid and didn&#x27;t need _any_ workarounds to enable parallel jobs.')
