Friendly contact would be an email or a phone call or talking to them at a public event but not setting up a team of field agents to follow someone and track their habits, then threaten with legal action at their door.<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stalking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stalking</a>:<p>&gt; Stalking is unwanted and&#x2F;or repeated surveillance by an individual or group toward another person.
