I&#x27;d buy a non-cookbook that gave me more paleo&#x2F;AIP&#x2F;low-lectin food-combinations like that.  Or just info on how to make better salads.  (I add a lot of fermented foods like pickled red onions lately)<p>I do sometimes bake a bunch of turkey meatballs and eat those over a couple days - but I&#x27;ve given up on making turkey burgers or chicken.  It&#x27;s just too much work.  I&#x27;d rather heat up frozen broccoli daily with a side of canned tuna.  I really hate cooking, it&#x27;s a huge time-sink and extremely unenjoyable.')
