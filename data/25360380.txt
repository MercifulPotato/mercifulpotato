It does support up to 2 older versions with updates, but that means potentially breaking major upgrades every 6-18 months, compared to once every 8 years.<p>Debian, OTOH, has a much longer release cycle, and more of a reputation for moving like molasses, which for better or worse mirrors CentOS a bit more closely.')
