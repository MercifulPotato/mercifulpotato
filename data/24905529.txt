It’s easy not to appreciate just how much intuition can go a long way in helping us understand a concept, even if the intuition is formally “fuzzy”. I used Hefferon’s Linear Algebra to plug the gaps in my intuitive and practical knowledge, and was all the better for it.<p>People have different reasons and approaches for learning, and in the linear algebra landscape Hefferon is a worthy addition.<p>(edit: just like one of the commenters below I bought the hard copy a few years ago to show my support and thanks for the free edition.)')
