My work switched from everyone being in the office to fully remote as a result of COVID, and I&#x27;ve never met my coworkers. They&#x27;re all pretty webcam-shy, they don&#x27;t want to have social calls, it&#x27;s very awkward. I think if we met in person a couple times it would break down some barriers but as it is I&#x27;m basically alone working on a one-man project with minimal communication. Most days it feels like if I just quit nobody would notice, and the work itself is not very interesting, so it&#x27;s hard to stay motivated.')
