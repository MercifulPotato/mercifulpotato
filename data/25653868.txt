There should be some terms under which you are interacting. The terms as listed are pretty easy to find. The link pretty clearly says that if you proceed you agree to the terms. They have a link to the terms. You don&#x27;t have to proceed. It&#x27;s not really that hidden or misleading. Adding a check box doesn&#x27;t make it that much more likely for someone to read it, not enough to materially change the facts here. Every piece of software has terms and conditions, so seeking those out seems like a low bar.<p>If the standard is &quot;well nobody reads those things anyway&quot;, then a lot of mortgages and credit card agreements could be invalid. Frankly most propositions on the ballot should be invalid, as those aren&#x27;t even linked in any way to the ballot where you vote. This December&#x27;s bill in the US congress that was like 5,000 pages long and they only had 2 hours until the vote to read it, that should be invalid.<p>If there was a plausible alternative agreement they might have agreed to, then I could understand the ruling. But as a matter of law, this seems like a bad call.')
