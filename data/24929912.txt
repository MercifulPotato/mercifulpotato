Government debt is at or approaching an all time high relative to GDP. Corporate debt is rather high although I don&#x27;t know how it compares historically and there is a massive amount of student debt floating around. There are a lot of people out there who, by the numbers, are consuming quite a bit more than they are producing.<p>US primary energy production has basically flatlined since 2000 [0]. That isn&#x27;t the be-all and end-all, but it just seems like an easy prediction that long periods of growing population and flat energy consumption is going to lead to problems. The people who can&#x27;t convince Asians to give them stuff are not going to be rolling in a surplus of stuff, is my read of that chart. I haven&#x27;t heard good reports about the state of US infrastructure either, but maybe it is better than I think.<p>The States might make it work, but the political situation is developing pretty much how I&#x27;d expect it to if there is a large group of people being squeezed out by lack of access to real stuff. There is a big body of people who just aren&#x27;t producing as much as they are consuming, and the background talk of &quot;we don&#x27;t need energy to be wealthy!&quot; - I don&#x27;t see how that squares off against the growing relatively evident growing instability. Trump in particular is not a sign of a thriving economy. Nor is the Democrat rhetoric in response to Trump.<p>Population growth is ~.7-.8% per annum, and real GDP growth is estimated at 2% per annum. Given the expansion of the money supply, and the gossip that the US is a &#x27;service based&#x27; economy, it is entirely plausible to me that real stuff is growing more slowly than population and the measured growth is some sort of complicated feedback loop that nobody has tracked down.<p>&gt; Malthusian arguments are outdated by atleast a 100 years.<p>Hopefully. But it is worth being prepared for a world where obvious trends play out to their conclusion.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy#energy-production-by-region" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy#energy-production-by-regio...</a>')
