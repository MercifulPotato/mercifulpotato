Item(by='Freak_NL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605516384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108455, text='&gt; ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai […])<p>Rōmaji, not <i>romaji</i>¹. The macron (long dash above) over the vowel indicates that the <i>rō</i> is a long vowel sound (roughly twice the length of, for example, the <i>ma</i> or <i>ji</i> following it). The purpose of romanization is to get text that can be pronounced roughly correct by someone not fluent in reading Japanese kanji and kana.<p>Dampfkraft is knowledgeable on these topics, which makes the complete absence of macrons in his romanized words doubly conspicuous.<p>1: Unless you are using it as a loanword in English, but here it was a literal romanized transcription.')
