The market will have a big wake-up call when the VC money dries up and these companies will be in serious trouble.<p>I think advertising and marketing is a good example of this. The amount of advertising a typical person is exposed to has increased by orders of magnitude but the amount of disposable money people have hasn’t followed. Given the primary objective of advertising is to drive a purchase (either directly or indirectly through brand awareness), an adjustment is bound to happen. Currently a lot of advertising &amp; marketing is propped up by VC-funded companies who burn unreasonable amounts of money on customer acquisition in an attempt to monopolise their market, but these attempts are petering out which in turn means the advertising companies’ revenue would diminish and get closer to the <i>true</i> value of their services. We’re already seeing this on major platforms where they cram more and more ads in, in an attempt to maintain their revenue despite the declining value of their ad slots.')
