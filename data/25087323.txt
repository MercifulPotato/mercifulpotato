They make great temporary gloves that you can slip over your hand before touching the gas pump, and they slide off into the trash easily without touching the outside with the other hand.<p>Keep in mind that Clorox wipes still take 30 seconds to kill the virus (according to the manufacturer page).  Most people don&#x27;t tend to wait after disinfecting a surface before touching it, meaning the cleaning agent may become more diluted and less effective.<p>Better yet, disinfect <i>and</i> wear a baggie-glove while pumping.  I don&#x27;t disinfect the pump when wearing a plastic bag glove myself, but I do use hand sanitizer as soon as I&#x27;m done.')
