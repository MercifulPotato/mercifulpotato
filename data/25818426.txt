I get that. But the option of distributing proper, sealing, high filtration efficiency military grade masks and filters to the entire population, as ridiculous as it might sound to some, would have completely halted the spread of the disease and most importantly kept the economy and societal bonds active. It would also have been much, much cheaper than what most governments did in the end.<p>The only reason I can think of that would put this plan out of public dialogue is because it&#x27;s sounds ridiculous to the average person. Is that the case?')
