Item(by='smoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606059761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177814, text='I grew up in a region where everything in recipes is given by weight and learned to cook this way.<p>Nonetheless, although initially super annoyed, I have grown some fondness of using cups as measurement. For day to day cooking, I can’t be bothered to do things precisely and I’m more interested in rough ratios. Usually I don’t use any measurement device at all.<p>Also, no matter which way, often you can not rely on measurements because of how widely the products differ. For example paprika powder. The exact same amount can go from not doing anything discernible for the dish to overpower it.<p>My favorite way of cooking is how it was done in a half day class I took in Singapore. There were some basic amounts given as a starting point, then all further instructions where: do this until it becomes that consistency or color, taste, if you want it spicier add some more of this, if you want it more sour add this, sweeten with that if you like, taste again, etc.<p>Exact measurement I think is great for certain dishes where it really matters and for professional places to make it reproducible and scalable, but at home, for me it takes like half the fun out of it and I reckon more people would enjoy cooking if recipes where generally conceived, less as instruction manuals and more as seed for an idea for experimentation.')
