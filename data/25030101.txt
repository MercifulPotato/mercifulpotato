They&#x27;ll be off the grid unlike most of us.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t actually give them privacy, I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s plenty of &#x27;friendly&#x27; neighbours spying on each other for a few bucks, basically stasi style.<p>And also this watermarking isn&#x27;t all that different from our browser fingerprinting and mega data collection. It&#x27;s just a cultural difference. The NK government <i>wants</i> their citizens to know they&#x27;re being spied on. Whereas ours is trying to hide it. Thus more focus on the endpoint device rather than the cloud side.')
