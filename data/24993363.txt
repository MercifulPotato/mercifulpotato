The issue there is that, at some point the game addict has to look away from the screen: the game may end online service, fall out of fashion, the addicted gamer may lose their quick reflexes as they age, etc.  And once they look away, they&#x27;ll find that they have nothing; they&#x27;ve poured their efforts into something that has left them with no real status in society.<p>Similarly, people using robotic devices in this way will have poured something rather different into them but the result is still the same; at some point they&#x27;ll look away and realize they have none of the status markers of society accorded  a long-term committed couple &#x2F; family.  In short, the emptiness eventually hits home at some point in both cases.  What will these addicts do then?  What will become of them?  I suspect nothing good, meaning that such robots aren&#x27;t a long-term solution to the unfulfilled biological needs of those locked out of the reproductive pool.')
