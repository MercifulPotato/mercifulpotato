What you are describing is a kind of &quot;right to an audience&quot;, where in the article is there a demand for this?<p>If the comment were demanding that substack remove the article, or if the commenter was trying to get the author fired from his job for this article, I would consider it against the idea of free speech. Note that this does not equate to a demand for any legislative change or government action.<p>The view expressed in XKCD 1357 is that there would be no free speech issue since it isn&#x27;t the government trying to prevent the author from making his article available to those who wish to read it (again, no one is asking for a right to an audience or right to be protected from disagreement) or threatening his livelihood as retaliation for publishing the article.')
