So, my account (which is admittedly large, with around 3000 rooms and 350K users visible) uses 1.4GB of JS heap on Element&#x2F;Web, and 14MB on Hydrogen.  It&#x27;s also lightning fast, as you might expect given it&#x27;s not having to wade around shuffling gigabytes of javascript heap around the place.')
