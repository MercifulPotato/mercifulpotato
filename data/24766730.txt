I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> thought building GUI in Rust would be straightforward. I&#x27;ll try for a tl;dr summary, as it might be useful to this thread:<p>Building a GUI toolkit is a huge task, with many subtasks that are themselves serious efforts (2D drawing, text, reactive architecture, etc). The Druid project has been engaging these problems and coming up with pretty good solutions. Trying to rush the effort (for example, by trying to lash together existing modules) won&#x27;t be helpful. In coming months, the project will continue focus on trying to deliver one application, the Runebender font editor, rather than trying to be a general purpose GUI toolkit product. We&#x27;ve been growing a really good community and there are lots of opportunities to learn more about GUI technology and help the project along.<p>I&#x27;m a bit biased, perhaps, but I&#x27;m extremely optimistic about the prospects for GUI in Rust. But if people are impatient and hoping for a solution they can deploy right now, no, it&#x27;s not there yet.')
