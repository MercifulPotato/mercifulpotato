We can argue about carbohydrates endlessly, and I have to no avail in the past, but there is no dietary need for sugar at all. We <i>tolerate</i> some of it, but the less of it you eat the better off your body will be.<p>On a related note, the alcohol industry is actually really shady. They like to put on a clean image of providing responsible adults entertainment, but in reality the industry is deeply dependent on alcoholics. It’s estimated (2007 numbers) that just over 10% of alcohol drinkers consume <i>half</i> of the alcohol in the United States. Without that small cohort of alcoholics, a large percentage of the industry would go broke. Ever since learning this fact, I’ve taken an extra skeptical eye towards anything that even vaguely looks like alcohol industry influence.')
