How? Remember all those articles about the practical slave labor camps of content reviewers with psychological problems that everybody was horrified by? And how we said we needed to stop doing that? Yeah, Parler doesn&#x27;t have those slave camps.<p>And by the way, do you know how <i>long</i> it took for FB and Twitter to get to <i>semi</i>-decent moderation?<p>FTA:\n“During one of the calls, Parler’s CEO reported that Parler had a backlog of 26,000 reports of content that violated its community standards and remained on its service.”<p>Parler might have refused on <i>some</i> of them, but the above is obviously a big part of the issue. Plus, if some people are willing to justify Twitter leaving up the &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot; stuff, then surely there will be some disagreement about <i>what</i> exactly should be removed on Parler based on context, yes?')
