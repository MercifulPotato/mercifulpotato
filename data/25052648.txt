Weak core muscles; specifically wrong muscles trying to support the core. I had zero lower abdominals. Pilate&#x27;s helps a lot.<p>I have to consciously engage muscles, even after practicing for years (can&#x27;t afford Pilate&#x27;s sessions which would make it go faster). Now I very rarely get the burning sensation and corresponding days, weeks, or months or not being able to sit or do much of anything.')
