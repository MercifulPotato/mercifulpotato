People trust these journals to curate science in the same way you suggest twitter would come to curate science if it made the move online.<p>1. It&#x27;s already possible to call attention to a paper through twitter, regardless of whether it&#x27;s published in a journal or not. Paywalls gate-keep the content somewhat and makes sharing easier, but that&#x27;s a minor side effect of a very broken system.<p>2. Papers (and involved data) being available on public platforms like github that already have mechanisms for reporting and tracking issues as well as built-in review tools, in githubs case even a separate discussion feature now, would allow for much quicker discussion critizising bad methodology.<p>3. Working with a VCS like git would automatically make it clear who wrote, edited or removed what.')
