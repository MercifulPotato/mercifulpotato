Have you actually checked to see if the IPs you send from are on any blacklists?<p>I just checked the last 5 spams I reported to SES, and every single one is blacklisted:<p>54.240.8.60\n54.240.48.100\n76.223.180.15\n54.240.27.34\n54.240.27.45<p>I gave up reporting spams to them because they don&#x27;t do anything about it. I kept getting spams from the exact same SES spammer. I think that explains why SES are so shit...they don&#x27;t bother actioning spam reports, which means they end up on blacklists.<p>I just use my own server for sending emails (the same server I host my SaaS on). If I did want to use an email server, it would be one that has a zero tolerance policy towards spam.')
