NDs harbor a nitrogen-vacancy enabling them to emit fluorescence when illuminated [9,45,46]<p>Basically you design your nano diamonds to bind to a virus, antibody or bacteria and then using imaging you can identify the presence of them in your sample.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how you ensure your sample is &quot;clean&quot; as in doesn&#x27;t have non-bound NDs I&#x27;m not sure but that&#x27;s the gist of it from what i gather.')
