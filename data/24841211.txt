Consider a1=&quot;\\xC3\\xA4&quot;, a2=&quot;\\x61\\xCC\\x88&quot;, a3=&quot;\\xE0\\x83\\xA4&quot;. Assuming you&#x27;re using a1 as your canonical representation of &quot;Ã¤&quot;, there&#x27;s no legitimate difference between a2 and a3 despite the former being &#x27;valid&#x27; UTF-8 and the latter not. (There are decent reasons why you might use a2 as your canonical representation instead, whereas the reasons for using a3 are satyrically flimsy (ironically they&#x27;d better support using a4=&quot;\\xF0\\x80\\x83\\xA4&quot;), but that would just leave no legitimate difference between <i>a1</i> and a3.)')
