There are many usually sweet recipes that are actually great when done savoury instead. I personally like it when the last thing I made in the pan was something that had onion and then I gotta make pancakes, precisely because the first pancake will have that flavor. Then I put chorizo and cheese on it too and call it a day. Next pancake will be &#x27;normal&#x27; again anyway. Win-Win!')
