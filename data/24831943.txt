You mention that it isn&#x27;t an &quot;absolute reputation system&quot; -- that makes sense. I&#x27;d like to know more about that because I think I&#x27;m misunderstanding the proposal.<p>I understand that it isn&#x27;t a single dimension (like HN or Reddit karma) -- it seems your proposal is more or less a &quot;tagging&quot; system, but anonymized so that other users wouldn&#x27;t be able to say, look at my profile and see how other users have tagged me. But other users or operators could apply a filter to exclude comments from users based on those tags? I feel like my understanding must be incomplete because that wouldn&#x27;t be very anonymous -- e.g. if I applied a filter to exclude users tagged with &quot;gopher-enthusiasts&quot;, and suddenly stopped seeing messages from a certain active members of a community I was in, that would &quot;out&quot; those users as &quot;gopher-enthusiasts&quot;. So I assume the system you&#x27;re proposing is more sophisticated than that. Can you clarify?<p>Based on my reading of what was proposed, I&#x27;m particularly concerned about these scenarios:<p>1. Say you have a community centred on the goldfish keeping hobby. It happens to be the largest such community -- many thousands of members. And (to use the example given by OP), suppose a large contingent of moderators (or perhaps even the server operator themselves) are super averse to guns enthusiasts, to the point where they&#x27;ll either ban anyone they learn to be a gun enthusiast, or persistently tarnish any members&#x27; reputation score (for lack of a better word) until they leave, or simply won&#x27;t allow anyone who is also in a gun community to participate (does this reputation system give others insight into what communities I&#x27;m in?). This is problematic because there aren&#x27;t many other goldfish communities worth participating in -- all the experts participate in this one, and as a newcomer to the goldfish keeping hobby, I won&#x27;t get very far &quot;voting with my feet&quot; here. Presumably the overwhelming majority of participants won&#x27;t care or even necessarily notice that guns enthusiasts are &quot;filtered&quot; from the group.<p>Nothing stops this particular scenario from playing out today, but I guess my concern is that the proposed system would make this scenario super easy for operators to implement -- I would be filtered from the group without anyone knowing anything about me other than that maybe I had some association with a gun focused group at some point<p>2. Say you&#x27;re having a mental health crisis, and you end up saying some stuff in a channel with many participants that you regret later. How does that impact your global reputation, and for how long?<p>3. Say you&#x27;re a Marxist and participate in Marxist discussion groups. What kind of metadata will the reputation system generate about you? Is it possible that it&#x27;ll put you on the same filter&#x2F;tag lists as &quot;terrorists&quot; and people who advocate for the overthrow of governments, even if you don&#x27;t personally hold such beliefs?<p>4. (Mostly a rehashing of #3) Say you&#x27;re involved in some (legal, consensual, 18+) fetish community. Are you now globally on a filter list for sexual deviants that will keep you from joining, say, a parenting community?')
