Actual transmission 10-1000ms. Decoding the signal into audio channels for playback 1-5ms. Don’t forget this is duplex. You are transmitting as you are also receiving. In an ideal world we could get very close to zero-latency (enough where an orchestra <i>could</i> by in time step with each other).<p>It sounds do-able. It sounds like we should already be there. Looking around though you’ll see we aren’t because of technical issues described that are systemic of the infrastructure used.')
