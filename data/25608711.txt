She also refused to stop finding employment as a cook, a choice which killed at least three people and probably dozens more. People did not just tolerate her: they <i>died</i> for her right to do as she wished, including her right to work.<p>While there are indeed obvious ethical issues about the incarceration of people like Mallon, and we should have a much better legal framework which isn&#x27;t as intrusive to their rights, the fact is that an inability to enforce social distancing for just this one person caused tallyable fatalities.<p>Like, you don&#x27;t think that the ice-cream licker should have been tolerated despite obvious stupidity, right?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mary_Mallon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mary_Mallon</a>')
