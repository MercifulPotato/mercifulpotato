Let&#x27;s not pretend that there was zero danger to democracy.<p>Do you realize that numerous times throughout history people have <i>successfully</i> killed the actual president and it didn&#x27;t end democracy?<p>What these people did was a serious crime and it should absolutely be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, but no it was never going to destroy the country or end democracy. This is hyperbole people are using to grab and consolidate power.<p>Democracy is not a single person that can be killed and taken over. It&#x27;s all of us acting in concert to uphold those values. It doesn&#x27;t end by this person or that person being killed, it ends by all of us collectively agreeing to give up the values that make it work. That&#x27;s the real threat here.')
