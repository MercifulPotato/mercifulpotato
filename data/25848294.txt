Iirc when they bungled the development of the covid test they had 100x the budget of Germany&#x27;s Robert Koch Institute and probably a similar budget ratio against South Korea CDC. Both of which got on top of developing and deploying tests, including fixes, in a shorter time frame. I dont have a lot of faith in them, I think we should be looking for actually competent leadership abroad')
