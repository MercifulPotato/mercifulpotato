I use light mode everywhere. I like some others have mentioned have astigmatism and I find dark mode only tools much harder to use - to the point that if a code editor only supported dark I would probably not use that editor. I wonder if any that prefer dark have the same issue with light mode only applications, and if so for which is your application usable by a greater number of people, even if it’s not their first preference.')
