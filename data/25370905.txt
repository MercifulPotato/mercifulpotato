Rather, most of the followers never actually read the publications and mostly got into it to feel part of a group as their friends were followers.<p>They&#x27;re typically publications that were never read by either the proponents, nor the detractors who wish to ban it.<p>&gt; Most of the censorship cases i can think of have been religious or conservative groups and in all those cases i thought the call for censorship was misguided. There are situations where I’m ok with censorship. One of them is Islamic terrorist propaganda and fake news.<p>There is very few news that is not fake — the addage of “<i>All news is accurate, except that one article about that one field one happens to be a specialist in.</i>” seldom fails to hit the mark.<p>That you need to specifically single out “Islamic terrorism”, opposed to simply keeping it about “terrorism” as a general concept also betrays a deal of specificity in your view, which is often the problem with censorship — that not all are censored æqual.')
