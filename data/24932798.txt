Item(by='dvtrn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603991951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932736, text='This is exactly why I&#x27;ve gone back to using just one (admittedly, big ass 32&quot;) screen whereas before I had three (one was attached to a separate device where builds occured). I do have one other display, but it&#x27;s stacked high enough up on my vesa pole above %PRIMARY_DISPLAY% so I have to tilt my head up quite a bit to look at it. Note taking app, a small monitoring dashboard, email, and a music player are up there.<p>This means if it&#x27;s not on my main screen, it&#x27;s not on my mind until I make the conscious decision to move something over to it, or I need to drag something off of it. It&#x27;s a behavior I had to force myself to train and become disciplined at.<p>If it needs to come down to the main screen, it should under no circumstances STAY there if I&#x27;m not working on it.<p>Benefits: attention is more intentional and deliberate, I can quickly glance up at something if needed, but I&#x27;m not straining my neck looking up because it&#x27;s happening so infrequently.<p>Intentionality is king.<p>(edit: the only real problem with this particular bit of home office design is my macbook stays shut in a vertical dock, and since I haven&#x27;t really made myself buy an external webcam, there are times I have to unhook things just to bring the Macbook out because there are people who are weirdly hung up about being able to &#x27;see everyone&#x27;s faces&#x27; on Zoom calls just to conduct an outage post mortem, which is annoying--but not annoying enough that it&#x27;s made me want to spend even $20 on an external webcam)')
