It&#x27;s great, but the RAM cost has been too high for me.<p>I&#x27;ve been slightly switching the opposite way, using vim more and more for smaller stuff and opening the IDE only for larger projects or work stretches. I definitely love the value of vim as a nifty tool, my workflow is noticeably faster.<p>As an aside, that cheeky :wq is not missed by me at all, :x all the way!')
