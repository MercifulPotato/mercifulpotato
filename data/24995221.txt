DMCA takedowns are for taking down works you <i>own the copyright to</i>; not for enforcing any arbitrary aspect of legislation.<p>It’s my understanding that service providers do not need to comply with illegal requests.<p>For example, if I DMCA’d &lt;an oil producer&gt;’s repository on accused violations of environmental protection acts, I don’t think it would be taken down, would it?<p>If GitHub was an independent company advocating for open source; would it have acted any different?<p>Note: Microsoft is a member of the RIAA.<p>Apple made waves and built lots of favour for resisting the FBI and challenging quasi-legal processes. They took risks and demonstrated their principles (Suing the FBI over a terrorist’s iPhone is unlikely to be the first recommendation from their legal counsel).<p>This smells like a qausi-legal process, and it would look great for GitHub&#x2F;Microsoft if you do.')
