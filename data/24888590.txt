Item(by='5n', descendants=2, kids=[24889830, 24891073], score=5, time=1603650213, title="Ask HN: I don't use an IDE, should I be using one?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been at my job for about 1.5 years, and I don&#x27;t actually use an IDE. Basically I have tmux with one vim window and 1-3 terminal windows. Whenever I want to see the results of a change, I&#x27;ll just switch to a terminal and either reload in a repl, recompile, or rerun tests. For things like linters and autoformatters I just manually run those things too. If I want to find a definition I&#x27;ll just do some ripgrepping, or search google&#x2F;github if it&#x27;s in non-internal libraries. If I find myself jumping way too much I&#x27;ll generate a tags file.<p>Am I leaving a ton of productivity on the table? Most of my coworkers use something like vscode, or at least hook an lsp server onto their terminal editor. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t feel significantly less productive, and a small handful of coworkers seem to do the same thing. In fact, it feels kind of liberating not having to think about a bunch of tools; when diving into a new part of the codebase I can just start grepping away. I also feel that not having an IDE forces me to build a detailed mental map of the codebase.<p>For reference, I&#x27;m 23 years old, mostly working in C++, Python, and Haskell, and a touch of JS. I imagine I couldn&#x27;t do this for everything, particularly platforms highly integrated with a specific tool like mobile dev, unity, or fpga.')
