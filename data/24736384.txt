I.e. if SQL had the FROM clause before the SELECT clause autocomplete support could be much more intelligent about helping with SELECT columns.<p>Same problem with declaring imports in javascript. Python got it correct, where I write e.g. &#x27;from somemodule import ...&#x27;, so by the time I get to the import the parser has enough info to help with autocomplete. Javascript&#x27;s &#x27;import { Something } from &quot;foo&quot;&#x27; means the parser can&#x27;t help me autocomplete Something.')
