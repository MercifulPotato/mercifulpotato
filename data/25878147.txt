Item(by='pvaldes', descendants=None, kids=[25878580], score=None, time=1611361162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25876377, text='&gt; They&#x27;re not endangered, they are aggressive predators, and Scotland&#x27;s ecology isn&#x27;t obviously in need of them<p>Three falses in a row. First, Eurasian Lynx is so endangered in UK that is in fact locally extinct. You can&#x27;t be more endangered than that. Moreover,  Spanish lynx is still one of the most critically endangered mammals in the planet<p>Aggressive is relative. IMHO, a pack of wild dogs pursuing a zebra for a couple of miles (before to eat it in chunks while alive) is aggressive. Lynx are ambush predators that avoid humans.<p>UK ecology has several problems. One of this is the fever of introducing exotic game species and specially deer. Apart of roe and red are: fallow deer, chinese water deer, asian muntjac and japanese deer. All introduced by hunters. Their populations are increasing and trying to pack as many plant eaters as possible in absence of predators is a very bad idea. To add pressure to the unfortunate trees of Scotland there are also rabbits and zillions of cattle. This is blocking the regeneration of forests, keeping many areas deforested and eroded and severely reducing the populations of many bird species.<p>Must be also noted that deer can be also dangerous for humans and can (and will) stab dogs but, for some reason, pet safety was not seen as a problem in that case.<p>&gt; This is just for tourism<p>Great then, a powerful reason to do it and a win-win for the local people.<p>If hunters were allowed for decades the right to release as many <i>alien</i> species that they liked, it seems a little hypocritical to criticize hotel owners or wildlife photographers for wanting to release <i>native</i> animals that they like also. Either everybody can do it or nobody should do it. All citizens having the same rights and duties is in the basis of a modern society<p>Diversification of economy is always the safest and smartest move. Not everybody must be a farmer.')
