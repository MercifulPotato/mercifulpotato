You know, how my current Yamaha soundbar works.  But I haven&#x27;t for the life of me been able to find any boards that would allow me to add HDMI-CEC into the project.  I did find USB modules that would allow a computer to send CEC commands, but no pre-amp or class-D board that could take CEC input.<p>Building speakers and a soundbar would be pretty fun though.  Been really getting into DIY projects.')
