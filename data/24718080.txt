What I think we are looking for is the amount [melted down for reuse] divided by the amount [properly put into a recycling container].  The first link (EPA) is dividing the [tons of glass recycled] (presumably entering the recycling stream) by the [tons of glass generated] (manufactured).  The second (ACS) says 33% is recycled (as opposed to put into general trash), but also repeats the claim that &quot;90% of glass put into multistream collections gets recycled&quot; (presumably meaning actually remelted).')
