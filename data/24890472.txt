There may be enough demand to at least cushion it.<p>Commercial will definitely be a bloodbath of epic proportions, especially in formerly hot markets.<p>Edit: too early for good stats but here are some cities that seem to be receiving HCOL expats as determined by the highly scientific process of observing anecdotes:<p>Phoenix, Santa Fe, Boise, Denver, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Chicago... I’m sure that list is not exhaustive. Those are just some I have seen.<p>Those vary in terms of how not-HCOL they are but all of them are much less expensive than California, NYC, or the Seattle area. Much better places to live if you don’t have to live somewhere with $500k to $1.5m “starter homes” and other absurdities. Now that we are discovering that we can actually use this Internet thing, good riddance to that madness.')
