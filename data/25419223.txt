It received a lot of attention[1] and invaluable feedback! But a lot of the comments focused on the rendering part, and the data part is much more interesting, in my opinion. The website being a valid JSON with pure data is very powerful. Today, I&#x27;d like to introduce Hyperdata. A simple way to get information from any JSON website. I hope you like it. Your feedback is very welcome.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25352385" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25352385</a>')
