Along with 330, 105, 301, 326, 641, 302, 102, 103, 300, and I just assume a few others, all coming from ESENT.<p>I guess that&#x27;s a question: what would it look like on a Windows 10 system if it had a truly broken ESENT installation? As far as I know ESENT has never directly been a problem. Its log output is just part of the noise that now makes using the Event Viewer a complete waste of time unless one knows precisely when a problem was logged.<p>&gt; Feel free to reply here with your flame. ;-) I can handle it. Really. :)<p>Believe me, if I thought the state of the Event Viewer and its logs were the fault of any one person, I&#x27;d be able to muster some sort of impassioned, vituperative response. I&#x27;m not angry, son, I&#x27;m just <i>so disappointed in you.</i> Ahem.')
