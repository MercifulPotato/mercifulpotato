Item(by='ur-whale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610448850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741443, text='&gt;Contrary to this article&#x27;s claim, the equation describes the behaviour of Helium atoms perfectly well;<p>Yes, I was disappointed to read this as well. I suspect what he meant is that we can&#x27;t derive closed form solutions for the Schrödinger equation in the case of the Helium atom.<p>But the equation can perfectly be integrated numerically ... in these days of rather powerful computers, closed-form solutions to diffeqs aren&#x27;t as important as they used to. As a matter of fact, for most problems in QM, I suspect there&#x27;s just no other way.<p>One step further, when reading QM books, there seem to be a strong tendency to try and assign &quot;physical meaning&quot; to purely mathematical techniques used to find closed form solution to diffeqs (eg separation of variables). I am not convinced that it is a fruitful endeavor.<p>Another reason he may be saying this could also be because with the Schrödinger equation for the Helium atom, assuming it isn&#x27;t separable along space variables, the solution ψ is a map from the configuration space, (i.e. ℝ6) to ℂ, something that&#x27;s hard and annoying to visualize, whereas for the Hydrogen atom, you can draw pretty orbital probability density pictures in ℝ3, something everyone can &quot;understand&quot;.')
