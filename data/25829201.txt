Maybe not if you&#x27;re a software-only company. But for pretty much every hardware (a gadget, a car, a rocket, whatever), the software is part of it and it aint working until the software is.<p>If you don&#x27;t want your product to be held shipping because the software isn&#x27;t ready, you better have some way of estimating when it&#x27;s going to get done so you can either trade features, personell, or even just knowing that there&#x27;s no point rushing the hardware because it&#x27;ll be done way before the code anyway.')
