I barely write any software that uses the package managers libraries, so don&#x27;t get hit by this, but some friends of mine complained about this when using arch, coming from debian&#x2F;ubuntu.<p>Sometimes pacman upgrades also spits out manual commands for you to follow after an upgrade, while I never had that happen on Ubuntu (using it for my laptop), guess that could be a turnoff for some too.')
