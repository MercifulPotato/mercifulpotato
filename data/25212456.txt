I was thinking around the same like you know every company declare annual report every year. So why I don&#x27;t declare a personal annual report(PAR) on all things that I did, likes, expectations that were in the beginning of the year, what was accomplished, learnings, life lessons, things that got cancelled.... If one continues to do this consistently do this there won&#x27;t be many only a few like 35-50 PARs per person depending life expectancy but would be a great collection. The questions in your site can really help my stuff, I hope I can start on this idea.')
