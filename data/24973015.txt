You can get email with that, and install a bunch of applications to replace a lot of the services like photo sharing. Of course the downside is you have to maintain some of it yourself (but you can get an auto-updating Wordpress installation for sharing photos), and you don&#x27;t get as much connectivity because you have to promote it yourself.<p>The advantage is that you don&#x27;t need to worry about Google&#x27;s whims to shut things down or change policies or whatever. Also typically with your own domain, you get more control over your email. For example, with cPanel you can program in a filter to permanently delete emails you don&#x27;t want instead of sending them to the trash.')
