This means, we agree to help you start on OSS and have something which is meaninful for us listed.\n- A browsable list of projects which opted in. So you can look for projects to contribute.\n- It will look something more like GSoC.\n- What I think it would be great is if maintainers are willing to mentor newcomers so they are able to help more in the future, not only on a given october timeframe.')
