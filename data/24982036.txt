After spending time in SE Asia, where bandwidth is cheap and plentiful (in the cities), it&#x27;s painful coming back to Europe (and Australia). I&#x27;m in Berlin atm, and the wifi is shit, bandwidth is expensive and unreliable. And the phone plans suck. I was in Perth (Australia) before that, and access there is terrible.<p>In  Cambodia, 120Gb (per week) of download cost me US$1 (per week) over good-quality 4G connections anywhere in the city (but almost nothing outside the cities). In Berlin, it&#x27;s 40 euros a month for 5Gb, and coverage is a bit patchy, and very patchy if I go a few Km&#x27;s out of the city.<p>In Bali, a $5 SIM card got me a month of effectively-unlimited download over decent connections. Nepal, Malaysia, all good. Phillipines was tricky to get decent coverage, but when it was there it was cheap.<p>Cafes in SE Asia offer free wifi with a coffee. Berlin nope.<p>I get the price differences are a function of relative GDP. But the performance differences should be the other way around. Tech should work better in developed countries, not worse.')
