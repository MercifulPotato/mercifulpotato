Yet, one of the points of criticism against flatpak is that it doesn&#x27;t protect the users home directory.<p>Now, it&#x27;s certainly debatable if flatpak could or should push more in that direction, like apple did when they introduced the sandbox for app store applications, but flatpak certainly does not have leverage to the same extend as apple has. So it&#x27;s up to the app to opt in to a suitable sandbox set. It&#x27;s a sad state of affairs, but I don&#x27;t see a viable path for the flatpak folks to change that.')
