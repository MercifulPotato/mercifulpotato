With the Surface X, that isn&#x27;t remotely the case. It&#x27;s a pretty major gap.<p>This is from the Verge&#x27;s review of the Surface Pro X:<p>&gt; The worst part is that even if an app installs, it doesn’t mean you’re going to have a great experience. Photoshop installs and opens just fine on the Surface Pro X, but the usability of it is terrible. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;6&#x2F;20950487&#x2F;microsoft-surface-pro-x-7-review-comparison-specs-photos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;6&#x2F;20950487&#x2F;microsoft-surfac...</a><p>Maybe it&#x27;s improved since then? Everything I&#x27;ve heard suggests there is a pretty big performance penalty running x86 code on Windows ARM. If there is a significant performance hit on the M1, the performance gains of the M1 are so good, it erases the difference.<p>The only way an emulation layer works is if the new platform is fast enough to erase that difference. When Apple moved from PowerPC to x86, it nearly did. With this transition, Apple knocked it out of the park. Microsoft? Not so much.')
