They could be sued over any comment that appears for any amount of time. There are definitely comments that have appeared on HN that are libelous.<p>Moreover even if they pre-screened every comment before it was posted with a team of lawyers who never make any mistakes, they&#x27;d STILL have to worry about defending against frivolous lawsuits. Would it even be possible to buy liability insurance for a forum in this world? It would cost a fortune.<p>And this is for a site that has the resources to have full time moderators. Smaller sites are even worse off.<p>I don&#x27;t see how anyone could practically operate any forum or discussion board or comments section that allowed people to post messages in real time.<p><i>&gt;Even the internet was around for decades prior to Section 230.</i><p>Sure and sometimes your ISP got successfully sued because someone didn&#x27;t like a comment posted on a message board they hosted.')
