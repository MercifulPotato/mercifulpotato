They&#x27;re technically more correct but not always the practical best choice.<p>RabbitMQ is a smart play as Rabbit is very easy to use, understand, and troubleshoot at the low end (which is where I suspect the vast majority of queue systems live).<p>It also has a feature which is actually really hard to do (and sqs doesn&#x27;t do). Guaranteed delivery of a message <i>once</i>.<p>That was THE reason we never migrated to SQS, there are scenarios where SQS can double deliver. Our codebase was built up from nothing over time and couldn&#x27;t gracefully handle double delivery of messages in all scenarios. We could have refactored, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the work when we were already doing a half billion in revenue without getting even close to the limitations of rabbit AND were close to selling (which we ultimately did).<p>AWS is great at selling multiple slight variations of the same product. If you look you can usually find ONE variation that works for you. The real test will be if the billing isn&#x27;t garbage (garbage billing is why we didn&#x27;t use their other AMQP service and part of the reason why we don&#x27;t use things like EKS or Managed SFTP despite having the need).')
