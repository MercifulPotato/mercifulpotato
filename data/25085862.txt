I used to get sick constantly, had low energy and snored at night. A few years ago got serious, started weight training(was running but weights made a huge difference), also cut out all the junk in my diet(snacking now healthy, more water). I was never obese, but just carried a good amount of weight, The results have been dramatic.<p>I no longer snore, and have ample energy throughout the day. And I have been getting sick alot less now. Other things that I found to be interesting is I now have a very good sense of smell, I can now smell very faint things my Wife cannot. Also I always had a terrible balance and that has changed dramatically as well for the better.<p>If there is one thing that was life changing for me, it is losing all the weight, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough for everyone.')
