This was a while ago, but there was a Perl script where you could write a kind of psuedo code and it would convert it into the Java syntax, so we could look at the math behind it in a clear way.<p>&gt;Does rust buy much for HFT?<p>Going from C++ to Rust is low priority.  It may not ever be finished.  That low of a priority.  It&#x27;s more about refreshing the code base.<p>One thing that surprised me is Rust can be faster than C++ at certain tasks.<p>The big benefit is if you have a new dev coming on and they try to modify something that would introduce a bug, the compiler is all over it.  Currently acceptance tests are all over it and work fine and C++ can be pretty strict so it works, but Rust is more ideal for this.')
