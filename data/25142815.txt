Especially if it accepts money from Facebook, because there&#x27;s a power imbalance no matter how much paperwork you have saying &quot;thou shalt not get anything from thy donation.&quot;<p>If you want a great example of how corporate involvement corrupts - look at Firefox, which has been caught not only with its hand in the Collecting User Data cookie jar, but inserted software for the makers of a TV show (Mr. Robot) and software nobody asked for, with no way to disable it (Paper, I think it was&#x2F;is called?)<p>Not only did they get caught with their hand in the Collecting User Data cookie jar, but when someone brought it to the public&#x27;s attention via the bugtracker, the bug was locked almost immediately by a mozilla employee.
