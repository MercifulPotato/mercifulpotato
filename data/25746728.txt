To be a Facebook employee is a conscious choice.<p>yes, but loosing a lot of benefits.<p>&gt; should you avoid working at companies that are a net negative, or should you stay there to try to improve them?<p>Thats two questions. And it&#x27;s been on my mind for about a year now. I was bought out. The tech we make could be a brilliant tool for mankind, or if deployed incorrectly, commoditised stasi&#x2F;KGB&#x2F;Chinese secret police as a service. I don&#x27;t want it to be the latter. If I leave there will be less voices of dissent.<p>FB is a whipping boy. There are things that it should rightly be criticised for: not adhering to its own ToS for celebrities. Not enforcing age restrictions for instagram, not having enough diversity in its India operation. Myanmar.<p>The difference between FB and the rest of SV is that FB has an utterly utterly shit PR team, who sits apart from the company. They love sniffing their own farts. (for example I only found out how many small companies advertise on FB when I joined. yet they reference this heavily only once, and expect a single full page advert to win people over.)<p>Let us not forget that whilst FB is a data dustpan and brush, Google, Amazon, Apple, and your ISP are data hoovers. most of FB&#x27;s data is collected willingly. The stuff your phone snitches on you every minute is extra ordinary. Amazon is literally selling a live feed of your front door to the police.<p>I don&#x27;t seek to admonish Facebook of its failings. They should be fucking hauled through the shit. But, we should also start to look at other companies, especially with the rise of AR.')
