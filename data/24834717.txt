Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=[24842193], score=None, time=1603178917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834221, text='If the IP&#x27;s do not match to these two-word domains in the forward and reverse DNS direction, my mail server will turf the connection.<p>Hypothesis: thus, my valid e-mail address will be declared invalid.<p>Experimental result: Experian fucking lies!<p>I tried two addresses, a valid one and invalid. Their user interface claims that it was not able to determine the status because &quot;[t]he request timed out due to the host domain not responding in time&quot;.<p>This is complete horseshit.<p>Both requests resulted in a prompt access to my mail server and a swift and clear SMTP rejection. Nothing timed out.<p>This one was rejected because the IP address is listed by Spamhaus:<p><pre><code>  2020-10-20 00:22:00 H=emv31.eistnesieu.com [64.17.42.224] F=&lt;double-bounce@emv31.eistnesieu.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThis one was rejected by a rule of my own, &quot;too many digits in domain name&quot;:<p><pre><code>  2020-10-20 00:23:16 H=smtp104.bordurecultures.com [192.121.0.117] F=&lt;double-bounce@smtp104.BordureCultures.com&gt;\n</code></pre>\nHiding the fact that their probe attempt was rejected due to looking like spam, by claiming that the request timed out, is egregiously dishonest. They are insinuating that they <i>could</i> validate an address in my domain, if only my domain would respond on time, covering up the fact that it did, and no they could not.')
