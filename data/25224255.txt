I&#x27;m starting to see the particles lie on something like a deforming 4D shell that maintains it&#x27;s volume in 6 dimensions.<p>Edit (further description of the 4D shell under the Liouville theorem):<p>When the plasma has large spatial volume, the momentum of particles at any point creates a 1D line forming an empty 4D shell. When all particles enter the 1D spatial focus the particle velocities there are essentially random and have large variation in all 3 spatial dimensions. Essentially a 4D sphere with only 1 dimension in space.<p>The result is a morphing 4D shell that collapses all particles into a focus with 0 volume once per period.')
