It was later found that the ambulance operator was using devices that hadn&#x27;t been cleared by the FDA yet.  Although they came from a Turkish &quot;medical device&quot; company, they were not cleared for use in the US and left my friend with brain damage and PTSD.<p>I don&#x27;t care that the hardware involved in your project was &quot;made be a medical company&quot;, it&#x27;s not hardened tech.  Also, rust is by no means hardened - look into &quot;provably complete&quot; languages if you want to see what a true &quot;hardened&quot; lang is.  There&#x27;s a reason why medical devices and serious &quot;hardened&quot; tech (military or otherwise) is validated and cost tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.  It&#x27;s because teams of engineers spent weeks or years coming up with every possible problem or failure pattern.<p>To be frank, I&#x27;d rather pay a nurse $50k in cash to pump a vent bag next to me than rely on your &quot;project&quot;.')
