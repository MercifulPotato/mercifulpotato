The 2013 Taper Tantrum is an example of this potential dynamic, although the wider financial stability implications of that episode were limited. The potential risk here is that unexpected increases in rates negatively affect the balance sheets of financial institutions in such a way that leads to financial instability. Banks without adequate capital buffers could face solvency issues, while pension funds and insurance companies could\nexperience liquidity problems related to losses on\nderivatives positions or increases in early liquidations.\nAdditionally, with valuations in both equity and credit\nmarkets relatively high by historical standards and\nlikely to become further stretched in a low-for-long\nenvironment, the risk of a sharp correction becomes\nmore likely, especially in conjunction with high levels of\nleverage or excessive reliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding. Even small changes to expectations of far-in-the-future cash flow may have a disproportionate effect on current valuations when interest rates are low. As a result, such rate changes can lead to sharp adjustments in valuations. The potential negative effects that an unexpected increase in rates would have across\na variety of market participants make this longer-term\nrisk worth monitoring. Adequate guidance on the timing\nand pace of any such policy-related increase will likely\nreduce this risk.&quot;<p>The 2013 Taper Tantrum refers to the 2013 collective reactionary panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields, after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the breaks on its quantitative easing (QE) program.
