Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=[25237332], score=None, time=1606560463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235808, text='That&#x27;s very interesting, I didn&#x27;t know there&#x27;s a country already where fossil heating is rare. In the Netherlands we&#x27;re trying to get houses off of gas for years and have pretty much no results. Nobody wants to pay much more for heating (operationally) nor for a renovation to change the entire heating system to something electric in every household. Municipal heating is also not coming off the ground, and afaik most that do are burning stuff to create the heat. Frankly it almost seems hard to believe that it&#x27;s rare to heat with fossil fuel anywhere in the EU after hearing all the aspects of all the problems with making it happen in our relatively mild climate, let alone in the colder north.<p>Where can I read more about how you guys managed to switch everyone to heat pumps? Or is hydro power cheap enough that you can just create heat rather than pump it around? Because that would make it a simple &quot;replace 1 device&quot; transition from heating water with gas to heating water with electricity. And for burning garbage, do you filter the CO2 at the exhaust or how is that green? (I don&#x27;t know much about garbage burning or what kind of pollution does&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t come from it.)')
