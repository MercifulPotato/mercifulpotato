The cause of the problem had to be a computer in the first place. For human data sources, even back in the 60s we had machines fast enough to tally the census, balance checkbooks, or book flights.<p>So yeah, Dan had a problem of unimaginable scope in the 80s but also the problem is kind of fake? “Help, my computers are spitting out too many numbers and I can’t graph them all!”<p>I feel like Dan was on to something here but also something in the article didn’t quite line up.')
