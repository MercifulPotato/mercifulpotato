You are assigned a random identifier that is actually publicly available. So if I vote and give you my identifier to prove how I voted, you have no way of verifying if I am giving you my actual receipt or just some other receipt from the publicly accessible register of voters. The only way to truly validate the vote would be to match the receipt id with the internally held ballot that has your pii on it.')
