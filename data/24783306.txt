Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602720828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783003, text='&gt; The ban is a political act and not a scientific one.<p>It is a public health act and a moral act, and therefore both scientific and political. These considerations don&#x27;t take place in a vacuum of Free Speech Patriots versus Social Media Authoritarians. YouTube&#x27;s decision has to be considered alongside the widespread consensus among doctors and public health officials that social media disinformation about COVID-19 has killed tens of thousands of people worldwide, in a pandemic that has killed over 1,000,000 people in less than a year.<p>And let&#x27;s be absolutely clear: the reason why YouTube&#x27;s actions are so politically controversial is that unscrupulous politicians like Trump and Bolsorano have deliberately politicized misinformation about COVID-19. It is not YouTube&#x27;s fault that &quot;should we listen to scientists about COVID-19?&quot; has become a partisan issue.<p>Also: &quot;Section 230&quot; concerns are irrelevant here (and irrelevant in most cases of social media &quot;censorship&quot;). Section 230 specifically allows content providers a great deal of latitude in blocking material they deem &quot;objectionable,&quot; including constitutionally-protected speech. YouTube is well within their rights to make reasonable determinations about what constitutes COVID-19 misinformation, and to ban such materials.<p>YouTube blocks pornography with nary a peep from free speech activists. This is because a &quot;free speech&quot; argument is transparently absurd: YouTube is a business and not the government, and is allowed to regulate the data it keeps on its servers for business reasons. Yet the idea that YouTube might regulate for reasons of ethics or public health <i>in the middle of the worst pandemic in 100 years</i> is apparently the slippery slope of censorship.')
