A woman is under arrest for trying to grab what she thought was her phone back from a black kid. It&#x27;s a national story.<p>In 2020, getting into an argument with a Black person is &#x27;racist&#x27; and &#x27;criminal&#x27; if you happen to be wrong.<p>The woman did 1=2, in that, her actions are wrong.<p>But because someone is a different colour, she&#x27;s being destroyed and doxxed on the MSM for the <i>assumption</i> of racism. (Ironically, she could easily pass as a &#x27;person of colour&#x27; if she chose to).<p>This is unfortunately a problem right now in politics and it&#x27;s perpetuated by the press.')
