Even on a Linux PC, I would feel &quot;dirty&quot; with games and steam installed, and I can&#x27;t afford a PC exclusively for gaming. A PS4 costs 300â‚¬ and runs Skyrim, so I am quite happy. I am also speculating that the PS4 will become completely owned by the community and ultimately runs Linux without anything missing.')
