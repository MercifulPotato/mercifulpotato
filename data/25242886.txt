The doctor stimulated one spot and the patient suddenly laughed. The doctor asked &quot;why did you laugh just then?&quot; and the patient replied &quot;well, you all just look so funny standing around in your doctor outfits!&quot;.<p>It was the best explanation the brain could come up with for the laughter, the closest thing to &quot;funny&quot; or &quot;things that might explain my laughter&quot; in that moment. But the guess was completely wrong, even though the patient felt certain it was the truth.')
