Lightning burns it down.<p>False example. The owner of a warehouse (clearly what you mean even though you fail to specify) would in general not have been held liable for the value of others&#x27; goods that were lost. As no less than Rothbard pointed out, contracts alone could have excluded that liability, with no need for a corporate structure. Or the owner and&#x2F;or investors could have purchased insurance, which <i>also</i> predates corporate structure by centuries. The introduction of a new legal entity, which has since been expanded to be equal (or superior to) natural persons under law, was unnecessary to secure the benefits of investment.<p>&gt; Before limited liability, unlimited liability was the norm. If a merchant invested some of his profits in a ship, and the ship sank, then those with cargo on the ship could sue the merchant for all the merchant was worth, far surpassing the value the cargo was worth.<p>You just happened to pick an example that has been used to show why the corporate form was unnecessary.<p>&quot;The corporate form emerged from economic arrangements that mirrored the concept of limited liability offered by modern corporations. One such arrangement was the commenda, a system developed in Eleventh Century Italy ... This arrangement allowed the passive partner to limit his or her liability of their investment&quot;\nRobert W. Hillman, Limited Liability in Historical Perspective<p>People were already investing, without corporations, in the <i>eleventh century</i>. As I said before, your claim was untrue.<p>&gt; If I&#x27;m possibly liable for $1,000,000, I&#x27;m not likely to ever invest that $100.<p>That&#x27;s why you would write a limitation into any contracts related to that investment, and&#x2F;or buy insurance. Either could be overridden by acts of gross negligence (an illegal clause in a contract is void and insurance contracts have similar exceptions). If you&#x27;re negligent or malicious, or authorize others to be negligent or malicious on your behalf, you damn well <i>should</i> be liable for a proportional share of damages which could exceed the value of investments. Hint: don&#x27;t do things that harm other people and you&#x27;ll have nothing to worry about. Did you look up &quot;moral hazard&quot; yet?')
