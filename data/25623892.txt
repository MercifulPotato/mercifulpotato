The energy industry is a tiny part of that.<p>We should definitely try and reduce the amount of embodied CO2 in wind turbines.  But it is hardly a differentiating factor when comparing nuclear and wind.  Both are fantastic in terms of co2 when compared to the fossil fuels they are replacing.  We only talk about embodied co2 because the other emissions are \nso non-existent!<p>Emissions from concrete are a problem which needs to be addressed separately to energy production.  Other industries need to do their bit and provide alternatives.')
