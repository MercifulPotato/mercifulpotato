These companies still care a bit about emails and customer reviews. This is why cancel culture gets away with it because they mass email them to take down and de-platform people. Here&#x27;s an email template. You can modify it as needed and send it.<p>I sent it to these two emails WHICH ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THEIR SITE so I am not doxxing:<p>product-security@apple.com<p>tcook@apple.com<p>----------- TEMPLATE:<p>I wasn&#x27;t able to find a specific place to send this feedback so using this email. Please forward to the relevant department.<p>I am a brown immigrant to Canada. I usually don&#x27;t mention my race but it seems relevant in this topic. I as well as my family own several Apple products including iPhones, MacBooks, Mac Minis etc. Several of us and my friends are also developers for the App Store. I am deeply disappointed in Apple threatening censorship and banning of apps which don&#x27;t align with Apple staff&#x27;s views. I understand calls to violence are unacceptable but Apple banning apps like Parler just for political speech which isn&#x27;t violence is deeply disappointing.<p>I am not sure if you are aware but apps like Twitter, Reddit have and allow porn, illegal porn, and regularly calls to violence. Twitter allows violent terrorists like Antifa, Iranian dictator who calls for assassination and violence to stay on their platform but has banned a democratically elected President just because they disagree with him. Facebook has banned WalkAway group - founded by a gay man, with 500000 members consisting of ex-liberals who have left the democrat party. These members were mainly gays, blacks, brown, hispanics, women etc who have now been banned by Facebook. How can Apple accept apps like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit which openly allow porn, illegal content etc while banning gays, blacks, hispanics etc simply because they are conservative? And now Apple is threatening banning Parler too?<p>Doesn&#x27;t Apple stand for freedom of expression, stand with gays and PRIDE? Does Apple believe us brown, gays, blacks, hispanics etc aren&#x27;t allowed to have differing view points? This is a deeply disturbing and concerning thing which Apple is doing and essentially pouring gasoline over already polarized population. Apple is forgetting that until a few decades ago, us minorities like blacks, gays, jews etc were threatened with the same censorship. Apple should reflect on this and stop this blatant censorship. Otherwise I along with my friends and family will stop supporting and purchasing Apple products. There would remain no reason for me to support Apple if they have forgotten their own 1984 ad:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I</a><p>Regards,')
