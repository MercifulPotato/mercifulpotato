ITER is anchored to the EU.<p>Anchored, yeah sure. So you&#x27;re listing something that isn&#x27;t in the EU, which is revealing. ITER is entirely irrelevant. It&#x27;s a pork project that won&#x27;t result in much. The biggest breakthroughs in fusion will derive from smaller projects, not giant slow-moving projects like ITER. The next 20-30 years of energy generation is wind, natural gas, oil, solar, some hydrogen and nuclear (and primarily only China is brave enough to build that). Fusion will make zero contribution in that time.<p>&gt; BioNtech made the first breakthrough on a COVID vaccine.<p>Moderna was just as well positioned as BioNtech, you&#x27;re more than reaching. Russia and China also have apparently successful vaccines being deployed.<p>&gt; The EU has many issues, but losing leadership in the sectors you mentioned is not one of them.<p>That&#x27;s true in the sense that the EU never had leadership in most fields to begin with.')
