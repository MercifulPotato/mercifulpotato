I still do it manually but will have an automated solution for that soon. :)<p>There are many other dashboards already out there that are much better than this one! I just wanted to see how fast something like this can be built. I will add more features, widgets ands graphs soon. Also mobile usability is not that great at the moment.<p>Looking forward to your honest feedback.\nThanks,\nJoe')
