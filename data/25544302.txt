Often you can get away with very little math, but if you know math, you may be able to see patterns in the domain you are working in that allows you to come up with a much better and more elegant solution than you would otherwise. Or you can attack problems that the people around you consider too hard or go beyond the standard library used in your domain.<p>Then, if you don&#x27;t know the math that applies, you may never even see the opportunity, and be convinced that math does not applies to what you do, and that you never needed it in the first place.<p>And often, it makes you the most natural person to work on the most interesting and challenging problems.')
