Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=[25313045, 25308148], score=None, time=1607094017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302611, text='&gt; UUIDs are 128 bits; thatâ€™s large enough that you can reasonably assume in most fields that no collisions will occur.<p>I&#x27;d go a step further than that honestly. Even at 80 bits I&#x27;d say you can really be sure that it will never happen. Mind that 2^64 is quite large, and with every single +1 of that power you <i>halve</i> the chance. Anything above 80 bits is quite safe even when someone purposefully <i>tries</i> to find your input, let alone by random chance. The 128 bits includes a decent security margin.<p>Plain MD5 is pretty much the fastest thing you can find. A decent GPU can do 25GH&#x2F;s on that. If you can have a $1 000 000 hardware budget, it takes you 150 years to have a 50&#x2F;50 chance of cracking a 2^80 secret with Hashcat. (Ballpark numbers: can be off by an order of magnitude, but not &lt;10 years for that budget if you use today&#x27;s hardware and today&#x27;s hashcat.)<p>We haven&#x27;t even cracked the 3DES key used for Adobe&#x27;s user database backup, which I&#x27;m sure a lot of people would be interested in. Not $1M interested maybe, but still.<p>2^128 is really gigantic and no collision will ever occur there unless you have a quantum computer. It&#x27;s more than a &quot;reasonable assumption in most fields&quot;.<p>Of course, I agree that 2^64 is too small to just generate a token and assume it&#x27;s unique without checking if it exists. I&#x27;m just trying to prevent someone from assuming that we need 512-bit hashing or something and creating crypto soup (as a security dude, this happens all too often).')
