Better watch anonymously so you can always clean the cookies and get out of the pit.<p>When you sign in,  you can view your history and remove things you don&#x27;t want the algo to work on.<p>Here&#x27;s what to do instead: Sign in, and use your account to curate what you want to see. As you say, music, education, and for me, it&#x27;s cookingtube, some non-toxic video game people for sim games and the like, etc.<p>And my algo recommendations are wonderful. The biggest issue is it forgetting about cool channels and hiding them, and I don&#x27;t use the bell because I hate notifications, but generally speaking it does a great job.<p>But if you want to watch something that you DO NOT want the algo matching on: Open a private tab (or clean out your history).<p>It&#x27;s actually not bad to keep it under control.<p>Oh, and when Youtube drops a redpill propaganda video in, or something similar, (it always will try to indoctrinate you into a radical ideology, no matter what), make sure to use the menu and tell it to fuck off and never show it again.<p>I&#x27;ve got it trained now. No politics! No radicalism! Just good, relaxing, well-made content.')
