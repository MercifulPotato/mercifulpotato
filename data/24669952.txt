There were some genuine good parts, but most of it felt too hyped because the explanations were too flavorful and simplistic, or taken too far. It felt like I was watching The Secret or Zeitgeist.<p>&gt; Rather than offer a nuanced look at technology, it gives a distorted view of how social media platforms work to create a convenient scapegoat for what are difficult and complex societal problems.<p>This sentence lacks the nuance that they criticize. While I think it&#x27;s a fair position to state it gives a distorted view (due to simplification, for example), that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re creating (or intending to) create a convenient scapegoat.<p>&gt; The film’s creators do not include insights from those currently working at the companies or any experts that take a different view to the narrative put forward by the film.<p>Well current employees have a lot to lose in being honest, if they disagree. And the documentary <i>did</i> have experts that had a different view that <i>was</i> actually telling a different story than the narrative. I was actually on the lookout for it, because I was upset with the simplistic cookie cutter bullshit it was feeding us.<p>---- Reacting to the points ----<p>1. They say they&#x27;re making efforts to make responsible use possible. The issue with this is, we can&#x27;t check this. So reputation and trust is all we can go on. So I&#x27;m putting this in the neutral category.<p>2.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t sell your information to anyone.<p>Wasn&#x27;t Cambridge Analytica a thing? If so, then I don&#x27;t care if you sell or don&#x27;t sell, info gets out there. It feels disingenious to put that sentence in there as a response to &quot;you are not the product&quot;.<p>I agree that the mantra is nonsensical &quot;you are the product&quot;. Uhuh, right, because it&#x27;s short and sweet it must be true? Nonsense, all explanations that I&#x27;ve ever read that were true never devolved to mantra-like statements. IMO it&#x27;s a &quot;code smell&quot; that something is off.<p>...<p>I&#x27;ll stop here, this is getting way too long.<p>Long story short: Facebook is being questionable here at best, despite that I agree in general with them that The Social Dilemma is nonsense.<p>The incentives here are all warped :&#x2F;')
