And most sites with it i&#x27;ve seen look like they want to sell me some service and feel faceless and soulless. I&#x27;ve considered at some point setting up my own instance for my own use since from what i can understand you can configure to &#x27;fetch&#x27; messages from other instances, but (at least at the time) the system requirements for what is essentially passing around tiny snippets of text are so high that it is ridiculous. Then i thought perhaps a desktop client would provide the same functionality but the joinmastodon site has a bunch of them without any information about what they are, who makes them, if they&#x27;re safe or whatever and the sites of a couple that i checked are again that &quot;faceless, souless, perhaps trying to sell you something or sell your data to someone&quot; variety.<p>So i lost interest.')
