Two texts that absolutely opened the game up to me were The Grinders Manual (fundamentals) and The Mathematics of Poker (where your stats&#x2F;math background will be useful). The way I started was by dedicating 2 hours per day (1 hour studying, one hour playing online micro stakes). Next I will start learning and memorizing output from Solvers, that seems to be key to success at higher levels. Good luck on your journey if you get into it!')
