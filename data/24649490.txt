But this is the kind of thing that you <i>would</i> use if it were in the standard headers, but maybe not create (or modify, if it already exists) a work_around_cxx_deficiencies.h in the project and make sure it&#x27;s included everywhere. Or maybe it&#x27;s already included in some misc_utils.h in the project but is not easily discoverable, since such &quot;misc utils&quot; headers are always a grab-bag of random unrelated stuff. Whatever the reason, in the C++ projects I worked on we always ended up using the iterator version. We certainly would have used the non-iterator version if it had been available from the standard headers.')
