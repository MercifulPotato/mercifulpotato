Just because other people think you work too hard or because they judge you for being too nerdy or w&#x2F;e the case might be.  Who cares (of course <i>they</i> do but... thats a reflection of them), If you want to code in your break then code in your break, and own it.  Let them go around taking shrooms or playing world of warcraft, or watch netflix.  That&#x27;s fun for them, you do you.  And if anyone asks why you dont know what its like to be on acid then just press ignore&#x2F;delete and move on. They have no right to condescend because they like shrooming-off more than you do.')
