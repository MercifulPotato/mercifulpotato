The founders aren’t responsible for what Facebook, Inc has done for it.<p>You can try to attach a bunch of clauses to try and imprint your legacy, but at the end of the day if you sell your stake you sell your stake. You aren’t in the room anymore.<p>And if you aren’t in the room, you aren’t responsible, either. I can’t help if someone buys my car and crashes into a telephone pole.  I didn’t cause that damage to the world by selling my car. Maybe, I could have found a more qualified driver if I accepted less payment for it! Or, my interested buyer upon seeing my clauses and restrictions might say “thanks but no thanks, no longer interested.”')
