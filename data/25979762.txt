The problem is that updating the agreements would be a 3 way negotiation with the UK who has all the leverage. Due to current political divide between EU and UK, the EU doesn&#x27;t want to enter this negotiation, not that I think it would easy. It would probably be political suicide for the UK government to publically reduce domestic vaccine delivery unless EU offered some incredible incentives.<p>The EU knows this and is instead paining AZ as the bad guy.')
