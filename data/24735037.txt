They will be able to start iterating right now. The technology is far more real, understood, and far more developed than SME fission, much less fusion.<p>I would say that direct air capture of CO2 is about 2x as likely to be economically efficient and a significant part of the economy than SMR fission. And fusion is only at pie-in-the-sky stage, the level of materials development that would need to happen is practically unimaginable. We have no idea that it would ever be cheaper than fission, for example.')
