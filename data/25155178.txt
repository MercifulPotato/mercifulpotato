Maybe it&#x27;s just different audiences but the spam was eventually so bad I moved multiple communities off of forums that we&#x27;d used for years and years- and got at least an hour a day of free time back in return.<p>In my experience spam is easily the biggest contributor to the death of forums, most groups just don&#x27;t have the resources to keep their heads above water.<p>I see people complain on platforms like Reddit or Discord about one or two spam messages getting through, I don&#x27;t think they realize how good they have it.  A channel I follow on YouTube just got a single spam comment which one of his followers responded to, and he made a 3 minute video about it.<p>Can you imagine making a 3 minute video every time a spammer registered for your forums?')
