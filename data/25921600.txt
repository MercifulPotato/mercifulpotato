Item(by='Noos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611698777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25911866, text='I&#x27;m not sure if he can do much.<p>Gamestop has the same problem that drove other retailers like suncoast, sam goody, strawberries, and many other ones out of business; you cannot survive the digitalization of your primary products.<p>Gamestop relies on console systems and videogames both new and used to make the core of its primary business. These are what draw people into their locations and to their web site, and allow add on sales like memberships, warranties, collectibles, and accessories to be sold. They generally go to malls, either interior or open.<p>The problem is the decrease in physical games over digital kills the primary reason to go into their stores, and also prevents middlemen from existing; there is no value add to getting a digital code from gamestop as opposed to steam, ps store, etc. It also murders the high value used game and console sales because now there is less product to trade in.<p>That just leaves them with collectibles, which they&#x27;ve always been low quality and too expensive, accessories, and a tiny assortment of physical games that now they barely even have stock of. They &quot;advertise&quot; the top 100 games or so in their store, yet don&#x27;t have stock of many of them ,and their used games are barely a shelf of them.<p>The problem with being an internet retailer is amazon already does what they do better; it&#x27;s an uphill battle where they have no real value add. Even Amazon seems to have less and less new physical games, and they have an infinite amount of chinese sellers dramatically lowering the price of game accessories.<p>I don&#x27;t see any way to be bullish on them because of their actual business.<p>edit: its not just them. There&#x27;s a regional game store chain where I live, and they suffer the exact same problems. They are desperately trying to carry anything and everything geek related just to fill the store with inventory; records, collectible card games, comics, manga, crt tvs, used movies, anime accessories, model kits, etc. They actually are losing the game store focus, as used product even in the retro market is dead now...very few retro systems and games.')
