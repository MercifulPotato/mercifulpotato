Not sure if all of these applicants realize what they are getting into in regards day&#x2F;night time in the summer and winter.  At least in the summer you can put up black out shades to keep the light out but winter is another thing all together!<p>(sunrise today was 9:25 am and sunset is at 3:18pm, 5:53 hours of daylight but in june 28 it is 3:58am to 10:48pm, 18:51 hours of daylight)')
