As long as the automatic update has a &#x27;downgrade&#x27; option that&#x27;s tenable but most of the solutions out there make downgrading difficult.<p>I prefer automatic updates that are presented to the user for action, sadly feature update&#x2F;release notes are often hidden or content-free (cf. Google&#x27;s apps&#x27; updates on the Play Store) and downgrading path varies heavily with OS (easy on Linux, impossible on iOS).')
