It does exactly what I need without issue and has worked reliably<p>USB1 and USB2 still work fine despite being less than ideal engineering. Tolerances are big enough at lower speeds. USB3 can be unreliable (e.g. for cameras) because limits set by the laws of physics get too close for cheap implementations. That&#x27;s no longer good. Especially if we are forced to use that in professional set-ups, where a couple of cents or even Euros&#x2F;dollars would not harm. The problem is now that you cannot put that tiny bit of money on the table and you get a reliable product. As the discussion showed even certified and known brands&#x27; USB3 products can be unreliable.')
