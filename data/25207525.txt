There are very few opportunities for non-English speakers, either educationally or economically. Normal speech has turned into a crass pidgin of English and the local vernacular; schooling has turned &#x27;English-medium&#x27; entirely, thus creating a generation of idiots, fluent neither in English nor in their own native languages.<p>The Indian state being essentially the same as the colonial British Raj, will never tolerate empowering the natives of India, even if political cronies have and will continue to give it a sense of legitimacy by appealing to ethno-religio-linguistic rabble rousing.<p>See,\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sankrant.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-english-class-system-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sankrant.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-english-class-system-2&#x2F;</a>')
