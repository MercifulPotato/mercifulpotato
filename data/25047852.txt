They may even be angry after you inform them because they lose plausible deniability.<p>I&#x27;ve also been in situations where an ultimatum like E2E encryption is dictated by a marketing team and then expected to be created without adequate budgeting or time, essentially creating pressures on development teams, project&#x2F;product managers, etc to lie.<p>The conclusion I&#x27;ve come to in business is that ultimately, your product or service is going to be falsely advertised and oversold one way or another. It&#x27;s a lot easier for some to lie, act deceitful, and&#x2F;or feign ignorance than it is to actually deliver. Your competitors are doing it, if you don&#x27;t, you lose.<p>The way I deal with this nonsense is that I make it a point at least once in meeting or fairly tracable record like an email that others know what is and isn&#x27;t true once and it&#x27;s up to them to decide who they want to lie to. I&#x27;ve been on the other side being pressured to lie and its not fun so I&#x27;ll happily pass that responsibility. I didn&#x27;t pursue a career in computing to be a constant liar, I&#x27;ll let the people who want to lie, lie.')
