Taxes, healthcare, abortion, gun rights, military spending, education spending, etc.  Arguing in favor of low taxes, eliminating funding for public healthcare, banning abortion, etc. will not get you de-platformed.<p>What gets you removed is racism, bigotry, and inciting violence.  Of course, nobody thinks they&#x27;re racist.  Even Neo-Nazi Richard Spencer denies being racist.')
