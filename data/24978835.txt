It msy be under our current structure, but its not hard to stop<p>Here are 3 rules that would stop lobbying overnight.<p>1- Make house of reps sole body to set tax law at federal lvl\n2- tie reps in house to very specific, low pop counts.  For ex, 1 rep district = 25,000. This would mean house would become gigantic. \n3- randomize election outcomes. Swap winner of city treasurer with senate winner. Swap rep seat with state assemblyman. Every seat should have a high random chance of being swapped. If winner does not like position. We should even do this with presidency.<p>This solves federal level lobbying by taking (1) power into a (2) decentralized body and also (3) inserting downside for lobbyist.')
