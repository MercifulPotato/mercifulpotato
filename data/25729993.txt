The core logic doesn&#x27;t really care as such, as long as it could determine EU membership somehow, but actual code would have to use a DB lookup[1].<p>That of course spirals back to what would that really buy you. You&#x27;d write code pretending it&#x27;s pure while it really isn&#x27;t. I can see part of the appeal, but I can do that in my current language.<p>Of course I don&#x27;t get an error if I do something silly in the middle of some otherwise &quot;pure&quot; module, so there&#x27;s that.<p>Anyway, illuminating. I enjoy thinking about these things and challenging my self-taught ways. Thank you all for your contributions, much appreciated!<p>[1]: An aside but, due to an error on the government side, GB is part of EU today as far as <i>one</i> of their validation checks is concerned. So today only we have to pretend along, for just that one field. This stuff is fun!')
