By &#x27;work hard&#x27; you can only mean &#x27;performing hours of tedious unthinking labour&#x27; if you&#x27;re saying &#x27;flipping burgers&#x27; is relevant and necessary to &#x27;working hard&#x27;. The qualities just don&#x27;t seem to match up for a job that requires real, rigorous, logical thinking, except for selecting out anyone incapable of the bare minimum effort to sort of just survive in the workplace. That&#x27;s fair, but doesn&#x27;t really map to what I commonly see which is a lot of wasted potential being consumed by menial labour because &#x27;just doing it&#x27; is seen as more important than developing genuinely useful new approaches.')
