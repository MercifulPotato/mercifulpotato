This mower came with the property I bought this summer. You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find something less maintained than this mower. It was missing both exhaust bolts where the exhaust connects to the manifold. I had some left over &quot;make-a-gasket&quot; material so I used that and some old machine screws that I had available. Seriously, half of the exhaust was just banging around, exhaust leak city with it coming straight out of the manifold.')
