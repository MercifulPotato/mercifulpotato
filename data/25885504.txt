All those 30-year bonds issued at the start of the Reagan revolution matured and were paid off, no one seemed to notice, and none of the rhetoric seems to have changed at all.<p>This just isn&#x27;t a problem in the modern economy.  Interest rates have been sitting at or very near GDP growth for four decades now, which means that money is as close to &quot;free&quot; as it is possible to get (that is, if the US borrows $4 and spends it, it sees a $4 increase in GDP).<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that serious argument about sustainable spending can&#x27;t be made in good faith, but it does mean that almost all arguments of the form &quot;we can&#x27;t afford it&quot; are not.  This is triply so if the argument includes a credit card metaphor.')
