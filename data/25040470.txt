They will either deliver to my address or deliver to the nearest store where I can pick it up in person without having to pay delivery fees.<p>For my needs, Walmart is the place that has the solutions that most matter to me. I almost never use Amazon.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand why people order so much from it and then bemoan its dominance.
