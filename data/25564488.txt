[...] hoarding (by today&#x27;s standards).</i><p>You have an interesting argument - by the same reasoning, when one has eventually filled up a 12 TB HDD, it would no longer be hoarding by tomorrow&#x27;s standard. In other words, at this point, one should be able to get the next generation of HDDs for cheap, and it&#x27;s this fact that makes all tape drives unnecessary.<p>Now I wonder whether it was a mistake for me to buy a spare 14 TB HDD to 1:1 mirror my new file server for cold backup. Perhaps a smaller one should be good for 5 years anyway...')
