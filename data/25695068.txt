NYT and WaPo have hundreds of journalists, so the average would be in the tens of thousands.<p>This doesn&#x27;t follow. Just as an example, Maggie Haberman (an NYT reporter) has more than 1.6 million twitter followers, around 2x Tim&#x27;s and more than he has subs on any of his channels.<p>(More broadly, there are a number of junior reporters who don&#x27;t have big followings at the NYT and other conventional institutions, but there are also a number of very well known journalists who have large followings for their specific content).')
