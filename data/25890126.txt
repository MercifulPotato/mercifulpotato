The data acquisition system was made on a tiny budget and most of the code is python 2.5.2.  It hasn’t been touched in 12 years.  We’re stuck with Windows 7 running on some machines because there are no Python 2.5 libraries that support NI-DAQmx and NI does not have any Traditional NI DAQ releases in windows 10.  Obviously good solutions involve porting to linux and airgapping the DAQ, but the simplest solution I like is updating the codebase.  I’m one engineer with loads of other responsibilities.  Python is popular with scientists.  I don’t begrudge the scientists.  I begrudge the awful decision by the python developers to disregard backwards compatibility.')
