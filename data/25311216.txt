The whole selling point of floats is that they&#x27;re a fast approximation to real arithmetic in a bunch of useful cases. I&#x27;d personally be much more miffed by an excessively slow implementation of a transcendental than one which was off even by a large number of bits. If there&#x27;s a fast solution with better precision then that&#x27;s great, but low precision by itself doesn&#x27;t strike me as particularly problematic.<p>&gt; Why should anyone use double precision if that&#x27;s the kind of slop an implementation can have?<p>Because by using float64 instead of float32 you can cheaply get a ton more precision even with sloppy algorithms. If there&#x27;s only 16ish bits of slop you could probably get a full-precision float32 operation just by using an intermediate cast to float64 (proof needed for the algorithm in question of course).')
