If they did, the numbers would be horrifying. But since they have a young population, herd immunity was reached. (Serology tests show over 50% of india had covid, and the case stats show a classic epidemical curve)<p>Same goes for Russia btw, theres no 50+ males for covid to kill as they die to alcohol abuse. So they peaked at &quot;only&quot; 600 deaths &#x2F; day.')
