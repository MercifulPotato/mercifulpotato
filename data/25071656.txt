I am really interested in this space because I have a long build collection of mp3s and I&#x27;m not as interested in yielding to Spotify but I&#x27;m not always at the same computer or building for the accessibility.<p>Thus far I&#x27;ve been using mStream <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mstream.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mstream.io&#x2F;</a> with decent success. You can federate collections with your friends. My tries with NFS or SSHFS doesn&#x27;t work reliably on windows&#x2F;mobile hosts, especially across the (mobile) internet.<p>I know there is at least a few other projects in this space, some mentioned in the comments (Ampache.)')
