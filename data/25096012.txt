IMO it emphasises two salient points, size on the wire and centralised control. The first is laudable but in my mind is taken too far because of the second. A decentralised distributed system requires ease of discovery and a decoupling of server and client.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of the many reasons to build distributed systems, not least of all the ability to distribute engineering effort, and so can see that if team distribution  is a primary motivator for creating a micro service system that there would be a desire to make it appear like it&#x27;s actually all one process. Of course it isn&#x27;t one process but I can see the desire.')
