Whatever you want to call it—deep learning, multilayer nnets, whatever—it’s the same thing and results are exciting. Also, I believe that there is a difference between deep learning and multilayer nnets (though I can&#x27;t quite articulate it), but throwing in things like “singularity” is a bit much as it’s not really related at all to the math results being presented.')
