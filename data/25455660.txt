I&#x27;m no expert at making comics, but it&#x27;s something I occasionally enjoy, and I wanted to see if I could make a tool to make it easier on myself, specifically the step where I&#x27;m ready to make straight, uniformly-margined, custom panels. This is the result, and I hope you have as much fun with it as I have been. You can make panel shapes with any number of corners, snap to the grid to ensure uniform margins, snap to guide lines to go beyond the grid while maintaining alignment, save&#x2F;load your work directly to&#x2F;from svg for multiple sittings, adjust page dimensions, stroke etc. with just the scrollbar, etc.<p>If you end up using this to make something, I would love to see your work! I&#x27;m @andrewulrich on Twitter - feel free to reach out and share. Also feedback and code contributions are welcome:')
