It&#x27;s pushing a viewpoint.<p>Well it does imply that the person referenced is being callous towards the concerns of the property owners, which is why I asked the question. I&#x27;m not sure what viewpoint you think I&#x27;m pushing. I&#x27;m wondering how someone can be so dismissive of the concerns of a homeowner regarding the government depriving them of their home in a place they chose to live. They picked that house and that place for a variety of reasons then invested their time, their life, their families, and their money in that community. Then some bureaucrat says &quot;we need this for &lt;aquaducts&gt;, get out or die. Here&#x27;s a check.&quot; Its one thing to exercise your best judgment and believe that when the public interest is balanced against the private interest, this is the greater good. But when someone callously disregards the interest of the homeowner in the home and community they have chosen to be part of, it raises serious questions about whether their interests are actually being balanced fairly. When someone is casually dismissive of a person&#x27;s interest in continuing to own the home that they chose to buy and live in, one wonders if they are even considering the homeowner as a person and not an obstacle.<p>&gt; By definition? I call BS.<p>Yes, <i>by definition</i> market value is the amount that must be paid to achieve a voluntary transaction on the market. Eminent domain <i>forces</i> a person out <i>under threat of violence</i> and pays an amount that <i>the forcing party</i> deems to be acceptable. If they were offering fair market value, <i>by definition</i>, they wouldn&#x27;t have to threaten violence.<p>&gt; In fact, the Constitution requires &quot;just compensation&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m confident you understand that the constitution is a document and does not compel obedience to its words. Furthermore &quot;just compensation&quot; implies the question &quot;just according to whom?&quot; Its not a synonym for &quot;market value.&quot;<p>&gt; Nice whine.<p>So when I used a technical term correctly, you whined. Now I break it down into it technical components in a purely descriptive sense, so I&#x27;m not expecting you to know the meanings of technical terms, and you say I&#x27;m whining. What am I to make of this?<p>&gt; But in fact the government does have the right to do that, and for quite good reasons.<p>Referring back to the question that started this discussion, when people are so callous about the manner in which government exercises its powers, it calls into questions whether those reasons are in fact very good.<p>Minor quibble: governments have <i>powers</i>, people have <i>rights</i>.<p>&gt; And, if they make the tunnel, they&#x27;re going to have to take different peoples&#x27; houses.<p>Asserts facts not in evidence. The point of the tunnel is to go underneath extant structures.<p>&gt; On that point, I agree with you at least some of the time.<p>glad to see I&#x27;m making my point.')
