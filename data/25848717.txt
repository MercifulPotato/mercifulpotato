It looked like a continuous line of light slowly moving across a section of the sky; really an amazing sight.<p>Unfortunately I live in an area with a decent amount of light pollution, and haven&#x27;t been able to catch a glimpse of any of the more recent trains. (Might have something to do with the dark coating they&#x27;re putting on the newer satellites to reduce reflectivity.)<p>For those who want to give it a try, this site gives a list of optimal viewing times, complete with an animation of where and when the satellites will appear in the sky at your location: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;james.darpinian.com&#x2F;satellites&#x2F;?special=starlink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;james.darpinian.com&#x2F;satellites&#x2F;?special=starlink</a>')
