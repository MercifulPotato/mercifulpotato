The US department of energy did a study on it awhile ago, but sadly the page was scrubbed a few years ago.<p>Fortunately, it was archived:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170910060455&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wipp.energy.gov&#x2F;picsprog&#x2F;articles&#x2F;wipp%20exhibit%20message%20to%2012,000%20a_d.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170910060455&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wipp.e...</a><p>Some interesting excerpts:<p>&gt;We decided against simple &quot;Keep Out&quot; messages with scary faces. Museums and private collections abound with such guardian figures removed from burial sites. These earlier warning messages did not work because the intruder knew that the burial goods were valuable.<p>&gt;Note our use of irregular geometries and denial of craftsmanship. None of our designs uses any of the regular or &quot;ideal&quot; geometric forms, and only crude craftsmanship is sought, except for the precision of engraved messages. Why? the geometry of ideal forms, like squares and cubes, circles and spheres, triangles and pyramids is a fundamental human invention, a seeking of perfection in an imperfect world. Historically, people have used these ideal forms in places that embody their aspirations and ideals. In our designs, there is much irregularity both of forms and in their locations and directions, yet done by people with obvious knowledge of pure geometry. This shows as understanding of the ideal, but at the same time a deliberate shunning of it...suggesting we do not value this place, that it is not one that embodies our ideals.<p>&gt;In short, to ensure the probability of success, the WIPP marker undertaking will have to be one of the greatest public works ventures in history.<p>&gt;...it is largely a self-correcting process if anyone intrudes without appropriate precautions, and it seems unlikely that intrusion on such buried waste would lead to large-scale disasters. An analysis of the likely number of deaths over 10,000 years due to inadvertent intrusion should be conducted. This cost should be weighted against that of the marker system.')
