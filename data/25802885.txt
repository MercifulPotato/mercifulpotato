They still happen though: myocardium tumors shouldn&#x27;t happen, but hey, rhabdomyoma. In that case, it&#x27;s more likely in youth &#x2F; congenital, because it had to happen via inherited defect rather than one that accrued through cell replication in your lifetime. It is rare, though, and ridiculously rare in adults. Still, &quot;on a long enough timeline...&quot;. I mean geeze, let a guy get a tiny bit poetic.<p>Other cells don&#x27;t have DNA and don&#x27;t reproduce, so they shouldn&#x27;t be eligible (red blood cells.) They still fall into a grey area though: the RBC itself will be dead soon enough and never leave behind cancerous progeny. On the other hand, your bone marrow can absolutely lose its mind and pump out the equivalent of a red blood cell mass, a condition known as polycythemia. You can also have RBCs turn cancerous before they become fully mature and shed their DNA. The erythroblast stage - the late stage of RBC development, the last stage before it chucks its nucleus and becomes disposable - can develop into a leukemia.<p>Our reproductive system generally keeps its genetic payload cells in stasis for the lifetime, so it doesn&#x27;t accrue replication errors, as well as sitting behind a protective wall (e.g., the Blood-Testis Barrier) similar to the one that protects the brain. Even in stasis, though, damage accrues - the age of the parent has a direct impact on the likelihood of various congenital disorders.')
