Additionally the Google competitors in the EU are so small that nobody really cares if those laws do impacts them as well...<p>Android is probably the only exception indeed but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s nearly enough of leverage to counter the current trend.<p>The issue is that Google optimized profit so much in the EU that they even get rid of their leverage there. I do think they are right to fight against those laws (and I&#x27;m also personally against them) but let&#x27;s be fair, at this point nobody cares what Google says in the EU. There&#x27;s an idea in the EU that impacting Google&#x27;s business won&#x27;t impact in any ways the local economy and that&#x27;s hard to prove them wrong with the way Google is setup.')
