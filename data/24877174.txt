Futhermore, the official node docker images come with yarn pre-installed, and there appears to be no way to bundle in a specific npm version in source control, like you can with `yarn policies set-version` (v1). That has worked wonders for us. Before yarn we used to have problems with developers using different versions of npm on their machines&#x2F;build agents, and .nvmrc&#x2F;&quot;engines&quot; doesn&#x27;t help you there other than being an &quot;error gate&quot;. The yarn executable acting like a shim delegating to the checked-in version is brilliant for versioning (especially CI).')
