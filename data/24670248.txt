He designed his living room spesifically for <i>having guests.</i> So instead of the living room being in front of a telly, there are two big sofas facing each other accross a lounge table. Behind the seating arrangement is a Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo with a turntable and a shelf containing records. But that&#x27;s not all. To top it off, the ceiling skews down towards elongated windows placed so that you only get a good view of the sound they&#x27;re facing by sitting down. This arrangement gives guests a great view, great music, and great company. They also have a TV room, but it&#x27;s tucked away in a much smaller, purpose built room, so that the guests get the full attention when they visit, and not the TV.')
