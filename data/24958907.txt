However, Hardt&#x27;s own FAQ says:<p>&gt; &quot;The hyperloop is a good alternative to short-distance flights and links up seamlessly with existing modes of transport.&quot;<p>To estimate what &quot;short-distance&quot; means, the Hardt site promotes Amsterdam-Paris. That&#x27;s about 250 miles, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gcmap.com&#x2F;dist?P=AMS-CDG" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gcmap.com&#x2F;dist?P=AMS-CDG</a> .<p>A NY&#x2F;SF trip in 4 hours @ 600 mph = 2,400 miles. the great circle distance is 2,574 miles - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gcmap.com&#x2F;dist?P=SFO-NYC" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gcmap.com&#x2F;dist?P=SFO-NYC</a> - so the author&#x27;s times can only be reached with a non-stop, dedicated track between those two cities.<p>Which is an unrealistic waste of money as it would be a national tax that only really benefits NYC and SF, and not the nation.<p>The author writes:<p>&gt; Under FDRâ€™s leadership, the federal government pulled the United States out of the Great Depression, in part, by funding ambitious public works projects, like building our vast interstate highway system.<p>The interstate highway system was <i>Eisenhower</i> not FDR. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Franklin_D._Roosevelt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Franklin_D._Roosevelt</a> points out that FDR&#x27;s expanded the &quot;Reconstruction Finance Corporation, making it a major source of financing for <i>railroads</i>&quot;.<p>It looks like the article contains bad math, bad monetary policy, and bad history. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good way to promote hyperloops.')
