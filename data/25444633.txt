It&#x27;s not about the &#x27;fish industry&#x27; it&#x27;s about weighting the interests of the tire industry against the life in the Puget sound ecosystem.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildsalmoncenter.org&#x2F;why-protect-salmon&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildsalmoncenter.org&#x2F;why-protect-salmon&#x2F;</a><p>&gt;Few animals have been as central to the Pacific human experience as salmon. Their annual migrations are a miracle of nature. They feed us and their presence tells us that our rivers are still healthy. From grizzly bears to orca whales, at least 137 different species depend on the marine-rich nutrients that wild salmon provide<p>&gt;Salmon and freshwater ecosystems are inextricably linked by feedbacks between salmon runs, food webs, and riparian forests. Salmon runs function as enormous pumps that push vast amounts of marine nutrients from the ocean to the headwaters of otherwise low productivity rivers. For example, sockeye salmon runs in southwest Alaska contribute up to 170 tons of phosphorous per year to Lake Illiamna. These nutrients are incorporated into food webs in rivers and surrounding landscapes by a host of over 50 species of mammals, birds, and fish that forage on salmon eggs, juveniles, and adults in freshwater. Predators, such as brown bears, disperse these marine nutrients into surrounding forests, enhancing the growth of stream-side trees that shade and protect stream banks from excessive erosion')
