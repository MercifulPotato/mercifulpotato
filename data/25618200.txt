Let&#x27;s take the main character, Wang.<p>Oh, I see! Sorry then :)<p>I agree that most of the characters in all three books are a little ...flat. But that&#x27;s also part of what I say above, that the characters don&#x27;t have to have &quot;depth&quot; for the story to move forward, and the story is often the main concern of authors who haven&#x27;t had a particular kind of training in how to write.<p>&gt;&gt; Thank for taking the effort of writing the lines about the Illiad and the Odyssey. I&#x27;ve never read them, but I think I would enjoy a oral performance like they were given when the story was initially crafted.<p>That&#x27;d be really something. I wonder if there&#x27;s any performance like that somewhere.')
