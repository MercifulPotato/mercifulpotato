For instance .nz (New Zealand) originally only allowed people to register 3rd level domains ( like company.co.nz or network.net.nz ).<p>This changed in 2015 and you can now register 2lds like company.nz or network.nz but AWS still hasn&#x27;t updated their system. It means my employer has to have a 2nd registrar just for those domains. Nagging our TAM and asking other companies to do the same has had no effect.<p>Note that AWS use Ghandi.net for .nz registration (and many&#x2F;most other TLS) and Ghandi <i>do</i> support .nz 2lds')
