If the result you want is maximizing the value of dollars then: Bad Fed! Very very bad!<p>2) given that this hasn&#x27;t collapsed the value of the dollar, why haven&#x27;t they done this earlier and given the money to our government to spend on infrastructure ? Clearly we&#x27;re still in the zone where more loans make the economy go smoother.')
