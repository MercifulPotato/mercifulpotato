They&#x27;re not survivalists or militia folk or anything like that.  They just like to maximize their privacy.<p>The keys to survival appear to be: Generate your own power (so you aren&#x27;t beholden to a utility company), have a well drilled for water, have a boss who will cash your paycheck for you on payday, and live near a town where paying by cash isn&#x27;t considered strange.<p>They still pay taxes, though, so they can&#x27;t be totally anonymous.<p>One goes a step farther.  He builds his own motorcycles to get around.  According to him, the law in his state says that if your conveyance is home-built to a certain percentage (51%, maybe?), then you don&#x27;t have to register it with the state.  I have no idea if that&#x27;s true, but to my knowledge he hasn&#x27;t had any trouble with it in the 20 years I&#x27;ve known him.')
