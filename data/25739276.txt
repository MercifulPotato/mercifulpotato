It&#x27;s not that you have a space, you just want to express what the composition looks like. But by doing it in this way, the description is happening inline within a larger context.<p>Here&#x27;s an analogy to illustrate what I mean: Imagine you were writing a story, but every time you wanted to mention a character, you instead had to describe how they looked, inline in the middle of the sentence. This is kinda the same thing.<p>&gt; Semantically, it feels weird to me sometimes<p>If we&#x27;re talking about semantics in the way that people used to talk about semantic web, neither the space nor the image have semantic value. The vanilla version might be:<p><pre><code>    &lt;button class=&quot;back button&quot;&gt;Go back home&lt;&#x2F;button&gt;\n</code></pre>\nTranslating that to React might look like this:<p><pre><code>    &lt;BackButton&gt;Go back home&lt;&#x2F;BackButton&gt;\n</code></pre>\nwhere `BackButton` is a specialization of `LinkButton` that uses CSS to add the icon (or not, if, for example, the mobile version doesn&#x27;t have the real estate for it)')
