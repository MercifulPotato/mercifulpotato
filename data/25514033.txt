Where I live it&#x27;s illegal to bring an un-neutered dog to the dog park, but some people do. When that happens I don&#x27;t make a fuss about it, but I do leave the dog park early. So when I&#x27;m asking an owner of their dog is neutered it&#x27;s not because I am pushing some bad societal norm, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m trying to prevent a preventable incident.')
