It does all of the above (including a Feature Store, notebooks as jobs, airflow for ML pipelines, model serving (TensorFlowServing, Flask, and soon KFserving), experiments, a project-based multi-tenancy model that supports sensitive data on a shared cluster, and a UI. It does not have a labelling system - but you can pip install libraries. You don&#x27;t need to learn Docker -  each project has a conda environment, and we compile Docker images for projects transparently, so jobs are tied to Docker images, but you don&#x27;t need to write a Dockerfile (this is a huge win for data scientists). You can run Python jobs (connect to a k8s cluster) or Spark&#x2F;Flink jobs (on Hopsworks itself).<p>Open-source:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;logicalclocks&#x2F;hopsworks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;logicalclocks&#x2F;hopsworks</a><p>Managed platform on AWS&#x2F;Azure (with elastic compute&#x2F;storage, integration with managed K8s, LDAP&#x2F;AD):<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hopsworks.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hopsworks.ai</a>')
