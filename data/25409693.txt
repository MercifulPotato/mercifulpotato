Normally folks would outsource that type of work to consultants, but Google was big enough that it needed 2 of us full-time.<p>We helped the CEO and SVPs figure out how much to pay the company&#x27;s top ~100. That meant we were hands on with performance bonuses, equity packages, hiring negotiations, promotions, and more.<p>The coolest part about it was getting to frequently join Laszlo Bock (head of People Ops at the time) when he met face-to-face with the CEO (first Eric, then Larry) and the SVPs to discuss all of the above. It got to the point where they all began to recognize me, which was pretty darn cool as a 20-something-year-old.<p>A byproduct of all that exposure was that I ended up being privy to a huge chunk of the &quot;corporate drama&quot; taking place in the upper ranks. It&#x27;s been 7 years since I left, but as I&#x27;m sure you can understand, getting into details is probably a bit of a no-no :)')
