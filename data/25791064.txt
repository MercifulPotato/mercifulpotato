But they should be switched off. Once they are switched on, the cells will stop cooperating with the rest of the tissue and start acting &quot;selfishly&quot;, at others&#x27; expense.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5474827&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5474827&#x2F;</a><p>This is known as &quot;atavistic theory of cancer&quot; and it is rather controversial, there are people who utterly hate it, not least because the original authors are not specialists in cancer treatment.<p>Part of this theory is that cancer cells &quot;cannot help but switch to the previous single-celled metabolism, very inefficient compared to ours&quot;.')
