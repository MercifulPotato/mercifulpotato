It&#x27;s easy to gloss over details and edge cases when talking through an algorithm and it&#x27;s not apparent until you actually write the code. Similar things happen when discussing things in meetings vs writing a formal document. I&#x27;ve interviewed plenty of people that were able to quickly come up with algorithms to solve a problem but really struggled to translate them into code.')
