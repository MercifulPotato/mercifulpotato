KA tends to trend more towards the lecture side of that spectrum, other sites tend to be too cute. (This is kids from 8-13 giving this feedback.)<p>2) They dislike the UX. They don&#x27;t phrase it that way, but they just don&#x27;t like how they have to interact with questions, videos, etc.<p>3) Math on KA, specifically, only has one way to teach each topic - if you don&#x27;t get it, you are out of luck. This is where a tutor would absolutely help.')
