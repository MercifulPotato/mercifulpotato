In many major cities, it&#x27;s hard to get a legit job if you don&#x27;t have a car, because you can&#x27;t get to work reliably.  Folks who live in poverty and don&#x27;t have access to legit work will do <i>something</i> to make money, and crimes ensue.<p>Bikes might not be a great solution in these areas -- they&#x27;re easy to steal and somewhat unreliable due to weather and other factors.  And, if somebody already feels that they&#x27;re taking a risk hiring a poor person... is it going to help if they&#x27;re showing up sweaty?  Perceptions matter on both sides of the equation -- I won&#x27;t apply for a job if I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d last a week.<p>Rather than focus on the impact of cars, which is a bit of a &quot;boil the ocean&quot; solution, it would be directly impactful to fund a local restauranteur.  It makes local jobs, and makes the neighborhood more livable and walkable.<p>If I had a billion dollars, I&#x27;d do an incubator for small, local businesses focused on sustainability,  not disruption.')
