Stuff like speed of light and ability to disperse heat have a tremendous influence on how computation can and is done, and how we design software systems.<p>Then there are laws entropy and complexity, math laws &amp; cryptography, social laws (how do people cooperate), game theory, economic laws and legal laws. And bunch of other stuff that I forgot about now. All greatly limiting &#x2F; shaping the way we can create software at scale.<p>Software engineering is one of the most (if not the most) complex forms of engineering out there. A lot of people don&#x27;t realize it, since they routinely work with tiny parts of the whole picture. Writing a typical REST API backend, or making a RPi blink an LED is like civic engineer building a popsicle stick bridge. Sure it&#x27;s fun, but that&#x27;s not &quot;the whole field&quot;.')
