If you discount self-driving (and I do), then there are clearly other manufacturers who know perfectly well how to produce an EV.  I own both a Tesla and a Bolt, and neither is a clear winner over the other.  They each have ups &amp; downs, but in any case GM produced a perfectly good EV.  And Ford&#x27;s Mach-E appears to be an improvement on Tesla&#x27;s Model Y.  The game is on, and the big boys seem to know the rules.')
