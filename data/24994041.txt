During that time I have had long periods with extensive, frequent social interaction and bonding. My depression encompasses most of the time I&#x27;ve known my now-wife, repairing a broken relationship with my father, the acquisition of one new close friend, and the coming and going of many transient relationships.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the cure for my own case of depression is, and I&#x27;m sure if I were isolated&#x2F;disconnected my condition would be worse, but the evidence available to me indicates that simply connecting with people is not what&#x27;s going to fix me.<p>My wife and mother-in-law are both counselors, and routinely successfully treat people with depression. They have never indicated that level of social connection is either a dominant cause or reliable treatment for depression.<p>If you want something to read up on, a very popular treatment methodology for depression is CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). The premise is that depression is often caused by harmful thought patterns about yourself or your life, and CBT trains you to arrest those thoughts and replace them with thoughts that are constructive or more accurate (less exaggerated, etc.). It&#x27;s not the treatment I need, but it works for an awful lot of people, and its solution isn&#x27;t built around social connections (though it may reveal social connections as a problem in individual cases).')
