Especially given 9 people died in BLM protests last year.<p>Regarding this incident Zuckerberg didn&#x27;t ban him at the time because he said that Bannon didn&#x27;t even violate his sites policy in regards to how many times you have to say things like this before getting banned.  He reacted with a removal of the video.  Zuckerberg was correct and for all the hate leveled against him he seems to be one of the only people who is resisting political pressure and fighting to enforce policy fairly and unarbitrarily.<p>An extremely broad amount of people will once or twice say something like this regardless of political affliation and the banning of Bannon here is mostly a mixture of hindsight and bias and arbitrariness.  Bannon wasn&#x27;t banned today based on an equally applied sober reading of social media policy, but because the capitol riots happened.  Trumps supporters messed up a building and got themselves killed and that&#x27;s being used as a pretence to treat other Trump supporters arbitrarily online for the greater good because they&#x27;re just too dangerous.')
