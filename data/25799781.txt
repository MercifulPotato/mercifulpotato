Some feedback:<p>* I might be worried about businesses using this as an actual metric of developer productivity, rather than as just a fun game.<p>* the readme.md in the linux tarball is pretty useless, since it just contains instructions for building the CLI from source.<p>* the first time setup flow (where you run .&#x2F;karma and the site knows it instantly) is slick as hell, I&#x27;m blown away!<p>* I can&#x27;t use arrow keys to navigate or edit in the &quot;any comment?&quot; prompt, but I guess it&#x27;s supposed to be short anyway!')
