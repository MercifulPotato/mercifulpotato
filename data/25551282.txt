I have tried contacting twitter   to tell them that there is a vulnerability or weakness that is allowing hackers to hijack twitter accounts with ease. Reporting the accounts does not nothing and too many of them. I suggested to twitter that there is a problem with rate limiting on twitter&#x27;s end, which could be fixed by better rate-limiting or improved hashing of the passwords. This is not a hard problem to fix yet twitter seem to be unable to do anything about it.  Obviously,  someone is finding an easy way to hack into twitter accounts. Twitter does not see this as a problem even after the 2020 Twitter Hack.')
