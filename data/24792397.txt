I&#x27;ve made it a point now to call up some of my team members at least once a week for no purpose other than to have a venting session.<p>I don&#x27;t think I ever realized how much of this venting must have subtly happened in person, but since COVID I think most of it gets bottled up and people get very frustrated when they can&#x27;t casually talk through these issues in person. My team has collectively agreed that these &quot;venting calls&quot; are great if only for the reason that they make you aware that you&#x27;re not the only one with frustrations, and I think that really helps morale.')
