It&#x27;s used in Japanese passports, road signs, railway signs, all major newspapers, JNTO (the tourism org), most textbooks, etc etc.<p>In second place, particularly in informal contexts, is wapuro (word processor&#x2F;computer&#x2F;mobile phone) romaji.  &quot;jya&quot; for じゃ is neither Hepburn, Kunreishiki nor Nipponshiki, but it&#x27;s probably how the average Japanese would write the romaji for that if asked to.<p>Legit Kunrei&#x2F;Nipponshiki, despite its notional official status, is dead: nobody writes Japan&#x27;s tallest mountain as &quot;Huzi&quot;.')
