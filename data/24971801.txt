Which is the stage you get your $100K &#x2F; 1% of your Investment. In the 10x example, let say $1M, you should start asking for discount. And it could range anywhere from 20% to much higher. Compared to OVH which is already offering at a very low price. The price stays the same at scale.<p>Amazon are also going full steam ahead with their own ARM instances, and those offering are 20% cheaper listed already. And in many cases they even perform better per vCore than Intel. On x86 instances vCore is a Thread, while on ARM instances vCore is an actual Core. ( Assuming your Apps works with ARM. )<p>Network quality - OVH, DO, Linode, none of them are any where near as good as AWS in terms of Network connection speed, routing and capacity. And this is something you can recreate with other IaaS such as OVH.<p>All this brings AWS to a much lower multiple of OVH. And then you add up all the extra benefits such as easier to hire, Resume Driven Development, Asset vs Lease Tax Break &#x2F; Financial Engineering etc.<p>I really do wish Google and Microsoft brings in more competition though. As the author mentioned he was surprised with no single monopoly. Because the market is growing faster than all of these HyperScaler can handle. Intel has been selling as many Server CPU as they could Fab them.')
