The investigation is because there may well be a competition issue here, where Google is leveraging its dominant position in browser to the benefit of its ad business, removing the ability for its competitors to compete.<p>Google identifies users using Chrome via other means than cookies (Google Signal etc) in a way that no other competitor can or is able to access, and therefore is now pushing to remove the ability for anyone else to do it who doesn&#x27;t control the browser.<p>Guarantee you if Google was forced to stop sharing data from its browser business to its ad business, it would not be pushing to remove cookies.<p>Edit: One final note is that it&#x27;s a shame because there really is an opportunity to create a new alternative to cookies, better suited to the risks posed by modern tracking methods. But Google leading the charge to dictate how you can be tracked should be a huge red flag for you.')
