Item(by='OskarS', descendants=None, kids=[25746019], score=None, time=1610454719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745326, text='&gt;  People are not making up illness for the fun of it. Their ailments are very real and they have a cause.<p>I have absolutely no doubt that their problems are real. I fully believe that these patients are honest and that they really suffer, and they need treatment. I do not believe at all that they are &quot;making it up&quot;.<p>But they don&#x27;t suffer from &quot;chronic Lyme&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s just no evidence that it&#x27;s a real thing. But just like with electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Morgellon&#x27;s disease, &quot;Wind Turbine syndrome&quot;, or any of a legion of &quot;diseases&quot; from medical history, you can&#x27;t treat them medically if there&#x27;s no evidence they exist. It would be malpractice for doctors to prescribe real drugs for fictitious syndromes, and it wouldn&#x27;t do anything to convince their patients either.')
