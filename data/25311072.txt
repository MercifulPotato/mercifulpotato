Programmers who donâ€™t code in their spare time for fun will never become as good as those that do.<p>Not surprised that this would be controversial.<p>&gt; 17. Software development is just a job.<p>A bit disappointed that #17 is controversial in principle, though it is certainly a hobby for some and a religion&#x2F;obsession for others. Maybe what I&#x27;m looking for is &quot;Software development can be just a job and that&#x27;s OK - it doesn&#x27;t have to be an all-consuming passion that devours all of your waking hours, even if your employer or boss thinks it should be. People with varied interests can be better developers than people who have few interests outside of software development or computing technology. Most software applications depend on expertise outside of software development, often knowledge in a specific application domain (such as science, mathematics, engineering, game design, business, or communication) as well as expertise in computer-human interaction or sociotechnical design.&quot;<p>Hopefully that wouldn&#x27;t be particularly controversial, but it probably would be. ;-p')
