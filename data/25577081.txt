There is really nothing in Tesla that sets them apart. Yeah, they made electric cars popular, but other car manufacturers started to catch up and they have immense advantages, like brand lock-in and a long history of adapting and evolving to customer needs. And they were right not to jump into EV too quickly. It&#x27;s a pretty unpredictable, developing market. Tesla got a head start, but at the end, they really have nothing going for them.<p>The stock is gonna crash so hard in a couple of years, I am sure someone will make a movie out of it. I might actually buy a good bunch of options against Tesla, if they reach far enough into the future.')
