In other words, how do I know what models to use or not use? I am surmising from the techblog post that there is a stable set of content-intrinsic features, and that can be separated from perhaps more dynamic features-sets that characterize audiences, presentation treatment, and viewing (as conditioned on all the other stuff). But it sounds like there is a stable set of features for prediction tasks, as well, which is to say that for a task like predicting an audience for movie X in region Y, you&#x27;ll need some set of features, and that we have some set of trained models (and recommend analytic components) available that match some or all of those features for this task. Is that a &quot;thing&quot;, or is the workflow support simpler than that, and should that be a &quot;thing&quot;?')
