Many, many features need to be restricted or put behind feature flags due to either lack of Metal support, or Metal having bizarre restrictions compared to other platforms.  As a random example, border color is limited to 2 or 3 colors for Metal, and has no restrictions at all for anything else.  There are also entire features (like geometry shaders) missing from Metal; for many common usecases you can replicate the functionality with something else, but usually not in a way that easily translates to any of the other APIs (and pretty much nobody on Earth writes games <i>just</i> targeting Macs).<p>Hence, the easiest thing to do for most games is to just drop Mac support and not worry about it.  IMO that&#x27;s the biggest reason by far why people stopped bothering to port new games to Mac; between not updating OpenGL past 4.1 at best and Metal being so idiosyncratic, it&#x27;s just not worth it, and since people have learned gaming on Macs sucks (largely <i>because</i> of the outdated and idiosyncratic APIs), most people who want to play games on a Mac have just been installing Windows anyway.<p>This is all not even to mention that Mac laptops tend to have far too high a resolution for the onboard GPU to perform well for any but the most rudimentary games; hopefully this has been addressed with the M1 batch having a much more powerful GPU.  But the issues with Metal remain and will continue to remain until Apple either fixes Metal to make it a more Vulkan-like target, or adds really good Vulkan support.')
