We&#x27;re all cyborgs already. Irrespective of the actual interfaces we use to fuse ourselves with technology.<p>Take yourself driving somewhere and using navigation that shows where the traffic jams are. At that point you&#x27;ve effectively delegated the decision making for achieving the particular goal to the hive-mind, and you yourself have become a node in the larger network. At that point, &#x27;you&#x27; effectively consist of:<p>1. Your wetware<p>2. The hardware of your car<p>3. The hardware of the device you use for navigation<p>4. The software of the device you use for navigation<p>But it goes further than this. For ages it used to be the case that only the rich and the powerful could afford to elevate themselves to a status of a &#x27;system&#x27;. That is, they would delegate significant parts of their functionality as a whole to other people. From physical defense of their wetware to enhanced decision making capabilities, and possibly even wiping one&#x27;s bottom[0].<p>Lois XIV quote &#x27;I am the state&#x27; is now known to be apocryphal. Yet, it wouldn&#x27;t have actually been very far from the truth. You didn&#x27;t necessarily have to be a king to extend yourself as a social system. But you would have to be rich and powerful.<p>Now we live in a time where for many systemic functions that would&#x27;ve required a bunch of humans just a short while ago, you can find technological solutions that go at least 80% of the way if not more. Well set-up productivity tool systems can substitute large parts of what until recently you needed a personal assistant for, intelligent use of search engines and social media substitutes a bunch of people you would&#x27;ve hired to call other people, and access to trading platforms for better or worse have substituted one&#x27;s broker.<p>And it&#x27;s only a few decades since this has been going on, I don&#x27;t think we have the faintest idea of where this will lead to, but the change will be profound. It already is.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Groom_of_the_Stool" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Groom_of_the_Stool</a>')
