He had the luck to be born to parents that were able to prioritize education over subsistence. So yes, he was lucky.<p>But in your previous comment, you also call Linus&#x27;s <i>choices</i> &quot;luck&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t read fairly to me.<p>He had the luck to make good choices? Maybe in retrospect, but you must acknowledge that there&#x27;s much more than luck involved.<p>Of the tens of thousands of people with enough &quot;luck&quot; to arrive at roughly the same place in 1991 -- by which I mean smart, well-fed, decent academic&#x2F;life schedule with adequate free time, few or manageable commitments like spouses&#x2F;dependent children or parents, broad and deep exposure to Unix, access to USENET and the Internet -- Linus remains exceptional.<p>My closing parenthetical was not a counterpoint to your message. It was to frame my perspective: I don&#x27;t worship, but I do respect.')
