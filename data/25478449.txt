Also ran a solo consultancy for about 4 years in there.<p>Tech stack = Python (mostly for chemistry, currently), R (mostly for computational biology)<p>Recently having fun building web services around open source and proprietary tools + HPC using Python and FastAPI + the usual suspects (pandas, numpy, sklearn, altair, dask)<p>Tons of cool problems with work that can ultimately make a real difference in patients&#x27; lives.<p>Education: BS Biochemistry, PhD Biophysics<p>PS - we&#x27;re in the SF Bay Area and are hiring software engineers &amp; business&#x2F;systems analysts; looking for people at the intersection of code and science.  Reach out if you&#x27;re interested (email in profile, I think, or post here if you can&#x27;t find my contact).')
