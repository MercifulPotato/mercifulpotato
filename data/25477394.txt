A lot of laptops are still configured in single channel mode. Even high-end laptops tend to be dual channel setups, even if the CPU itself supports more. I&#x27;m inclined to say that high-end CPUs configured in 4 (or more) channel are rare enough that you probably shouldn&#x27;t expect to be able to enjoy one unless you&#x27;re developing in-house software where you can know exactly what kind of hardware you&#x27;ll be running on.<p>And partially it&#x27;s due to contention. All the memory channels in the world won&#x27;t help you when memory access starts to pile up on the same bank. Which is, in practice, going to be something that will happen all the time if you&#x27;re not taking steps to keep it form happening, because that&#x27;s the kind of unhelpful jerk that stochastic processes are.')
