FPGAs cannot be effectively time-division multiplexed, as a full reconfiguration can take up to tens of seconds.<p>GP is also correct that DSP&#x2F;SRAM blocks are critical to performance. FPGAs are not very efficient at raw compute if you have to synthesize everything out of LEs.<p>The performance benefit of FPGAs, which PIMs also share (in theory, there aren&#x27;t any PIMs ready for real-world deployment AFAIK) is that they can leverage much larger memory bandwidths than general purpose CPUs can. An FPGA might run at a lower clock rate (low 100s of MHz), but be able to operate on several kb per clock cycle. This can work really well when paired with off-chip logic to convert high rate serial interfaces to lower clock rate parallel interfaces, then back after the FPGA is done processing.<p>There is also a lot of work going on in the space of time-division multiplexing FPGAs effectively. The two main approaches are overlay architectures and partial reconfiguration. The former implements another high-level fabric on top of the FPGA which will be less general-purpose, but can be reconfigured faster. The latter is a feature vendors have added to some high-end chips where specific regions of the FPGA can be reconfigured without affecting other regions.')
