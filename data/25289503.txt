I&#x27;m about to just go Intel instead.  I hope they ramp up production and don&#x27;t miss out because I think a strong AMD would be a good thing.  I can&#x27;t wait forever to build my new rig though and I&#x27;ve been using Intel for decades so I have confidence in it.  Excited to go AMD but I am building a new rig for a reason (my old one is in its death throes and I use this thing all day almost every day for work).')
