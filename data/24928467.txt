All one needs is:<p>- WASD&#x2F;click mouse - scroll<p>- F - flip<p>- R - shuffle<p>- left click - pick&#x2F;drop<p>These cover 99% of all use cases.<p>But then learning rules of a pariticular game and learning how those are applied - these need to be learnt each time when starting a new mod. One way to mitigate this is playing with people who already have experience with a particular mod.<p>When starting with a new mod by yourself, first it&#x27;s important to determine how much scripted it is. Some mods are raw physic playgrounds with components from the game, while others are scripted to automate and simplify gameplay. I think those raw mods are easier to get started, because you basically only need to know rules of the game itself and do everything manually same way you&#x27;d do when playing actual board game. On the other hand, once you get to know the range of scripts in a scripted mod, it&#x27;s much easier to play the mod - it&#x27;s often more like a computer game, where things happen automatically.<p>Because these mods are all independent, so it&#x27;s often difficult or impossible to find any documentation about scripts used by the mod. Often figuring that out is basically trail-and-error, which is unfortunate. There are some which provide written instructions though.<p>I&#x27;ve played Twilight Imperium, Gloomhaven and Gaia Project and I found all of them very enjoyoable (once I learned how to play them). PM me and maybe we can setup a game :)')
