This is a huge code smell and more error prone. Take a step back and evaluate this idea, like I did, and realize this is not a good idea. Ask language experts their opinion. Your getting the opinion of a developer who did the same and discovered issues, and then went looking for answers. Your response is to shill the tool you work on because you have attachment to it. You have to be able to evaluate your work without attachment, to see it from an unbiased view, and to take feedback without fighting back.')
