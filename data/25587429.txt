Remember when they looked at 2 years of body-cam footage for one of their highest earners and came out the other end with 32 counts of assault, false imprisonment and generalized misconduct? [1]<p>That&#x27;s police brutality.<p>Your reply:\n&gt; The police is not the problem. [...] Victim-rights trump criminal-rights.<p>The fact that you are arguing against oversight of the police due to <i>documented police brutality</i> is at least indirect support for police brutality. Beyond that, your general stance that appears to be okay with the police doing what they need to to prevent crime would imply more direct support for police brutality, especially since you seem to justify their actions as &quot;tough policing,&quot; which I fail to understand in any way other than a polite euphemism for &quot;police brutality.&quot;')
