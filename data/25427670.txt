Item(by='waste_monk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608014473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421550, text='&gt;Personally I would ban resistive heating, they are generally in lower cost rentals, student properties etc and cost a lot for the tenant to use especially as these tenants are generally at the poorer side of the fence.<p>You mean the radiant &#x2F; bar heater type ones? I cannot agree with this, while I agree that they&#x27;re expensive to run and inefficient for heating rooms &#x2F; whole house, they do work well if you use them to directly heat only the part of the room you&#x27;re in.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in old houses where the ceilings are too high to effectively heat via convection (e.g. a modern 5x5x2.4 room is 60m^3 volume, while an old house with  the same width and length but 3.6 metre ceilings is 90m^3 of volume to heat - combine that with inferior ceiling insulation common in old houses and the fact that hot air rises, the space often cools faster than the convection heater can keep up) and there was no natural gas service, so we just had to sit in front of radiant heaters.')
