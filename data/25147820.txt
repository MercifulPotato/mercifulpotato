Therapist asks them how they&#x27;re doing. Client describes various issues from the past 1-2 weeks, many of which are recurring (e.g. procrastination, indecision, etc). Therapist validates client&#x27;s feelings, asks probing questions to explore them, supports where the client is right now. Client has plenty to say about these things, speaks their mind.<p>This easily absorbs the therapy hour. Client leaves, not exactly dissatisfied but not exactly satisfied, either.<p>... the therapist (being a therapist and not some kind of “accountability coach”) is not expected to hold the client to these in any important way. Instead, the client can crop up afresh each time with feelings new or old, accomplishments and failures of any kind, and be accepted all the same.<p>This is therapy&#x27;s perpetual present.&quot;')
