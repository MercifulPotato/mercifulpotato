It&#x27;s a wart on the standard library IMO.<p>The template declaration and invocation hierarchy seems unnecessarily complex and is almost 100% undocumented. It just hurts my brain and doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me in comparison to jinja, whatever jekyll uses, etc.<p>It has very very poor documentation. Some docstrings are not a replacement for actual documentation when your approach is that unorthodox.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t produce any error messages or warnings when you do something wrong - just renders a completely blank template.<p>EDIT: to be clear, my beef is with the template hierarchy, poor docs, and lack of errors&#x2F;warnings, not with the general capabilities of the library, which are quite complete.')
