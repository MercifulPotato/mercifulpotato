I am to some extent but not to the point where I inspect every single update.<p>What I value most is having every software or library available through some form of package manager. Downloading static binaries off the internet without auto-update just doesn&#x27;t make it which is why I like having Flatpak as a fallback.<p>It also makes it easier for the common user to have every piece of software available through one store. They don&#x27;t need to know whether it&#x27;s a .deb or a Flatpak underneath, it just needs to be there and work reasonably well.<p>There&#x27;s really no other option: either distro maintainers include every single piece of software in the repositories (unlikely), or we need a common format that works on all distros (already the case with Flatpak).')
