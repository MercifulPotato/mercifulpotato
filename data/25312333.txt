The problem is there isn&#x27;t that much to modern &quot;AI&quot;&#x2F;machine learning. It&#x27;s just brute force approximation&#x2F;simulation&#x2F;curve-fitting. There&#x27;s a lot of tweaking, a lot of data and a lot of processing power. It does a lot but fails unpredictably and has unpredictable (or predictable) biases and leaves you at the mercy of a black box.<p>There, I&#x27;ve repeated the paper without reading it. But Google did hire her to be an AI ethicist so what else would they expect?')
