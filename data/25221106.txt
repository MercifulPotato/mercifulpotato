HFT is just a scam. Anybody remembers Flash sales? And there were consideration like digging tunnel from nyc to chicago due to small latency. HFT is just ran by powerful and rich people thats why the are still now. There are preety bad thing hft has done like Intensifying Volatility, Ripple Effects,Uncertainty, Stock Manipulation.<p>As a game HFT is interesting but in real life its just a plain scam. Yes you may have a job and you may work on HFT but that doesn&#x27;t mean you have to give your heart and support it.<p>Disclaimer: I worked on HFT but I still don&#x27;t like it and the money HFT generate is just insane.')
