If I went with my friends to lunch it is acceptable to check your phone but we would never find it acceptable to be on your phone the whole time.<p>I&#x27;m 40.<p>This gives me hope for our species. I lost a very good, old friend several years ago because he was constantly on his phone. Several of us were home for Thanksgiving, which is a real rarity since we live all over the United States. We were all out to dinner and he just could not get off the phone, when I finally said, &quot;Do you think its socially unacceptable to constantly be on your phone when we&#x27;re all here together??&quot;<p>He got extremely defensive, and very nasty. We haven&#x27;t spoken since.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how great it is for me to see younger people realize how important it is to be in-the-moment with the people around you.')
