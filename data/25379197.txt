How about when Microsoft dropped Silverlight and basically killed any products built on it and the ability to put “Silverlight developer” on one’s resume? Or Adobe and Flash for that matter?<p>I think it’s reasonable to put some restrictions on the choices a company can make about their product direction, but just “it screwed a third party that built on my product” is a bad one.')
