Item(by='sumtechguy', descendants=None, kids=[25460688], score=None, time=1608240104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460350, text='What is more frustrating is the search stinks.  Pick something that most places have.... say a DVD.  Top 3-5 results will NOT be what you are looking for (sponsored links) or links to amazons &#x27;prime selection&#x27; where they charge for a digital copy (if I wanted digital I would buy that).  Then maybe the middle 3-5 items might be what you are looking for and the bottom 3-5 items will be &#x27;sponsored links&#x27;.  Finding things has become a pain.  You have to play a game of get the title <i>exactly</i> right or it will not show you the thing.  I have had items I marked down to look at later (not using the wishlist).  Come back 3-4 days later and it will not even pop on the search at all.  Find the exact title and ta-da there it is.  Amazon has really gone downhill fast.')
