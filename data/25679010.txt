Racing on public streets is dangerous and should not be encouraged.<p>The Porsche Taycan looks worse than the high performance Tesla&#x27;s based on published EPA numbers but it has some advantages the EPA numbers do not show. The Taycan can maintain high power output for longer before overheating.<p>This makes it good for racing, probably better than the Teslas, but please do your racing on proper race tracks.')
