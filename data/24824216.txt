I would need at least some form of backup. Furthermore, if the point was to hide the existence of encrypted data, you would have to also hide your payments to said cloud service provider. So at this point we would need to:<p>- Set up (locally encrypted) storage to cloud service provider 1, and a similar backup to cloud service provider 2.<p>- Learn cryptocurrency washing mechanism to hide continuously ongoing payments to cloud service providers.<p>Note that both of these would have to remain in your memory, since you wouldn&#x27;t be able to save anything (like &quot;download_encrypted_data_from_cloud_storage.sh&quot;) on the amnesiac OS.')
