Does derived data qualify too (otherwise you can keep the original data for a minute, derive an intermediate data format out of it, then discard the original)? Do you charge for how long is spent <i>processing</i> that data (so they just throw more CPU at it so the data is only processed for milliseconds)?<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a solution. Not only is this hard to implement &amp; enforce, but this still ends up legalizing the unwanted processing of consumer&#x27;s data as long as the processors can pay the fee. Those users should be allowed to decline regardless of how much the processor is willing to pay.')
