This is because:<p>1. The menu option for <i>cut</i> is right above the menu option for <i>copy</i><p>2. The keyboard shortcut for <i>cut</i> (command-c) is just one key away from the keyboard shortcut for <i>copy</i> (command-c) on a QWERTY keyboard<p>Cutting and pasting deletes the file from its original directory, however under a traditional cut-and-paste operation, the system does not ask for confirmation. Consequently, if a user mistakenly cuts a file or directory without <i>immediately</i> noticing their mistake, their files could be rendered unrecoverable (and keep in mind that there&#x27;s no particular reason why they <i>would</i> notice... the UI provides no special indication when a file or directory is deleted via cut-and-paste). This is arguably a very bad user experience.<p>The equivalent action to cutting-and-pasting on OS X is copying, pasting and then deleting the original file. By adding in this extra step, the UI has forced users to acknowledge that their action is potentially destructive and unrecoverable.<p>Also notice that the command-x shortcut in Finder copies a file. It does not cut the file. Again, this protects the user from inadvertent data loss if they use the wrong keyboard shortcut.<p>It&#x27;s a rather unusual move Apple has made here by breaking convention, but I think they&#x27;ve made a wise wager that users would rather be annoyed by a small extra step, then be faced with the loss of important data.<p>Thinking about this design choice, I now wonder how many times I&#x27;ve had files mysteriously go missing on Windows and other operating systems simply because I used CTRL+X when I meant to use CTRL+C')
