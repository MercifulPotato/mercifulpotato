People who aren&#x27;t very self-aware can also wrongly attribute an outcome to something they took, when in fact it&#x27;s simply exposing them to something underlying, something their ego mind was hiding from them - suppressed&#x2F;repressed unhealed&#x2F;unprocessed emotional and&#x2F;or physical trauma (past or active) - which will highly likely have a highly workable solution&#x2F;treatment for, just that the medical systems lack of holistic approach and holistic understanding and lack of protocol causes the current institutions to be v relatively useless when trying to guide healing. For example, MDMA may cause people to feel anxious while they&#x27;re on it - that&#x27;s actually expected and not a problem if you&#x27;re explained why it happens and you&#x27;ve been explained, primed with, multiple ways to process it - while being in a relatively safe space with at least one safe go-to person who you can have to talk to, as that&#x27;s one of main methods of processing trauma and allowing the anxiety to rapidly melt away; it wasn&#x27;t the MDMA that caused the anxiety but instead lowered the conditioning to below your baseline stress level, revealing&#x2F;giving access to feelings of anxiety underlying that otherwise would be too distracting and overwhelming preventing you from being functioning day to day - instead you have the opportunity on MDMA to process them. If you take MDMA recreationally but without knowing this, without having a safe person to talk to at a moment&#x27;s notice if you start feeling anxious that you can&#x27;t seem to process on your own (which makes sense that could be the case the majority of the time if it&#x27;s trauma that you&#x27;ve yet to be able to process) - if you don&#x27;t know how to process that anxiety while on MDMA, and it&#x27;s as simple as going somewhere quiet with a person and just starting to talk (&quot;I feel anxious&quot;) to start dialogue - then you&#x27;re going to feel bad after because you&#x27;ll open yourself to anxiety but not have processed any or much of it; over days to weeks you&#x27;ll get conditioned to it again to some degree, you may avoid MDMA and blame it when it was inadequate support during, and it&#x27;s also why dosing is very important - as if you take too much MDMA 1) you won&#x27;t remember much of the experience (as memory is part of stress response), and 2) you&#x27;ll access too much, causing too much to come to the surface, and can feel very anxious for at least a week.<p>Maps.org&#x27;s research, founded by Rick Doblin, is now why the FDA is fast tracking approval for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.<p>I also want to point out that your final sentence also should be asked for approved medications line SSRIs - which not only increase rate of suicide (and arguably homicide; suicide taking anger out on self, homicide out onto others) but also have horrendous side-effects including long term withdrawal symptoms.')
