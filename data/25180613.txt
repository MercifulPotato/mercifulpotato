The decline in rigour among applied computer science corresponded with an increase in software availability, economic output, and probably also literal lives saved.<p>I don&#x27;t deny that it&#x27;s frustrating to be stuck with poor choices, ones which cause confusion and make development difficult. However, I think that this method got more software in the hands of people sooner than the counterfactual high rigour world. There&#x27;s definitely an argument to be made that there&#x27;s an inflection point, where the rigourous method is slower up until some point where it becomes a better baseline, and from there software development accelerates and overtakes our current world. I think it&#x27;s hard to be confident in that argument, though.')
