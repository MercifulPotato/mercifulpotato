Why should it change?<p>I have many programs I wrote years ago that I don&#x27;t change and I use every day. Constant changes are not a measure of utility.<p>But again and again, you&#x27;ll find users looking at repositories and deciding that something is &quot;dead&quot; because there isn&#x27;t any recent commit, often blaming developers for not doing more free work for them. This is a toxic attitude. When we have a software that works well and solves our problems, we should celebrate it, not complain it doesn&#x27;t find new problems to solve.')
