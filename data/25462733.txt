The poverty experienced in that nation is extreme and very few eat properly. I&#x27;d wager that they may have worse health metrics than americans in nearly every category (including obesity)<p>Worse, everyone (even americans) tend to agree that &quot;ordinary&quot; Filipino food is less healthy (and less tasty) than basically anyone elses. Compare your experience at jolibees to at McDonald&#x27;s. I claim that almost everyone (even people who hate both) will prefer the food at McDonalds, and that the average item from McDonalds is healthier than from Joliebees<p>Filipinos trying to bring up their good food and &quot;somehow were still having bad health outcomes&quot; is pinoy pride going wrong. And who can forget about THIS delicacy?\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pagpag" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pagpag</a>')
