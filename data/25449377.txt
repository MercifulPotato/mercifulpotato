Item(by='Danieru', descendants=None, kids=[25449832], score=None, time=1608156041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447647, text='I&#x27;ll explain why it&#x27;s down voted then: everyone knows Nathan used to work at Microsoft but &quot;rich man goes on to make the world much worse to get even more rich&quot; is no better than &quot;man makes the world worse to get rich&quot;.<p>Also note now the down voted post contains only one factual number plus a bunch of speculation all in the interests of deflecting. The post assumes Nathan never sold any stock, then assumes Nathan never spent most of his money, then assumes Forbes somehow knows an accurate valuation of a private company. Then after all these assumptions the post still admits the important bit: Nathan started the world&#x27;s biggest patent troll and is actively involved in extracting rents.<p>Note: I do not buy the speculation that MS is the major source of Nathans current wealth. Nor does it change anything or make patent trolling different.<p>Nathan&#x27;s founding of Intellectual Ventures caused everyone in the world to get slightly poorer. It is an affront to any inventor or intellectual on this planet. Nathan was militarized a system meant for good into a system of worthless rent extraction. In turn Nathan caused the current patent trolling we see from IBM, that they have more patents does not somehow absolve Nathan, this is the future he says he wanted.')
