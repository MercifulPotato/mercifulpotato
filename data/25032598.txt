You owned a license to <i>privately</i> listen to your copy of the music, that lasts as long as the medium is playable. Recording from the radio is technically unlawful, as is playing the music at large gatherings or broadcasting the music. Same goes for video cassettes, DVDs and other mediums. What you do own is a physical copy of the music&#x2F;film. You cannot do what you want with it, which is what you are implying. I’m not suggesting that this is fair or just either.<p>Also, if you’re arguing against 30% fees, Spotify takes about 30% as a margin on every fee they receive, more for ads.')
