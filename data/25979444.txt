You can pay for support if you want, which gives you the bleeding edge security patches immediately (without support you can upgrade every six months to get the all patches). The pricing for support is calculated by CPU core count I believe. So if you&#x27;re using Java in production on 100 cores, that&#x27;s going to be more expensive than 10. I don&#x27;t have the specific numbers off the top of my head though.')
