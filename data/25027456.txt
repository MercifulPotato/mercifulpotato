Obama took a Republican healthcare plan, and it was still gridlocked and framed as extremist.<p>The truth is that there are real interests in this country that actively don&#x27;t want problems to be fixed, and that&#x27;s the reason why there is so much low grade nonsense that gives you the idea that it&#x27;s because both sides are intransigent, but past experiments show that trying to collaborate with the obstructionist party just leads to the ratchet effect [0].<p>In effect, there can never be consensus because the purpose of some is simply obstruction and dysfunction, which is made evident by what happened to Romney&#x27;s healthcare plan. The only solution is to use an electoral breakthrough, pushed by a not-so-moderate message, to create a new fait-accompli and change the political landscape, otherwise you either fall prey to the ratchet effect or to gridlock.')
