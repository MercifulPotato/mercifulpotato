You pay your &quot;union dues&quot; by buying the hardware, and then &quot;you&#x27;re in&quot;.   There&#x27;s no money to be made after that fact, so there are an enormous number of small interactions after that that are fully trustworthy - for example, unlike many internet-ad-revenue companies, you&#x27;re not worried about being profiled or having your info sold to advertisers.  You&#x27;re also not worried about &quot;product collapse based on shaky revenue streams&quot; - one thing that&#x27;s always been scary about using various consumer apps is there are a fair number of programs out there that just have really shaky revenue models, so it&#x27;s scary to commit to them because a lot of them eventually have to pivot, or sell out, or otherwise do something brutal to stay alive.  When using some of apple&#x27;s hardware, you know if it&#x27;s selling decently, the business is stable and certain rugs won&#x27;t get pulled out of under you.')
