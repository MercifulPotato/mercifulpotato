Item(by='president', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602094640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705302, text='&gt; There is no evidence that folks on H1B visa compete with a US Citizen&#x27;s job.<p>If an IT department puts out a req and fills it with an H1-B worker, a US worker is out of a job. It&#x27;s really that simple. People like to respond to this and cite sources funded by H1-B consultancies about how H1-B create more economic opportunities which translates into more jobs for all but this doesn&#x27;t make sense because companies will A) pocket the savings and B) continue to hire H1-Bs to keep on saving per headcount. The reality is that jobs are a zero-sum game. I welcome your response if you have a counter-point.')
