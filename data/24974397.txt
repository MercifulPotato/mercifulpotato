I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Electron is heavily dependent on code <i>developed</i> and <i>maintained</i> by Google, but then so is Node, and Go, and presumably anything written in Go, such as Docker. Calling all of those Google products seems wrongâ€”but it&#x27;s true that Node would be in big trouble if Google suddenly stopped maintaining Chrome or something.')
