Item(by='lsllc', descendants=None, kids=[24662088], score=None, time=1601601455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652283, text='I don&#x27;t know about you, but my AirPods have been a total nightmare.  Routinely won&#x27;t wake up, routinely don&#x27;t charge; often when I go for a run one of them is dead or at 10% charge.  I now have a routine where I insert&#x2F;remove&#x2F;insert&#x2F;remove&#x2F;insert&#x2F;remove and watch the led to make sure it blinks -- it makes it better, but it&#x27;s not foolproof.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on the iWatch, it crashes at the same point on my run about 50% of the time.  Now when I say same point, I mean same geographical location.  Doesn&#x27;t matter if I run directly there (it&#x27;s about 1 mile from home), or if I do a 5 mile loop first.  Always roughly the same place (within 200 yards).  I should go and look up the coordinates, maybe there&#x27;s something odd about the numbers.<p>Anyway, switched back to iPhone, wired earphones and armband holder -- much better (and now I can take pictures of the woods when I see something interesting!).')
