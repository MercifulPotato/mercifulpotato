In a wider context, I feel like the cycle of building and then strip mining a brand has been accelerated. As soon as there is credibility and trust, it&#x27;s exploited. But also, I don&#x27;t see all the different people who write for an organization as having much if anything in common. My favorite general news source at the moment is Bloomberg, but I remember one or more people who used to bring up a particular article as evidence Bloomberg was not to be trusted.<p>I choose things to read based on my perception of their average reliability, but I don&#x27;t assume that something is true because it comes from a good source. If I did, how could I know the source was good in the first place? The causality goes from good articles -&gt; good source, not the other way around.<p>I just don&#x27;t think you can give anyone any benefit of the doubt. If you&#x27;re not forming your opinions bottom-up, you risk getting drawn into a divergent reality like so many people these days.<p>I&#x27;m also reminded of how some people on HN like to mention the &quot;Gell-Mann Amnesia effect&quot;. You can&#x27;t expect that smart people automatically know about any random thing, if it doesn&#x27;t impact their life whether they are right or wrong.')
