Rather than “media” I think he means “art”, specifically AV media art.<p>Much of the AV media (Not necessarily art) consumed these days by the younger generation a is transitory, part of a conversation, and short:   Podcasts and YouTube videos in particular.   They take up a lot of the media consumption time.   I see this as our new dominant mode of sensemaking, a section of the populace isn’t going out into the world make making mistakes to learn from them, they’re watching YouTube to learn and make sense of the world.  (This is why YouTube’s recommendation algorithm is so dangerous socially and politically.)<p>As for consuming art... even that has become a bit different.  People watch the latest tent pole Marvel movie or whatnot , yes for a multi hour thrill, but also to join in the conversation with their friends and acquaintances and to not get left behind in the labyrinthine plot continuity.  Same goes for the evolution of music genres.<p>In short, much modern media consumption seems to me to be about the current meta-narrative, and that makes it hard to place older stuff in context unless it’s curated by someone that is clever enough to fit it in.<p>For what it’s worth, I love historical art house cinemas, but know almost no one else in real life or my close online circle that does.  But I find it provides a lot rewarding depth.<p>The Criterion Channel is my preference - it has a great selection on demand.')
