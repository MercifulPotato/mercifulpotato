I get a notification that &quot;my&quot; order executed two minutes before market closed, I immediately contact Robinhood saying that I didn&#x27;t place the order. It took a week for them to tell me that they had put the order in on my behalf. Cost me $1800 vs the value held to expiration (which was a month out.)<p>Seriously considering taking them to small claims court. No notification beforehand, and even afterwards it took a week to find out what happened.')
