The iPhone is pretty far from what I want too.<p>What I dispute is that they should be forced to build something for you, or that there is any ‘should’ about this.  I want an open device too, and would prefer such a device to the iPhone, however I don’t want Apple to be forced to make one for me.<p>There are no gymnastics going on here.  Apple’s software is not designed to make it easy for you to customize the way you would like.  Nobody disputes that.<p>What I dispute is the use of the government to force them to change their designs, especially since we have alternatives to choose from and can contribute to them if we so desire.')
