There&#x27;s already been blatant examples like adding Hayden Christensen to Return of the Jedi[1], but they&#x27;ve also changed movies like Lilo &amp; Stitch, Toy Story 2, Splash, etc and I think it will only get more prevalent as time goes by (although I&#x27;m sure the changes will be similar to the ones mentioned in the article- removing some of the darker aspects of their stories, or ones that might offend more puritan viewers.)<p>[1]: I realize this change was pre-Disney+, but presumably Disney has the rights to previous cuts of Star Wars in addition to the &quot;Special&quot; ones')
