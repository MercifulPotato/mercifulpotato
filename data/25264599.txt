Even most of us in the tech industry no longer care. <i>I</i> care deeply, and I assure you I&#x27;m in the minority. This because companies like Apple and Facebook have successfully shifted us into the &quot;app mindset&quot; in which the open web is irrelevant.<p>I would love to understand the downvotes on this comment.')
