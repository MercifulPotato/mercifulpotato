In UK and I had a tablet I ordered, that was supposed to come yesterday. Says that is delivered, but I never received. None of my neighbours received, so who knows where it is.<p>As for their own brands like thier tablets, they are probably worse quality than some counterfeits&#x2F;awful brands. They have nasty cheap parts, for example the usb power port breaks in no time. I made the mistake of shopping for that non-amazon brand tablet for yesterday, but what a seriously shoddy company, for many reasons.')
