I&#x27;m thrilled to eat fruits&#x2F;vegetables every time I go back to my grandfather town.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it is... mass production? Tomatoes bought in the city do not even taste good in season (like now). We now have bigger and tasteless fruits. Why? I want to enjoy eating, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s 25% smaller. Now they try to fool us with more colourful pulp or exterior... but taste the same.<p>I guess it takes more time to grow them if we want them to have taste. Orchards in my grandfather&#x27;s town are not even irrigated (or much less, because it&#x27;s dry weather) and they taste amazing.<p>This only helps hyperpalatable and unhealthy foods to gain strength between young people.')
