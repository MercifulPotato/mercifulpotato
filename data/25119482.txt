Some of them are web readers who read more because the reminders prompt them, but many are email readers who don’t really want to visit your website but want your content. It makes a lot of sense to offer a free subscription to someone instead of making them search for it.<p>There are also readers like you and me who look everywhere on a site to find what we want. They don’t need a pop-up and may resent it.<p>Of course you need to do the additional work of sending good email. That’s part of the appeal, that you’ve done additional work for the reader and are inviting them to enjoy more.<p>Why so much of our economy and society is driven by people asking other people to do things for them is a good question but above this particular consultant’s pay grade. ;)')
