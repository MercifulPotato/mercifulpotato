Basically, PHP alternatives.<p>Here&#x27;s a &quot;wishlist&quot; of features I&#x27;d like in such a framework:<p>- Absolutely no boilerplate code: It should feel more like a powerful templating language than a general purpose programming language.<p>- A static type system that&#x27;s checked before your application can go live<p>- Vertical integration, especially towards the database: You could go really crazy with this. LINQ-style query-ability is just the beginning. Imagine if you had a typed access control framework that lets you specify which users&#x2F;roles can access a database column. Or built-in ways to handle migration and automatic schema checks to prevent mismatch issues.<p>- Useful primitives, especially around authentication and authorization: For something simple I should only have to write my business logic.<p>- FFI (for example to C or JVM libraries)<p>- Automatic and safe dependency updates')
