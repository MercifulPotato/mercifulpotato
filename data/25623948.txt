If you make bits smaller, you get a modestly larger number of events in a given area capable of flipping a bit, spread across a larger number of bits in that area.<p>That is, it&#x27;s flip event rate * memory die area, not flip event rate * number of memory bits.<p>In recent generations, I understand it&#x27;s even been a bit paradoxical-- smaller geometries mean less of the die is actual memory bits, so you can actually end up with <i>fewer</i> flips from shrinking geometries.<p>And sure, your other effect is true: there&#x27;s a whole lot fewer bitflips that &quot;matter&quot;.  Flip a bit in some framebuffer used in compositing somewhere-- and that&#x27;s a lot of my memory-- and I don&#x27;t care.')
