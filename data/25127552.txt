That&#x27;s sufficient for timestamping, but not great for a general purpose time library where even ordinary civil calculations might exceed that range, particularly in intermediate arithmetic.<p>Since larger than 64 bit ints are a disaster for portability, the reasonable solution is to go with a 64 bit signed seconds, 32 bit nano offset field. A lot of language std libs have adopted something along these lines.<p>DJB was advocating for everything to be in a format like this, referenced to TAI (UTC without leap seconds, basically). Sadly that didn&#x27;t get any traction.')
