What test is even used as discriminant of “white people”? self-report, a pencil test?<p>In particular, I&#x27;ve seen many persons who are apparently considered “not white” in the U.S.A. whose skin complexion woud surely not have such a meaningful influence. Consider also the story with Rachel Dolezal, which showed well that race is a cultural meme, not a phænotypically defined set of traits, nor something upon which a biological significance can be built.')
