The purpose was to study the different accents that were found in Paris at the time. They mention that it&#x27;s easy to tell apart someone from Paris 14th arrondissement (south-ish) and someone from Montmarte (north). When the interviewee listens to the recording, he&#x27;s astonished to hear why people have sometimes been mentioning slowness in his speech.')
