Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607722111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390274, text='This seems like a particularly inflammatory characterization of events. I&#x27;ll just say that I think Kenosha was a tragedy, ideally Rittenhouse shouldn&#x27;t have been there. Ideally there wouldn&#x27;t have been riots in the first place, and failing that, the government should have effectively marshaled the police and national guard to keep the peace so (largely untrained) private citizens didn&#x27;t have to do the job. I can understand why police viewed those private citizens as &quot;help&quot; in keeping the peace, but obviously that&#x27;s problematic (bringing us back around to the rioters creating the situation and the government failing to adequately manage it). And of course everything Trump says tends to do more harm than good.<p>As for Rittenhouse&#x27;s &quot;victims&quot;, by all appearances Rittenhouse was acting in self defense--maybe he was instigating the conflicts before the cameras started filming, but there&#x27;s no evidence to support that; on the other hand, the footage does show Rittenhouse being chased and physically attacked before firing. I&#x27;m inclined toward the presumption of innocence, but I also understand that this is very controversial.')
