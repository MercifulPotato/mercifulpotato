Some days, when I&#x27;m resting after an insane week it&#x27;s 0 or close to it. Other days it&#x27;s 8+ hours when it&#x27;s mad crunch time. A regular day is about 3-4 hours of productive work. My employer is very happy with me, keeps promoting me&#x2F;giving me raises. I&#x27;ve found that my contributions are generally less measured in LOCs, and more in finding business problems, designing technical solutions for them, and communicating them to non-technical stakeholders.')
