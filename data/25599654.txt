But I most definitely think it is effectively a currency in some places and in some special circumstances.<p>I take it that the point of the post is that, by and large, due to the fact that the blockchain is public and analyzed and mining is conceivably traceable to special purpose hardware, it&#x27;s not for many practical purposes usable as a stateless, institution-free vehicle for transactions.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to square the circle on this, but it certainly is a currency in some cases.')
