So any more or less up-to-date doc should indoctrinate the REST-style, especially for CRUD. You might need to make the transfer from the data is not coming from a form anymore, but some JS that sends JSON, but that is something a developer should be able to do...<p>And yeah, I also think a mix is what makes sense for most things, and there it can be anything from plain js&#x2F;jquery through stimulusjs to react&#x2F;vue.<p>Even though it sounds to me like I am trying to defend rails, this is not really what I am trying to do, just trying to show a little bit different perspective :-)')
