Having had left Ireland behind us already (after maybe 2 hours of flight time), the pilot told us that the air condition in the crew rest wasn&#x27;t working, so the crew was unable to get proper sleep. Unable to fix it in flight, but not an outright emergency, they had to turn around and we went right back to Paris.<p>That&#x27;s how I learned about this magical place&#x27;s existence, and that you aren&#x27;t allowed to make a 8.5h flight when it&#x27;s broken, even if the rest of the plane is perfectly fine.')
