I miss having agency over what I&#x27;m building. It can be extremely demoralizing and frustrating.<p>For example, I have to fix some &quot;bugs&quot; in my code. Apparently the application that sends us json messages doesn&#x27;t properly escape double quotes in one of the fields, so I have to fix it. It&#x27;s another internal application, so I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t have them rollback this addition of double quotes that isn&#x27;t compliant with json standards.<p>On top of this, that other system is using that field for both business and system data. So we have to string match that field and perform logic if it&#x27;s true. But the business uses that field to display on the UI so they request updates to it. Why would you architect it this way!<p>I was building a report a few weeks ago and found out that the report is for <i>operational</i> work, but that we only have the necessary data available in an <i>archive</i> repo which won&#x27;t contain up to date info. My team doesn&#x27;t own the data or systems so we aren&#x27;t allowed to redesign it. Yet they complain that I can&#x27;t give them what they want. I&#x27;m a dev, not a magician...<p>What are these higher paid architects doing?')
