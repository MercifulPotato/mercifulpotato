It so much more than makes up for lost government benefits.<p>Health insurance working for a decent US tech company generally requires some out of pocket, but the amounts are really quite modest. Premiums are typically mostly paid by the employer and not considered part of your compensation. If you&#x27;re single you&#x27;ll probably pay nothing for insurance premiums and potentially up to a few thousand out of pocket if you&#x27;re a heavy user of health care, and maybe $5k in the absolute worst case (and the out of pocket is often tax free). If you&#x27;ve got a family, you might pay a couple thousand per year in premiums and $10k in out of pocket maximum. These numbers are honestly chump change for people who are earning $50k-250k more, with better career prospects and more high paying employers to choose from if a particular job doesn&#x27;t work out.')
