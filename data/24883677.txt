Voters need to be at least <i>as</i> interested in the human rights angle as the domestic employment angle, if we are to see tarrifs being used <i>specifically</i> as leverage to improve those global human rights.<p>Otherwise, in spite of gains in redundant manufacturing capacity (great for local employment, and for national security), it&#x27;s likely there would be a degradation in workers&#x27; rights domestically in order to keep costs low.  In order to avoid these outcomes, workers&#x27; rights and human rights need to be something that most voters believe are important.')
