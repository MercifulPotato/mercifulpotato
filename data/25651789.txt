FBA is basically B2C, as opposed to B2B or C2C.<p>Back during the &quot;peak lockdown&quot; of April&#x2F;May 2020, a little birdie told me about some of the steps that Amazon was taking to give the warehouses and delivery network a break from the increased demand. In other words, Amazon saw lots of unexpected growth due to the pandemic. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if plans to launch &quot;Amazon Logistics&quot; or whatever as a separate line of business got pushed back due to the pandemic.<p>Edit: I know for a fact that the leadership of the Logistics part of Amazon has expressed a desire to become the &quot;4th flywheel&quot; of Amazon, which is Amazon-speak for being a self sustaining, revenue generating line of business. But as you allude to, they have to soak up all the demand generated from the Amazon consumer business first.')
