A few more notable games:<p>- The Pirate&#x27;s Dream. You played as pirates spread out over a huge map with dozens of different islands. Every island had different ships you could buy and ways you could make money. Lots of fond memories of claiming an island for myself, or taking part in huge ship battles with my buddies. We would sink the enemy&#x27;s ship with cannon fire and shoot any swimmers that tried to grapple onto ours.<p>- Ride-a-Rocket. You started the game at Cape Canaveral. Every few minutes, a rocket would launch that allowed players to get to the ISS. From the ISS you could fly to the Moon, spacewalk, or just hang out with your astronaut bros. Flying the Space Shuttle back to Earth was very difficult.<p>- Storm Chasers. The objective of the game was to take close-up photographs of hurricanes and tornadoes and sell them for cash. Risky shots meant greater rewards. You started out with a cheap car, a ruddy camera, and a handful of strips of film. As you made money, you could gradually improve your equipment until you had full-HD Camcorders and video drones.<p>- Ultimate Power. A battle-royale game where you used Dragon Ball-style power attacks. I remember this game having a really high skill ceiling; it was insane how good some players were.<p>- Grow-a-Brick. You spawned with a tiny pet brick that followed you around. Your job was to go around the map, collecting food for your brick so that it could grow to a huge size. The rarest kinds of food were good and evil food. A brick that ate enough evil food could kill and eat other bricks; a brick that ate enough good food could sap the evil from the evil bricks.')
