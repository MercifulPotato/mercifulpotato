(Another hint at this is that the registry the RFC establishes is established with GANA rather than IANA. And the URI format; I suspect that if it went through the full standardisation process it’d be pushed to payto:<i>authority</i>:<i>path</i> rather than payto:&#x2F;&#x2F;<i>authority</i>&#x2F;<i>path</i>, the &#x2F;&#x2F; style of URI being strongly linked with DNS resolution.)<p>(I completely forgot to check this when I first read the spec, and I’m <i>used</i> to reading these sorts of specs and checking their status. Read my earlier comments bearing this in mind.)')
