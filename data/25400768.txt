I had a similar thought the other day and your remarks reminded me of it, so I&#x27;ll share. It was something like this: the way we categorize and conceive of objects in the world is very much influenced by our overall cultural&#x2F;civilization worldview. We seem to be very tied to this Platonic ideal&#x2F;form of what something <i>is</i> inherently and then building the world up from there, rather than other ways of categorization; i.e by our emotional reaction to the object, or our sensory experience of it.<p>For example, both <i>an orange</i> and <i>the Sun</i> are round, orange-colored objects. If our primary way of organizing the world were based on pure visual perception, we might group them together in a fundamental way as <i>orange things</i> or <i>round things</i>. But since we&#x27;re concerned with what oranges and stars are as concepts, we don&#x27;t group them together at all. Instead oranges are <i>fruits</i> and the Sun is a <i>star</i>, which in biological&#x2F;physical terms have essentially nothing to do with each other. Our metaphysical structure of the world has separated them entirely, but this is only because we&#x27;ve built it upon a foundation of concepts rather than direct sensory input.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that made any sense, or if I&#x27;ve simply had too much coffee today. I think you&#x27;re essentially saying the same thing RE: whales. How we categorize them as mammals or fish is more-or-less completely arbitrary.')
