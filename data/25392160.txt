Up until that point, my chances of dying from rabies were pretty slim to none.<p>Likewise, my chances of severe complications, death, or even experiencing any symptoms at all are slim to none. The at risk people around me will be likely vaccinated, so i&#x27;m not putting them at risk.<p>Now, the rabies vaccine came with some known risk, a bit higher than others, hence why it&#x27;s only given to people who request it or need it.<p>This covid vaccine is brand new, rushed, the manufacturers are legally exempt from liability for damages the vaccines cause most places in the world and it&#x27;s a mostly new technology not really tested or used before.<p>There are potential side effects, these side effects are potentially long term and severely debilitating and despite being a low risk, it&#x27;s still a higher risk for me than experiencing anything terrible from covid.<p>So, why put myself at some unknown risk from some unknown thing over something that, is more than likely not, going to cause me severe problems?')
