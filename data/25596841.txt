Someone willing to argue that the car had a choice and made the wrong one could just as easily argue that the human had a choice and made the wrong one.<p>You might personally think that oh, the machine is being rational and intentional, that&#x27;s different from a human.  But a lot of people will treat a human the exact same way.  That split second panic is judged as if they had all the time in the world to consider the optimal choice.<p>The legal system already has and handles this type of lawsuit.')
