Or whatever. If his secret had been that he drinks three Dr. Peppers a day, or that he does a headstand for five minutes every morning at sunrise, our response would be the same.<p>He no more knows the secret of his longevity than a gambler knows the secret of a hot streak.  Like every centenarian, he&#x27;s on the mother of all hot streaks, that&#x27;s all.  Our impulse to find some causal agency that we can understand and adopt is no different than a gambler&#x27;s.  When he said &quot;fruit and cold showers&quot;, it&#x27;s no different than saying &quot;if I stand on one foot and close my left eye when I throw the dice, I don&#x27;t crap out.&quot;<p>I have to think that he knows this and he&#x27;s just humoring us because he knows we want an answer other than ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯.  After all, we are all just children to him.')
