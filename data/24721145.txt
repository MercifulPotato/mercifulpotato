With the number of people who have access to development tools it&#x27;s hard to build something that doesn&#x27;t already exist. I think it&#x27;s a shame that when someone shares something the first reaction is to shoot them down by saying it already exists, but it&#x27;s helpful to give the OP and others an idea of what&#x27;s already out there')
