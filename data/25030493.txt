A VW ID3 or something?<p>I was wondering about the ID3 because the batteries are built into the floor and seem to only have a 100k miles lifetime, which is nothing for a VW and will destroy the secondhand market in the name of &quot;progress&quot; and saving the environment (but with non recyclable battery tech to do so).')
