As for the dumpster fire that is Twitter: the usual advice is, for all Internet denizens is <i>never read the comments</i>, and Twitter is 100% comments. But I digress.<p>The equivalent, in all my own countries of citizenship, origin, or residence, might be that deceiving someone into thinking you are a police officer is already illegal, although simple impersonation may not be e.g. for satirical purposes.  Satire aside, in a country that generally trusts its law enforcement personnel, such a deception, particularly in person, may have both high capacity for harm and a high likelihood it occurs for harm&#x27;s sake.  Nevertheless, notwithstanding my total unfamiliarity with the case you refer to, I struggle to see how Twitter is ever anything other than satire. My own Twitter profile reflects this view.<p>Curiously, in Australia, it is illegal to claim an association with Sir Donald Bradman, and for similar reasons of potential harm.  Impersonating a Prime Minister is not, since it is a very low occupation and any attempt to do so is self-evidently preposterous.')
