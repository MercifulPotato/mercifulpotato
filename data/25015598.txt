Plus I&#x27;m not always using an API that expects me to be using it.  Sometimes the API goes out of it&#x27;s way to prevent me from using it, but the vendor gives me their blessing to try.<p>Interacting with systems like this for a decade has conditioned me to just try it out first, and then look up what i need to know if i&#x27;m having trouble, or need to optimize.')
