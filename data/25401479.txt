It feels like the complete rewrite that happens only for the people doing to finally learn all the project needs at the end, and immediately need another rewrite, but <i>nobody</i> has the stomach for it now.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the authors are and we&#x27;re probably the best authorities on what is and was needed in an init system, but the problem space was so poorly documented and understood because of all the crazy custom she&#x27;ll init scripts people were using that they just kept having to tack on weird directives in piecemeal ways, until were left with what we have now.<p>What the world needs is for the systemd authors to take all that knowledge an apply it to a new init system in a sane way, but nobody had the will to go through that again, most likely especially them.')
