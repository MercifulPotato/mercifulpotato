I am an Indian and my own experience has been totally opposite. The open source community welcomed me, guided me, and appreciated my work when I began contributing to open source. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;NUTCH-559" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.apache.org&#x2F;jira&#x2F;browse&#x2F;NUTCH-559</a> for an example. This was my first significant open source contribution to an Apache project. I was young, naive, and had very little prior software development experience. The change I submitted added new features but it also removed a lot of code that I incorrectly assumed to be not serving any purpose. The Apache committers helped me to refine the change, make it better, and even appreciated it with a &quot;Wow&quot; with this comment: &quot;Sorry for the late review... I have finally reviewed your patch and I have to say: Wow!&quot;<p>I think this was very welcoming. It filled me with confidence to tackle more complex problems both at work as well as in open source. Thanks to that good experience, I still contribute to open source whenever I can and I write and maintain a few open source projects of my own.')
