Nearly all of that is for the cheapest accounts.  Companies with money have people who know what they&#x27;re doing, who can quickly figure out what the product does and how to set it up, and who then go use it as intended without needing any hand holding.<p>I picked 10 hours a week in my example because that&#x27;s where it was when I was building those things &quot;full time&quot;.  Now that they are feature complete, it&#x27;s a lot closer to zero.  I haven&#x27;t opened the IDE for either of my rent paying products since the summer.')
