Over what? Hundreds of millions of cases? So the only thing you can deduce is: some people might get reinfected by covid, the reinfection seems to be worse (at least in confirmed reinfection cases, but this is skewed because the only time we get reinfection cases is when people are put in a hospital, so...)<p>Also antibody-based immunity should not fade that quick (less than a month for the elderly that died) so those are fringe cases and nothing else, and trying to make some sort of rule for reinfection less than a year before the patient 0 was even infected for the first time is a bad idea.')
