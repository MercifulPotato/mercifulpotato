You can release your software as GPL on GitHub, with a notice that you&#x27;re willing to also license your code under a paid proprietary license; interested parties may send an email to sales@example.com at their leisure.<p>Do note that this effectively prevents other people from collaborating with you, since their contributions would be GPL-protected and you may not sell them. So it&#x27;s not a good model for larger open-source projects. But if you&#x27;re an independent open-source developer who works as a sole contributor and feels exploited, then it&#x27;s probably a better model.')
