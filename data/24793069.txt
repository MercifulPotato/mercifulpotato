The cluster API will be offline, but the workloads will keep on chugging.  I think with the decoupling of etcd and the expectation that this might happen, we&#x27;d see more improvements on how to (gracefully) handle these situations.<p>Also, there was a bug with kube api where it wouldn&#x27;t failover to other etcd members during an outage.  So I would say most customers have ran kubernetes with a &quot;single backend&quot; at some point.')
