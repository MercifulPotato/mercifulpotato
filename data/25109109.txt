I can customize it to my hearts content, and run whatever style I want. I can switch from my i3 setup, a tiling wm, to GNOME in an instant. MacOS is alright, its UI is just a tad bloated and some things I don&#x27;t like. But I can change and choose my UI in linux.<p>MacOS just doesn&#x27;t run great on my 2015 MBP (dual-core) either. I have a 4k monitor, and launching 5 chrome&#x2F;safari tabs, zoom, and VSCode creates noticeable lag. Window dragging being 24fps, choppy scrolling, etc. I&#x27;m sure linux would run better on the same hardware. Its not what doesn&#x27;t run, its how it runs.')
