Unless you meant welding engineers when you said &#x27;study&#x27;, like some of my compatriots building automated robotic weld cells, who get paid 4x that much.<p>And there&#x27;s plenty of training courses at the local caterer center and community college for both those jobs at reasonable rates. Local manufacturers often pay hourly+tuition for their best fabricators or line workers who want a promotion to the welder position to go through one of those programs.')
