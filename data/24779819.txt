You still have 8x8 tiles, but with a single 16-color palette instead of four different 3-color palettes. For scrolling, the NES has 2-4 screen buffers, but the SMS just lets you hide one single row and column of tiles offscreen. This isn&#x27;t as bad as it sounds since -- on SMS you can write to VRAM at any time during the frame, as opposed to NES where you can only write during vertical blank.<p>I&#x27;ve ported a simple NES game written in C to the SMS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;8bitworkshop.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;?n=sms-sms-libcv&#x2F;chase" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;8bitworkshop.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;?n=sms-sms-libcv&#x2F;chase</a>) and I think it&#x27;d be feasible to write a translation layer between the two platforms. Sound might be a little tricky, since NES&#x27;s APU is more advanced.')
