Are you saying that Sweden&#x27;s coronavirus policy somehow led to all deaths in Sweden lowering?<p>Looking at the graph, the clear trend is death rate lowering year after year since the 60s.  That would mean that each new year, statistically, there will be several months that happen to be the &#x27;lowest&#x27; ever.  I don&#x27;t see how this data proves (or disproves) any coronavirus strategy.')
