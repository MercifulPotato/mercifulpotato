It has bidirectional I2S, (for example mic in, apply dsp, then out to speaker), is dual core, which would allow you to do the audio-related stuff on one core, and everything else (like communications) on another core.<p>If you then see that you don&#x27;t require all the good things an ESP32 has to offer, maybe because you only want to drive a LED strip via WiFi and read some sensor values, then you can step down and use an ESP8266')
