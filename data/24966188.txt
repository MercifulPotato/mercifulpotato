But this isn&#x27;t enough because:<p>1- I have to remember to download an up-to-date backup myself.\n2- I have to store the backup somewhere.\n3- Retrieving the data is cumbersome: e.g. if I need to access my emails after a lock down I&#x27;ll have to first get a recent backup that I stored somewhere then try to find a program that work on my machine that&#x27;ll read the email format then import it.<p>This approach is open to flaws that is why I&#x27;m working on the side on a product that address these pain-points: you&#x27;ll be able to automatically get backups to the service servers and it&#x27;ll do all the parsing so that you can have a similar services UI (read-only) to the ones from Google.<p>Shoot me an email if you want to keep updated.')
