And 4.9.0 came out in 2014. I don&#x27;t see why it is out of the question to release 4.9.5 - with the patch already having been backported to 4.9.4 by others; and the fact that there&#x27;s no change in library API, command-line arguments etc.<p>Now, perhaps it is the case that GCC doesn&#x27;t have enough manpower to support releases for 6 years. But doing so can&#x27;t just be dismissed as &quot;out of the question&quot;.<p>Compilers are very fundamental pieces of software - perhaps no less than OS kernels - and they shouldn&#x27;t just be &quot;moved on&quot; from.')
