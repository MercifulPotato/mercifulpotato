I think CL has the right direction but the details are wrong. This pattern requires declaring the function notinline, and that is a much stronger statement than just “wait I take it back”. Using this pattern, the function can ONLY be inlined in the contexts where you allow it. Similarly, compiler macros are disabled for notinline functions. I would like the compiler to use its normal judgement for inlining and continue using compiler macros for call sites where I don’t provide an inline declaration.')
