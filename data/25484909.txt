Apple uses the same off the shelf DRAM chips from established manufacturers found in any PC&#x2F;Phone&#x2F;Laptop.<p>Unlike Flash storage, there is really not really <i>bad</i> performing DRAM per-se, just defective, And apple is no guarantee of free from defects with RAM fault in MACs being as common as in the rest of the PC industry.<p>The extra price is just the Apple tax.')
