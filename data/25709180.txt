Item(by='jsolson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610249296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708391, text='&gt; We rely on AWS, and now I&#x27;m thinking this is a giant mistake - what if they unilaterally decide one day that our business is politically unacceptable because a bad person says nice things about us?<p>You&#x27;re making the argument for why this choice is not &quot;free&quot; for AWS. Not only do they lose a paying customer, but they cause some of their customers to debate the risks of doing business with AWS. It&#x27;s precisely this balance of capital (including goodwill) that gives private companies the freedom to choose with whom they do business. Customers are the lifeblood of a business, but every one of them is also a potential liability. Every severance of a relationship with a customer carries more cost than merely the lost revenue.<p>So no, AWS _alone_ is not the arbiter of what actions are supposedly harmful to the fabric of democratic society -- the market for serving infrastructure is vibrant and competitive. If nobody in the market will do business with a given customer, well, that&#x27;s capitalism for you.<p>(and just in case it wasn&#x27;t clear, I applaud AWS making this choice, and hope the market at large will do the same)')
