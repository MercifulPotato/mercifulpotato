I told her it&#x27;ll work fine because Bluetooth, but that (at least originally) AirPods ship out with buggy firmware that needs updating. She&#x27;d need to find a friend with an iPhone just to update them to some current version before use. (And apparently even that is a UX nightmare with no real update button or indication)')
