I looked at your profile to try and find an email address to say this personally but I figure it&#x27;s good to say this in public too. You&#x27;re writing all the things I would if I had a bit more time and inclination. I know it takes a good chunk of time and courage and mindspace to go against the current like you are, but just know there are a lot of people reading comments like yours and nodding their head but just don&#x27;t want to join the fray. There are also a lot of people waking up from the virus fear only to confront the way scarier danger of the agendas driving things. Your comments are helpful to them too. Anyway keep it up!')
