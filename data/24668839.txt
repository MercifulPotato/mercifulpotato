This means that &quot;parallel&quot; longitude lines meet at the poles, so the distance between degrees of longitude are much shorter as they get closer to the poles than they are at the equator (~111 km).<p>Latitude and longitude are defined on the globe, not by any particular projection, and the fact that longitude lines meet at the poles is true on the globe. A projection may or may not make them appear to be parallel. No projection is responsible for, or will change, the fact that a degree of longitude <i>as an arc on the Earth&#x27;s surface</i> varies in length from (Earth&#x27;s equatorial circumference)&#x2F;360 at the equator to 0 at the poles.')
