Gamers were complaining a lot during the last bull run that those crypto nuts were buying up all available high-end GPUs.<p>Also comparing the hashrates of Bitcoin and Ethereum doesn&#x27;t make sense. Those are different algorithms that run on completely different hardware. Bitcoin ASICs can only be used for Bitcoin (or Bitcoin forks that haven&#x27;t changed the POW algorithm) where GPUs as more general programmable devices can be repurposed for mining other cryptocoins which might be more profitably to mine at any given time. Together with the fact (as stated in the article) that Ethereum has reduced the block rewards over time, it&#x27;s not surprising that the hashrate isn&#x27;t bigger than during the previous bull run.<p>This leads to the criticised monetary policy of Ethereum. This wasn&#x27;t explicitly mentioned in the article but Ethereum&#x27;s monetary policy can best be summarized as &quot;don&#x27;t overpay the miners for securing the network&quot;.<p>Many see it as a necessary evil that Ethereum is still running on POW and they are eagerly awaiting the jump to POS. It is seen as a design flaw of Bitcoin that it has a rigid coin issuance that isn&#x27;t dynamically adjusting to the actual demand.')
