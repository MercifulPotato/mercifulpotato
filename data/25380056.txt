In my opinion, Java as a language is gross and unlovable, but the runtime, the development tooling, and selection of libraries and other integrations is about as good as it gets.<p>It sounds like Clojure is perfect for you then. You have all the upsides of Java you mention here with Clojure because it&#x27;s hosted on the JVM (among other platforms). You can use Java libraries and SDKs seamlessly from Clojure, but the language itself was designed specifically for a functional style from the beginning.')
