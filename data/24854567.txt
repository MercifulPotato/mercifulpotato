Waking up from the anesthesia I felt more relaxed than I ever have in my life.<p>Alternatively, you can opt for no anesthesia&#x2F;sedative, if like me your major concern is lingering after effects (and a fear of going under).

Also quite fun to see your insides on the monitor — gave me peace of mind to see perfectly uniform pink healthy flesh, as opposed to some of the craziness you can find on YouTube.')
