Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=[25934822], score=None, time=1611785114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25934632, text='Yea... but what exactly are sound fundamentals? (Not directed at you, just topical).<p>Is Apple at 40x P&#x2F;E (which is a very simple and over-used metric) still fundamentally sound? Amazon? I think the rule of thumb was always 12x. Ok so what company is that? Intel?<p>I think what we&#x27;re seeing is the result of excess capital. Items like accredited investor definitions lock people out of the VC space so if you can&#x27;t buy a house because they are too expensive or sold before they hit market... what else are you going to do with your money? Some return looks a lot better than no return...<p>Granted, Tesla does have an extremely high valuation but, well, who cares? I think that&#x27;s the general sentiment. It&#x27;s a speculative investment.<p>* Disclaimer I own a small amount of Apple and Tesla shares and have a positive outlook on the future of both companies.
