It appears to be something like &quot;the maximum speed of sound in matter which consists of atoms&quot; (maybe I&#x27;ve missed a few conditions). In particular, this speed limit is known to be violated inside of neutron stars (where the speed of sound is near 1&#x2F;sqrt(3) times the speed of light, and may even exceed that).<p>The paper also mentions a proposed lower bound on viscosity. This is the KSS bound (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;hep-th&#x2F;0405231" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;hep-th&#x2F;0405231</a>), and various theories violating it have been constructed. The violations, of course, don&#x27;t get mentioned nearly as much as the proposed (and all-but-debunked) bound.')
