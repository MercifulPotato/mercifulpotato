I would recommend clicking the actual article and reading through it, because Google&#x27;s quote is... not exactly representative of what&#x27;s contained within.<p>If you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> do that, you&#x27;re probably citing this from the World Factbook, who use a definition of literacy broadly encapsulated by &quot;is capable of reading&quot;. By that definition, if you can look at some words and then say them out loud, you&#x27;re literate. Useful for developing countries or historical contexts, but not exactly meaningful in a modern society with many resources.<p>These days most literacy studies look at actually understanding content, and being able to reason about it. This typically includes some level of numerical literacy (not necessarily mathematics, but e.g., being able to understand the difference between a million and a billion), as well as things identifying internally contradictory statements. By those standards, the United States does abysmally.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting here that the U.S. does disproportionately suffer in some studies that look specifically at literacy in a small number of official languages (English for the U.S., occasionally also including Spanish), rather than counting literacy in any language as sufficient. My comments here are in regards to the latter.<p>&gt; and a higher % of the population has a tertiary education than finland<p>The people who choose to go to tertiary education in the United States (or indeed any other country) are not usually the people in desperate need of better education. The problem is predominantly in insufficient primary and secondary schooling, combined with a cultural attitude of anti-intellectualism that leads to many people thinking they never need to learn a thing once they exit the school system.<p>Not a uniquely American phenomenon (Michael Gove&#x27;s &quot;the people have had enough of experts&quot; quote being a particularly flagrant European example), but one that&#x27;s uncomfortably persistent there. For example, it takes a very unintelligent person to be in the middle of a global pandemic, yet think that the opinion of a reality TV host is more important than the professional advice of a doctor. Those people exist everywhere, but they exist in astonishing concentrations in the United States.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what point you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>My point is that, as someone who lives in neither North America or Europe, if I had to pick a random adult citizen from the population of either the United States or Finland to make a rational decision for me, I&#x27;m picking Finland.')
