I think it&#x27;s a mischaracterization to say most indie developers are blundering foolishly after something they don&#x27;t understand vs just developing their own style or working within their constraints (there are constraints that aren&#x27;t technical in making a game, after all).<p>I can understand the intention of developers in the 80s optimizing for blurry screen all day, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I just prefer the grid-look for a lot of game contexts and usually don&#x27;t like art styles with heavy antialiasing or a lot of smooth curves. To say that if only I understood the reality of the technical implementations of 40 years ago my aesthetic preferences would shift is pretty frustrating. I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s much more frustrating for actual artists who have devoted time and energy to getting good at making games in the style and probably know their history pretty well.')
