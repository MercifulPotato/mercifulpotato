What this tool does it to encrypt your data&#x2F;files&#x2F;etc and store them in the chosen cloud. It&#x27;s quite convenient, if you have several devices. I highly recommend it.<p>If you want to use Cryptomator, please check if your cloud storage provider supports WebDAV, otherwise not every feature will work, like android or so.<p>You can also use this idea with something like KeepassXC so that you can have a password manager in the cloud without having to pay.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptomator.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptomator.org&#x2F;</a>')
