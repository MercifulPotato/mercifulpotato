Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25952808], score=None, time=1611885201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952505, text='&gt;<i>Maybe assholes shouldn&#x27;t be able to use these platforms to shape public opinion and influence elections and news</i><p>And who judges who is the asshole objectively?<p>For example, in my book a president who actively bombed 7 countries, continued wars he was elected to stop, under whose terms ICE deported more people at the border than Trump (wall or no wall), gave Wall Street a &quot;too big to fail&quot; bailout, enlarged surveillance and hunted several whistleblowers and threatened journalists, is more of an asshole (and a danger) than another who is just a crass business&#x2F;tv personality that wrote mean tweets and that rednecks liked. That&#x27;s whether the former has had more political experience or is a smoother talker, and polite company.<p>But that&#x27;s just me, and neither is even my President, so...<p>&gt;<i>Maybe having a Twitter account is a privilege, and not a right, and that privilege is correctly granted on the precondition that one will not act like an asshole.</i><p>No, I&#x27;d say that having an account to social platforms above some population reach level shouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;privilege&quot; but a right (that is, subject to due process&#x2F;law, not up to the whims of the company).<p>Else, those who control said platforms (where the majority of the public frequents and where most of public discourse happens), also control the public dialogue.')
