He was pushed by his parents to learn an instrument. He has complained multiple times about what a waste guitar playing been. He has spent his twenties chasing dream of making it as musician.<p>Now he has finally given up on his rock star dreams and working in his career but he is far behind his peers. His family struggles financially right now. He wishes that he was never into music and was focused on more productive stuff. He thinks his parents wanted him to play an instrument because they wanted him to impress their friends.<p>So the lesson is children will find any excuse to complain about their parents.')
