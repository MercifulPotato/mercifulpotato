Time waiting for a build process is time not adding user features.<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t bother building for scale<p>Correct, since finding the true requirements for scale requires having many users, and the unicorns that you admire had multiple rounds of scale-out rewrites.<p>(You can add Google Analytics to your pages to see their usage. I&#x27;ve seen some companies do this as a lightweight interim APM before. Pages that nobody uses aren&#x27;t a bottleneck.)<p>My current SaaS app has a built-in APM using pre-auth, post-auth and post-load hooks that I added after version 2.0. I learned the auth was slow, but the page generation was fine, so I fixed the auth routine.<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t bother proper code lifecycle<p>Correct, since you don&#x27;t know what the final version will even look like. The exception is if you&#x27;ve done similar projects with a similar expected load, then you can skip a lot of the steps that didn&#x27;t work before.<p>My goal is to write code to Open Source standards, but I realize that rework will be needed later for scale, etc.')
