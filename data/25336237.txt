I&#x27;m totally in support of comments when they&#x27;re used judiciously.<p>To add a bit of context, a tendency I&#x27;ve noticed when I encourage people to answer questions with the code is that they think that means &quot;add a comment in case anyone else has this question,&quot; when really what I want them to think is, &quot;rewrite the logic so nobody else has this question. If that&#x27;s not possible, add a comment.&quot; In other words, a comment should be the last resort for explaining code rather than the first line of defense.')
