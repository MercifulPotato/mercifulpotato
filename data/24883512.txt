Papers don&#x27;t stand on their own because it takes far too long for even a subject matter expert to evaluate one paper, and that&#x27;s even assuming that the paper was written honestly and without fudging the results.<p>Science works on reputation. That reputation is most evident in the form of peer review where trusted members of the community review papers and decide which ones are good enough to get published. It also works behind the scenes in people finding out what papers to read by word of mouth, and people setting there prior on how trustworthy it is by who the authors are.<p>Reputation is built partially (largely even) on being able to reliably publish true and verifiable results, and doing this without ever playing any politics will quickly build a reputation (meanwhile building a reputation by playing politics is next to impossible), but it&#x27;s still reputation based.')
