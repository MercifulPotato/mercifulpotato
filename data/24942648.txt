These days, it doesn&#x27;t really mean much; except that the server goes down. I don&#x27;t get any real advantage from it.<p>I think Medium kind of butchers my work. I have full control of presentation, and whatnot, on my site, and I can do series. There are always links to my original articles, because I don&#x27;t really trust Medium. I could see them try to claim ownership of my work; simply because it&#x27;s on their server.<p>As for people applying value judgements on me for using Medium? Eh. Whatever.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;chrismarshallny" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;chrismarshallny</a>')
