Congress can admit a state by simple majority.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;articleiv#section3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;articleiv#section3</a><p>As to what you consider a &quot;false positive&quot; state, that&#x27;s a political question, and apportionment is not the only political consideration. Congress is just about the best option we have for settling such complex, interstate questions.<p>Moreover, the US has always had lopsided state populations. The 65:1 apportionment population ratio between California and Wyoming (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.census.gov&#x2F;programs-surveys&#x2F;decennial&#x2F;2010&#x2F;data&#x2F;apportionment&#x2F;apport2010-table1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.census.gov&#x2F;programs-surveys&#x2F;decennial&#x2F;2010&#x2F;data...</a>) is definitely big, but it&#x27;s still within an order of magnitude of where we started in 1789.<p>The first (pre-Census) apportionment, hard-coded in Article 1, Section 2, had a 10:1 Virginia:Rhode Island ratio in the House:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;articlei#section2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;articlei#section2</a><p>After the first Census, the largest difference ratio of apportionment population (i.e. population after implementing the 3&#x2F;5 compromise, excluding &quot;Indians not taxed&quot;, etc.) was about 11:1, between Virginia and Rhode Island:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;history&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;ApportionmentInformation-1790Census.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;history&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;ApportionmentInformation-...</a><p>If you were to undo that 3&#x2F;5ths slavery effect, the Virginia:Delaware ratio becomes closer to 12.5:1.<p>FWIW I agree Puerto Rico ought to be admitted, just as the Virgin Islands, Guam, and Mariana Islanders ought to be as well. France&#x27;s DOM-TOM system seems like a better model to follow than America&#x27;s, and it could still happen within our lifetimes; France made major reforms here within the last few decades:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Overseas_France" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Overseas_France</a>')
