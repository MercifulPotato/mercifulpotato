Outside of that it&#x27;s less clear. It&#x27;s still extremely underused for heating&#x2F;cooling. I think there isn&#x27;t much incentive for people to incorporate it at the moment because it mostly saves on long-term costs, but let&#x27;s face it most of our new buildings are made in the pursuit of short-term profit. The technology is also underdeveloped therefore expensive in most cases.')
