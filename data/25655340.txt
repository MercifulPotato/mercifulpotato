Item(by='waste_monk', descendants=None, kids=[25655898], score=None, time=1609917090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655072, text='&gt;There&#x27;s plenty of $60 games released that have less substance than Star Citizen<p>There&#x27;s plenty of similarly priced or cheaper games which have far more substance (in terms of delivered scope, not promised scope).<p>&gt;but it&#x27;s clearly marketed as a work in progress, with no unrealistic promises made<p>Star Citizen&#x27;s kickstarter originally promised to release in 2014&#x2F;15 [1], and they continue to push back that date with no end in sight. This behaviour is literally illegal in my jurisdiction - there are reasonable exceptions for things outside the supplier&#x27;s control, but scope creep is not one of them.<p>&gt;You, like several others, seem to be blaming it for not being something it does not claim nor aspire to be.<p>I mean, they&#x27;ve claimed to be able to deliver a game and have failed pretty spectacularly at that. They claimed to deliver an accurate flight model which accounts for centre of mass, individual thrusters, etc. and as I understand the current flight model is basically &quot;noclip mode but with collisions&quot;. They&#x27;ve sold so many ships for various lifestyles (journalism etc.) but show no progress towards even a vague idea of how those game mechanics would work, let alone implementing them. User created content and modding tools, land claims, private servers, all have been promised and then silently dropped in favour of spruiking newer and shinier ship models. They&#x27;ve claimed to deliver a universe of star systems and are still manually grinding out content for the first star system.<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t bought it, but I just might when it can be run well enough on Linux, with limited expectations on my part<p>I&#x27;d advise you hold off until they deliver something close to a finished game, or even just hit beta, but you do you.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20121019000754&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;cig&#x2F;star-citizen&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20121019000754&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickst...</a>')
