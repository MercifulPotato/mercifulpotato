Matrix (so far) has never been tested in adversarial conditions[<i>citation needed</i>]. While matrix&#x27;s e2ee is an often talked about feature, it is not part of most matrix-implementations. Only riot claims it does e2ee however the claims on voice security are vague. Not clear if p2p or multiparty voice are E2E encrypted. Also you can <i>optionally</i> encrypt text chat rooms (which means it&#x27;s not the default and so it&#x27;s either not used by non-tech savvy users and those who rely on it risk getting exposed due to the extra steps it takes).<p>I&#x27;m excited for decentralized technologies[3] but Riot is not in a state (yet) where I&#x27;d recommend it to exposed groups or individuals. So if neither e2ee is properly implemented, nor does it offer some radical new feature, nor is it actually more user-friendly - then why should anyone bother with it?<p>[1] compete = moderate attempt in getting a name for itself considering that Signal is stealing all the attention in comparison to all other &quot;secure&quot; messengers<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;3120046-Open-Whisper-Documents-0.html#document&#x2F;p4&#x2F;a320485" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;3120046-Open-Whisper...</a><p>[3] cwtch: more bleeding edge than matrix, potentially buggy and certainly not ready for prime-time but they understand that: <i>&quot;your threat-model isn&#x27;t my threat-model&quot;</i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.openprivacy.ca&#x2F;cwtch-security-handbook&#x2F;risk.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.openprivacy.ca&#x2F;cwtch-security-handbook&#x2F;risk.htm...</a>')
