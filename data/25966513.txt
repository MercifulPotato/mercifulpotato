I can sit at a normal desk bolt-upright for a few hours, but not a whole day.  For long coding stretches I don&#x27;t lie down but rather use a weird custom chair I built myself that has my back at about a 45-degree angle to the ground.  My leg-torso angle is still 90 degrees, but (important part) the angle between my torso and jaw is much much less than 90 degrees.  It requires a somewhat elaborate monitor arrangement (I like huge 4k screens) based on a repurposed adjustable-height standing desk.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine this setup working in one of those now-ubiquitous &quot;open office plan&quot; places.')
