To put it another way, US companies are more productive (in the economic sense) than EU companies, and that gap is even wider for tech companies (&amp; those that rely heavily on employing software engineers).  Putting aside the question of whether EU companies have higher overhead per employee (probably true on average), they also derive significantly less value from their employees.  This is the same effect which explains why the few &quot;big&quot; tech companies in otherwise low-paying regions will pay above local market rates (e.g. Shopify, Spotify, etc).')
