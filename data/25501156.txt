I&#x27;ll give it one more go, just in case you are sincere but struggling.<p>That is not in fact my basic premise.<p>My basic premise, is, as I said:  &quot;it&#x27;s worth asking both questions: Is racism really at play? And given America&#x27;s lasting, endemic racism, is there reason to think something makes it absent in a given case?&quot;<p>If America&#x27;s history of racism were somehow only limited to Black people, then perhaps we could dismiss out of hand the notion that said racism could have something to do with a fact-free hysteria about &quot;Chinese Restaurant Syndrome&quot;. But that&#x27;s demonstrably not true.<p>Note that I&#x27;ve never said the two things are necessarily linked. I&#x27;m just saying that we can&#x27;t presume a priori that racism isn&#x27;t involved. We shouldn&#x27;t assume that it is, but we mustn&#x27;t assume that it isn&#x27;t.')
