You don’t think millions of Americans see their money lose its value week to week? Their friends or family being shot by someone trying to steal their cell phone? What does understanding the reality of life in America has to do with my capacity to see the good parts?<p>See how the only point you did not address was (4).<p>Do you still think I missed mmaunder’s point?<p>Besides, the comment mmaunder replied to was comparing different periods, but your argument makes for a valid point that America is a great place for a <i></i>privileged<i></i> immigrant, but let’s not pretend that this is on offer to every American...or the vast majority of immigrants working minimal wage (when lucky, illegal aliens, forced labour, slave labour...) and providing the services you and mmaunder so proudly benefit from.<p>Have a quick look at cost of education and housing vs income growth.<p>&gt; I think you are reading mmaunder&#x27;s comment as &quot;the US is the best country in the world&quot;<p>Not at all.
