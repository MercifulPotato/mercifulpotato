They all invariably raise the hope of a statically typed lisp for the given use case, then clicking through to the linked heading say “this project isn’t focusing on static types”. It’s Lucy and Charlie with the football. If you’re developing a lisp and you’re not interested in a static type system, not mentioning it is good enough. Making it a big headline only to yank it away in the rest of the text is just a disappointing setup.')
