I did not know the a lick of programming ML in Python or whatever language was out there. I simply began by using Matlab&#x27;s Neural Network and Machine Learning toolboxes and playing around on them. That turned into real coding interest on Matlab, which carried on to Python, so on and so forth. In a sense, I rediscovered programming because of those toolboxes.<p>What you&#x27;re doing is great stuff and I hope it encourages a lot of folks to play around just as I had, just to get started.')
