Didn&#x27;t realise there were so many types of twins. Superfetation just seems incredible to me. I&#x27;m just thinking of the perfect combination to produce the maximum amount of offspring for a woman. A quick google says the greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is 69, to the wife of Feodor Vassilyev (b. 1707â€“c.1782), a peasant from Shuya, Russia. In 27 confinements she gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets.<p>If we involved superfetation in Feodor&#x27;s nameless wife we could trivially improve the output by a huge amount.')
