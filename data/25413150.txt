This year ICE cars, globally, are in decline.<p>Tesla will grow 50% on average for at least next 5 years.<p>Also, there has been a ton of money looking for a place to invest for the past 20 years. And there are plenty companies that are investable. Just recently we had monster IPOs from DoorDash, AirBnb, Snowflake and others.<p>At the same time there are many more companies that one could invest in but doesn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s lazy to attribute &quot;lost of money available&quot; to outsized successes like Tesla or Snowflake.')
