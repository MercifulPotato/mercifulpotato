My opinion as an immigrant is the opposite: I&#x27;m clinging to this rock like a tenacious fucking barnacle. And as far as I know, I probably have a better right to it than you. At least I earned it. You were just born into it. I made it here.<p>You can pretend like you gifted me this but in reality you didn&#x27;t. I took it through my hard work.
