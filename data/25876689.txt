That shifts my perspective a bit, thanks. I admit food&#x2F;safety&#x2F;env regulations occupied a different pocket in my head and maybe it&#x27;s less far away from this topic that I considered it to be.<p>I mention regulations in general and not particular one, because the context that you are talking about is placed within bigger context of everything around changing. And once law is put in place is almost never removed.<p>Re forum, collecting emails seem to count as personal data, maybe the amount of work wouldn&#x27;t be high, but researching what do I really need to do, how to register personal data database etc. was high, there were not much info available at the time. AFAIR changes were pretty brutal to me since I was miraculously running on some very deprecated phpBB with a few manual patches which kept bots away.<p>And wow, I think what we currently consider to be a polluted river is pretty clean in historical context.')
