In Rust, exception information is part of the return type, so you can handle potentially-exceptional functions using mechanisms that are generic over any return type. For example, Iterator::map lets you call every function that might fail, and gather the results as failures, even if you don&#x27;t fail-fast. But in Java, the exception information is passed in a separate part of the type signature, so generic functions have to be written differently to also handle functions that might fail.')
