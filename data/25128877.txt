Get a table indoors</i><p>Keep in mind that restaurants are at significantly reduced capacity and those tables are now more widely spread apart.<p>These guidelines mean you are much less likely to share airspace with strangers. Yes, it&#x27;s not as safe as not going to a restaurant at all, but they are trying to balance mitigating risk while allowing some economic activity. It&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>The last time I drove through central Washington, I saw <i>crowds</i> of people clustered together at the front of restaurants with no masks on.
