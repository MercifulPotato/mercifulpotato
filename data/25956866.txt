It&#x27;s like letting a dam fill up. That water is not circulating (please bear with tiny mistakes in my analogies). It&#x27;s staying somewhere and it is ready to be deployed at any given time. If there is a natural disaster or any other kind of pressure to empty the dam then there is a very real risk of a flood.<p>The currency has not been debased. However, the potential for it to debase in the future has grown massively.<p>One day politicians are going to discover sensible policy (maybe Biden will do it, I don&#x27;t know) and somehow magically increase inflation. That same day will open all floodgates on all dams.<p>The correct strategy would be to increase taxes and interest rates and cut stimulus spending once that has happened and we&#x27;ll be fine. Crying hyperinflation is not the right strategy.')
