Now in that instance the people of New York&#x27;s democratic say be kinda futile say in who runs the country as they had no chance.  THAT is exactly how MEP voting choice was in some EU member countries that didn&#x27;t have any EPP representation, say or choice and not a single EPP MEP voted for and yet it is the EPP that runs the EU.<p>Yes the EU isn&#x27;t perfect but when they can&#x27;t even sort out their own accounts and get them signed off year upon year, that&#x27;s not a good sign of leadership or credibility.  Heck even they admit they need to reform, which is sad as they didn&#x27;t admit that until after the whole UK interdependence vote and that vote only came about as the UK leadership went to the EU for reforms and got palmed off with some tokens.   Ironically had the EU even bothered to do any attempt at reform before the UK left, the UK could of tabled another vote as things would of changed and sadly the EU didn&#x27;t do that and more so France been insistent that any reforms do not happen until the UK has left.<p>Remember that the EU was a trade agreement that people voted to join, what it became is something the people had no direct say in at all and that was the root of much divide that has grown over the past few decades.  Me I do feel it is in the best interest of the EU and the UK to divorce as the UK has held the EU back upon many votes and looking at the voting history shows this and the EU could of had better financial regulations decades ago, regulations needed to work with the EURO financial model and that has not been good for the Euro.<p>No tabloid or other such outlet was used to form this opinion, other opinions may vary.')
