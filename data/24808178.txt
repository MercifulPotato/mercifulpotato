I just don&#x27;t understand how it doesn&#x27;t happen to me.<p>I don&#x27;t leave updates hanging about for weeks and months, which explains how forced reboots are not a problem. Forced reboots are your own stupid fault, I have no pity at all.<p>What doesn&#x27;t make sense is that I get none of this crapware on my system. It&#x27;s clearly possible to disable this garbage, I don&#x27;t know how I have done it without restorting to any scripts.<p>Edit: to clarify, as someone who very recently installed Win10 and Office. You do not have to reboot to install Office. Windows had to reboot because some critical update had to be installed, and office <i>so happened</i> to be installed at the same time. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I uninstall a few things after a fresh Windows install (edit 2: and that is unacceptable behavior from Microsoft). This article, however, is way off with the primary complaint: the reboot. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Allow Windows to update, because it really does know best.<p>Edit 3: this is the Verge, who put bloody thermal paste onto a CPU when the AIO had it pre-installed. There isn&#x27;t a high bar of journalism here.')
