Why would you call that &#x27;algebra generated by ganja.js&#x27;?<p>The &#x27;generated by&#x27; in that sentence is referring to the code generation - not the mathematical generators. I&#x27;ll change &#x27;algebra&#x27; to &#x27;algebra implementation&#x27; to make that more clear. (I figured the very sentence &#x27;an algebra generated by ganja.js&#x27; disambiguates the interpretation, but I&#x27;m happy to stand corrected.)<p>Ganja can create numerical implementations for a wide range of algebras (not just &#x27;a certain algebra&#x27;), including any associative algebra (you can give it a Cayley table), although the focus is on Clifford Algebras, and providing the ability to stay close to the mathematical syntax. In order to do that it provides operator overloading, algebraic literals, etc .. (all features that do not natively exist in javascript). Because it is not &#x27;a certain algebra&#x27;, but a wide range, for which the code is only generated at runtime - it seemed a reasonable way of describing what is going on.<p>Thanks for letting me know it confused you - will fix it right away!')
