Item(by='rochester46', descendants=None, kids=[24724563], score=None, time=1602195288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722907, text='This is such an insulting excuse.<p>Ironically, this is almost the exact same attitude I got in my poor experience interviewing with Stripe. Interviewers were constantly late to our calls and mixed up who would be interviewing me more than once. Despite that, I still was told I was going to receive an offer... only to be ghosted for weeks. Once the recruiter finally reached back out, they said the position had been cancelled but they would find me another position. Spoiler: I never heard back from them, and they ignored all of my further communications.<p>Throughout all of this, I was apologized to several times (credit is due there, I guess) and each time the excuse was &quot;ha ha sorry things are such a mess, that&#x27;s just how things are when you work at a start up!&quot; First of all, &quot;haha we&#x27;re a startup&quot; is not a valid excuse for being late to meetings and ignoring communication.<p>Second: you&#x27;re a company worth tens of billions of dollars, have thousands of employees in offices around the globe, and were founded a decade ago. You are not a startup. You are not a &quot;small team&quot;. Stop using it as an excuse.')
