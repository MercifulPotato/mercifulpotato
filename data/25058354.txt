Vetted Deals is a passion project that I’ve been working on. It’s a modern community forum that allows Canadians to share consumer deals&#x2F;tips with the goal of saving money. I drew inspiration from Pinterest for the UI, while the voting&#x2F;commenting system was inspired by Reddit. It’s still in the very early stages, and is still lacking some features and content at the moment. Feedback would be appreciated!<p>Front End: Angular 9 and Bootstrap \nBackend: Azure, ASP.Net Core, EF Core, Sql Server')
