Greenwaldâ€™s accusation that it amounted to censorship was beyond ridiculous. He wanted to publish a hatchet job against a Democrat, based on shoddy, unverified claims and mediocre, unverified physical evidence. The Intercept instead wanted to uphold bare minimum journalistic integrity and even offered to publish the piece if Greenwald would edit out the extremist rhetoric, claims of widespread liberal bias in professional news rooms, and unsubstantiated speculation against Hunter Biden that was purely playing into the hands of a fascist Republican administration.<p>Instead of adhering to these basic Journalism 101 bare minimum requirements, Greenwald decided to throw a tantrum and call it censorship, when really it is plain as day to any fair-minded outsider that there was utterly zero censorship towards Greenwald, the Hunter Biden story was crap and major news rooms were right to ignore it, and The Intercept did nothing wrong in that particular scenario.')
