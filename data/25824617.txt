The American Arbitration Association now requires that a company putting an AAA consumer arbitration clause in a contract must first get approval from the AAA, and pay a $500 fee. See rule R-12 in [1]. The AAA made this rule specifically to stop companies from using bad arbitration clauses in boilerplate contracts.<p>There&#x27;s a database of companies which have registered.[2] BuyForLife isn&#x27;t listed. The AAA&#x27;s reviewers would probably have caught the bogus terms and rejected the clause. A company that didn&#x27;t register can usually use AAA services after registering late, but there are extra fees they have to pay before they can proceed.<p>So the arbitration clause is probably invalid. That throws any dispute into court. Which court? Specifying &quot;Netherland, California&quot; as a venue would invalidate the choice of venue clause. So the default rules on venue apply. Consumers can generally sue where the consumer is.<p>So, any site using that boilerplate probably can be sued in small claims court. Actually, the AAA lets you do that even if consumer arbitration is specified. See rule R-9 in [1]. Consumers usually do better in small claims court than in arbitration. Especially since the company has to send someone, or they lose.<p>Bad contract drafting of one-sided contracts is a great way to create a legal mess for yourself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adr.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Consumer_Rules_Web_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adr.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Consumer_Rules_Web_0...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.adr.org&#x2F;ClauseRegistryUI&#x2F;faces&#x2F;org&#x2F;adr&#x2F;extapps&#x2F;clauseregistry&#x2F;view&#x2F;pages&#x2F;clauseRegistry.jsf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.adr.org&#x2F;ClauseRegistryUI&#x2F;faces&#x2F;org&#x2F;adr&#x2F;extapps&#x2F;...</a>')
