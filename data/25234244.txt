On one hand, dev containers could be really awesome.  Imagine being able to spin up an old dev container to fix a bug in an old project.  Ex: I added a tiny feature to a 5+ year old Java app last year and it took me longer to get the dev&#x2F;build environment fixed up than it did to add the feature.  A 5 year old dev container would have been awesome at the time.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;s going to be used to (attempt to) &quot;take away&quot; our ability to compile locally rather than giving us an amazing, immutable, local dev environment.')
