Item(by='MattConfluence', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606256097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196558, text='&quot;March 14th 2020&quot; is perfectly fine both when spoken and written. It&#x27;s not easy to sort lexicographic by programs, but that&#x27;s not the most important aspect.<p>The problem is that the existence of both MM&#x2F;DD&#x2F;YY and DD&#x2F;MM&#x2F;YY makes dates less than the 13th of the month ambiguous. People do seem to get hung up on not going from smallest to largest unit (or the other way around), but the ambiguity is the real problem in my opinion. And of course it becomes a tribal thing, &quot;the other guys are wrong about their format, we should keep ours and drop theirs&quot;. The best thing would be to just drop MM&#x2F;DD&#x2F;YY <i>and</i> DD&#x2F;MM&#x2F;YY in favor of _any_ format that is universally understood as unambiguous.')
