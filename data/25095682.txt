In theory, it is a fantastic idea to send mental health professionals, without any guns or self defense tools, or any bodyguards (police) to an ambiguous high-intensity crisis situation that seems like it involves psychological distress. In reality, when those professionals come face-to-face with, for example, someone high off of bath salts or PCP, they might have to abandon the scene due to the imminent threat to their lives, which then results in both the drug user and random passerby being placed into harms way due to the government not sending a full complement of healthcare + police professionals to the scene.')
