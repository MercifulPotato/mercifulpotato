You have to be quite motivated.<p>That&#x27;s because the test won&#x27;t change anything. If it&#x27;s positive, they&#x27;ll tell you to isolate your kid. If it&#x27;s negative, there&#x27;s a high enough false negative rate that you&#x27;ll still need to basically treat them like they have COVID (stay home and isolate).')
