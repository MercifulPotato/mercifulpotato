Meanwhile with ads on your own website you can get paid something like $0.002 per user. So if you could distribute the app on your own website and put an ad on it, you would <i>get paid</i> $120,000 for having a hundred million people download it for free. Even more if you use P2P distribution.<p>But by forcing you to use their store, you <i>lose</i> money.')
