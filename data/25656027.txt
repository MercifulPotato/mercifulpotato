If Healthcare costs are rising everywhere, then no-one has a stable solution.<p>And I&#x27;m talking about universal healthcare, not American healthcare; the difference being that there are more than one factors that goes into the end-result of American healthcare, so if you start talking about universal specifically and then switch to American outcomes, you are implying the one follows from the other, and the burden is on you that that outcome is <i>purely</i> due to that one factor (and not, say, a culture of litigation; or cultures of corporate lobbying&#x2F;corruption etc).<p>I&#x27;d also wonder which part of my post drew downvotes. I hope it&#x27;s not that I dared suggest that Obama lied. But that was one reason it was controversial, and that future efforts at something similar are now damaged; who&#x27;d trust a similar proposition when even wunderkind Obama couldn&#x27;t be straight about the deal?')
