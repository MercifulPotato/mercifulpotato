Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606149666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183141, text='Danny you have that 100% backwards.<p>&gt; This whole Tether speculation &#x2F; hit piece is basically people thinking &quot;It&#x27;s implausible people want to buy bitcoin on the largest bitcoin exchanges&quot;.<p>This whole Tether speculation &#x2F; hit piece is basically people thinking it&#x27;s implausible that people are <i>physically capable</i> of redeeming Tether for USD, ever. Not a single audit has ever been conducted - except for one that was started and then the auditor literally quit half way through. If you begin there, the rest all falls into place.<p>Come on, you&#x27;ve got a super shady organization based somewhere between a virtual office in Hong Kong and a corporate entity in the BVI. [0] Who pretended not to be involved with Bitfinex until the Paradise Papers showed it to have the same principals. [1] Who lost banking access repeatedly - being cut off by Wells, before issuing a letter that they were now banked in Nassau, Bahamas with Deltec that Deltec then <i>denied</i> (&quot;The bank previously declined to confirm any relationship with Tether when reached&quot;). [2] For about as long as I can remember they promised to release an audit, but of course, their most recent auditor literally walked out once they got a peek under the covers [3]. Then when Bitfinex (care of Panamanian company CryptoCapital) had $850M seized they just transferred it from whatever mattress is keeping Tether funds and left Tether with an IOU [4]. And are now the subject of 5 or 6 ongoing investigations and lawsuits, most significantly by SDNY [5].<p>If I didn&#x27;t have sources for all this you&#x27;d think this was the most absurd conspiracy theory ever. It&#x27;s all true, though, and what sane person could possibly believe $2B of fresh new money is making its way to their big ol&#x27; Bahamian mattress?<p>Bitfinex is a massive fraud, and Tether is a massive fraud, it&#x27;s plain to see for anyone willing to take a quick peek.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craft.co&#x2F;tether-holdings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craft.co&#x2F;tether-holdings</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icij.org&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;paradise-papers&#x2F;paradise-papers-connection-sparks-massive-bitcoin-lawsuit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icij.org&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;paradise-papers&#x2F;paradise...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;tether-produces-letter-confirming-dollar-deposits-but-bank-hedges" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;tether-produces-letter-confirming-d...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;tether-severs-ties-with-its-auditor-leaving-its-accounts-shrouded-in-mystery&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;tether-severs-ties-with-its-auditor...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;bitfinex-used-tether-reserves-to-mask-missing-850-million-probe-finds-11556227031" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;bitfinex-used-tether-reserves-t...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-york-court-rejects-bitfinex-appeal-over-850m-in-lost-funds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-york-court-rejects-bitfin...</a>')
