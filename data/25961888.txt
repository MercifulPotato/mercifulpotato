This is something I don&#x27;t think I agree with: &quot;Incorrectness is simply not allowed. It’s pointless to try to get stuff done if you can’t guarantee the result is correct.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true in some domains, but I think they&#x27;re pretty narrow. E.g., if I were building an internal API that managed money, I might buy that. But I think the vast bulk of software is essentially exploratory. We ship something minimal and see what we next need. In that context, learning what we really need to do is far more valuable than doing the not-quite-right thing with provable correctness.')
