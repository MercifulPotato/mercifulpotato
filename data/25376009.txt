Absolutely incredible. I love stories like these, but I also understand these hells are probably reserved for the special world of startups. The interesting takeaway from this for me is the question &quot;Was the rewrite successful?&quot;.<p>As an engineer, I understand I&#x27;m a vehicle for success at a startup. Even if I ultimately get burnt out and quit. If I make important changes, that maybe only I could have thought of before I quit, it probably becomes a good investment to hire me.<p>Uber managed to hire enough of the &quot;right&quot; vehicles for success to get to the point where they shipped a platform rewrite at massive scale. By all high level objective metrics, this is probably success story.<p>The one metric I think could derail the projects success isn&#x27;t really documented--what was the human cost to this effort? I bet you looking at a graph of turnover at Uber you could probably identify exactly when this project happened. I&#x27;m curious if the engineering turnover from such a massive effort was enough to offset the benefit.')
