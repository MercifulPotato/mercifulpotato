The user interface is worse\nthan before in every(!) aspect.  There&#x27;s not a single improvement. And\neverything feels slower.  And there is no offline browsing. On a mobile\nbrowser! WTF?!  And there is no way to save websites.  On a mobile\nbrowser, which has very limited connectivity due to its nature.<p>This is just sad. There was a time when I was happy to read about a new\nFF version for the desktop.  Now I&#x27;m just waiting that they will ruin it\nlike they did with the mobile version.')
