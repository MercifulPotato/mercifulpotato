I was homeschooled through high school and taught myself for most subjects during high school - my parents gave me textbooks and teacher&#x27;s manuals, said &quot;ask us when you get stuck,&quot; and I went to town.<p>That&#x27;s largely how I approached college, too - attended lectures, did the assignments and read the textbooks.<p>That was a big mistake on my part - I could have gotten so much more out of my education if I&#x27;d really developed relationships with my college professors and worked with them more.<p>Nonetheless, I did manage to learn most of what was in my CS program that way.<p>I&#x27;m no genius, and I really think anyone with a normal brain can do what I did (given the time and resources  to focus on study).<p>Is self-teaching plus active teaching better than self-teaching plus lectures? Absolutely. You&#x27;ll spend far less time struggling and being stuck, and your teacher will be able to communicate new ideas directly to you so much better than they can to a whole crowd.<p>Nonetheless, I think for most subjects it just isn&#x27;t actually necessary. It&#x27;s a luxury, lovely when you can get it, but not required for learning.')
