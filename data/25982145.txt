And I have experience with cars older than 20 years. So you aren&#x27;t familiar with that breaks on older cars and what doesn&#x27;t. Nor do you know how much it costs to fix the various things that break.<p>So for me imagining going from 20 year year old cars to 30 year old ones is not a stretch. Where for you it&#x27;s going from 5 years to 30.')
