Item(by='35fbe7d3d5b9', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611086859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835867, text='You cannot release your software under the terms of a permissive license, then when faced with a large company following the terms of the license, complain that you should get first crack at monetization.<p>That seems to be the fundamental problem with this whole tempest in a teapot: people have decided on an idea of what &quot;free software&quot; means in their hearts, and many people think it&#x27;s about &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;protecting the little guy&quot;.  That is noble and good, but isn&#x27;t extensible to an existing large body of software with licenses that clearly spell out how free they are or are not.<p>But what is great is that if you don&#x27;t like the state of affairs you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have to suck it up: you just have to pick a license that is better suited to your goals.<p>I have a handful of open source projects on my public Github.  They fall into two categories for me:<p>* Software that is trivial, uninteresting, or easy to replicate: these I&#x27;ve released under the terms of the ISC license (2-clause BSD). I have no expectation it will ever come to much, so I&#x27;m happy to free it â€“ if it ever turns up in the license file of the iPhone or a Tesla or something I&#x27;ll say &quot;cool!&quot; (but it won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not that good ;))  Hopefully someone uses it and it makes their life easier.<p>* Software that is non-trivial, interesting, or difficult to replicate: I&#x27;ve freed it all under the terms of the AGPLv3 and placed a &quot;business use? contact me about the license&quot; note at the top.  If I ever decided to work towards building a product around the software (but I won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not that good ;)) I&#x27;d look at a dual-licensing strategy, but in the meantime it&#x27;s out there for anyone to extend and carry forward and build things on. But I know that the AGPLv3 essentially means FAANG will never touch it because the risk is disproportionate for the reward of using it.<p>This feels right to me.  Your calculus may be different so you can license as you&#x27;d wish.')
