There are a variety of policy initiatives the US could likely implement to bring costs down. My kind of mindset with the company though is I am a nobody from nowhere, and congress isn&#x27;t going to listen to me. I can make cheap &#x2F; sell medicine at an affordable price though. So I will do that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure drug importation will work though, not because it&#x27;s a bad policy per se, but I&#x27;m not sure that other countries will let the US import their low-cost medicines if US law changes in order to protect their domestic supplies.<p>There&#x27;s Canada as an example case. We have ~10x the population of Canada, and California alone could use up all of Canada&#x27;s medicines. Not sure Canada would go for it.<p>Think it&#x27;s worth a shot though. I know there are some trial programs going into place in Colorado and Florida around allowing drug importation. Will be cool to follow and see how they play out.')
