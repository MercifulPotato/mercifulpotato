I have a choice of unions in my workplace. Some are targeted more at one job sector than another - but all of them will gladly take my (cheap!) subscription.<p>I get a vote in the union&#x27;s policies. Employers can&#x27;t require you to be a member of a specific union - or any union at all. You ccany join at any time - or leave whenever you want.<p>What does it take?   Just join a union and get others to do so.<p>That&#x27;s all union is, people working together.')
