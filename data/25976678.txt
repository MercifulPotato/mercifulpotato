They are also likely to call RSS as &#x27;Nazi&#x27; every chance they get. This is also similar to them calling out the brigading by pro-govt people, whereas the truth as you just found out is that they are the ones who are brigading.<p>This is also similar to the propaganda peddled by Imran Khan(Pakistan&#x27;s PM) when he called RSS a &#x27;Nazi&#x27; party. Pakistan is the only country which has institutional persecution of minorities (Ahmediyas and Ismailis) and denies equal rights to any other religion other than their version of radical Islam.')
