If those buildings are really nice, as they tend to be for companies of this sort, they will really want to go back.<p>Companies that have a component to their office space that requires onsite work - for example manufacturing companies with an IT office somewhere on site or big media companies will probably return to onsite.<p>companies in which management is predominantly older might return to working onsite - supposing that more of the older management will see this last year as a deviance and working onsite a return to the normalcy they want. (obviously some older management will be able to see the possibilities but, as an old guy myself, I find that most older people are not as quick to change as I am)<p>companies in which a dominant force of the management would prefer to work onsite will do so. Some people like to work onsite and if they are in management you will do as management wants.<p>finally I know of one company that has recently had a bunch of high profile moves and are thinking it is caused by working from home and the lessening of social ties this implies.')
