Additionally drug companies run ads where they <i>literally tell potential customers what to &quot;discuss&quot; with their doctor</i>.  Honestly I think a day or so of research into how drug companies market their wares would of probably saved this guy $40k.<p>His work is interesting as a free product, maybe as a side project could of grown over time into a potential acquisition.  Slapping a paint of React (or Svelte) on top of his Excel-driven POC and a &quot;show Hacker News&quot; post might of been a better way to go.<p>However kudos to him for not only trying to pursue the idea but also for the write up.  It&#x27;s easy for me to armchair quarterback this one, especially since my father was a doctor who got hammered weekly by drug companies, but I&#x27;m sure his blood&#x2F;sweat&#x2F;tears will pay off in other ways.')
