As it stands, I lost a very large amount of message history when an old iPhone broke.<p>I totally understand your reasons for not enabling iCloud backup, but why not a local encrypted backup via the Files app, just like Android?<p>Even if you feel this goes against your ethos, though I do not understand why that would only apply to iOS, it would be far better to go through a few warning messages and back up my messages than to lose years of conversations with a friend or partner who passed away. There’s hundreds upon hundreds of anecdotal stories where people value this or were burned by Signal on iOS, so clearly it is important to a large part of your existing and also potential userbase.')
