To do that, you need all the merge bases... which can present a kind of a chicken-and-egg problem because, to figure this out with git, you need the commits to be there locally to begin with. I&#x27;m sure you can find a way around it if you put enough effort into scripting against the remote git server, but you might need to deal with git internals in the process, and it&#x27;s kind of a pain compared to just cloning the whole repo.')
