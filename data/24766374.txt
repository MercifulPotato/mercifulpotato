I once was looking into a slow query and had to know that ordering text field in mysql requires a filesort regardless of how much data was involved. which means touching a disk. Was easy enough to make a schema change to a varchar small enough not to also trigger a filesort. But learning that required several hours of scouring documentation and making sure the schema change wasn’t modifying the requirements significantly.<p>Also what’s fun is that the data in the tables can change the explain plan. I got to see this myself when dealing with dev vs prod data.')
