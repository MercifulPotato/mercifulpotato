They did not lose a lot of money, but they lost a lot of credibility. I, for one, found it interesting that all the investigation and due diligence didn&#x27;t catch the fraud before investor relations published their press release. The checks and balances definitely failed in this instance, and I am sure this is not the worst case of such fraud in the history.')
