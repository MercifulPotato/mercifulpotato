In any case it seems thermal grizzly is the high profile brand. The tubes are small (1g) bit you really don’t need much. I put probably a pinhead and a half on the die and maybe a pinhead on the cooler. Watch videos on how to apply it, it’s hard to spread in the beginning because it won’t “stick” to the surface but eventually you’re able to “paint” the whole contact area.<p>Be very careful because it’s electrically conductive. Or use conformal coating&#x2F;nail polish around the die of you don’t trust yourself.')
