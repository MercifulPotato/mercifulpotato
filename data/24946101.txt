It is possible that the original submitted title included this.  I have submitted similarly formatted titles before and had the leading colon-delimited content automatically removed.<p>However, if the submitter will edit the submission quickly enough (within 2 hrs I think), then an edited title with the correction will be accepted.  At least that has been my experience in the past.')
