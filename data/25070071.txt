There is no information available on this planet that has not been influenced by people.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be obtuse. I worry about this problem a lot. Obviously we need to keep companies from doing stupid stuff like storing the first digit of a Social Security number (can&#x27;t identify someone by that!) and then the second digit (also not uniquely identifying!), etc.<p>On the other hand, what if I have web log files that only store URL, timestamp, and status code? Is that OK? If I get hits for two specific pages within a couple of minutes of each other, and there&#x27;s only one person on the planet who would know about both those pages, I know they were visiting my site at that time.<p>People influence the world around them and it feels like privacy laws are trying to prevent companies from understanding that influence. At the same time every other incentive is pushing those companies to understand more.')
