If you have books that you aren&#x27;t planning to read again, consider trading it for a book you will read in a book swap.<p>Just let me know which books you have, and which books you want. I will match you with someone to send your book to, and it is on you to mail your book. I will do my best to make sure everyone gets a book they want, but if nobody has the book you want, I will notify you and keep you out of the pool (unless you&#x27;re willing to receive a random one!).<p>Sign up if you&#x27;re interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;nGo5Q4B15W1oL54dA<p>Some things to keep in mind: Another user will have your address, so if that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re comfortable with, please don&#x27;t give it away! Finally, because of the free nature of this, I can&#x27;t guarantee that everyone will do their part and mail their book.')
