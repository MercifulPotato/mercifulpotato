I personally don&#x27;t have the time to drive to the datacenter to fix something. We&#x27;d need someone who is available pretty much on-demand to manage the hardware acquisition&#x2F;install&#x2F;maintenance&#x2F;decommissioning. We are a very small organization. One extra person is a big deal for us.<p>That said, its really close to being possible. We are going to look at it hard next year. With the density coming out of AMD these days, we can probably solve the capex problem pretty easily.')
