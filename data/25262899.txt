If there&#x27;s no magic, then a third wider would likely exactly decrease the boost clock by a third with perfect code. With SMT off, I get 25-50% more performance on single threaded benchmarks, that&#x27;s because a thread does get full access to 50% more decode&#x2F;execution units in the same cycle. It&#x27;s not that simple again, but that&#x27;s likely the simplest example.<p>The M1 is definitely a significantly different point in the design space. Intel is also doing big&#x2F;little designs with Lakefield, but it&#x27;s still a bit early to see where that goes for x64. I don&#x27;t think Intel&#x2F;AMD have specifically avoided going wider as fast as Apple; AVX&#x2F;AVX2&#x2F;AVX512 probably take up more die-area than going 1&#x2F;3 wider, and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve focused on with extensions over the years. If there is an x64 ISA limitation to going wider, we&#x27;ll find out, but that&#x27;s highly unlikely IMO.')
