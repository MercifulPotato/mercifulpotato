At least this person is talking about free and public cultural works.<p>Finally, a bit of a nitpick, but there was a time when &quot;Doom-clone&quot; was the word people used to describe FPSs. If this person is truly trying to create a 90s game, that&#x27;s actually the better terminology. Granted, it&#x27;s likely not the most common interpretation of the word these days.')
