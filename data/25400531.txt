Because KCDC performed strong infection control procedures during boarding; the medical staff and crew members were trained in infection control; all passengers, medical staff, and crew members were tested twice for SARS-CoV-2; and a precise epidemiologic investigation was conducted, the most plausible explanation for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to a passenger on the aircraft is that she became infected by an asymptomatic but infected passenger while using an onboard toilet. Other, less likely, explanations for the transmission are previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure, longer incubation period, and other unevaluated situations. &quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;11&#x2F;20-3353_article#r1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;11&#x2F;20-3353_article#r1</a><p>asymptomatic transmission is not FUD it is very real. what has not been expounded clearly enough is that the virus is inducing second order effects that are latent to incubation and transmission. the reproductive process of the virus is minimally damaging, with respect to the immuno sequelae<p>when it comes to the chase this is not about asymptomatic transmission, this is about presymptomatic transmission.')
