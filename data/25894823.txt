Wanting a boring detached house and a garden somewhere quiet is generally categorized as NIMBY in these discussions in my town. I grew up somewhere quiet and residential with trees and sky and space, and I liked that. It has a ton of jobs nearby, so it&#x27;s gotten crazy expensive. But if you don&#x27;t want to bulldoze the single-family homes and build high-density, you&#x27;re the problem. Doubly so if you are lucky enough to afford said home.<p>I sincerely hope remote work takes off so the geographic network effects of all the jobs being in the same place are less important. It would make low density much more viable for those of us who want to see the sky and maybe a tree every once in a while.')
