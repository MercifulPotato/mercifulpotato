This is about, in essence, prosecutorial discretion.<p>If everybody was prosecuted for breaking all the laws they didn&#x27;t know existed, everybody would be in prison.<p>Also, the old principle was reasonable when the law consisted of things like &quot;don&#x27;t kill people or steal stuff&quot; which everybody can be reasonably expected to know whether or not they ever read the book where it&#x27;s written down. That doesn&#x27;t quite work when you&#x27;re talking about every obscure detail of the 70,000 pages in the Federal Register.')
