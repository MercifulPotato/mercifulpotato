When I see that, I start with the assumption that what&#x27;s being censored is likely true.<p>The other night, I realized that of the various sources I trawl, some of the best analysis going on to knock down invalid theories of fraud is happening on TD.  (Note that I said &quot;best&quot;, not necessarily &quot;good&quot;.)  Why is this happening?  Because those discussions have been wiped off of most other sites.<p>No matter how you feel about the claims, this is an appalling state of affairs.')
