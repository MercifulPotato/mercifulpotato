Say Toyota releases new electric car, invest $500 immediately in Toyota, Nissan, do the same, etc...<p>Because when the tide turns all that money will go into whichever competitors are still standing and have the best e-car portfolios. Best to diversify.<p>If you could time it right, sure shortsell, but that&#x27;s a HUGE risk, this one not so much...again I&#x27;m NOT a financial guru, my negative bank account could prove that, but it&#x27;s just a hunch I have, a similar one I had in 2013 about bitcoin and kick myself daily for every day.')
