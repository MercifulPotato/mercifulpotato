Such high fatality rate hasn&#x27;t happened anywhere in the world, regardless of the lockdown policy or absence thereof. That being said, I concede that this wasn&#x27;t known at the time of the first wave when strict lockdowns were put in place.<p>Another point to take into account is that the vast majority of covid victims had very short remaining life expectancy. Not to say that their death don&#x27;t count, but it is to be taken into account when comparing with suicides. Rather than number of deaths, maybe we could count number of years of life lost.')
