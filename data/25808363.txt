That isn&#x27;t the same as having their beliefs questioned in a public debate -- which we already do with religion. Questioning isn&#x27;t punishment. Getting fired is punishment.<p>&gt; imagine if he SPLC couldn&#x27;t fire a staffer who&#x27;s an active Klansman<p>The strongest objection to a Klansman is that they commit acts of violence. But violence isn&#x27;t protected speech. If they&#x27;re committing acts of violence, fire them.<p>Whereas if your only objection is that they go home and give sermons against interracial marriage while wearing a stupid hat, isn&#x27;t that kind of the point?<p>How is it any different than Planned Parenthood can&#x27;t fire a Catholic for opposing abortion outside of work?')
