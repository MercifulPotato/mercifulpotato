I was visiting Bulgaria without a smartphone, had a paper map with the street names printed in English&#x2F;Latin characters and the actual street signs were all in Cyrillic. I had to match them up to get around and make the correct turns while walking. It ended up not being that hard, whereas I think trying to learn it in a classroom with a whiteboard would actually be much harder because there are no experience-based memory aids. Like, I remember getting off the train to a big &quot;Централна гара София&quot; sign and was like<p>&quot;София&quot; -- cool, that kinda looks like it should be &quot;Sofia&quot;, I mean, one of the 3 words on the sign has to say Sofia, and the Greek-like &quot;phi&quot; in the middle is probably an f, makes sense ...<p>&quot;гара&quot; -- that looks like a greek capital Gamma, a, something, and an a ... Oh! it&#x27;s probably just &quot;Gara&quot; like the French &quot;Gare&quot; or Romanian &quot;Gara&quot; I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere<p>... so &quot;Централна&quot; kind of looks like ?ehtralha if you imagine л as a lambda and we just learned that р was an r ... and considering where I am, it&#x27;s actually something that means central, like &quot;Milano Centrale&quot; or &quot;Amsterdam Centraal&quot; as you would see elsewhere ... &quot;Centralna&quot;! (actually more like Tsentralna, as I learned later...) Makes perfect sense!<p>But there, I just learned about 1&#x2F;3 of the Cyrillic alphabet within 5 minutes of getting off the train. Somehow that just doesn&#x27;t happen as fast in a classroom.<p>These days people might probably just use Google navigation, and don&#x27;t even use their head anymore, sadly.')
