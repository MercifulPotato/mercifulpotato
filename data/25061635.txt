Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605121460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25058673, text='&gt; My dismissal of the original statement is well explained.<p>No it missed the point. <i>You can&#x27;t play the game currently</i>.<p>&gt; Dramatics: you seem to be a person that understands the problem, understands individuality, but refuses to paint as more than a binary outcome. There are already a million gamers playing games on Linux, there&#x27;s clearly room in the middle, and positive road to the future.<p>I also understand what is true and what isn&#x27;t. With the dramatics I was more talking about the high minded attitude about saving the world by buying the right carrots, or using linux. I used to cycle a lot and many cyclists on there thought they could save the world by everyone cycling everywhere, while buying foreign kit that needed to be shipped over in a container.<p>As for the number of gamers. &quot;Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics&quot;. Saying there is a million gamers sounds like there is a lot. It isn&#x27;t. Those million gamers are like 1-2% of the whole market <i>at best</i> (you can look up the steam stats which I think are representative).<p>I game (partially) on Linux and the extra hoops I have to go through to get a game running isn&#x27;t worth the extra effort when I can just reboot into Windows (which takes seconds with modern hardware).<p>&gt; E-sports: the elite will continue to happen at real venues, but I think there&#x27;s going to be significant growth in the every-day teams. Think five-a-side pub teams. They&#x27;re not going to rent a £15k&#x2F;d venue like Multiplay can, they&#x27;re going to play online and need a way to ensure that all players are playing with the same tools.<p>Never said a pub-team would be playing at a 15k venue (btw local pub footie teams in the UK do sometimes play in the big stadiums). Different levels of competition have a different levels of scrutiny over the process. If I play pool at the local pool club against another team, we don&#x27;t have a umpire on board. It is done by mostly by gentleman&#x27;s agreement and each team captain not causing a fuss. If you see a match on a TV they will have an umpire&#x2F;referee.<p>&gt; A cloud-rendered system does that and it&#x27;ll only become more feasible in time. Yes, there&#x27;s higher latency, but it&#x27;s a known latency.<p>The system they have currently is more than good enough and have none of the drawbacks of your proposed system. The latency problem is never going away with cloud based rendering because it is limited by physics. Gamers have rejected Stadia for the very problems I described (it was wildly mocked for it) and other services are expensive when you can buy a decent gaming PC for less than £1000.<p>Most of them don&#x27;t care about Linux, they want to play games. On my discord (which has a lot of programmers and people in IT) I am the only person that uses it regularly. I&#x27;ve worked at quite a few places as well (I am a contractor) and there might be another Linux user there. This experience matches up with every other statistic about Linux usage. We are very much in the minority.')
