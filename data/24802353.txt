I&#x27;d pay more for a service that lets me serve 12kb-10MB files with &lt;50ms latency on Cloudflare edge nodes but some of them are only going to be accessed once a day or less. My understanding is that most of the time these files would just fall out of the edge cache. There&#x27;d still be the advantage of going through Cloudflare&#x2F;Cloudfront&#x27;s private network but I&#x27;m still going to be limited by S3&#x27;s latency.')
