I&#x27;ve been raised on extremely cheap but healthy food. We would buy 10kg of rice which was cheaper than a single Big Mac menu and cheap vegetables which could be cooked up with rice and a sauce. People claim that eating healthy is difficult when you&#x27;re not rich but I can say from 1st hand experience that this is an ignorant statement to make. Buying prime grass fed beef is expensive, but that is not healthy. Eating beef or lamb 5x a week is actually unhealthy. Vegetables and rice is cheap everywhere.<p>Time is money.<p>The issue really isn&#x27;t that you can&#x27;t live for cheap.  The issue is that living for cheap takes time.<p>It takes prep work to turn cheap vegetables into something edible.  On the flip side, a can of spaghetti-os just requires reheating.  A box of mac and cheese requires milk and butter and 15 minutes.  A bag of potato chips takes 0 time to open.  Most microwave dinners are similarly unhealthy but convenient.<p>Then there is also the problem with culture.  If you are poor and spent your whole life raised on mac and cheese + hamburger helper, guess what you are likely to reach for when it comes time to feed yourself in the future?  It takes active work to move from an unhealthy diet to a healthy one.<p>Then comes the education problem.  It&#x27;s hard enough figuring out what a &quot;healthy&quot; diet is even with internet access.  You&#x27;ll find a bunch of fad diets which push for, frankly, super unhealthy foods based on pseudo-science.  Sure, the healthiest diet is a vegetarian diet based primarily on vegetables.  Good luck convincing people of that.  Especially when their reiki master is telling them that banana and pineapple smoothies will unblock their chakras.<p>In short, health eating requires that you. A) know what it is B) have the time to do it and C) you know how to prep it.  Poor folk are often disadvantaged in all these categories.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthyeating.sfgate.com&#x2F;eating-habits-lowincome-populations-11376.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthyeating.sfgate.com&#x2F;eating-habits-lowincome-pop...</a>')
