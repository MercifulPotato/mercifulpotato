Why 2000&#x2F;2020 in one case and 1995&#x2F;2020 in the other?  In fact, your last link actually goes to 2000, not 2020, which makes it look an awful lot like you looked at that year and didn&#x27;t quote it because it doesn&#x27;t fit your narrative.<p>For the Miami case, it is probably worth noting that Miami is cooler during El Nino events and warmer during La Nina.  Of course, 2000 was in the middle of the latter and 2020 the former.  In fact, if you look at more than 2 datapoints the trend over the past twenty years is the opposite of what you&#x27;re saying.')
