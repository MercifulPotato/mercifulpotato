It was called Beeseek. [0]<p>I knew close to nothing about building a company or a project, or how a proper business model would have helped it. I was the leader (SABDFL) of the group, and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t lead it well enough to succeed. We had some good ideas, but ultimately we failed at building more than the initial prototype.<p>The idea behind it was simple: WorkerBee nodes (users&#x27; computers) would crawl the web, and provide the computational power to run Beeseek. Users could upvote pages (using &quot;trackers&quot; that anonymously &quot;spy&quot; the user in order to find new pages - repeat: anonymously). The entire DB would be hosted across multiple nodes. Auth and other functionalities would be provided by &quot;higher level&quot; nodes (QueenBee nodes).\nEverything was going to be open source.<p>Well, it didn&#x27;t work.<p>Thankfully, because of Beeseek, I met a few very smart people that I am in touch with to this day.<p>Life is strange and beautiful in its own way.<p>Weird, though, that today I still believe that Beeseek could have been the right thing to build. Who knows?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launchpad.net&#x2F;beeseek" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launchpad.net&#x2F;beeseek</a>')
