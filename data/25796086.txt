But I can also understand that there are legitimate constraints that led them to go this route initially (abuse &amp; spam prevention come to mind).<p>I can also acknowledge that it&#x27;s a universally good thing that they are moving in a positive direction here, and I do not hold it against them for being unable to solve all problems for all people at the same time.<p>NSLs are a problem generally, but I have a lot less concern in Signal&#x27;s case because they have no data, and they&#x27;d have to be forced to make significant software modifications to enable targeted interception of messages. This is something I expect they would be motivated to fight, more so than any for-profit company might.<p>Let&#x27;s acknowledge and appreciate progress where it is being made.')
