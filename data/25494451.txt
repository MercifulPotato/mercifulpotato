Item(by='eqvinox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608555149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494193, text='&gt; I am fairly certain that there are already OS&#x27;s designed to run entirely on a GPU rig.<p>A &quot;GPU OS&quot; would still run on a CPU, it&#x27;s mostly about feeding tasks to the GPU efficiently.  The design goals between CPUs and GPUs are strikingly different; CPUs are much more designed for conditionals and branching while GPUs do massively parallelized number crunching.  The CPU is the robot arm that picks and shovels things into the GPU pipeline.<p>My understanding is that quantum computers are very similar to GPUs in this regard, and I don&#x27;t think a classical &quot;OS&quot; makes sense to directly run on either.<p>(P.S.: even more so, I&#x27;d expect QCs to model similar to FPGA accelerator cards)')
