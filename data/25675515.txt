I can quote you numerous &quot;nerds&quot;, such as the esteemed (&#x2F;s) Eric Emerson Schmidt that told us on a public podium that it is unreasonable to have &quot;an expectation of privacy &quot;(a technical legal phrase, btw) when using the internet. So let&#x27;s not blame this on the &quot;smart phone&quot; and usability.<p>In the late 80s and 90s, we had influential technologists that sold what became the Panopticon as a liberating force that would unleash creativity and usher in a new era of freedom. Most now work for one of the FANGs. The rest made a face saving effort via EFF.<p>&gt; If privacy was high-value, any privacy-conscious competitor would&#x27;ve taken the market by storm.<p>Which VCs would fund them? VCs, even our gracious hosts YCombinator, are gate keepers of who &amp; what gets funding.<p>Has YCombinator, with genuine educated and well informed geeks at the helm, ever supported a decentralized proposal?<p>Consumers can only choose from what is on the menu.<p>And &quot;privacy conscious&quot; competitors were not on the menu. Or maybe I did miss these. This is possible, so can you point out which VC funded &quot;privacy conscious&quot; startups failed against competing venture funded centralized systems?<p>To this day, non-geeks are not aware that it is possible for them to have their social apps while insuring their privacy.')
