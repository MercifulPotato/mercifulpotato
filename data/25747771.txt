We know very, very little about the genome. In fact we&#x27;re still discovering new mechanisms of encoding and meta-encoding. We can&#x27;t even say where &quot;genes&quot; begin and where they end.<p>We identified a few single genes in _association with certain risks, but literally nothing is understood in complex interactions and how environment and genetics make for the concrete phenotype.<p>Transsexuality is related to brain anatomy, which... is about the most obvious complex system in the body...<p>Have you had any introduction to bioinformatics at all? Your enthusiastic futurism is uncalled for.<p>We also thought to be at the edge of AI in the 50s, thought the mystery of the brain was about to be illuminated with the introduction of fMRI and weather prediction is only marginally better at what farmers were capable of for thousands of years. Nobody can extensively model even a single cell today. Do you know how prostate cancer cells ultimately always evade androgen deprivation therapy? Me neither. Nobody does. All we are celebrating is &quot;this transporter may play a role&quot; types of &quot;breakthrough&quot;, achieved by extensive experimentation.<p>Humans tend underestimate chaotic complexity...<p>And again, what are you even getting at? To understand and manipulate transsexuality completely, you need to understand and manipulate sex expression completely. It&#x27;s pretty telling that you assume &quot;parents&quot; will chose to eliminate transsexuality exclusively. Why wouldn&#x27;t you rather have intersex humans? There is no inherent value to sexual dimorphism and the sexual evolution likely isn&#x27;t related to survival, but rather costly (see birds).<p>Snails do fine.<p>Clown fish do fine.<p>Sex is overrated.<p>You just want to construct a reason to be edgy on transsexuality... don&#x27;t you?')
