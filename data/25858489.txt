ARM is still extremely dominant and it&#x27;s not likely to go away in the near future. For this class of processors specifically there are basically no competitive RISC-V versions available today, and I would not expect to see any for a few years.<p>I have used RISC-V professionally mainly because it was easier than worrying about licensing a different soft core for an FPGA. I have the same codebase running on an ARM cortex-m3. The RISC-V code uses far more flash and RAM (near 2x for code in flash and stack space in RAM), as far as I can tell because of awkward decisions made by the ISA (there are extensions which should improve this a little but they aren&#x27;t available in the core I&#x27;m using). If it were a cost sensitive high volume application then ARM would win basically on that front alone, the license fees would be more than offset by the cost in hardware.')
