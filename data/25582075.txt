This is especially the case which comes up often where you’re interacting with external libraries or even your own internal, older libraries. For example, if you have a vector, and want to pass its contents to a C API that takes a pointer and length. If it’s a vector of raw values&#x2F;structs, no problem. If it’s a vector of std::optional&lt;Foo&gt; now you’re stuck unless you go through and recopy the whole thing.<p>That being said, I’ve never found the STLs use of initialized allocation to be a problem, but I don’t work in game design.')
