It&#x27;s not a substantive ruling on the merits of anything. And second, it was related to a &quot;tortious interference with business expectancy claim&quot; which required the plaintiff to have a business that was interfered with as a result of the defendant&#x27;s <i>false</i> trademark violation claim, and that harm actually resulted from the defendant&#x27;s false claim. (The case is still going, and both sides have filed competing motions for summary judgment.)<p>The second case was a tortious interfence case in which the defendant also made false allegations of counterfeiting, which led to Amazon removing the plaintiff&#x27;s products from the store, so I&#x27;m assuming you brought it up because you are going to argue that the RIAA will make factually false statements <i>of fact</i> against you if you make a copy of the youtube-dl repository.<p>If that&#x27;s your plan, good luck, because you&#x27;re going to need it. You&#x27;re definitely going to want to hire better lawyers, too, if your current lawyers have advised you that you could beat the RIAA in these circumstances.')
