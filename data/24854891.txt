Most of the control plane is automated, but when that breaks, or there are issues in the data plane, I might log into read logs, look at metrics, force scaling actions, or just general investigation tasks.<p>I also use different accounts for permissions boundaries.  Data shared between multiple teams might go in one account.  The apps can access the data but maybe the interns can only access the app account while the SR. Eng(s) + current oncall have full read only access to the data for investigation.  A second RW-Data oncall might have access to the DB account in each region.  Ever data storage account also has a limited access cross account Data replication&#x2F;backup account.<p>+ I help people out.  &#x27;Can you look at this? . . .&#x27;<p>In the end, there are account specific errors that can be caused in your infra, IAM rolls, keys, throttling, malicious access that are easily prevented with least access in per account buckets.  So I end up with multiple accounts in each region.')
