It makes money, whether in pet feed, animal feed, or stock as someone below mentioned (that&#x27;s news to me).  It may seem unsavory to some but if there were a more profitable use of the chick, it would be used for that.<p>It always amazes me the mental gymnastics people will go through to justify just enough harm in their minds to get what they want (in this case, meat to eat and eggs to eat).  Just accept that these things are bred for fuel, and move on, or don&#x27;t, and be a vegan.  Both of those are fine, but to sit in the middle and pick and choose which you kill and justify it to yourself based on cuteness or anthropomorphizing it is silly.')
