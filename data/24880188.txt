It just didn&#x27;t happen on our soil. We&#x27;ve crossed the line in the past as well.<p>Crossing the line while fighting terrorism was not an acceptable action by the USA but I think it&#x27;s a false equivalency to compare it to forced internment, torture, and reeducation of an entire population.<p>At least the USA pretended to be discerning about who they went after.')
