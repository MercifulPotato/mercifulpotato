In practice, this is <i>extremely unlikely to work in the real world</i> because in reality, this is not some universal constant that is fixed at a particular value everywhere by some physical law - it varies from place to place, from job to job, from community to community, and the ones where it&#x27;s below 1 will end up representing an exponentially smaller fraction of cases compared to the ones where it&#x27;s above 1 meaning that the overall average won&#x27;t stay below 1 for long.<p>Treating R, the number of infections from each case, as though it was the same everywhere is just a way of simplifying the model, but the map is not the territory and we need to be a lot more careful about whether our simplifying assumptions change the overall behaviour of the system being modelled than we have been.')
