We actually are working on systemic changes to try to make this lighter&#x2F;better but I can&#x27;t talk about specifics until the feature is available.<p>On the other hand, any level of specificity is great, for example:\n1) full page loads are slower and more annoying than Transitions (or, vice versa)\n2) loading Home page is slower and more annoying than Search Results (or, vice versa)\n3) waiting for the editor to load is more annoying than X&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z\n4) etc....<p>Even systemic changes require individual work for applying to these different views, so any level of specific feedback would be helpful.<p>(also it looks like HN is limiting my reply rate so apologies for any slowness)')
