Even then I think a lot of those projects have their benefits severely exaggarated because people who propose them then feel pressed to show benefits or embarass themselves. Even if you exclude those projects, I suspect a lot of projects are simply to &quot;get ball in the game&quot;, to build a capability even before there is real need to be able to react to competition. Now, the value of that capability doesn&#x27;t seem so much, this probably leads to many cut projects.<p>Still, probably beats blockchain. There was a time when I heard a blockchain project being awarded almost every other month at the companies I worked for and I still wait for ANY single one of them to do anything useful.')
