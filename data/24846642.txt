Many also suck at teaching computer science. There&#x27;s no incentives in academia to be good at teaching, and many lecturers only care about their research.<p>There are arguments here and on the blog post that the industry doesn&#x27;t have credentials. We do have credentials, it&#x27;s the CS degree, but universities suck at issuing them so we don&#x27;t rely on them much. Sometimes not at all.<p>The people saying, hey, why can&#x27;t we be like civil engineering are thus perhaps not sounding as re-assuring as they hope: why would universities be more trustworthy at teaching civil engineering than other kinds of engineering? The problems are incentive related. Ultimately the software industry is highly egalitarian and a bad university experience can&#x27;t hurt your career permanently, like it could in most other fields.')
