I&#x27;d love to see some data about it. If you&#x27;re buying a plug in hybrid and don&#x27;t have the plug-in part.....then what are you even doing. Like I said I understand that in UK the tax structure is beneficial regardless of whether you charge it or not. But yeah, if people buy PHEVs and then don&#x27;t charge them then it&#x27;s pointless. I just don&#x27;t think that people buy them <i>because</i> they don&#x27;t have somewhere to charge. I got a PHEV not full electric car because there wasn&#x27;t a fully electric car in my price range of the size that I wanted, not because of the lack of charging space .<p>&gt;&gt; It doesn&#x27;t help that where they live in Germany charging the battery at a public charger even when assuming the full ~40Km range is 30% more expensive per Km than filling the tank but this is a local issue that&#x27;s not generally applicable<p>Well, exactly, charging at public stations can be incredibly expensive, in some cases it&#x27;s literally cheaper to drive a good diesel car than an electric one if you&#x27;re charging at public stations. Here in UK for instance Ionity charges £0.69 per kWh, while at home at night I pay £0.05 per kWh. The difference is insane.')
