I&#x27;d love to see some data about it. If you&#x27;re buying a plug in hybrid and don&#x27;t have the plug-in part.....then what are you even doing. Like I said I understand that in UK the tax structure is beneficial regardless of whether you charge it or not. But yeah, if people buy PHEVs and then don&#x27;t charge them then it&#x27;s pointless. I just don&#x27;t think that people buy them <i>because</i> they don&#x27;t have somewhere to charge. I got a PHEV not full electric car because there wasn&#x27;t a fully electric car in my price range of the size that I wanted, not because of the lack of charging space .<p>&gt;&gt;they drove ~2000Km in a brand new PHEV with ~11 liters + 9KWh per 100Km. The manufacturer suggests ~2 liters per 100Km<p>I drive a Volvo XC60 T8 and that&#x27;s completely not what my stats are. My long term average over a year is 3L&#x2F;100km. It really depends what kind of usage you want out of it - short journeys are done without burning any petrol whatsoever. But if you travel long distance frequently then it&#x27;s simply the wrong drivetrain for you. I mean it&#x27;s not a novel concept either - for decades we&#x27;ve been telling people that if you only drive in the city don&#x27;t buy yourself a diesel, but if you drive long distance often don&#x27;t buy a petrol. PHEVs are in a different category where they really really really work well if you&#x27;re just commuting within the EV range but can also go further if you need to. The main problem of high usage when out of the battery range usually comes from the fact that most PHEVs use petrol motors and you&#x27;re not going to see any good numbers from very heavy SUVs with a small-ish petrol engine. Mercedes has it right with the 300de drivetrain where you get about 50 miles of EV range and then a diesel engine after. Like, that just works well on both short and long journeys, but that&#x27;s not what most PHEVs are like.<p>&gt;&gt; It doesn&#x27;t help that where they live in Germany charging the battery at a public charger even when assuming the full ~40Km range is 30% more expensive per Km than filling the tank but this is a local issue that&#x27;s not generally applicable<p>Well, exactly, charging at public stations can be incredibly expensive, in some cases it&#x27;s literally cheaper to drive a good diesel car than an electric one if you&#x27;re charging at public stations. Here in UK for instance Ionity charges £0.69 per kWh, while at home at night I pay £0.05 per kWh. The difference is insane.')
