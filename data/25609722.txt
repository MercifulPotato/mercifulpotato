But, just as an anecdote on the other side, I recently did some Blender tutorials, the famous donut scene by Andrew Price. When I was done I was happy I learned Blender better but I was also disappointed that making 3D hasn&#x27;t changed much since 1995. In 1995 I learned PowerAnimator (predecessor to Maya) and in 1996 I learned 3DSMax. The techniques used to build the scenes are exactly the same, still super tedious. What changed is better renderers, sculpting (z-brush), but not much else.')
