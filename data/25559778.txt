I think the idea comes from the fact that people have this idea of &quot;developers&quot; as people who work for startups or FAANG companies. Most developers work in unsexy industries and in boring places. Insurance companies in Indiana, a hospital Utah, an manufacturing plant outside of Houston, etc.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that middle-aged developers raising families don&#x27;t have time to blog and be &quot;influencers&quot; on social media.<p>That being said, ageism is definitely an issue in the industry. A lot of it has to do with so many companies having an &quot;FTE&quot; based approach to viewing things. Some moron with an MBA and no actual real-world skills sees a 55 year-old developer and thinks, &quot;I can replace him with two new grads and still have money left over&quot;.')
