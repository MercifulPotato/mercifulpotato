Most onshore turbine are 10 more powerful, and Siemens Gamesa has a 14 MW offshore turbine in the works<p>For storage, he is taking totally stupid hypothesis (nobody want to use 100% onshore old wind turbine with no change to the current demand and 1 week of total backup), and one old technology, and is never mentioning demand response or thermal storage...<p>A 100% renewable grid, would require big (profitable) energy efficiency investment, big investment in thermal storage and demand response, some onshore wind, some offshore wind, some solar facing different direction, some biomass, a bit of geothermal power when available, and hydro power like now... Some smart grid and a bit of electrical storage (many different technology available).')
