It&#x27;s not obvious to me. Mixing and recycling timescale of an atmosphere seem very short compared to other relevant timescales of the problem. Impactors, volcanic eruptions... the memory of the atmospheric impact of those events is in the sediments, not the air we breathe (e.g. KT boundary). Finally, civilizations that do not destroy themselves in the short-lived polluting era should move to a clean nuclear fusion era. We are probably ~50-100 yrs away if we don&#x27;t fuck up.')
