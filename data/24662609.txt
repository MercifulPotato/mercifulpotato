Not just for the X11 socket (which is a potential security issue on its own), but also for audio (both ALSA and Pulseaudio can be made to work, but you have to bind-mount correct sockets, use correct user IDs and set correct environment variables) and video (usually hw-accelerated, so you have to install correct opengl libraries for your hardware and keep them on correct versions to match the drivers your host is running.<p>It all works, and provides some benefits (it is also fun, if you&#x27;re into sysadmining!), but it kind of breaks one of the basic promises of &quot;dockerizing&quot; - that the containers are independent of what the host looks like.<p>e.g. I cannot just take the Dockerfile for a video streaming app container from my desktop with a Nvidia GPU, and use it as-is on my laptop with an Intel GPU.')
