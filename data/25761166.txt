Bad.<p>Parler - their &#x27;evileenemy&#x27; was the #1 download (!) on App Store before the ban.<p>There is serious talk of breaking up those companies and issues of &#x27;free speech&#x27; are top spot in the headlines.<p>Empathically - no - those companies do not want to be in that position.<p>I think you&#x27;re misinterpreting those leaks.<p>It makes certain individuals feel powerful, gives them the influence to &#x27;stop Trump&#x27; - but in the end, it&#x27;s a massive distraction for their business.<p>They will be fighting these fires daily for some time.<p>From a business perspective - they just want to make money.
