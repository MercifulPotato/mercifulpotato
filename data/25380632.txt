Have your own set of trusted dealers and vendors. Void warranty for off-branded parts. However, once I buy the car I am also free to go to any shitty unsafe vendor I want. VW can&#x27;t tell me not to do that, because it&#x27;s my car not theirs.<p>Do you think it would be okay if Volkswagen remotely shut down your car because they didn&#x27;t like the brand of gas you put in it (for your own safety of course)?')
