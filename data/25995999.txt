You could probably do that too, if you tried, but you haven&#x27;t in this case.<p>You&#x27;re simply asserting that the ideals used to justify the American war of independence are a sham, and everybody should know it and accept it as resolutely as you choose to interpret it<p>Did you watch the video of Baldwin at Cambridge Union?<p>He gives the audience a first hand account of what it is to be a 4 year old black kid in America.  The audience didn&#x27;t know what that experience was like.  It was literally foreign to them.  They were surprised and enlightened by what they heard.<p>Why do you think the Cambridge Union gave Baldwin a standing ovation?  What do you think they were responding to?<p>What do you think those people, drawn from the 1% of the country that America broke from with Jefferson&#x27;s words to become its future ruling class, learned from that 40 year old son of a drug addict from Harlem?')
