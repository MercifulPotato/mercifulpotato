Item(by='jasomill', descendants=None, kids=[25319279], score=None, time=1607205169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318079, text='I imagine this depends on the configuration of the TV, if only because — if your C9 is anything like my slightly older LG IPS HDR TV — backlight brightness, color calibration, and other settings that affect the brightness of full-scale SDR white can be freely configured in any of the SDR modes without affecting the levels of any other SDR mode, or of any HDR mode at all.<p>In other words, assume SDR &quot;Game&quot; mode is set to Backlight 50, SDR &quot;Cinema&quot; mode is set to backlight 25, all other settings are equal, and, therefore, 100% white is considerably brighter in &quot;Game&quot; mode.<p>Then both values for &quot;white&quot; cannot possibly match a single, fixed level set by any other mode, HDR or otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s therefore impossible for Windows or any other input source to &quot;just work&quot; when switching from an arbitrary SDR mode to a preset HDR mode.<p>Again, assuming your TV works more or less like mine, and mode switches use the most-recently-used preset in the target &quot;mode family&quot; (meaning not only SDR and HDR, but also Dolby Vision, which maintains its own collection of presets), and that the various presets are independent of one another.<p>And if this is <i>not</i> the case, and presets <i>cannot</i> be set independently, then I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have a newer TV, because some of my presets have color settings that are wildly different from standard calibration (e.g., a preset resetting the display to its native, uncalibrated white point and gamut, used with video players capable of internal HDR tone mapping and color correction given a custom 3D LUT generated from measurements).')
