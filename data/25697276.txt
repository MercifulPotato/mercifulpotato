That is not at all the same thing as widespread fraud.<p>&gt; but that would get Trump booted from Twitter<p>Trump has called for and praised violence for five years now. He only got banned after fanning the flames during an invasion of the capitol building. (He literally says stay peaceful but not even anything resembling leave until much later in the day)<p>&gt; It isn&#x27;t a serious argument to say that Trump is bad because his opponents can deduce he means to do secret evil so it is OK to out-of-context quote him<p>You don&#x27;t have to out-of-context quote him.<p>&quot;We love you.
