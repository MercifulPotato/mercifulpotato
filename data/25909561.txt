Failing classes because you can&#x27;t see!<p>Most people don&#x27;t just decide that &quot;hey, today is a good day for me to start wearing glasses, wouldn&#x27;t it be cool!?&quot;<p>For young kids, it&#x27;s usually when they start doing badly in classes or people notice they are squinting. For adults, it&#x27;s having trouble with things like the DMV exam, caught by routine checkups, or when they notice their peers can see much better than they can.<p>I could also give you endless anecdotes &quot;proving&quot; the opposite point, that wearing glasses can slow down or stop the progress, but why bother. That&#x27;s all they are, they are not facts.')
