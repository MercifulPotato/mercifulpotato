It does seem powerful.<p>I think the argument could be made that this is only possible with a language that uses barely any syntax, like the lambda calculus, since how would Python&#x27;s 20+ keywords all translate into a graphical representation while preserving their true meaning (if statements and recursion could be straightforward, async and try&#x2F;except... uh?). But it&#x27;s nice to see that it&#x27;s possible in simple cases, and that alone makes these harder questions seem more tractable IMO :)')
