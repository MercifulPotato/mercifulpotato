I&#x27;d like to be able to deploy lambdas by sending you a Dockerfile and having you build it for me, with as few additional steps as possible.<p>- Make it as easy as possible to run containers that speak HTTP, like Google Cloud Run does. Having a wrapper that translates the AWS Lambda runtime into HTTP calls, maybe even as a proxy I can run inside my own container, would help a lot here.<p>- Make it as easy as possible for me to host my lambda as the &quot;root&quot; URL of a domain or subdomain that I own - without those nasty &#x2F;api&#x2F; path prefixes.<p>Zeit Now (the Docker-based predecessor to Vercel) did this the best in my opinion - they had an HTTP API that you could POST a Dockerfile to and they would build it into an image and then start a container listening on an HTTP port, with an HTTPS proxy in front of it, running on a subdomain that I could easily customize.<p>I would LOVE to see AWS Lambda offer an equivalent developer experience. I&#x27;m super-excited about container image support but I&#x27;ll admit I am absolutely dreading the several hours (to several days) it&#x27;s going to take me to figure out how to actually get my code running on it.')
