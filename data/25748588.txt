I like the differences in the UI that are visible in their demo screenshots and the ability to host my own server would be nice.<p>The biggest difficulty teamspeak is going to face is that users are now firmly entrenched in discord, just as twitch users are firmly entrenched in that product. Why would users switch? I am certainly going to try out the new TS and see how it fares because I just like trying out all of my options before settling on one. Quite a few others that I know would largely prefer to just stay put though.')
