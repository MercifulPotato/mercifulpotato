As of now, none of Trump&#x27;s cabinet nor Pence have suggested intent to do so. I would wager it will take another event of this nature and&#x2F;or a big hit to Trump&#x27;s approval ratings which are very static and unchanged by scandal mostly.<p>There&#x27;s also the option of impeachment and removal. This is significantly less likely as it requires a majority of senators and Trump only has two weeks left.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely he will be held accountable for encouraging domestic terrorism against democratic and republican lawmakers alike. Especially if he wins up pardoning himself.<p>Edit:<p>CNN just reported a source claiming some of Trump&#x27;s cabinet are in early talks about invoking the 25th amendment. Still very unlikely to happen however.')
