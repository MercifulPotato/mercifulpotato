Your justification of why do puzzles:<p>&quot;<i>Finding people that can work together effectively at scale</i>&quot;<p>has no connection to these challenges whatsoever.<p>If this <i>was</i> the priority thing that &quot;big companies&quot; wanted to optimize for, then testing would be focused on a potential managers ability to prioritize and coordinate tasks and&#x2F;or on an employees ability to follow directions and seek clarification when there is ambiguity.<p>Neither of these things is tested with &quot;brainteasers and algorithmic puzzles&quot;. What these things do is make the puzzle master feel smart (typically at the expense of the puzzle taker) and will weed out thoughtful and less self assured candidates.<p>In short, you optimize for the classic &quot;brogrammer&quot;. If that is what you seek and is the culture you want to cultivate, then great. Keep doing your interviews with brainteasers.<p>From my personal experience, I was being second round interviewed for a senior position and the interviewer asked me two questions.<p>1) While at lunch I left one of the lights in the conference room on and turned the others off. Which light did I leave on?<p>2) How many tennis balls fit in a tractor trailer?<p>After the second question, I stopped them and told them this was not the kind of environment I was interested in working in and left.')
