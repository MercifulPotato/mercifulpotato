I also know of one wishing to pay for retaliation attacks.<p>This behavior from market admins is absolutely unacceptable and it will not be tolerated. You have [b]no idea[&#x2F;b] of the ramifications this has, it is way beyond just taking your competitor offline, inadvertadly, but you are causing a problem that is a great deal worse without even knowing it, if market admins wish me to disclose these other issues to them, they can contact me directly and you will soon rethink your poor business strategy.<p>– From here, there will be extreme consequences for any Market admin found to be funding attacks against any other service, market or not. You know who you are and I won’t publicly out you here for it, for the time being.\n```')
