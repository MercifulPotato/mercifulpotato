You&#x27;re looking at the big EU countries and stopping there. Smaller EU countries in many ways feel the same about larger EU countries. Foreign banks basically took over the banking sectors of former Soviet states and then you got things like the Danske Bank money laundering case. When Bulgarian truck drivers tried to use their competitive advantage of lower average incomes, rules were drafted to bar them from it. On top of all that brain drain is still ongoing. The EU as a whole is one of the most unequal economic zones in terms of income.<p>If those countries did things like you propose then there wouldn&#x27;t be an EU or it would be significantly smaller.<p>&gt;<i>Great EU firewall</i><p>I know what the internet is like under the lead of the US. It&#x27;s not amazing, but it&#x27;s pretty good. I&#x27;m afraid that EU-net will be a far worse place judging by how regulated many things are in Germany or how if things are against French (and other western European) interests then EU-wide rules are drafted to stop that.<p>Large EU countries along with the EU work as a good counterbalance to the US when it comes to the internet. But I fear that if you remove the US from the equation then you end to with something worse.')
