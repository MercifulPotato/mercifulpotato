If you add all these costs, such as electricty cost (3W * 24hr * 31day &#x2F; 1000 * 0.15$&#x2F;kwh ~ 0.33$&#x2F;mo), it&#x27;s hard to be both profitable and competitive.\nI&#x27;d pay maybe 2 or 2.50$ &#x2F; mo, but I&#x27;m probably not a good example because I like running my own RPi at home and be able to tune things.\nNice project anyway, good luck for staring your service!')
