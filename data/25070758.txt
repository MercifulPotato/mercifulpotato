Your experience in not suffering from discrimination clearly invalidates all of the millions of people who do. It&#x27;s clearly all in their head.<p>It boggles my mind on people&#x27;s basic inability to realize that not everyone has the same experiences in life as them. And rather than accept other peoples experiences as valid, it&#x27;s always the same argument of &quot;I haven&#x27;t had to deal with this therfore they don&#x27;t either.&quot;<p>Yes they want to be in a situation where they can just ignore it and it won&#x27;t be an issue, the problem is they don&#x27;t have that luxury. It&#x27;s great that you do, but that doesn&#x27;t change their circumstances.')
