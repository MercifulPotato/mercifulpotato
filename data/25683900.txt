In 2010 my son was unwell, having issues with lethargy, balance and vomiting. We took him to the local children&#x27;s hospital and he had a CT scan within 2 hours and an MRI an hour after that.<p>As part of his ongoing treatment the hospital scheduled an MRI every 3 months for a year, then every 6 months for 5 years, and now it&#x27;s annual. The scans happen on time every time.<p>Waiting lists are prioritized based on urgency.')
