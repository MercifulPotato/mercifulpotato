One is carrier grade NAT (CGNAT), which is used by ISPs that have run out of IPv4 addresses so you don’t get a real public IPv4 address, although you should have a public IPv6. If you’re unlucky enough to be on one of thee ISPs there’s likely not much you can do.<p>The other issue is ISP provided gateways that handle authentication onto the ISP network, like ATT fiber. These devices contain the certificate&#x2F;keys to gain access to the network. Unfortunately theses devices also try to be more than just an auth device&#x2F;gateway. In ATT’s case the gateway also handles some Uverse&#x2F;IP TV services so they don’t have a true bridge mode where they send all traffic to another device. This approach then causes issues like update downtime or NAT table issues.<p>Either of these issues shouldn’t be caused simply by an ISP provided router. If an ISP wants to implement either approach they will do so without your approval.')
