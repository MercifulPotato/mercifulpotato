Item(by='afryer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610642228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775872, text='I recommend the book: Agile Data Science by Russell Jurney[1]. The tech stack is circa 2017, but the chapters on the Agile Data Science Process and Teams are timeless.<p>He clearly articulates team roles: from Biz Devs, marketers, PMs, UX designers, UI designers, Web Developers, API Engineers, Data scientists, Applied researchers, Platform&#x2F;Data engineers, QA engineers, DevOps Engineers.<p>Then he talks about different ways to increase agility by combining these roles into generalists empowered to iteratively explore the &quot;pyramid of data value&quot; until the right product-market fit is found.<p>Building Data-science Intensive Web Applications is inherently waterfall, not agile, and I find this book to be a fascinating reference.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;view&#x2F;agile-data-science&#x2F;9781491960103&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;view&#x2F;agile-data-science&#x2F;9781...</a>')
