There should be better integration between the two, eliminating the need for &quot;hacks&quot; such as replacing stylesheets by JS styling (popular with React, for example). Writing variable-based dynamic CSS is too hard. SASS and other variants don&#x27;t solve the problem because they are compile-time, not runtime technologies.')
