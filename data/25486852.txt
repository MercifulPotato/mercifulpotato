That&#x27;s because moral culpability is in the heart to start with.<p>Folks don&#x27;t sign up for the same worldview, sure. And it&#x27;s a nonsense (perhaps harmful) worldview if you reject Christian teaching altogether. But there&#x27;s a lot more subtlety, realism, and (from their perspective) care for people than is captured by concerns about cheating and symbolism.<p>More concretely, there is a lot of excitement to see progress on modern slavery and human trafficking in many Christian circles. The intersection between pornography, sex work, and sexual slavery is especially concerning in those circles.')
