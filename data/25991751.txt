Since I would already need to give an application access to my data, I might as well have them host it for me.  It still feels like Solid is a more complex and harder-to-reason-about solution to the same problem that GDPR data takeout tries to solve.  Consistent open standards are nice, but it doesn&#x27;t take that much work for Facebook (or others) to accept a Google Photos takeout dump as an input format.<p>If the only real problem that Solid solves is &quot;I loose my data if provider X locks me out or goes bankrupt&quot;, then it isn&#x27;t even good enough since the third-party pod-hosting company can have the same failure mode.  Maybe we should expand on GDPR data takeout legislation to require something like API-driven access that would allow people&#x2F;companies to build automated backup&#x2F;export solutions.<p>That becomes a much simpler thing to build and get buy-in for instead of a whole new paradigm which companies aren&#x27;t incentivized to follow and is hard for users to understand.')
