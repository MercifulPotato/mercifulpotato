Canon finally release drivers in November. The image quality amazing. It&#x27;s also a bit overkill though to use a (back then) 1400â‚¬ camera to act as a webcam (also hard to compare with default webcams at that price point), but as long as I&#x27;m not using it otherwise, I think it&#x27;s ok :)')
