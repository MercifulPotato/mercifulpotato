Give the user a logout option which leaves nothing but ciphertext on the device (e.g. by encrypting any plaintext keys with the passphrase). To login again you need a passphrase. Then as long as the user has enough time to click logout they are safe even when the device is out of their hands. Of course, after that, it might be prudent to consider the device compromised, and thus not login again afterwards in case it has been backdoored.')
