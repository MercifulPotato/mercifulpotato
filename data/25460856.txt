It&#x27;s proponents call it &quot;supply side economics&quot;. It is a discredited theory, but it is still popular idea among many serious people in public policy.<p>If you want want a name of one (in)famous proponent, I&#x27;ll give Arthur Laffer, inventor of the Laffer Curve. The curve says that as tax rates fall, government income goes up due to economic growth. You may have heard of this as, &quot;Tax cuts pay for themselves.&quot; He famously invented the curve while drawing on a napkin. The napkin is now housed at the Smithsonian.')
