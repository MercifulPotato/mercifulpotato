That&#x27;s the problem. People don&#x27;t believe he would be so inclined. However, there&#x27;s no sign of him not meaning what he says, even when it&#x27;s to troll for attention. The risk there is him going through with what he says, and not standing up for principles but rather tearing them down. Why? His agenda is simply to satisfy his own infinite craving for attention and likes. Though where are the limits to the means for attaining such a goal? They seem to diminish in time, which is pathological.<p>Such populists play on the fears and anger of the people. There is real inequality in USA, but the masses bet on the wrong horses again and again. Why? Because the privatization of media assures that billionaires set the agenda every day.<p>It seems high time for a third party, a middle ground, to be made. Because Democrats are too wide, too divided, and thus end up being too extreme. Ie. their stance of unlimited abortion until birth, <i>is</i> extremist in any country. But with the failed two party &quot;system&quot;, they end up alienating most of the republican voter base.<p>This is all frustration playing out due to failed two party political system and the billionaires that ensures the status quo on both sides. The problem is when people become too frustrated, but it is a hard problem who to turn to for aid.')
