You can also get Xenophon&#x27;s <i>Hellenika</i> to follow that up, as he continues directly where Thucydides left off and goes up to the Theban triumph over Sparta.<p>Where Xenophon really shines though, is <i>Anabasis</i>, the story of his own campaigning. I have the Loeb version of this and it&#x27;s good.<p>Landmark Ancient Histories also have an edition of Arrian&#x27;s Alexander you may like, which would begin just a few decades after the end of Hellenika. I prefer this when they&#x27;re available - they are very richly annotated with maps and other supplementary information to help you keep on track.<p>For Hellenism and Ptolemaic Egypt, Polybius is probably worth a shot. I can&#x27;t think any other ancient writers that really go into detail on them.')
