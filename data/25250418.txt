There are deeper tech specializations beyond just “software development”<p>Around my 30s I knew I wanted to stay technical and not go into management. I ended up specializing in search engines (like site search using Elasticsearch). I intentionally pushed hard into a personal brand and skills around the niche. It’s a very in demand space. It’s very hard. I still write lots of code. But it’s combinddd with domain knowledge, data science, nlp, and lots of other cool fields.<p>I have other friends that have specialized based on other opportunities their careers have presented them, including:<p>- legacy software refactoring and management<p>- native C development<p>- wireless protocols<p>- operating system internals and drivers<p>- A&#x2F;B testing<p>- MySQL performance<p>- JavaScript front end performance<p>- Various scientific fields where coding is useful<p>There’s so many niches in demand that it’s really hard to think of software development as “one thing”. It really behooves you if you want to stay technical to build a brand around a consistent focus area that interests you. You’ll have more fun AND make more money.')
