Tesla&#x27;s Supercharger customers are Tesla owners (for the most part), and Tesla has a vested interest in keeping them happy.<p>Other charging stations are mostly installed in mall parking lots and so on by government mandate. The owners of the parking lots pay to get them installed and maintained--they are the customers. And since they&#x27;re (mostly) satisfying a government tick box, there&#x27;s not nearly as much incentive to keep functioning.')
