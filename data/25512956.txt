You&#x27;re not allowed to boobytrap your property, but beyond that you won&#x27;t be held liable for burglars injuring themselves.<p>I mean, if instead of glitter and fart spray the thing was wired specifically to explode and kill the thief, the argument &quot;they stole my explosives and blew themselves up&quot; won&#x27;t hold water.<p>I&#x27;m curious what a court would rule on this matter - anywhere from fart spray over property damage to death.')
