Which was what we were needing. Unfortunately our data was just not well handled by DRF, and serialization from PG &gt; Python &gt; JSON was absolute horrendous. So we love the speed we are getting with FastAPI.<p>Now you do lose a lot of things. There is no more Django ORM, so we are back to using SQLAlchemy. I don&#x27;t think this is bad, but definitely different.<p>You also have to write a lot more specs, and such. Which can be annoying, but not too bad.<p>It also encouraged us to go over to type hints on the whole code base and has save from a few bugs as well.<p>Overall we really like it, not sure I will go back to DRF on any future big projects. Still handy for something quick, but not what I want to be using moving forward.')
