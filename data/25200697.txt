Item(by='simiones', descendants=None, kids=[25200879], score=None, time=1606239065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200273, text='&gt; If someone creates a derivative work (e.g. crazy colors), that new person does own the copyright in the new &quot;crazy colors&quot; version, but they don&#x27;t own the copyright to the black and white version.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is true at all - as far as I know, copyright on a derived work belongs entirely to the copyright owner of the original work.<p>If I create and sell prints of a Game of Thrones character, I am infringing HBO&#x27;s copyright, and any money I make are owed to HBO legally. If you then create T-Shirts with my print and sell those, you are also infringing HBO&#x27;s copyright, and all the money you make is also HBO&#x27;s legally - you don&#x27;t owe me 1 cent, since I had no right to copy HBO&#x27;s work in the first place. If HBO wants to sell T-shirts with my print, they don&#x27;t owe me anything.<p>However, patent law does work like you mention - you can have a patent on a technology, and I can have a patent on an enhancement over that basic technology. I can&#x27;t create a product based on your base technology if you don&#x27;t want me to, but you also can&#x27;t create a product based on my enhancement if I don&#x27;t want you to.')
