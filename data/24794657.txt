All within 5-20mins walk of good places to go.<p>An average town may have more people, but they are spread over miles in houses or flats. Unless you live right in the town centre the convenience of going out to eat&#x2F;drink is just not the same.<p>Popping out after work with friends (or just colleagues) is convenient for everyone as well. At home you have to round up  your mates and all agree on a time.')
