My favorite series of all time is the original, British version of The Office. While I believe it also did not have a planned, proper ending, it was only a few seasons.<p>I never enjoyed the US version as much and lost interest after a few seasons.<p>Despite incredible earlier seasons, have also failed to finish many others, including 24, House of Cards, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, etc. Just end it!')
