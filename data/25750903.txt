Those shortcuts work in pretty much every MS OS from the early 1990s until recently. Linux has been a mess, but KDE has been pretty decent at enforcing global shortcuts.<p>The past 5 years though have been a nightmare, MS has really messed their UI up, and various applications&#x2F;toolkits or whatever the problem no longer properly support the CUA guidelines which in the past were the one assured way of doing an operation cross applications and various OSs (windows+linux&#x2F;kde).<p>Maybe its time to start going to a few developer conferences and giving talks about how useful system wide shortcuts that work across multiple OSs really are.')
