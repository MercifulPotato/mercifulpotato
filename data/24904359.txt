I no longer have to worry about the safety of handing my card number out over the phone. I no longer have to wait for a new card if the old number gets compromised. I no longer have to deal with completely inept new card processing agents who fail to actually send the card to the right address while I&#x27;m traveling after half a dozen tries and they keep just sending the damned thing to my house which they know I&#x27;m not at.')
