Working in game dev, I found some of his thoughts around prototyping, production, and design to be insightful and gladly would have read more of those. I also would gladly have read more about Sid Meier&#x27;s CPU Bach, since that was ahead of its time and seems interesting algorithmically. His stories are a bit more interesting in the early years and the end of the book drags a bit, as he goes from Civ IV to Civ V to Civ IV.')
