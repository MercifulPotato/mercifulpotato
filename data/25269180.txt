Throughout the year whenever you hear them say &quot;I love X author&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m getting into Y hobby&quot; then add a little note under their name. These can be as simple as &quot;Coconut La Croix is their favorite seltzer flavor and brand&quot; to as complicated as &quot;They have complained about a slow computer that you know you can upgrade the ram&#x2F;ssd&quot; and the list goes on. Then when it come time to decide on a gift you have reflect back on our list.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly helpful for me and led to gifts that have been very appreciated and used over and over. I think back to a dog seat cover I got for a friend after hearing them talk about taking their dog hiking a lot. They called me about a month after they got the gift out of the blue and said something like &quot;I&#x27;ve used this dog seat cover tons of times already and it makes taking the dog so much easier&quot;. That cover was less that $30 easy but it was more impactful than if I had spent $100 on them. That same person I got 3 months of BarkBox for them at one point and I heard about how much they enjoyed that for multiple months after the last box shipped and every time I went over they would talk about &quot;Our dog loves this one toy that we go in the box&quot;.')
