This is why the net transparency is not great over high-latency connections, it was never designed for that. In those days companies only had a handful of &quot;computers&quot; and people worked on terminals. Usually shared over a 10 megabit shared ethernet bus, which was surprisingly responsive!<p>However they were more than a simple terminal. Most of them were basically small Unix computers (like the SPARC X-terminal which was just a diskless low-powered SPARCstation, it could actually run full Solaris). HP&#x27;s EnvizeX stuff was similarly complex though I don&#x27;t think they could run HP-UX. But they weren&#x27;t nearly as &#x27;dumb&#x27; as the text terminals of the days.<p>I still have a few Sun Rays here but they used a very different protocol that only worked with their proprietary software.<p>However I do expect a return of this model. Now with the cloud, a lot of computing is once again shifting to a central model rather than on the endpoint.')
