It&#x27;s the same tirh the death penalty. The problems with it are plain for all to see. But lawmakers feel the need to signal the virtue of &quot;justice&quot; or &quot;strength&quot; and enough voters still respond to that signal. Even in the supposedly lefty stare of Washington where I reside, progress on criminal justice issues has been glacially slow.')
