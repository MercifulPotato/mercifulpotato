Item(by='ryeguy_24', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610671229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taskflowy-9a9aa.web.app&#x2F;demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taskflowy-9a9aa.web.app&#x2F;demo</a> (desktop browser only so far)<p>The idea is a daily note&#x2F;task management tool combined with the WorkFlowy concept of infinite lists. The real use case here is for heavy note taking and also tracking the todos within all the notes. I found that with WorkFlowy I had so many buried todos that I could never see them in one place and manage them throughout the day. It’s great for notes, but wasn’t working for tracking tasks.<p>It allows you to prioritize the tasks at every level. You can zoom in on certain nodes to see only the tasks relevant for that node and descendants. It seems to actually work for me but would love to talk to people who haven’t found a note&#x2F;task tool that works for them yet.')
