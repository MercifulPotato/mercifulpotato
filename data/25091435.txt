The planned route between Hamburg and Berlin, which is not even 300km, was shelved because the estimated costs exploded. The DB (German Railway) gets 2.5 billion EUR funding per year for its train network, which is 38.500km, so it&#x27;s really not that much. The Transrapid wouldn&#x27;t even have been significantly faster, since there were three stops planned between Hamburg and Berlin. And both the Transrapid and the ICE were&#x2F;are built by Siemens, so there&#x27;s not reason to think they would have been more reliable.')
