I use emacs for org mode only, but I use it all day long to keep notes, track todos, document projects, write prose and messages. Sometimes, I think something is worth publishing, so I mark it with the appropriate tags, run the publish command and let syncthing update the websites.<p>I have used hugo for a dozen significant project and I like it. I have chosen hugo over the alternatives because I prefer go to javascript, ruby and python in almost all possible regards. \nI even teach classes to journalism students with hugo and gitlab.<p>Static site generators are great for &quot;projects&quot; but as a individual willing to share some mildly interesting content as a side effect of his daily activities, I still consider them too much work and maintenance.')
