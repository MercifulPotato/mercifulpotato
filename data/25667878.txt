They&#x27;re not the ones who would be asking for reinforcements to help secure the Capitol, they&#x27;re one of the potential <i>sources</i> of reinforcements for the agency that is responsible for protecting the Capitol.<p>The mayor&#x27;s request was basically that the Feds not unilaterally start escalating and militarizing police efforts in her jurisdiction without her involvement. In hindsight, that does seem to have been the correct strategy for <i>her</i> police department, because all the violence seems to have been concentrated within the jurisdiction of a different police department.')
