The number of parts&#x2F;unit differs by an order of magnitude and so does the size and weight, not to mention manufacturing techniques and materials. These are capabilities, not so much skills, and they aren&#x27;t as transferable as you may think.<p>For instance, logistically things are very different in the automotive space. Many, many more people are required to ship a single unit. You also have many more variables that can hold up a production line anywhere in the hierarchy because you rely on more 3rd parties for parts. While these things are also true of consumer electronics, you may rely on a dozen suppliers for an iPhone, car companies often rely on hundreds.<p>Materials are also very different in the automotive space. You have to build with materials that will last 100k miles driving a 80mph in all weather, day&#x2F;night, freezing&#x2F;scorching etc etc. It is a very long tail to cover. Apple can do it, but it will take years and many, many partners to get it done.')
