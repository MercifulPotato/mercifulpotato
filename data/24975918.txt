I&#x27;ve invested significant time this year into developing and improving support for Hololens (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuplex.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vuplex.com</a>), and as part of that, I&#x27;ve gotten an interesting glimpse into the kinds of industrial applications that Hololens is being used for today. For example, several of my customers are creating bespoke applications to aid high-end manufacturing, like displaying instructions for aircraft assembly. Another application I&#x27;ve seen multiple times is remote assistance for field technicians. Although I still have a lot on my roadmap for 3D WebView, I think a lot about the kinds of problems that can be solved with AR and the ramifications of AR headsets becoming more affordable and accessible over time.')
