It said that before you claim that thing X and thing Y are related, take a look at this page that goes through the claims and debunks them.<p>If the answers on that page are mistaken and it is relevant to a topic on HN then it seems logical (to me) that you could discuss it here (but unfounded political allegations should be off-topic in most HN chats in my opinion).')
