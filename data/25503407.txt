It reads like propaganda and doesn&#x27;t really discuss anything about the specifics of the hack while accusing reports of the same.<p>There is a serious lack of good reporting on this subject. We need a communicator that understands the details of what has been put out and what it would take to do a supply chain attack like this.<p>I agree that it could for sure be 1 in 20 DEFCON attendants. But the motive and risk don&#x27;t match. It&#x27;s a state actor, very likely. Russian is also VERY likely.<p>I would need to look into the authors history more to say if they have a clue or not. I question why two of them needed to be involved to write this pointless handful of paragraphs.')
