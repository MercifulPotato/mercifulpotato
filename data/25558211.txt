We need more of everything in OSS (funding, testing, support, etc) but the simple &quot;thank you for your time, your efforts, your well crafted PR, your project that helps me accomplish X, Y, Z...&quot; go a long, long way. I try to do this at work. Anytime I get help on something big or small I always say thanks, thanks for taking the time, thanks for explaining it, etc, because I know they&#x27;re busy just as I am.<p>To all the people out there working on code that we all use and build on top off thank you!')
