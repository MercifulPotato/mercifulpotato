I actually have a pretty well-equipped office with keyboard tray, dual monitors, and HM chair. But I actually work a fair bit in a nice sunny room with a fairly cheap but comfortable Ikea chair that leans back and a foot rest. I work in that with my laptop just on my lap if I don&#x27;t need a bunch of screen real estate.')
