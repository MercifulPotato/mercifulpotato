It&#x27;s just that it happens that something relatively significant regarding politics and technology happened lately, and it&#x27;s top of mind for my commenting.<p>I was &quot;deplatformed&quot;--aka fired--from my tech job a couple months ago for political views.  This is not a neutral issue.<p>Thankfully I can retire, but not all people are so lucky.  What&#x27;s sad is that after 24 years of coding day and night, this issue so significant I refuse to continue to work in the tech industry.  I love technology, but we&#x27;re at the point where this industry isn&#x27;t about technology any longer.')
