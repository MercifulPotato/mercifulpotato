It seems so counterintuitive and just aesthetically displeasing. Like there&#x27;s huge swaths of software where this sort of paradigm just makes no sense (&quot;click to evaluate&quot; your Excel file, and then paste i there?)<p>Like OK, cool, I get an email and I can middle-click it there to run it instead of.... I guess opening a text file and putting it there and hitting enter?<p>Not to mention that limiting yourself to text really limits how far this metaphor can go.<p>I do realize that there&#x27;s limitations of the time, and that for the time it would be way better than, say, Win 3.1. Just like.... it feels like an evolutional dead-end (compared to say, Smalltalk-y OS&#x27;s whose concepts have lived on in things like browser dev tools and SFDC&#x27; Apex environments).<p>I don&#x27;t mean to yuck too much on anyone&#x27;s yum, just feels like there are better ideas out there at this point.')
