It&#x27;s still under development so more specs will be released later on.<p>&quot;Unfortunately&quot; the entire design is based around ESP8266 to make it cheap and easy for people to modify so wifi is the current option but if there&#x27;s interest for other alternatives, anything is possible.<p>Since the rotator uses simple HTTP GET queries for the azimuth and elevation, it should be possible to make it compatible with other ethernet enabled positioning software.')
