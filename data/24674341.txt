You assume these attacks aren’t targeted just because we haven’t seen them, but it wouldn’t be hard at all for an attacker to take control of a package through some means (purchase, social engineering, or just solving a problem more efficiently than others do and aggressively asking others to adopt it), then publishing to npm a minified version of the package which includes some targeted exploit that doesn’t activate except in a specific environment. The source on GitHib would ofc not include the exploit, and there’s no push for reproducible builds in the npm world so verifying that npm’s minified JS was built from the GitHub source is nontrivial and not something most shops would bother with.')
