I’ve done the weekend trip from SF a few times and with the long drive, the traffic (everyone has the same idea), the cost of hotel, trying to fit everything in a couple days, etc, I find it more stressful to take a weekend trip there than I find it enjoyable. Living there would be great but calling it a perk of living in San Francisco is a bit of a stretch for me. If your criteria for a good place to live is having a beautiful place within a 4 hour drive, then a lot of the USA is included in that. I want to live <i>in</i> the nice, beautiful, low-stress place.<p>But again, it seems to be a very personal preference. Maybe for some people having the ability to drive 4 hours to get somewhere amazing is a good balance to the things they love about living in San Francisco. I don’t consider it close enough to be a factor in my opinion of SF though.<p>Edit: I’m not trying to get into an argument about how amazing or horrible the Bay Area is. I’m just saying that some people find it amazing but other people actually would prefer to live in (the suburbs of) Detroit or elsewhere. I have no idea the percent of people in each group, but I don’t think we should take for a given than if all big industry leaves the Bay Area, that it will still be as popular as it is today. Not everyone loves it that much.')
