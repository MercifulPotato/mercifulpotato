This isn&#x27;t a retrospective that makes any sense.<p>No YouTube, no Snapchat etc.<p>With YouTube Google used their position to keep it that way.<p>It also wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if someone told certain app developers that &quot;that&#x27;s a nice app you have there, it would be shame if there was a bug in the Play store that made it hard ro find&quot;.<p>When it comes to App Store I have heard it is pretty well established that you won&#x27;t get featured, no matter how great your app is if it is available on other platforms.')
