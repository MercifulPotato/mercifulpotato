Domestication is an act or process before it is a characteristic.<p>Part of the point of the article was to argue that users shouldn&#x27;t be treated as livestock by companies; they should be served by vendors rather than be in service of vendors. I <i>wanted</i> people to think it&#x27;s bad to treat normal users as lesser beings to be exploited.<p>In other words: you&#x27;re right. My article agrees with you.<p>If you think the message wasn&#x27;t communicated clearly enough, I&#x27;m open to suggestions on how I could clarify this.')
