Item(by='nikisweeting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607352527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326870, text='From my understanding that was due to a long-running design philosophy clash between the systemd people thinking Docker should be using systemd primitives to manage things like unit startup&#x2F;shutdown&#x2F;etc., and the docker people wanting to use their in-house implementations so as not to depend on systemd (and thus rejecting PRs trying to change docker behavior to use systemd). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to use that as an example of toxic behavior on either side, they each had their motivations, and a consensus needed to be reached for both projects to proceed. From what I can tell that debate seems to be old news these days and I haven&#x27;t seen as much clashing between those teams. I am not a developer on either side though, this is just from the perspective of a user who follows the Github issues.')
