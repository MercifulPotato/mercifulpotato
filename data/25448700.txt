Minikube runs in a VM. But we have to set it up somehow.<p>I was implying a development environment inside a VM, not just a VM for testing.<p>You posted several times about how macOS isn&#x27;t compatible with your production environments scripts and what-not. The solution is to either not use macOS, or use a standardized VM every developer on the team uses to develop inside of, so that your scripts work &quot;out of the box&quot;.<p>&gt; I can definitely see this becoming more and more true in many fields, but this hans&#x27;t been an issue for us.<p>Your posts seem to contradict this. Perhaps you were exaggerating the pain it causes the team when production scripts don&#x27;t work on developer systems. Either way - it seems the writing is already on the wall. Apple isn&#x27;t going to make it easier any time soon - so ditch the mac&#x27;s.')
