It really does clean the air pretty cheap.</i><p>&gt; <i>There&#x27;s a problem with this though. These fans weren&#x27;t designed to be run with a filter. The filter will restrict air flow which will put a higher strain on the motor causing it to use more electricity and in worse cases could be a fire hazard. The higher the MERV rating (cleaning efficiency) of the filter the more stress it will put on the fan.</i><p>&gt; <i>Don&#x27;t worry! You can still have your cheap air purifier as long as the filter area is increased to decrease the effect of air resistance. Instead of using one 20x20x1 filter we&#x27;ll use two 20x25x1 filters which increases the filter surface area over 250%. It&#x27;s a little more expensive because you&#x27;re using two filters instead of one but the increased filter surface area also helps the filter last longer before it gets clogged up and we&#x27;re saving on energy use compared to a single filter.</i>')
