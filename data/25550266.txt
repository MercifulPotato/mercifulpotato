I get bombarded with car ads. I don&#x27;t drive. I&#x27;m never going to drive. I don&#x27;t own a car. I&#x27;m never going to own a car. I have no interest in cars (other than my general anti-car views). I think most (but not all) car use is dumb and the ads don&#x27;t persuade me otherwise.<p>Or I&#x27;m bombarded with ads for something I&#x27;ve already bought. You bought a rug? Here are 300 ads for other different rugs.<p>Sometimes the ad placement is terrible. I work in patient safety in English NHS mental health settings. This means I&#x27;m frequently searching using the word &quot;suicide&quot;. One time I was searching a newspaper website to try to find a report they&#x27;d done. Here&#x27;s the ad that was placed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;hhOYUJb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;hhOYUJb</a><p>But then as well as that I&#x27;m also worried about the privacy implications. People share computers and people share accounts, and the ad network has no way of knowing who&#x27;s looking at the screen at any time.')
