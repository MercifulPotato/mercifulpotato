My initial assumption is that you were doing this, and you may still be, I&#x27;m giving you the benefit of the doubt.  I feel it is very important that when we discuss abortion, we do so in a way that is scientific, rational, and consistent.<p>Your choice of words is particularly egregious, in my opinion.  Killing is not the same as homicide. Human is not the same as person. A fetus is not a clump of cells, or a baby.<p>A &quot;human being&quot; is just a human (a common usage scientific term), and human is just a species of animal. So yes, a &quot;human fetus&quot; is a &quot;human being&quot;. &quot;Person&quot; is a legal&#x2F;philosophical term, not necessarily a scientific one. &quot;Killing&quot; simply refers to ending the life of a living thing. &quot;Homicide&quot; (the mention of which you removed?) is a legal term for killing a person.  To drive this point home further, we have concepts for non-human persons, and non-person humans. They aren&#x27;t interchangeable in all contexts.<p>The scientific reality and proper usage of the English language is abortion is killing humans (human fetuses). This is not up for debate. The debate is whether these humans are &quot;persons&quot;, which entitles them to rights, or if they are not, if they deserve rights in some other capacity (e.g. my dog isn&#x27;t a person but has rights).<p>Again, when people say &quot;it&#x27;s not killing&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s not a human&quot;, or tangentially, &quot;it&#x27;s a clump of cells&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s a baby&quot; they are factually wrong and are deliberately misusing those words in an attempt to strengthen their argument, when in reality it makes them look either dishonest or ignorant.<p>To me, your posts are either dishonest, or ignorant. That was my entire point.')
