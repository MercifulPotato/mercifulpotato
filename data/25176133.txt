Probably only of interest to those in the UK (Ireland has The Phoenix, which appears superficially similar at least).<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s the only widely distributed investigative journalism magazine. You get to read about some scandals months or years before they break in the news, plenty never make it of course.<p>There are a number of regular features but the one on the state of national health by M.D. has been by far and a way the most insightful thing I&#x27;ve read on the state of various countries under covid.

It can be a bit of a slog to read, especially if you go page by page, but that&#x27;s probably more a reflection of the value of the content than the quality of the prose.')
