People are okay with giving up (or not knowing  that they are giving up) privacy to use products like social media. Unlike television (where there arenâ€™t any free alternatives), Facebook would lose market share overnight if a somewhat-competent but free competitor sprang up.<p>I am also not convinced that people would pay to just get rid of ads, especially when there are free and easy alternatives available.<p>I _am_ convinced that a company like Facebook will try to launch a paid content service with their own exclusives since that seems to be the thing that big content providers are doing.')
