Would the ice somehow have given better footholds than we have now?<p>I also wonder if it was a bunch of bored kids,  that found the painting material and the surface,  and figured this was as good a way of passing time as any. Or maybe it was adolescents getting high together, having visions, and doodling them on these walls day after day.')
