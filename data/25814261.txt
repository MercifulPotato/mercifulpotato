Our questions to Google have been met with &quot;You&#x27;re trying to do it this way, but what you really want to do is this&quot;. Or worse, they&#x27;ll send us a link to a document which we&#x27;ve already read ourselves and then just go silent.<p>They&#x27;ve never tried to deeply understand our use cases or business at all. Hopefully they turn this around but IMO, Google is absolutely horrible at B2B, they&#x27;re just not currently set up to do it correctly.')
