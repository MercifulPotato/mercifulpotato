It makes it VERY hard to build a business around.  10 years ago I had a police scanner app called Scanner911.  It sold well.. until a competitor innovated around me... by gaming the app store&#x27;s review system.  Complaining to Apple yielded nothing.<p>Not that I wanted to build a career around police scanner apps, but it was an independent income.<p>People here defending Apple are conformist fanboys.. the same people that were sitting staring at that video screen in the old 1984 ad.<p>Funny how the world repeats.')
