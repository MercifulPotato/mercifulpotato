Our code, task management and dev&#x2F;test VMs go through the VPN, the rest over the open internets.<p>The security argument we have is a bit hit and miss though, since our e-mail is at a random hosting provider (doesn&#x27;t even have calendar support) and most of our other comms goes through services like Skype, Zoom, etc.')
