In fact, last year this time, we were a global multi-cloud, multi-region play. Because we&#x27;ve done it before it was fairly simple to do again but being so early in our journey it was actually more effort than it was worth. In our case now we will expand geographically as there&#x27;s a demand for it and we&#x27;ll put some of that control in the hands of users. If your own user base in the US or EU or Asia, you may not want your backend to be global, you may not want that cost, and you may not want to incur the issues related to distributed storage, synchronization, eventual consistency, etc and the complexity that comes with it. So I think this is something that will evolve over time. Micro builds in the concept of &quot;Environments&quot; and this will be the form of expansion to different regions and cloud providers. The key thing to note, we are not an edge network, Netlify wants to distribute your assets everywhere, but I think APis are for the most part centralised in the cloud with some form of geo load balancing to different regions. All of that will play out over time, so again watch this space.')
