What principle do you think the NYT is purporting to hold but is applying inconsistently in these two cases?<p>I haven&#x27;t read either article (because I&#x27;m not a subscriber), but I gather that the former is advocating using the US military to put down civil unrest in the US, and the other is defending the actions of Hong Kong police to put down civil unrest in Hong Kong.<p>If you suppose the principle being applied is very broad, something like &quot;no support of any state action against civil unrest should ever be published,&quot; then that principle does seem to be applied inconsistently. But that seems very unlikely to be the principle NYT is purporting to have.')
