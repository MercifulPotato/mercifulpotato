Sure, if the US were to waltz in <i>alone</i>, they&#x27;d be treated as the invaders they are.  But every North Korean has been fed a steady diet of &quot;Korea is one!&quot; since birth and they&#x27;re all well aware that their kinsmen in the South are materially better off in every conceivable way -- so when said kinsmen lead the invasion and form the new government, they&#x27;re <i>not</i> going to get violently rejected in the same way.<p>The fall of East Germany is instructive: while that imploded internally instead of being triggered from the outside, there was absolutely zero violent resistance to West Germany coming in and essentially taking over.  North Korea isn&#x27;t going to be same level of cakewalk, but it&#x27;s closer to this end of the spectrum than Afghanistan or Iraq.')
