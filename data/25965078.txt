Not all of them,of course,but a lot. EU works when things are going slow and because of the sheer economical scale and power, everybody takes it serious when it comes to negotiations. But the EC isn&#x27;t a bunch of experts on rapid situations. It&#x27;s exactly the same when a French civil servant complained that they are being outbid when buying masks, because the state can&#x27;t pay upfront, while the Americans ( individuals) could,so essentially a 60 million people country ended up competing against a few individuals with cash. Same with vaccines: while the EK were trying to come up with something, Israelis already were calling around the globe to make sure they get it first.')
