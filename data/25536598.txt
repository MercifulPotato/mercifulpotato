Item(by='ryan29', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608905873, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534986, text='&gt; Are there any &quot;safe&quot; gTLDs<p>AFAIK there are zero guarantees. I think .com might have some pricing obligations, but all the good .coms are taken.<p>Don’t rely on ICANN.  They’ve proven they don’t care about registrants with the .org debacle and when they let Uniregistry raise the price of domains for _existing_ registrants.<p>Donuts reclassifies domains to premium, but I’ve only ever seen it after a domain expires.  Donuts raised some prices a few years ago, but let existing registrants keep their pricing AFAIK.<p>Assume there’s strength in numbers.  Any attempt to increase prices drastically on .com, .net, or .org should result in a lot of backlash.<p>I also consider .dev and .app safe, or at least safer than the rest, because I don’t think Google is looking to turn a huge profit with them.  They’re some of the most reasonably priced too.<p>The new TLDs could have been awesome if the registries weren’t so short sighted.  They’re priced way too high to foster wide adoption.  They should all be ~$10&#x2F;year IMO.')
