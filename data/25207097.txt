As for &quot;special training&quot; -you do realize that the special training police receive in firearms is more or less &quot;how to kill people more efficiently,&quot; right? Exactly the same training given to civilian holders of concealed carry licenses in the US in states that require them. Seems kind of messed up that a guy with a genuine need can only get what he needs by bribing sherrifs. Looking at his background I don&#x27;t think he needs much more training.<p>FWIIW you don&#x27;t need any training in my state to carry a pistol. In fact you don&#x27;t even need a license (you will be issued one if you&#x27;re a non-felon for use in other states). It causes zero problems, my state has the third lowest crime rate in the country. The two lower crime states in the country, we share borders and gun laws with.<p>&gt;You definitely don&#x27;t need a gun<p>You definitely don&#x27;t get to decide.')
