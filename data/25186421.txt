For me it&#x27;s more of a convenience thing. I recently bought a new house, and I didn&#x27;t immediately have the time to install my smart devices (Nest, Hue lights, motion sensors etc). After just a couple of days I was already getting fed up with having to get up to &quot;manually&quot; flip switches, change the temprature, rolling down the blinds etc.')
