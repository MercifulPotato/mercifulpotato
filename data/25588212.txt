Building and rolling out a standardized environment, and maintaining it, will cost millions of dollars.  It shouldn&#x27;t, but it does.  And for what added benefit?  The end-users don&#x27;t want it, you&#x27;d have to spend another couple million for a lateral move at best.  More than likely, you&#x27;ll end up with a pile of Python spaghetti code that runs slower than the spreadsheet (see point #4 about massively recursive calcs).')
