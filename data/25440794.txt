The difference is that the government represents you, while Apple represents their share holders.<p>Of course my local coffeeshop also represents their owner (no idea if they have share holders), so what&#x27;s the difference with Apple? Size. I don&#x27;t know what your local coffeeshop is like, but mine is not a trillion dollar company. Apple is. And Apple&#x27;s products are used by millions of people all over the world. That means Apple wields a lot of power. They may not be able to lock you in prison, but they are able to block or restrict your usage of your electronic devices. They have a lot of power over other companies that want to provide services through those devices.<p>And without regulation, all of that power is unchecked; they wield that power for the profit of their shareholders, not for the public good.
