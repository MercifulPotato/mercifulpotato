Long ago I had a very automated house with X10, but over time it slowly degraded to the point that I got tired of debugging my house every weekend so I ripped it all out. Ok, that was X10 and we all know X10 sucks, but my point is that was a <i>single</i> protocol from a <i>single</i> manufacturer. Imagine the MTBF where you have a federated system with 10 different protocols and 10 different &quot;integrations.&quot;<p>No thank you. The (manual) light switches in my house are 20 years old and they&#x27;ll probably last another 30. But &quot;smart&quot; gizmos are just not built to last. They could be, but they aren&#x27;t.')
