I&#x27;ll use my two start-ups as examples.<p>Firstly, at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundmind.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundmind.co</a> we&#x27;re setting out to help you get the best sleep possible.<p>1) Scratch your own itch - I&#x27;m an insomniac and even when I do sleep, I never feel rested, so I&#x27;m solving my own problem<p>2) Idea Extraction - I then spoke with other people who have the same problem, and even people who don&#x27;t have the problem, to understand what they want. This built on the initial idea, and how to market it.<p>3) Idea Safaris - Not knowing much about sleep I dove into research and speaking to experts to understand more about the problem they are trying to solve,<p>4) Live in the future - I realized that everything we do around improved sleep is focused on affecting our physiology, but sleep is neurology, so we&#x27;re focused on using the latest in neuroscience to improve your sleep<p>My other startup <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayvri.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayvri.com</a> we create 3D virtual world maps, mostly for sports.<p>1) Scratch my own itch - as an avid outdoorsman, if I want to share my adventures, or prepare for an event like a race, there isn&#x27;t a good way to visualize what the terrain and experience is like<p>2) Idea Extraction - speaking to other people, we found out that if you were a paraglider, pilot, wildlife researcher, commercial drone operator, you had similar issues, but of course, these brought more ideas and feature requests to the table<p>3) Idea extraction - Though we spoke to people in the mapping space, and some in video, there wasn&#x27;t really an area of expertise, so I don&#x27;t think this really qualifies<p>4) Living in the future - we recognized that what we had built was a low-level volumetric video experience which could be made by anybody with just a GPX file. This brings us to the future of any photo and video captured in the outdoors can be made into a 3D volumetric experience.<p>That&#x27;s how I look at it. Why would you limit your ideation to only one quadrant?')
