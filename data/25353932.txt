If you view the PDF version of any RFC on ietf.org, it has a hyperlinked table of contents, so you don&#x27;t need a javascript version of it like what rfcreader.com provides, and you can store that PDF offline. You can also hit the TXT version of any RFC and it&#x27;s passable in Safari&#x27;s Reader View, I&#x27;d say better than rfcreader.com (I also tried Reader View on rfcreader.com and it has other issues, so it&#x27;s like trading one set of problems for another, but I see no clear winner, so for me the tie breaker goes to ietf.org);<p>2) the OP made the point that text is preferable to video–I happen to agree–and I was responding to the hyperbolic (and again, subjective) pushback regarding &quot;ugly&quot; text, explaining a way that it is still functionally superior to videos (which can have wildly diverse quality issues of their own);<p>3) I didn&#x27;t link the RFC, that was someone else.')
