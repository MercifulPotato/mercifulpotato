I wish CUPS would not be installed by default. I&#x27;m curious if most people print in 2020. I don&#x27;t either. In Japan you can print via USB stick, sd-card, wifi, cloud, etc at pretty much every convenience store and there&#x27;s usually one close by. where I live there is one 1 minute way, another 2 minutes, another 2.5 minutes, another 4 minutes, and probably 10 more within 10 minutes. I know that&#x27;s less common in other places but I did use the printer at a library in SF so I know they have (had?) those services too<p>In any case I uninstall CUPS when I install a new installation of linux because, at least in the past, I&#x27;d see tons of files updated all the time every update all related to cups, something I wasn&#x27;t using at all.')
