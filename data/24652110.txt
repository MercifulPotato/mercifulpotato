I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s not optimal because what you&#x27;re gaining on the second page you&#x27;re losing on the first page.<p>Also you always have to remember that users won&#x27;t necessarily hit the homepage first. If they click a link from a search or a social media post they might end up on <i>any</i> page in the site. Everything that you do to optimize the homepage should be done for <i>every</i> page. You end up with cacheable assets that are shared between pages and everything else is only downloaded when the user hits a page that actually needs it. That&#x27;s the way to a fast site.<p>With HTTP2 request parallelisation having lots of small files is not a bad thing. You can also add prefetch headers for big things like fonts. There&#x27;s lots of ways to make sites load better.')
