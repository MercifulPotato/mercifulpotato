Even if you have an objectively true view of the world, moral values and duties aren&#x27;t just about the way the world is; they&#x27;re about the way humans <i>want</i> the world to be. And human wants are subjective; if you and I disagree about how we want the world to be, there is no objective way to resolve our disagreement.')
