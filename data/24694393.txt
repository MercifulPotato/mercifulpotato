There are a lot of ways in databases to get the job done. At first glance it seems to work the way you want and even survives early testing or even deployment. It doesnt fall apart until much later when you are trying to build upon it, scale it, etc.. This causes many people to learn the wrong way to do something because they might not stick around until it falls apart. The next time they have to do something they remember the way they got it to work last time and do it again, never realizing they are leaving a trail of tears for future developers to clean up the mess with.<p>CSS is very much the same way. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have seen CSS files that are a house of cards. One wrong element gets added into a markup and the whole thing crumbles. Unnecessary use of !important, wildcards, overly specific, not specific enough, inconsistent media queries, desktop-first layouts (as opposed to mobile-first, or often times a mixture of the two depending on the element), and so on. At first glance, the stakes for bad CSS also seem pretty low (which is not the case with databases or backend code). This further causes developers to just hack at it until it works or is &quot;close enough&quot;. It instills bad habits that last years or even entire careers.')
