This might well be in your case. My experience is the other way around.<p>I&#x27;m forced to think about stuff like Kubernetes because the devs are popping &quot;micro-services&quot; for almost anything and the answer to trying to keep things manageable is, hopefully, K8s.<p>Of course they then send funny memes and argue that K8s is overkill. Yet they have no idea how much a devops guy has to do to actually ramp up one of their multi-gigabyte container.<p>The whole micro-services mentality is proving to be backwards in my environment. It&#x27;s seen as the answer to everything. &quot;Oh we have a behemoth, let&#x27;s just not use this part of the application and reimplement it somewhere else.&quot; In essence that&#x27;s great. However, the grunt of the work is making tests to capture old behaviour&#x2F;semantics; and who are the (indirect) clients of this piece of code. Ignoring a piece of code to death and reimplementing it somewhere else behind a socket is only part of the solution.<p>The hyperscalars are benefiting greatly of this mindset imo.')
