MuZero does not perform any masking\nwithin the search tree, but only masks legal actions at the root of the\nsearch tree where the set of available actions is directly observed. The\npolicy network rapidly learns to exclude actions that are unavailable,\nsimply because they are never selected.<p>MuZero still masks legal moves, but only at the root.\nAll its parts are eventually trained on the output of its root, and so learn the legal moves.<p>The justify this root level masking by how the Atari will only allow you to perform legal moves, while a weak enough player may consider illegal moves while planning in your head.<p>The main thing that&#x27;s slightly &quot;hidden under the rug&quot; is that for &quot;masking&quot; to make sense in the first place, MuZero needs to know a set of all moves that may be legal at some point in the games.')
