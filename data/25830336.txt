I was hoping to be able to automate it with an affordable CNC machine (and an attached scanner bed) â€“ but I seem to not be able to find any clear information about step sizes. Here it says microstepping is bad....<p>I also don&#x27;t really need to do any milling, just adjust to the right x-y position and punch a tiny hole and collect the dust. Milling rocks in any case is a no-no from what I understand. Maybe someone could suggest some ideas for my .. unconventional requirements :)<p>The samples are pretty small (maybe 20cm^2 at the most) and I don&#x27;t need to do it fast... And I prolly don&#x27;t have a huge budget')
