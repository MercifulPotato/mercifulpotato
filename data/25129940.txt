This doesn&#x27;t really replace my laptop or tablet, but it 100% replaces the notebook I carry everywhere for notes.<p>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 4 weeks now, and I&#x27;m still consistently using it every day.<p>It&#x27;s fantastic for planning, diagramming (I use this to capture measurements and dimensions for items I&#x27;m going to be making in CAD software), getting signed forms, taking notes, and sketching.<p>The hardware is delightful, even for left-handed folks like myself, where other tablets often make erroneous marks where my hand is resting.<p>Now, all that said, the software can still come along way.  My single biggest gripe is that I haven&#x27;t found a way to search for text within notes.  I&#x27;d really love to have an option to automatically convert handwriting to text on save&#x2F;close and keep that around as meta data for searching.<p>I may play with implementing it at some point - A large part of the reason I bought the device was because of the open ecosystem.  I do software dev for a living, and knowing that I can get into the device as root and muck around <i>REALLY</i> makes it feel like it&#x27;s mine.')
