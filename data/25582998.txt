Certainly the <i>passenger</i> isn&#x27;t any more than if an Uber gets in an accident today.<p>And, with the possible exception of drug side effect (and even there there are lawsuits), we don&#x27;t really see consumer-facing products that, even if used as directed, kill a fair number of people and we just go oops. Let&#x27;s say autonomous vehicles kill 3,000&#x2F;year in the US, i.e. 10% of the current rate. (In reality, human-driven cars will take a <i>long</i> time to be phased out even when self-driving is available but go with the thought experiment.) Can you imagine any other product we accept killing thousands of people a year and we&#x27;re fine with that?<p>ADDED: As someone else noted, you could argue that tobacco etc. fall into that category but we&#x27;re mostly not OK with that and is reasonably thought of as in another category. (And pretty much no one is smoking because they think it&#x27;s good for them.)')
