I learned how things really worked inside what previously was a bit of a black box. This meant I could take better care of it, would be more efficient at finding things I may want to change or fix, and nothing ever felt irrecoverably lost to the point I would have to reinstall.<p>In fact, I had a pretty bad SSD hiccup after a power surge a few weeks ago. The sort of thing that would have taken a Windows laptop out: A lot of system files were blanked out. I still don&#x27;t know exactly what caused the crash itself, but I ended up with an unbootable system. Old me may have reinstalled the whole thing, but instead I ended up booting arch on a flash drive, debugging the issue, figuring out what had happened, fixing it, and ended up with a working system I&#x27;m typing this from.<p>Now to be clear, if I don&#x27;t want to deal with this kind of shit, nothing prevents me from a wipe&amp;reinstall. Nothing stops me from running my stuff on a VM I don&#x27;t have to manage, either. It&#x27;s important not to let yourself completely waste your time on distractions. But this is meant as an advert on what Arch Linux taught me fairly <i>passively</i> over the years: Within the space of a couple of hours total, I was able to prepare a bootable usb, chroot into the broken system, debug bootloader issues, debug graphics issues, debug kernel module loading issues, and more. I never felt outside my comfort zone.<p>Oh, and this also isn&#x27;t my job. It just made me a hell of a lot better <i>at</i> my job, as these skills entirely transfer over to devops etc.<p>----<p>With all that said: Arch is very much no-fuss compared to Ubuntu. I had to deal with a lot of new stuff to learn the first few weeks, then practically nothing over most of the next decade. When using Ubuntu, I constantly had to deal with distractionsâ€¦ and when I end up ssh&#x27;d on an Ubuntu system, I still do have to deal with distractions to this day.')
