Learn C++ first, and you&#x27;ll appreciate Rust more. But whatever you do, don&#x27;t let expertise in one language become a chain holding you back from learning others. I know a lot of people who are afraid to go from being an expert in X to a beginner in Y, and this tendency is even more pronounced when X is hard to master, but it&#x27;s a trap.
