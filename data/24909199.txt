Knowing what I do about incentives, any paper without rigorous principles of going to tend to issue fewer retractions. It&#x27;s time consuming, doesn&#x27;t drive revenue, personally embarrassing for people. It actually takes a lot of journalistic integrity to issue any retractions at all (how many have you personally published to a large audience?).<p>It&#x27;s fairly clear to me that the burden of proof lies with the extraordinary claim that the NY Post is even close to the level of journalistic rigor as the NY Times, let alone so far surpasses it that they issue fewer retractions because of the accuracy of their reporting.<p>You&#x27;re asking me to prove water is wet. You&#x27;re showing me a dog in a trench coat and telling me it&#x27;s an accomplished neurosurgeon. Have you ever even read the Post or the Times?

Feel free to offer any information of value you might have.')
