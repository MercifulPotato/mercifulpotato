I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s realistic.<p>Though of course it&#x27;s good to focus our efforts on what we have hope of changing, I think the Stoics miss the importance of actively seeking out ways that we can make things better for ourselves and others. They instead cast everything as &quot;duty&quot; in conformance to &quot;nature&quot;, two very slippery concepts.<p>Scholars have noted that Stoicism flourished in environments where people had to cope with severe disempowerment (such as being caught up in the politics of the Roman Empire.) I hope most of us are not in situations where we have to resort to the 100% stoic mindset.')
