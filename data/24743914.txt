Maybe it&#x27;s easier to recover the river from the optimisation case: we profile first, then optimise. This is because the only things that count are what actually eat wall clock time. Similarly, the only places in value chains that accumulate wealth are where there are actually consistent margins. And it doesn&#x27;t matter if there are rocks in a riverbed (which could potentially make bottlenecks or waterfalls), if they&#x27;re located in a pool between higher rocks, so the water level is higher than they are.<p>Does that make more sense?')
