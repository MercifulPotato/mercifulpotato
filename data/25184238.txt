I used this data to estimate the runtime if I take a measurment only every 5 minutes. This does not fully take in account the deepsleep current &amp; battery self discharge. But wake up from deepsleep is definitly working.<p>From 3.7V to 2.7V I coud activate 37&#x27;000 times with a total runtime of about 8h.<p>Schematic is found here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LilyGO&#x2F;LILYGO-T-Energy&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;t18_v3.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LilyGO&#x2F;LILYGO-T-Energy&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;t18_v3...</a><p>You also have the battery voltage on IO35 with a 2x100kOhm Voltage divider.<p>The setup is not perfect, but good enough so far, and practical.<p>If I start over, i would look into\n* taking a processor with lower speed und power. \n* taking CR 123 or a battery optimized for very low self discharge current.\n* Use a wireless protocol with very low overhead. I use ESP-Now now, WLAN would cut battery life in half.')
