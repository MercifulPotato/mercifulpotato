Incapable of thinking on their own, they can only do pre-programmed tasks in tightly-controlled environments -- they can&#x27;t understand, learn, or adapt. Covariant was founded in 2017 to change this.<p>Our vision is the Covariant Brain: universal AI that allows robots to see, reason, and act on the world around them. We’re bringing the Covariant Brain to commercial viability, starting with the industries that make, move, and store things in the physical world.<p>Our work was recently featured in publications from the New York Times (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyti.ms&#x2F;2SkFoUe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyti.ms&#x2F;2SkFoUe</a>) and the Wall Street Journal (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;on.wsj.com&#x2F;2OpujAe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;on.wsj.com&#x2F;2OpujAe</a>), to IEEE Spectrum (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2Opw3cy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2Opw3cy</a>)!<p>We’re always hiring for a variety of roles, but our current priorities are:<p>- Site Reliability Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2OrhpSf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2OrhpSf</a><p>- Sr. Software Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2OprXBq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2OprXBq</a><p>- Sr. Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;36qprEg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;36qprEg</a><p>Experience in AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;robotics is not required!<p>Bringing AI from laboratory research to success in the real world requires a team that represents that world -- a diversity of backgrounds, points of view, and experiences. Our common denominator: ambitious expectations, love of learning, and empathy for those around us. Curious?
