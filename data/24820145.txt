I don&#x27;t see how this doesn&#x27;t become a spam&#x2F;abuse-fest overnight.<p>My $0.02 is that there&#x27;s a much simpler solution hiding in plain sight: just stop giving legal copyright&#x2F;hacking&#x2F;ToS protection to sites with third-party-generated content that the site didn&#x27;t license.<p>In other words, if someone wants to build an app that downloads your Spotify playlist data by impersonating you... or scrape Craigslist listings... or copy Yelp reviews... then <i>nothing is legally in the way</i>. Not copyright, not anti-hacking laws, not ToS.<p>Services are free to rate-limit or ban you if they catch you... but if you can get around that then the information&#x2F;interaction is yours.<p>This feels like a much more &quot;free market&quot; approach. It doesn&#x27;t rely on trying to build laws that will be bad compromises and outdated by the time they&#x27;re passed. Rather it involves <i>undoing</i> existing laws and protections that are producing harm.<p>(To be clear, copyright still applies to things that are paid for or licensed -- movies, songs, articles, etc.)')
