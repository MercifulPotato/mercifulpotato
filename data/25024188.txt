For parts like this, a pin planning tool can genuinely be useful when planning a board layout.<p>It&#x27;s also nice when this tool generates starter code for you, because every peripheral usually has a slightly different way to enable&#x2F;configure&#x2F;map their IO to a pin, and there&#x27;s a global GPIO control interface, and there&#x27;s a global power management control interface, and (... etc). You need to set <i>all</i> of the properties correctly simultaneously, or the connection doesn&#x27;t get made. It&#x27;s easy to miss one of them and be confused about why your signal isn&#x27;t showing up.<p>Nordic&#x27;s GPIO pin mux allows you to map any peripheral IO to any pin like an FPGA. There&#x27;s one uniform interface for controlling this mapping, with no weird exceptions. I think that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t have a tool like this -- it just wouldn&#x27;t be all that useful, because remapping pins is so easy. When you&#x27;re designing your board, you can, for example, wire up an SPI device to literally any pins you want, and then make it work in software later.<p>These tools can also useful for setting PLL divider values and configuring clock distribution, because this can get complicated: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;e8CQw.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;e8CQw.png</a><p>But Nordic chips also tend to run at <i>one</i> officially supported clock speed, because their Bluetooth stack relies on it. So you don&#x27;t really need the clock configuration GUI either.')
