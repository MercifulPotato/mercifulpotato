I already have got Airpods(in use), Airpods Pro(daily), Sennheiser M2(broken - not charging) and M3(daily in use). I am looking for comfort, good sound quality, nose canceling and easy to use.<p>If I don&#x27;t like them I&#x27;ll just return it.\nThe price is high but I am happy to pay for it - if I can make use of them 3+ hours per day while working on my computer - and Apple knows that!')
