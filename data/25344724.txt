I would not be very surprised if it turns out they can make 10% more than they committed, and auction this off. And would expect hospitals treating Saudi princelings &amp; the like to win such an auction.<p>But does anyone actually know what these pre-sale contracts look like? They must have some wiggle room in case production doesn&#x27;t go as well as planned... are there just penalties for late delivery to specific customers, or explicitly tied to total production, or did they literally sell places in the queue, or what?')
