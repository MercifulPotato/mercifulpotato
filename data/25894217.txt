But I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s talking about that. I don&#x27;t particularly care if you prefer tabs over spaces, or if you do brace on the line or on the next line, or one of the many other trivial details that don&#x27;t affect the code quality.<p>I do care that you have <i>a</i> preference though. I do care that you&#x27;re consistent in applying that preference and have reasons where you break with that preference.<p>I have my own preferences, but if I were in a shop where the style guide was to do the opposite of them, I&#x27;d do the opposite of them because it&#x27;s not worth fighting over. It&#x27;s more important for the code to be uniformly styled so it&#x27;s easier to read and maintain rather than it to be styled in a way I prefer.')
