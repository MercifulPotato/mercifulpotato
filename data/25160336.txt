Does the typing outweigh this?<p>If all the time spent writing all those types was spent debugging, would TS win in actual development time?<p>If you&#x27;re writing good unit tests already, why are you running into so many type issues?<p>If you already have to spend time writing tests, why spend more writing types?<p>TS types aren&#x27;t really documentation. For other devs to use your stuff, you need JS Docs to actually explain things. Why write all those types too?<p>If I&#x27;m writing a quick and dirty project, it feels like TS types help a little, but if I&#x27;m following best practices on an important project, TS seems like pointless ceremony that slows things even more.')
