Some critical parts of the UDB architecture (which is arguably the most interesting part of the product!) aren&#x27;t explained in the register documentation -- for example, the registers which control routing are described as &quot;RAM configuration bytes for channel&quot;, with no further explanation.<p>If you&#x27;re using Cypress&#x27;s IDE, it can generate the required configuration data for you. But if you want to take off on your own, you&#x27;re out of luck.')
