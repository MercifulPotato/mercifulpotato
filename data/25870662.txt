Item(by='qsort', descendants=None, kids=[25870708], score=None, time=1611314394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870589, text='&gt; Google set itself up effectively as a gatekeeper to their content<p>This isn&#x27;t a fair characterization. They <i>want</i> their content to be indexed by Google, and furthermore most of those entities have separate distribution channels (television networks, print newspapers, etc.) that Google can&#x27;t touch. Most people don&#x27;t want to buy newspapers or watch news channels, but frankly they are <i>absolutely correct</i>, because 99% of that is freaking garbage no better than your average Facebook group.<p>&gt; Australia<p>s&#x2F;Europe&#x2F;politicians-worldwide&#x2F;g<p>My point wasn&#x27;t about Europe in particular (just observing that this kind of move, for better or for worse, is more popular in the EU). Again, I do agree that we should do something about Google &amp; friends, but this piece of legislation is the classical politician&#x27;s fallacy: we should do something, this is something, hence this is good.')
