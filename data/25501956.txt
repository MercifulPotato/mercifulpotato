Turning on the window defroster when the window starts to fog up at night comes to mind. Likewise many of the climate control nobs. While they do have nice physical manifestations, I don&#x27;t know off the top of my head what position the nob happens to be in or which direction I need to shift it to get it into defrost versus heat versus vent.<p>Personally, I think there is a happy medium somewhere between Tesla&#x27;s touch everything and the current state where you play button guessing games.')
