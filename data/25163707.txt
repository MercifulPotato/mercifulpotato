Between 2010 to 2019 wind energy become 70% cheaper and solar became 89% cheaper[1] -- and they&#x27;re still getting cheaper.  We are now in a situation where we can build 3x as much renewables for the same price as nuclear[2] - nuclear has a serious cost problem.  I&#x27;m very skeptical of any claimed nuclear energy cost reductions because time and again the industry has promised lower costs and failed to deliver; for example the new AP1000 and EPR reactors in the US and Europe have all vastly overrun their budgets and run years behind schedule.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451082&#x2F;lcoe-8.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451082&#x2F;lcoe-8.png</a>\n2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451081&#x2F;lcoe-2.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451081&#x2F;lcoe-2.png</a>')
