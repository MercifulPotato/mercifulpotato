I would guess they are now working on Centos Streams, or have moved on to other things entirely. Its not like Centos has been killed off either, so it didn&#x27;t cost a lot and this wont really save anything, it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a change of focus.<p>Microsoft buying ubuntu would be an interesting (and not impossible) move though.')
