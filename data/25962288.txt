I know a great deal, but I&#x27;m like Kelly Bundy; I can only hold so much in my pretty little head.<p>I generally forget stuff a week after last using it, and am googling even the most basic things.<p>In a few days, I&#x27;m gonna have to put my Swift code aside for a week or two, while I modify my backend (PHP). I guarantee that I&#x27;ll be like duuu-uhhh for the first couple of days, with serious Google-Jistu katas.<p>Then, the same thing will happen again, when I switch back to the Swift frontend.<p>I tend to avoid using dependencies, so I write a lot of code.')
