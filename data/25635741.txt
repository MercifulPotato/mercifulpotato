It appears they did share 10 users&#x27; data which is a bit questionable but I&#x27;d hardly call that unfettered access to US data.<p>The fact is all of the US businesses operating in China give surveillance ability to the Chinese government for the Chinese users and are operating in an ethically questionable space being primarily based outside of China, at least in my opinion.<p>It&#x27;s really not too different than the businesses sharing US citizen data to the US government, much of which Snowden and others before him exposed. I suspect there&#x27;s a lot more surveillance going on everywhere than the general public know about and the businesses best positioned to do the surveillance are probably doing it.')
