In the sense that it isn&#x27;t rich in complicated features, this is true.  But it is a garbage collected language, it manages it&#x27;s own stack which is less low level than C#, and it doesn&#x27;t provide any low level control over memory&#x2F;instructions that C# doesn&#x27;t, less in fact. And the cost to interop with C is higher with Go than with C#.<p>I think the fact that Go compiles to native executables as the default, just gives the impression that it is &quot;low level&quot;. That and the lack of features I suppose.<p>I say all of this as someone who loves Go as a language by the way. C# could use some simplification!')
