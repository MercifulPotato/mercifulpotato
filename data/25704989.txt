It can be very very hard to test and distribute them though. As someone who maintained a controller with paid support, your test matrix gets pretty large pretty fast accounting for different k8s versions, different hosted versions (GKE, AKS, etc), different distros (openshift, rancher, etc). And that&#x27;s before you even get into specific configurations like pod security policies, can the control plane communicate with the data plane, is there a service mesh.<p>Resource versioning is hard to get right. Once a resource type is v1, it becomes difficult to extend it. You can&#x27;t add a beta field to it easily. Revising schema can be hard since anything more than a no op conversion between versions requires a webhook, which requires a certificate chain, and while cert-manager is popular it is not ubiquitous and regularly has breaking changes. Webhook setup issues made up a large portion of our support requests.<p>As far as the general &quot;reconciliation loop&quot; architecture goes, you end up with something similar in most orchestration systems I&#x27;ve worked on, or you wish that you did. So overall I think that worked out well. Getting it right can be hard, but I think that&#x27;s the nature of the beast.')
