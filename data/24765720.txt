Item(by='soylentcola', descendants=None, kids=[24766114], score=None, time=1602598445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765604, text='I agree that increased integration and dominance can lead to higher prices (as you mention with cable), but is this a &quot;traditional&quot; rental?<p>I was under the impression that it was intended to make up for the fact that many theaters are closed or people don&#x27;t want to go out to them.  Pricing is more in line with a set of first run movie tickets for an adult and a couple of kids or a pay-per-view event.<p>Still, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s also a way to gauge what people are willing to pay for new, high profile Disney material via streaming services and might signal similar high-cost rentals in the future.  How much would people pay to watch (for example) the next season of &quot;Mandalorian&quot; a month before it shows up in the normal Disney+ listing?')
