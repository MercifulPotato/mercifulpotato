However, taxes amount heavily depends on location you live and possible tax optimisations you can use in your position.<p>For example it may vary in 10x+ times between entrepreneur&#x2F;nomad in low tax jurisdiction and hired worker in high-tax jurisdiction. Maybe it&#x27;s smarter to choose country (state in US case) with lowest taxes&#x2F;highest return than suffering from 30%+ cut.<p>I agree with the author about skills in general, but not every thing we do apart from the job bring us joy and satisfaction. Sometimes it&#x27;s more convenient to just pay for the work.')
