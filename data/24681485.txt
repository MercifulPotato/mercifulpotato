In the last sentence you mention the cost of a suburban house. That&#x27;s the only reference to &quot;suburban areas only&quot; I can see.<p>Panels + lithium battery does not <i>yet</i> make &quot;traditional power distribution obsolete&quot;. I have a net-zero adobe house with its own grid-tied 6.6kW array. The additional cost <i>at this time</i> of sufficent storage to go off-grid without significant life style changes (none of which would be particularly awful, but still big) is substantial. I have no doubt it will decrease rapidly, but we&#x27;re not there yet.<p>Sure, for rural and some kinds of suburban areas, your comments are on point. For rural, they&#x27;re even more or less the default. For suburban, it can be hard to tell where &quot;community service&quot; would end and &quot;what we do today&quot; would start.')
