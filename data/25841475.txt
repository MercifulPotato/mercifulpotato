I was never a big reader to begin with so this book along with others (Jude the Obscure, A Separate Peace) have always been in a bad light for me in my mind (I guess having a book that I would tested and grilled over first thing in the school year does that). However, as an adult I found reading books such as IT, Silence of the Lambs and The Grapes of Wrath really entertaining. When I have some time I think I&#x27;ll give this classic another try.')
