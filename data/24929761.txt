Things like provisioning and configuring servers, creating and configuring a database, implementing an API, authentication and authorization for users, storage for files and images, and a bunch of other security related work. Creating and maintaining all this infrastructure takes hundreds of hours and manual tasks each year.<p>We believe that those things are better offloaded to domain experts so that you can focus on accelerating your product innovation and growth.<p>Nhost allows products to get a ready-to-use, secure and performant backend in roughly 40 seconds, rather than months by integrating a bunch of open-source (no vendor lock-in) components and best practices.<p>Let us know if you have any questions or suggestions, we would love to hear from you.')
