Item(by='Avtomatk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601734030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669253, text='In practice, no one renounces their child or their intellectual property or important information (looking from the skin of companies), no matter how much you impose a thousand fines, only when the fines exceed the value of the person or information seized, you could be renounced to this, for example: to be fined a million dollars if you rescue your son.<p>But this is a stupid solution... Instead of punishing yourself for something that isn&#x27;t your fault (or something you overlooked like not creating a backup, or, in the case of children, not taking good care of your son), well this problem can be prevented and the irresponsible punished BEFORE the tragedy happens. I propose that companies that do not have a backup of their information be fined, or in the case of companies (financial, social networks that do not want the information to be disclosed), regulate the security of their company or otherwise be fined. With this, he punishes himself BEFORE the tragedy and not AFTER.<p>If the fines come AFTER, the ransomware is not mitigated, the hijackers get what they want.')
