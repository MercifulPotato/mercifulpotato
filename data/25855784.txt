As soon as you activate it then the expectations ramp up even more than the (likely) current flow which is likely non-trivial right now as it stands. My experience on a smaller scale was only tens-of-emails per day. And that was actually overwhelming for my little hobby that had no possibility of monetisation. The idea of thousands of support emails from people with expectations doesn&#x27;t spark joy at all.<p>Rhetorical questions: \nDo you want to support this thing? How much time does it take? Is this effort you want to spend? Are you not monetising this for a purpose? Are you happy with that purpose (obviously yes)? Do you still enjoy spending time on it? Do you see that time as well spent? Are the expectations from your side still being met? Are the expectations from everyone else still reasonable?<p>After all those questions, the basic answer is probably: you don&#x27;t want to monetise it because it will wreck the actual purpose for which its intended or alternatively there isn&#x27;t much of monetisation possibility due to its nature. But you can&#x27;t spend more time on it because you have other Things to Do, like making money from other ways.<p>(At least this is my impression based on my experience)')
