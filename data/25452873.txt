Bridges.<p>Media coverage from back then: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailydot.com&#x2F;crime&#x2F;silk-road-murder-charges-ross-ulbricht&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailydot.com&#x2F;crime&#x2F;silk-road-murder-charges-ross...</a><p>&gt; To date, there have been precisely zero murder charges filed. Instead, the indictment has been changed without explanation, the formal charges omitted, and the broader accusations buried within a lesser drug trafficking charge.<p>&gt; Of the six murder indictments trumpeted by the U.S. government in the days following Ulbrichtâ€™s Oct. 2013 arrest, five have fallen off the table and the sixth sits untouched in a separate indictment (legalese for an unproven allegation) that was purposefully left out of the upcoming trial.<p>Of course, we know now why they didn&#x27;t charge-- those charges were impossibly tainted by the involvement of the corrupt officers.  But the trial was no less prejudiced just because they skipped charging on the murder-for-hire parts: those corrupt officers had administrative control over the systems, they fabricated evidence to conceal their heist, and so on.<p>Had the compromise of the investigation not been fatal to the prosecutions case they simply wouldn&#x27;t have risked concealing it from the defence.')
