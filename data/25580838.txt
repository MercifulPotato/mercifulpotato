I have a large collection of bookmarks with many kinds of tags (topical, meta-tags like !important, !soon, !followup, !share, ...), etc. But the reality is those tags are not sufficient to search for what I need - adding a piece of content and searching for it are far removed in time (weeks, months, sometimes years), and &quot;future me&quot; doesn&#x27;t remember the context something he put in with. The today-me can&#x27;t anticipate which of the pieces of content will be useful and to what end.<p>So I don&#x27;t know _what to search for_ or _how to search for it_  == but just as importantly, I don&#x27;t know _what use to label something for_ and _what terms&#x2F;structure_ to add to it.<p>I think the semantic web must have assumed we&#x27;ll tag&#x2F;label things correctly, and the reality is we don&#x27;t do it because it&#x27;s on average too hard.')
