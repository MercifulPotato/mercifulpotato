Maybe this is a dumb idea, but it&#x27;s what C programs already do, except C programs don&#x27;t have the safety of compiler checked errors offered by Zig. Does the Zig compiler need to check error payloads beyond the type system already provided? I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I agree with you that having such a super-ergonomic error handling system will direct most code towards a certain style, but I don&#x27;t think this is contrary to Zig&#x27;s goals of perfect software or simplicity. It&#x27;s already such a huge win on top of C&#x27;s error handling.')
