The difference is night and day.<p>In addition, Vitamins C&#x2F;D and Caffeine can also make a huge difference.<p>Edit: also (and this is advice for myself), don&#x27;t spend too much time following political news&#x2F;COVID numbers&#x2F;etc. I still follow these, but I have to remind myself that spending 1-2 hours a day vs. 6-8 hours doesn&#x27;t really help me solve any of the things that are wrong in the world, and I end up losing time to spend with family, on side projects, etc. and suffer more from anxiety&#x2F;depression.<p>Edit 2: if you can, get a sitting&#x2F;standing desk. Spending too much time in either position is harmful in different ways, so it&#x27;s best to alternate between them throughout the day. An under-the-desk elliptical (for when sitting) and a comfortable mat (for when standing) are also helpful.')
