Item(by='Blikkentrekker', descendants=None, kids=[25782467, 25781160], score=None, time=1610646231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778135, text='The title reminds me of the Japanese strip <i>Rent-a-Girlfriend</i>, and how much it, and several similar ideas coming from Japan seem to express how lonely many of it&#x27;s citizens might be feeling.<p>Japanese commerce seems to have found a rather big market into treating loneliness. From the existence of Host Clubs, bars where the menu is not only food, but a good conversation with one&#x27;s designated “host” as well, to cafés where the waiter plays a role of one&#x27;s doting younger sister. Of course, it is probably also indicated by the infamously declining birth rate.<p><i>Rent-a-Girlfriend</i> is a bizarre thing to read, if one not understand it&#x27;s target audience. It&#x27;s a new dimension to <i>The 40 Year Old Virgin</i>, with the exception that the protagonist is supposed to be relatable to the audience — he&#x27;s unbelievably socially awkward and not in a way that derives humor from it, but is meant to invoke a sense of relatability and it essentially seems to exist as a way to vicariously cope with loneliness, as is surprisingly common in Japanese fiction.')
