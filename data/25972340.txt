It&#x27;s a Starlink problem plus the 13 other companies also trying to put 50,000 microsats in orbit, plus the 200 companies that will do it after them when prices come down.<p>In a couple of decades, we end up with millions of microsats in orbit, and by then there&#x27;s nothing that can be done.<p>But as long as we can beam social media misinformation into the most remote corners of the planet, heaven and nature be damned.')
