There&#x27;s a lot of talk of backups &amp; storage. But none of that is going to preserve the digital memories we have shared, after they die. All the old URLs that have been shared will, not rot &amp; wither, but one day just up and vanish. Up to the big log-off in the sky.<p>I really thought a dozen GB of storage from Google to each individual in the world was pretty reasonable. That there is plenty enough resources. But no, in to the garbage file society goes. Throw out all the past. It was the promise, but it&#x27;s not sound business.')
