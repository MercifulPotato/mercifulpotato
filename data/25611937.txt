It&#x27;s really hard to make them appealing in practice when you have to give up simplifying assumptions.<p>In particular a lot of these systems were not well adapted to managing collections of text files in unknown formats, edited by unknown tools. That made sense for research purposes, since you can&#x27;t have as many cool properties without understanding the file formats, but it made them substantially less useful in practice, which I think is partly why they didn&#x27;t get adopted.')
