Code is faster to read, modify, replicate. Code functions more predictably and is quicker to debug.<p>Cheaper: I&#x27;ll keep charging more, but it will cost less. A fresh graduate might do the same for $2000&#x2F;month, 3 months. I try to get it done in $9000&#x2F;month, 10 days. Part of this is not spending too much time on something that might be scrapped later, knowing when to plan ahead and when not to.<p>The essential skills are not really math or writing. Some of it is raw technical ability - know when and how to use reactive programming, declarative, imperative, and so on. Sometimes it&#x27;s leadership, speaking up when you&#x27;re stuck or something looks pointless. Sometimes it&#x27;s just knowing how to learn and unlearn, and how to filter out the golden bits of knowledge from the sea of useless, self-promoting articles and books out there. And it seems trivial, but one of the skills that lets you do all three is knowing how to type 20 WPMs faster and use keyboard shortcuts.')
