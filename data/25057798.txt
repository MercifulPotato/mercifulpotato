Since 1990 there are 5x as many people getting university degrees, and the rate at which those students get 1st class degrees has increased by 4x.<p>That is to say, the number of people able to get degrees has sky rocketed, and the classification of their degrees has also sky rocketed over the past 30 years.<p>So we&#x27;re left with the obvious question: Do we suddenly have 20x as many students capable of getting a first class degree when nothing in the rest of our data suggests a sudden rise in education standards or economic improvement?<p>Because your first class degree at a UK university is worht 1&#x2F;20th of what a first class degree at a UK university was in 1990.')
