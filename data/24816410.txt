That equates to between 60 and 6 grams of CO2 per GB, smack bang in the middle of the International Energy Agency estimate I linked to (29 grams).<p>The reason for the big discrepancy is your source article was written in 2016, and it referenced a study from 2012 for its 5.12 kWh&#x2F;GB number, and that 2012 study used bandwidth data from 2011.<p>Telecommunication systems are still getting exponentially more efficient over time (see the second Figure 3), so estimates get old very quickly.')
