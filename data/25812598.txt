If the Signal move was successful it should build confidence in future moves.<p>The killer app for Matrix for most people won&#x27;t be ability to run your own home server, but the easy generalization of Matrix to things like Reddit&#x2F;HN with good integration with 1-1 chat someday will be. Also organizational usage. That of course is way cooler than Signal &quot;not being facebook&quot;. So biding our time is fine.<p>When the time does come, we should probably campaign for HN to be officially bridged with Matrix too :D.')
