It is just developers not publishing games for Linux.<p>Why? because:<p>1. Windows comes preinstalled on many computers.<p>2. People do not install Linux because they cannot play games on it.<p>3. Game developers won&#x27;t publish on Linux because there are not enough users.<p>Is 3 the real problem, or is it 2? 2 is the real problem. If everyone committed to use Linux, game developers would follow immediately.<p>If you use Windows only for gaming then just buy a console, it is cheaper.')
