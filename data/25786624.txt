How are you giving me good value for free the first and at least the second time? Then maybe I&#x27;ll be interested in a chat. I need to discover the value on my own, in a natural way and not be sold it. This is pretty much universal to sales.<p>If you are targeting a larger business the cycles can be a year or more in length before you will see sales from initial discussions. Internal selling from a champion on the inside (the company) to your product is crutial, then there are tons of approval steps, budgets, legal review, pocs, etc...<p>Good luck')
