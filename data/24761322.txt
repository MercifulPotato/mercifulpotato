The project is dead. Keeping it alive only serves to divide the community unnecessarily. They can&#x27;t &quot;throw shade&quot; at other people&#x27;s work, if they aren&#x27;t doing any work. The weaker unmaintained project should be absorbed by the stronger and highly maintained one. It&#x27;s just FOSS nature.')
