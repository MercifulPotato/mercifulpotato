But ripgrep (including the version of ripgrep bundled with VS Code) does permit being built with PCRE2, which allows one to use the -P&#x2F;--pcre2 flag to switch regex engines. You can even use &#x27;--engine auto&#x27; to have ripgrep automatically select the regex engine.<p>With that said, I of course agree with your broader point. To say that regexes are &quot;useless&quot; without look-around&#x2F;backreferences is absolutely ridiculous.')
