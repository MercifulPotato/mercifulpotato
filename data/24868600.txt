I&#x27;m also taking classes and trying to use the language when I can. I&#x27;ve learned French and Dutch to conversational level in the past, but I&#x27;ve found Finnish to be much much harder.<p>In terms of life, generally in Helsinki or maybe the other big cities you could get by just fine with english only. I know a few folks at work who&#x27;ve been here a long time and have survived ok! In terms of written information everything is in Finnish or Swedish but occasionally (and from what I gather, increasingly) in English. I&#x27;ve found pretty much everyone in a customer&#x2F;client facing position speaks very good English too.<p>The one situation that comes to mind where it&#x27;s genuinely quite difficult is grocery shopping and following cooking instructions. Since I like to cook I enjoy trying new things but Google translate is totally hopeless. Thankfully I&#x27;ve found translating the Swedish to English seems to work OK.')
