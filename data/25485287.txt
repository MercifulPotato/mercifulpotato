I&#x27;ve had hard crash and multiple soft locks preventing progress, even on 1.05.<p>One was trying to vault a staircase and dropping into the water below.. but I wasn&#x27;t supposed to be able to fall down there, I guess, because I just kind of slid around and couldn&#x27;t duck or jump.  So that was a reload.<p>One was one of the psychopath bosses does this glitch teleport thing on you when they run up to attack you.  Which is scary and cool.. but they glitched into a stairwell and just yelled angrily at me while I stood there and couldn&#x27;t punch them.  So that was a reload.<p>Then I went to level up, and change my augments.  I got everything how I liked, and then went to exit out of the menu screen.  Except I couldn&#x27;t.  I felt like an idiot, trying for a while, though, figuring I was just missing some stupid and obvious way to exit it.  Nope.  So that was a reload.<p>Then one time I bought.. I think a vendor had 12 milkshakes, and I wanted them all, I don&#x27;t remember why.  So I bought them and the game hard crashed.  So that was a reload.<p>Then I had these two brother guys who were twins who I had to fight, but it cost 500 credits a round to fight them.  I ran out of credits and couldn&#x27;t afford another round, and with it ran out of ways to exit their dialogue menu.  So that was a reload.<p>And on it goes..')
