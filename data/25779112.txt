It felt like each library had its own idioms and syntax rules, which just adds a huge amount of variety and difficulty in a codebase. It was hard to have consistent architectural patterns across a team. I&#x27;ve seen an elixir&#x2F;phoenix backend rewritten completely in python&#x2F;django and it was a big improvement in developer productivity. I think elixir may work better for small teams. The learning curve and the &quot;consistency enforcement&quot; of languages really does make a difference on big teams.')
