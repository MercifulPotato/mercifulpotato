I really couldn&#x27;t even understand what he was talking about.  After beating my head against it for some time, I reached out to an acquaintance who was a philosophy instructor at a university and told him about my experience.<p>&quot;Try reading Hume,&quot; he advised me.<p>So, I read Hume, and I enjoyed it.<p>Last summer, I was visiting Edinburgh, Scotland for the first time.  I&#x27;ve always had a fascination with cemeteries: how the stones were carved, how old the people were, how long they lived, how long did their widows outlive them, etc.  In this particular cemetery in Edinburgh, I came across the tomb of David Hume.  It was completely unexpected: I was vaguely aware he was Scottish, but I didn&#x27;t expect to find his tomb.  I took a picture and excitedly sent to all my friends.  &quot;Hey, I found  the tomb of David Hume!&quot;<p>I guess my comment is a bit tangential to the article.  Like the article author, I found Hume interesting and accessible.  I still don&#x27;t understand Nietzsche.')
