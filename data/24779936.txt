Do I think deep learning is incredibly useful? Absolutely and I look forward to seeing more awesome stuff done with it in the future.<p>Do I think the singularity or &quot;true&quot; AI will be based on deep learning? Not really. I strongly suspect anything capable of reaching scifi levels of intelligence (which a lot of hype says or strongly implies is imminent) will have to be a difference of kind, not of degree.<p>I could be wrong, of course, but it will be interesting to wait and see.')
