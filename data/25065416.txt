It doesn&#x27;t connect to the Internet. It&#x27;ll beep if the camera is disconnected. The monitor has power save capability (video feed off, sound on), let me know if power is low....It has everything I need. I just needed to replace the battery for a very cheap price because the charge didn&#x27;t hold as long.')
