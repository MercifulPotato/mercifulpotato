Recently the opportunity of taking an online masters program has presented itself. There are some options like Georgia Tech or UT Austin. Does anyone here have experience with either of those? The latter seems more rigorous and more promising to me. I have also found that there are options of pursuing a MSc from some of the even better ranked universities (though I doubt that I would be admitted). How much does it help with future job prospects, particularly at big tech companies? (Acing the interview isn&#x27;t the hardest part, it&#x27;s getting the offer from a recruiter). What is the admission process like? Thanks for all the info.')
