There&#x27;s no real objective discussion to be had here.<p>Edit: That said I&#x27;m not being contrarian for the sake of it, I tried both Erlang and Elixir. Elixir however, is the one that kept me because I knew I wanted the benefits of that VM and the OTP capabilities to a degree but the niceties of a modern language which is after all a major reason I choose a language to do a job and be easy to write and maintain which I feel Erlang lacks the latter.')
