But it takes much less time to score exams and to administer them.<p>Writing research papers takes much, much, much less time because of word processors, online submission systems, copyediting changes, and so forth. A lot of research itself takes less time to do because of statistical analysis libraries, computerized administration and recruitment, etc etc etc<p>This is actually something I&#x27;ve heard older, very professors lament -- some of them have claimed that when, say, papers took longer to produce, you had more time to think when things were being mailed back and forth, and there wasn&#x27;t so much of a factory approach to paper writing where they were treated as widgets. I&#x27;m not saying I agree or disagree with this necessarily but I&#x27;m really skeptical of claims that productivity hasn&#x27;t risen in certain fields.<p>Now you can get into a discussion of &quot;real&quot; versus &quot;false&quot; productivity gains but that&#x27;s a little different.')
