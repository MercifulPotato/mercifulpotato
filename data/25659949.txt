So obviously Schrödinger equation alone is not enough to describe the time evolution of the universe. One way is to introduce wavefunction collapse, which is a nonlinear process. But there is no physical theory (well, there are propositions) of how and when collapse happens. It just happens somehow, sometime. This problem is at the core of why quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory.')
