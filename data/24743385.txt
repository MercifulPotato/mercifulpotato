Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602383495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739360, text='&gt; A state is most of the time a tool for a majority to oppress a minority. Laws and police are just their tools, and so are dictators. Whoever is labeled a dictator is just a figurehead supported by majority of elites, who in turn are supported by economically strong coalition, represented by some majority of people who are united.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that that characterisation of a state is true.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s sort of true, but it misses out some essential features which are directly relevant to that description, for <i>some</i> states anyway.<p>One of those is: Some states (maybe the USA?) believe in more than just acting out the wishes of the majority at any given time.<p>Some of them believe in ideals, which outlive an ephemeral majority.  Things like &quot;rule of law&quot; (which doesn&#x27;t mean clobbering minorities, it means the government is held to account rather than acting like a rogue king), &quot;human rights&quot; (in theory, things like the Magna Carta), &quot;justice&quot; (as defined by a long history of institutions and systems whose learned principles are studied by people that practice in it).<p>You can certainly argue that sort of thing still comes down to some level of majority oppressing a minority.  But I think the character of that ruling is <i>very</i> different in ways that matter, if it demonstrates a decent attempt at those attributes and builds them into stable institutions, than if it doesn&#x27;t bother or just pays lip service.')
