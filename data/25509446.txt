See e.g. the table on p.14 here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zenodo.org&#x2F;record&#x2F;3518178&#x2F;files&#x2F;Verhoeven%202019%20-%20Resolving%20some%20spatial%20resolution%20issues%20%E2%80%93%20Part%202.pdf?download=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zenodo.org&#x2F;record&#x2F;3518178&#x2F;files&#x2F;Verhoeven%202019%20-...</a> An airy disc of ~2um radius translates to ~500 lp&#x2F;mm. The following page also agrees with this usage, as does every other source I can find at the moment. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.normankoren.com&#x2F;Tutorials&#x2F;MTF1A.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.normankoren.com&#x2F;Tutorials&#x2F;MTF1A.html</a><p>I think you are basically out by a factor of 4 by using the diameter instead of the radius and requiring line quads rather than line pairs. I believe the lp&#x2F;mm value obtained is for ~9% MTF, so it&#x27;s a fairly generous estimate of the available resolution, but not excessively so.<p>Regardless of the correct definition of lp&#x2F;mm, the iPhone has plenty of room to increase the sensor resolution at f1.6. And phone cameras could certainly move to somewhat wider apertures and somewhat larger sensors.')
