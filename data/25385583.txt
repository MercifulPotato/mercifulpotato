In that price range you can get Pinnacle P1 ($200) or ER4XR ($250) which dump all over them. I use AirPods Pro daily, not for quality, but for convenience.<p>HomePod is probably the biggest disappointment I&#x27;ve ever heard. $300 and it sounds like a plastic box, despite &quot;computational audio&quot;.<p>At $550, you&#x27;re solidly in headphone big leagues. Beyer DT770 or DT990 are close to perfect and they&#x27;re &lt;$200. Beyond that point you&#x27;re hitting diminishing returns in audio quality; double price is going to get tiny marginal improvements in quality.<p>I&#x27;m eager to hear them but I can&#x27;t imagine them outperforming DT990s, despite costing twice as much.<p>(Yes, none of these options have bluetooth or ANC. Get an ES100 for BT. If noise is a problem, get IEMs or AirPods Pro.)')
