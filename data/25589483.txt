Item(by='selfhoster11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609387710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25587362, text='PCem (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PCem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PCem</a>) is a great improvement in the emulation of Windows 95 era hardware. It can emulate anything from the IBM PC through to Pentium II based systems. It also emulates specific graphics cards (3Dfx, Trident, S3, CGA&#x2F;EGA&#x2F;VGA, Tandy graphics, a number of DirectX cards) and specific sound cards (AdLib, Sound Blasters, Gravis Ultrasound).<p>The project should eventually allow emulation of the entire Windows 95&#x2F;Windows 98 era. In my mind, it&#x27;s comparable to what BSNES was to the Super Nintendo - accurate emulation that saves an entire era of software from getting lost.<p>Flash is homogeneous and hardware-agnostic, unlike those old Windows-based titles. Flash provides ~1 (bar inter-version incompatibility) target platform, and as far as I know, can run entirely in software rendering mode. If your computer is fast enough, there will be no hardware-based problem with running Flash software.<p>For Windows 95, there were multiple 3D APIs other than DirectX and OpenGL, and some titles depended on hardware-based quirks. Those APIs and hardware needed to be emulated accurately enough or passed through. That&#x27;s quite a large support surface.<p>In comparison, Flash needs a  Windows XP VM (or a standalone projector) with software-based rendering and that&#x27;s it. Not nearly as bad.')
