Item(by='dkersten', descendants=None, kids=[25420890], score=None, time=1607968250, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419265, text='&gt; On the other hand, being able to name the RAII object is often very useful<p>I didn&#x27;t say it wasn&#x27;t. <i>Being able</i> is perfectly fine, <i>being forced</i> is not. As I mentioned in another comment, the problem isn&#x27;t the extra typing, the problem is that it requires us, the programmer, to remember to name it even when we don&#x27;t feel we need <i>and</i> to remember that &quot;foo (bar)&quot; isn&#x27;t calling the constructor of foo and passing in bar, its calling the default constructor and declaring bar. That&#x27;s too many gotchas and rather error prone!<p>I believe there was a cppcon talk where the speaker said that it was a very common bug in Facebook, despite that they have linter rules to catch this case. Its also a rather insidious bug, because the code will run seemingly normally, just... it never actually locks anything. A rather hard problem to debug too.')
