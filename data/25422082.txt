There are (mostly) standardized ways to authenticate a CAC and associate it with a user for an information system. But people seem to prefer to roll their own. Either using traditional username&#x2F;password combos, or a worse solution.<p>The worse one is this (seen a few times): Username&#x2F;password and <i>then</i> you register your CAC with it. They only check the CAC itself for the cert expiration date. When it does finally expire (or gets revoked, say you need a new one early like happened to me a couple times, not to loss just became unreliable in the CAC reader), then you have to use the username&#x2F;password combo (the password has been getting updated every 60-90 days during all this time) and register your new CAC.<p>But, since they aren&#x27;t checking revocation data a stolen CAC + PIN (say it&#x27;s weak, beaten out of you, or they observe you using it) even <i>revoked</i> would still be able to authenticate against that system until the cert expires or the admin (usually) manually removes the revoked CAC.')
