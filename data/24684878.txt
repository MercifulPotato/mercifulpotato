I attended a small magnet middle school that was ranked as the best public school in the state, but it was still the most toxic experience of my educational life. It&#x27;s false to assume that gifted students don&#x27;t bully other gifted students<p>I hear you that you had a terrible experience at your magnet middle school. I&#x27;m glad that your high-school experience was better.<p>My own experience at TJ was that it meant having a group of peers who were just as enthusiastic about things like math, and physics, and computer science as I was. We learned a tremendous amount from each other, and gave each other the confidence to push far beyond the curriculum or what anyone would normally expect from high-school students. That&#x27;s something that simply would not have been possible if we were all scattered in our respective local high schools; it&#x27;s something that most of my friends from elsewhere never had until college.<p>I don&#x27;t assume that there was no bullying at TJ, or that the teachers are angels. But please hear that for many people it means an experience that we&#x27;re very grateful for, and that would not have happened without it.')
