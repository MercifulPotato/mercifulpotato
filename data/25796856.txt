That&#x27;s why many people strive to have money.<p>I personally also don&#x27;t think it is unfair if kids of rich parents inherit their money (or their support). After all, being able to take care of one&#x27;s children is a major motivation of many people for trying to make money.<p>It&#x27;s also well known that money is an important factor in mate choice for women.<p>Even without money, biology would be at work and people would be striving to find attractive mates to conceive &quot;fit&quot; children.<p>You could then also say those &quot;fit&quot; children are &quot;privileged&quot; compared to &quot;less fit&quot; children.<p>--<p>Anyway, as your own anecdotes highlight, if you are not rich, find another way, for example a rich person who gives you money.')
