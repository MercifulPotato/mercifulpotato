The problem is the teams who are asking for tickets aren&#x27;t managing them correctly or don&#x27;t have a good working agreement with the users. This is unfortunately very common with internal service providers.<p>But it can be changed. The users have to have a conversation with the service provider about what&#x27;s wrong with the process, how it&#x27;s affecting the users (&amp; the business), and how they&#x27;d like it to change. If the service provider stonewalls them, they can go up the management chain. Often upper management has no idea what&#x27;s going on and will get something done if they hear enough people complain.')
