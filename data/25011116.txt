I remember reading the terms before I subscribed which clearly stated that they can discontinue the free plan anytime. It is really good plan as I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying printer ink, always print in high quality color and printed a lot of photos. TBH, it is still really a good plan for $1 per month.')
