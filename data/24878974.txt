In the case of YouTube-dl the knife was included with instructions on how to kill someone, so it was deemed a potential &quot;murder weapon&quot;.<p><pre><code>  What if someone sold a car and included instructions on how to run over pedestrians?  Should the car no longer be sold, or should the instructions be removed?\n</code></pre>\nMy point here is that banning all of something based on the fact that the something could be used to commit illegal acts, when that same something also has legitimate legal uses,  is a slippery slope.  These days the RIAA pretty much lives on that slippery slope.')
