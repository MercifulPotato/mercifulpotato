You could consider it a very, very rough approximation of how anarchy would play out in real life. Your statement (if you are in a fixed location, people will find a way) closely mirrors my experience.<p>Even though, in the Minecraft natural environment, there are things that are dangerous (e.g. wild animals, &quot;monsters&quot;, ravines, etc.), nothing comes close to the danger of meeting another player, possibly armed.<p>If you are a new player, the most challenging part is escaping spawn (the area where new players start from, which is also the only crowded area in the game). This is pretty hard because spawn is a wasteland with no natural resources left (in Minecraft you have a hunger meter so if you can&#x27;t find food you will eventually die), and in addition spawn is populated by armed players who kill new players as a pastime.<p>Once you get to about 20 kilometres from spawn (20k blocks in Minecraft) you start finding food (trees from which you can get fruit, wood for building fishing poles, seeds that you can plant to start a small farm). However, you can&#x27;t stay in the same place for long, because in a few weeks at most, some other player will find your base and steal your stuff and&#x2F;or destroy the base.<p>Once you get to about a hundred kilometres from spawn (100k blocks in Minecraft), you can build a temporary base and hope that it will last a few months (mine lasted about 3 months).<p>Currently I have a base that is over one million blocks from spawn (i.e. more than 1000 kms) and I expect this may last for a longer period, maybe even years, so I&#x27;m building larger structures.<p>Obviously this is just a Minecraft server and doesn&#x27;t accurately reflect real life.<p>Some elements are realistic, for example travelling speed[2], or the way natural resources are either renewable (plants, animals) or non renewable (minerals).<p>Some other elements are not that realistic, for example the number of players on the server is way smaller than the population of a typical city. This means that the &quot;safe distance&quot; from spawn might not reflect the safe distance from a major city in real life.<p>Also, spawn is the only area with a high population. There are some larger bases across the map, but even the largest ones have a population of a few dozens players at most.<p>Another element that is not realistic is obviously construction. In real life, building a home or a farm means a lot of hard work, whereas in Minecraft you can do it in a few hours.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2b2t" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2b2t</a><p>[2] walking speed is about 5 km&#x2F;h, travelling through a &quot;nether highway&quot; you can go at about 45km&#x2F;h so this could be compared to motorised transport in real life')
