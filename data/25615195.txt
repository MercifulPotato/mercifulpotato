I split mine into 4 categories: personal, professional, physical, and reading. And then do monthly goals for each and track what I do per day. I don&#x27;t have to do something in each category every day or even have to do anything any day. It&#x27;s just helpful for me to see if I am slacking in an area over a stretch of days. The idea is to keep the goals fairly easy to accomplish and not plan more than a month out so I can pivot.')
