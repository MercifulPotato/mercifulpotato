It’s not a ‘real’ sin. Are we teenagers again because we use zoom like school kids do and should be admonished like children?<p>This is someone’s livelihood, reputation, legacy and maybe even way to pay bills. Not to mention public image. Who should be embarrassed now? Toobin or New Yorker? These are extraordinary times. Perhaps we should all grow up.<p>We are going to end up firing or cancelling everyone doing any work. What’s going to be left of our economy and any industry as a matter of fact.<p>[..]Jeffrey Toobin has been fired from the New Yorker magazine after 27 years following an incident last month in which he exposed himself during a video conference meeting.<p>Vice Media first reported the suspension last month, with two anonymous sources telling the outlet that the incident occurred during an election simulation meeting with staff. Toobin characterized the incident as an “embarrassingly stupid mistake” in a statement to the outlet.<p>“I believed I was not visible on Zoom,” Toobin said at the time. “I thought no one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video.”[..]')
