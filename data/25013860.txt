For example using decentralized p2p technologies like WebRTC is a good way to not use servers I know you still need servers for peer indexing etc but I argue that this is more green, we should start thinking in terms of offline first software where the user owns his data locally so it does not live on a server somewhere because the more data a server has the more compute power it will use to work with the data.<p>Edit: Typo')
