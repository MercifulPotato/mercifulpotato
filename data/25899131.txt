Someone replied to you  that &#x27;bring merry christmas back&#x27; was indeed a thing.  Then camjohnson26 replied to them, saying &quot;They wouldn’t feel like they need to bring Merry Christmas back if the overly politically correct voices hadn’t tried to cancel it in the first place.&quot;<p>Note that the first half of that (people trying to bring the greeting back) is a reference to weak man 1, and the second half (people trying to cancel the greeting) suggests that weak man 2) wasn&#x27;t an exaggeration, it really happened.  It is that latter half that I responded to.<p>Does the left think it <i>enough</i> to meet some arbitrary threshhold that allows us to call it &#x27;widespread&#x27;?  I dunno, that sounds totally subjective and semantic.  Luckily that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re arguing about (I just used that term  as a short way of saying &#x27;as widespread as the right has claimed&#x27;).  What we are arguing about is:  were the claims from the right about the left being against &#x27;merry christmast&#x27; roughly accurate, or a big exaggeration?  I claim the latter, and camjohnson26 (I&#x27;m fairly sure they would agree) was saying the former.')
