If the market for GME is &quot;one-way&quot; (it&#x27;s not, people are shorting), they might also hedge the sale by buying more exotic financial instruments and correlates of the GME price.<p>&gt; they say &quot;no, we&#x27;re not taking on any more risk&quot; and communicate that to Robin Hood.<p>Maybe, although they would probably do that when their ability to hedge started breaking down, not when they&#x27;d already acquired massive short positions.<p>More likely, to me, is that they would just increase the bid-ask price spread continuously as their ability to hedge degrades.')
