But after you subtract those the market of quality games without those dark patterns is still massively bigger than it ever has been in the past.<p>(I am talking solely of the PC market of course. Mobile games have way more widespread crap, and all the app stores have discoverability issues that result in all the good games basically being impossible to find unless you find out about them from somewhere else (yes there are actually good, non microtransaction based mobile games too)).')
