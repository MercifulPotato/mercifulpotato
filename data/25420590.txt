Though it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of time, as it did help me to learn to manage complex systems (I like complex games) and to anticipate and prepare (I like RPG&#x27;s and chess), and it also helped me to destress, there was also a compulsive quality to my gaming where the ultimate payoff wasn&#x27;t all that great compared to the many thousands of hours I put in to it.')
