Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=[25816176], score=None, time=1610910569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813256, text='I think we agree on the larger point but I disagree with a couple of your points here.<p>&gt; <i>it&#x27;s not only appropriate but essential that the employees of companies be allowed to call out fascism, and express their fear and dismay of Nazis, to colleagues whenever they see it</i><p>Fascism is the reprehensible government structure du jour but I think it&#x27;s wrong to be single-sided here. Employees should be allowed to call out things they disagree with. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything will happen, and they end up leaving the company because of it. But I do think there are quite a few conservative, non-fascist, anti-Nazi people who will read a &quot;employees can call out fascism!&quot; comment and feel at least a <i>bit</i> like it&#x27;s meant toward them as more conservative that most people in tech. I was a #nevertrump Republican throughout the primary and changed my party registration the day after his nomination. I think he&#x27;s done 10x the damage to conservatism than Nixon ever could have. But I&#x27;m sure there are people here who, because I was a registered Republican during the Obama administration, view me as a fascist. I&#x27;m positive there are people who are registered Republicans today who <i>hate</i> what Trump is doing (both to the party and to the country), working in tech, and reading HN right now.<p>&gt; <i>regardless of whether it is immediately linked to a product initiative</i><p>This I&#x27;m not so sure about. I mean GitHub exists to ship software, and for the most part if you&#x27;re communicating over a GitHub channel it should probably be about that. The fact that they have DEI channels and race-based channels and such on the official Slack in the first place is probably a larger discussion in itself.<p>&gt; <i>The comment that states &quot;you dont see &#x27;commie&#x27; being dropped in the workplace nor should &#x27;nazi,&#x27; it&#x27;s just slandering&quot; is the false equivalency of the century, and if we can&#x27;t distinguish between words that over-simplify a political ideology, vs. words that concisely warn colleagues that something is going beyond political ideology and towards a pattern of racially-motivated behavior that places people in grave danger, we haven&#x27;t learned our lessons from history.</i><p>With regard to the 6th specifically, absolutely agree.<p>With regard to the language more generally, though, you&#x27;re assuming that &quot;commie&quot; is always an over-simplification and &quot;nazi&quot; never is. Something actually <i>are</i> communism, which is responsible for a couple hundred million deaths historically, so while not directly racially related, it&#x27;s not exactly a great thing. Commie also doesn&#x27;t have quite the negative connotation of Nazi, and rightfully so. So even arguing the point feels a little like arguing about &quot;cracker&quot; vs. the n word. One is obviously worse, regardless of context.')
