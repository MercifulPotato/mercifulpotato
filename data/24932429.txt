That&#x27;s also true for indies. I don&#x27;t make money off youtube directly however my distributor claims videos using my music and I make money off ads on youtube indirectly. The payout isn&#x27;t big, but it&#x27;s not insignificant either.<p>I imagine a lot of major artists make good money off youtube too. They don&#x27;t if someone just downloads their videos. In times where musicians can&#x27;t make money off concert, it&#x27;s even more meaningful. Google does work directly with all these music labels (VEVO and co...).')
