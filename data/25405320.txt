It&#x27;s not a replacement for the web, but rather a supplement to it, where intelligent machine agents can automatically and intelligently navigate relationship connections to find or even infer the information you&#x27;re looking for using various APIs. Tim Berners Lee was way ahead of his time with this (and ahead of computers&#x27; ability to make something useful out of it), which is why it languished for so long (much like AI did).<p>schema.org is a godsend, because it&#x27;s finally a serious attempt at standardizing semantics (much like foaf did in a rather anemic attempt). I&#x27;ve added the relationship data type to the Concise Encoding spec [1] and look forward to exciting times!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concise-encoding.org&#x2F;#relationships" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;concise-encoding.org&#x2F;#relationships</a>')
