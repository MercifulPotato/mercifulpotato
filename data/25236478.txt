Source is available at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;teddit&#x2F;teddit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeberg.org&#x2F;teddit&#x2F;teddit</a><p>Feedback and suggestions are welcome!<p>Basically teddit is alternative front-end for Reddit. Like what Invidious is for YouTube, or what Nitter is for Twitter, or what Bibliogram is for Instagram.<p>Teddit doesn&#x27;t use any client-side JavaScript, nor does it have any ads (not now, and not in the future). Teddit supports videos too, so it uses native browser video players. I wanted to make the site as minimalistic and lightweight as possible. You can clone the repo and self-host your own (public or private) teddit instance on your own server.')
