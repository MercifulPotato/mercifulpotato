Doubling from 7, you get 14, 28, 56; and 1⁄7 is 0.1̅4̅2̅8̅5̅7̅, 2⁄7 is 0.2̅8̅5̅7̅1̅4̅, 3⁄7 is 0.4̅2̅8̅5̅7̅1̅, <i>&amp;c.</i> (just changing which digit you start the recurring sequence with). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;142,857" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;142,857</a> talks about it a bit more; the doubling sequence thing is covered in the section <i>1⁄7 as an infinite sequence</i> (including the reason the recurring decimal has 57 instead of 56—that 56 doubled is 112, so the hundred there overlaps with the six, much as the ten of the 13 adds to the 8 in the 1⁄89 expansion of this article).')
