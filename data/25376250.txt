But that&#x27;s just it, it&#x27;s the work of a few engineers and not thousands writing if-else blocks for each airport.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand what Uber does that requires so many people getting paid so much money, the only thing that makes sense to me is they don&#x27;t want them working for Lyft. It would be helpful for people to shed more light on how engineering resources are spent and what particular systems require so many hands to realize, but that&#x27;s too valuable information to leak I&#x27;d imagine.')
