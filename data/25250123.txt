It doesn&#x27;t really matter what you&#x27;re doing or if it succeeds as long as it&#x27;s marketable to people aspiring to create an online business<p>2) Make a big fuss about the launch on all social platforms (Twitter, HN, PH, IH, your blog, etc) and hope someone with a big audience signal boosts you or you get lucky<p>3a) If you start making money, awesome! Constantly post revenue numbers, things about Building in Public (TM) and &quot;you can do it too!&quot;. Your audience (And therefore revenue) will compound exponentially<p>3b) If you &#x27;fail&#x27;, make a blog post retrospective called &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; and blast that out everywhere as well<p>4) Repeat steps 1-3 until you hit 3a. Throw in a few &quot;6 Months of Building in Public&quot; type posts if you&#x27;re really having trouble<p>In reality, I strongly believe that very few people end up making it through this type of process and success mostly comes down to luck or connections (Anyone who already has an audience can easily pull you up).')
