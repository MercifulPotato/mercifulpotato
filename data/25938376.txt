I thought when the redditor buys the call someone else, let&#x27;s say Bob, sells the call. If Bob already owns 100 cows (covered calls), then no one will be forced to buy cows ever. If Bob doesn&#x27;t own 100 cows (naked calls), Bob will have to buy 100 cows at the end of the month if the call is in the money, not right away.')
