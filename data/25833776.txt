If your language is &quot;simple&quot;, you need to write the same low-level code again and again every single time, making <i>your own code</i> NOT simple. Pushing all the complexity away from <i>our</i> program into the language means that <i>our code</i> is simple, which is much more important. Any improvement to the compiler is spread for free to every single program compiled by it.<p>(I&#x27;m a go user, though)')
