It&#x27;s the name of the symbol. It&#x27;s sometimes used as a symbol to mean &#x27;approximately&#x27;, as in &quot;~100 BC&quot;. It&#x27;s used in IT as a symbol for a home folder on Unix-based systems and for pattern matching in other languages.<p>Regardless of the symbol&#x27;s function in different domains, the symbol&#x27;s name remains &#x27;tilde&#x27;.<p>Maybe <i>you</i> don&#x27;t use the word much but that really has nothing to do with the price of fish.')
