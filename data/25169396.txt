I still work, not because I have to, but because it gives me a reason to get up in the morning.<p>Damn. I read the same thing from a lot of people on HN over the years and I&#x27;m envious.<p>I think I could easily and happily just not work for the rest of my life (in my 30s). I did exactly that for more than a year, living off my savings after being laid off. It was fantastic.<p>For six more months after that, I worked a couple of hours a week contracting, as the savings started to dry up. But I wasn&#x27;t even close to wanting to work again. Maybe it would happen in 3-5 years? Who knows, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to do it full time. Which is where I&#x27;m back at, currently (working as a software engineer).')
