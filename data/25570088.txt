But distribute other things too, not only economic.<p>If you want to punish my grandfather who studied hard, despite being from a 3rd world country, studied in England, came back to native country, while other people in the same social group couldn&#x27;t be bothered to study, make money and pass the wealth across generations. Then my dad studied, got an mba. Then I made a startup, and made even more. Not once, sold 3x.<p>Look at good looking people, their parents likely married other good looking people, and their grandparents too. Eventually they became models and living off attention.<p>Why do people who accumulate wealth get punished. Tax those people too who store it in their genes. Otherwise don&#x27;t ask me. My ancestors sacrificed their time, pleasures so we could be better, and I have sacrificed my teen years, learning to program all by myself, no mentor or guide, while other kids went socializing, partying, playing video games. My idol was Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and people like them, while their idols were Ronaldo etc. They had access to same resources as me, now I&#x27;m better off because I recognized what was valuable. Not my fault.<p>You want me to give away money, ask people who store wealth in genes to also give away them. People acquire wealth for influence and to be desired, just like good looking people have influence and are desired.<p>Is it such a hard concept to understand?')
