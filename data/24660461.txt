Nothing changed, structurally or technologically (covid is neither), for outsourcing to work better now than it used to be so far.<p>There will always be companies who need to learn on their own how $20K developers are different from $200K developers and what investing in either means 10 years down the road.<p>By the way, good developers with good English and good communication skills can easily earn MUCH more than $20K even today by working remotely. Already today in most countries there are almost no barriers to earning multiples of their national averages other than one&#x27;s own skills and attitude. And yet dev salaries in America are as high as ever.<p>The industry seems to be growing faster than the labour force even despite globalization, and I don&#x27;t think that trend will reverse anytime soon. We&#x27;re still shoving software into more places, industries, and processes, and making it all more complicated.')
