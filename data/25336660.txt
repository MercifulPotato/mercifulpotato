Both the MacOS and iOS version of the Spotify app supports English subtitles for podcasts. I’m trying to find a way to download the subtitles for offline usage. I tried downloading the episode for offline play but the subtitles never download and require internet connection to show up. \nAn example of a podcast with English subtitles is Joe Rogan Experience. If I can find out a way to extract the subtitles with their timestamps that would be perfect.')
