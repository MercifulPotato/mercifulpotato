Namecheap will ask me who I want to resolve the domain (or offer to do it themselves).<p>I go and look up the details for DigitalOcean or Amazon or whatever and I put them in, but I either don&#x27;t tell the hosting provider I&#x27;ve done this, or I later delete the domain in DO&#x2F;AWS, someone else can come along and tell DigitalOcean that they own it (AWS as well, though it&#x27;s harder since they have a bigger pool of name servers).<p>Once DigitalOcean believes that the new user owns it they allow them to edit the DNS records. The attacker can then point the domain at whatever server they like and &quot;takeover&quot; the domain.<p>The original owner can get it back by changing the details in their registrar. But in the mean time a bunch of traffic might have been intercepted by the attacker (all kinds of bad).<p>NB: this was the case in 2016 when the article was written, I have not checked if it is still the case.')
