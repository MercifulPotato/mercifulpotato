E.g. twitter&#x2F;fb have email addresses, and use them to notify friends, but they won&#x27;t give you your followers&#x27; email list. There could be a way to ask your followers to give them for example, or at least a hash of it, so they can be discovered in another network. The issue here is that whatever value is in friend lists &#x2F;subscribers is locked into these companies, but in reality it&#x27;s the users who have earned it.')
