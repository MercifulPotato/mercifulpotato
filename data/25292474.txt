It&#x27;s technically less precise than GPS&#x2F;wifi location data but since it&#x27;s always active it&#x27;s pretty easy to use weeks of data to improve the resolution.<p>Besides that just don&#x27;t install any apps you don&#x27;t need. Stick to open source software, install a custom ROM on your phone, don&#x27;t use Google location services, etc.')
