You can see how there was a massive spike around week 12 to week 21, which is exactly when the initial covid outbreak hit and Sweden&#x27;s disastrous &quot;herd immunity&quot; policy failed.<p>Now Swedes have been scared and changed their behavior and covid deaths are less. Furthermore, the defensive behavior of covid prevents other deaths. People, do not drive, do not party, do not engage in sports, do not take drugs, or over-drink or over-eat at parties, so that other causes of death go down.<p>So it is possible that covid isolation reduces death rate more than the deaths caused by the virus itself. But that is not a solution, people cannot live in covid isolation forever.')
