Meaning that a car turning actually can turn, and stop in front of the crosswalk for pedestrians.  Which in turn means that the driver can pay attention to cars, decide to turn, and then separately deal with pedestrians rather than have pedestrians be part of a complicated decision.<p>I know of no research on it, but I have to believe that this design saves lives over the American standard of having the crosswalk right at the intersection.')
