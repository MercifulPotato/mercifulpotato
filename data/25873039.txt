This has an advantage that it can be carried and secured separately, even if the device has to go into insecure storage like a hotel safe. You need to trust your FIDO2&#x2F;PKCS11 device to be secure, though.<p>Clevis, on the other hand, allows to bind the key to a specific machine, preventing the storage itself from being yanked out (where it is still possible) - and you need to trust TPM2, which many do not.<p>It&#x27;s all about trade-offs and trust.')
