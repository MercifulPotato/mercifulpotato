And everyone loses their shit over it.<p>Everyone loses their shit over it because it&#x27;s a direct example of the US government potentially violating the first amendment. They may claim that the app is being used to spread propaganda, farm user data, and is a &quot;national security threat&quot;, but they&#x27;ve done very little other than raise the specter of &quot;China&quot; to prove that. Their claims of justification have been met with significant push back and, as far as I&#x27;m aware, they haven&#x27;t provided any meaningful proof of their claims.<p>So yes, it&#x27;s well-worth it for people to get up in arms about the US government censoring and shutting down access of US customers to a phone app. That&#x27;s a hugely dangerous precedent to set and one that shouldn&#x27;t be done lightly.')
