If you&#x27;re interested in the state of the city budget, Covid-19 combined with the passage of a year means that you really need to double-check everything in this article, so at best, it&#x27;s a waste of time. At worst, you&#x27;re being pushed toward a very biased, incomplete view of things - I&#x27;m not saying every article published by a &quot;think tank&quot; is factually wrong, but ignoring such articles is a handy lifehack.')
