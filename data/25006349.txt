Instead they don&#x27;t let migrant construction workers nor gardeners nor cleaners etc into the country, which is worse for global inequality.  But, out of sight, out of mind.<p>(There&#x27;s more to say about income distribution in Singapore, but having migrant workers, even if badly paid, is a plus in my book.<p>If Singaporean immigration was more open, they would have even more low paid foreigners.  Making the situation look worse, but be better purely in terms of global equality.)<p>With kids: I think it&#x27;s mostly expensive if you are an expat and go the expat route with everything.  If you go more local and earn a decent amount of money, the amount you save in taxes should more than make up for some extra costs.<p>(There&#x27;s also a breakeven point for expats with kids at private international school, but it&#x27;s obviously much higher.)')
