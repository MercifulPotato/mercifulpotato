The collective action problem has been addressed in political philosophy for centuries, but was most clearly established in 1965 in Mancur Olson&#x27;s The Logic of Collective Action.<p>Problems arise when too many group members choose to pursue individual profit and immediate satisfaction rather than behave in the group&#x27;s best long-term interests. Social dilemmas can take many forms and are studied across disciplines such as psychology, economics, and political science. Examples of phenomena that can be explained using social dilemmas include resource depletion, low voter turnout, and overpopulation. The collective action problem can be understood through the analysis of game theory and the free-rider problem, which results from the provision of public goods. Additionally, the collective problem can be applied to numerous public policy concerns that countries across the world currently face.&quot;<p>The part of the wiki that deals with this specific problem (vehicles) is unfortunately broken for some reason, but, eh, we get the point.')
