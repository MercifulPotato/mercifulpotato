The ideal (and minimum) number of colors for a sober site is two: one color for the background and a very different color for the text, each of them an extreme and opposite shade of gray.  If you are really fancy, add a third color on a couple of very small places, almost inconspicuously.  More than three colors results in an ugly pastiche.  The worst offence is having several slightly different shades of the same base color.  This is what this article seems to propose and it is unbearably horrendous.')
