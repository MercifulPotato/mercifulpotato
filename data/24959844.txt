I&#x27;d get sent a text and that would be it.<p>When I don&#x27;t use Nord due to forgetting to switch it on, it works fine 100% of the time.<p>Now, they just shut the door on me. I can&#x27;t even change my Amazon email address because they need to send a confirmation email to my current address which I can&#x27;t get in to!!!!!!')
