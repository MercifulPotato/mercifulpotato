You&#x27;re paying a cut for the eyeballs and distribution Youtube provides.<p>The alternative would be for you to pay Google their share of money they would&#x27;ve made if they had ads enabled on your channel, which would be proportional to how many views your video gets. It makes sense since these channels have their own in-video ads which they make money from, and Youtube isn&#x27;t getting a cut of that, it&#x27;s similar to how app stores don&#x27;t allow apps to have their own monetization which bypasses theirs.<p>That being said, having the creator payback Youtube depending on the number of views creates very weird incentives...<p>If they were harsher, they would&#x27;ve disallowed in-video ads completely and force channels to use Youtube ads.')
