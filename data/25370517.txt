That&#x27;s the first pitch of the first inning and they can&#x27;t even do that. It&#x27;s absolutely a safe bet the zero-credibility authorities will never provide an answer as to the origination of the virus. Their entire obvious goal is to never - not under any circumstances - blame China. They still dodge and evade that at all costs. They&#x27;ve collectively humiliated themselves and should be mocked frequently for it, for a long time. Every other sane person already knows where it came from: Wuhan, and likely inadvertantly escaped from their biolab after having been sampled from bats. It&#x27;s the only credible, rational explanation given what is known (including about their sampling program and horrific lab security); every other explanation requires farcical, laughable stretches to go far out of the way to avoid blaming China (it was India; it was imported via frozen food; it was the US army; etc).')
