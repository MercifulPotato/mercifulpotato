I, with my mom, were the primary caretakers of my father with dementia. Without any kind of sedation he was actually more mentally aware but also prone to violence, yelling, sprinting (if in the house easy to trip). On the sedative he was more manageable but also clumsier and more prone to slipping and falling. Overall I&#x27;d rather deal with that than having to be a referee between him and my mom!')
