Most probable targets are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia.<p>Russia is the most lucrative target but because of nuclear weapon, most likely more and more protests would be organized to attempt to destroy the country from inside, like they did in Ukraine in 2014.<p>If this strategy fail or is taking too long time, Iran or Saudi Arabia should be prepared. Saudi Arabia is an ally but it&#x27;s so rich in resources, that there will be some Casus Belli found.<p>Besides there&#x27;s no longer even a need for even remotely plausible explanation to start plundering other country. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter will explain it all and block all the discontent.')
