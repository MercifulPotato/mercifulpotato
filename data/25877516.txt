I hope planners have revisited doctoring to account for new detection tech - more comprehensive, redundant and rapid compared to the cold war - and have formulated different response models to different actors. Right now only Russia has enough nukes to threaten second strike that would warrant immediate retaliation.<p>IMO modern monitoring in general skews conservative responses, it would be pretty rare for malfunctions across multiple detectors to show multiple launces &#x2F; full mad scenario that require immediate counter-strike. It&#x27;s almost worth taking risk of hypothetical hit and then counterstrike with certainty then retaliate prematurely on false alarms.')
