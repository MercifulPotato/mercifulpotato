It&#x27;s all about getting a cut of every revenue stream they can on the platform and preventing alternatives<p>- casual users do care about this stuff - just the other day for example my wife wanted to play some GBA game from her childhood - you can get that on play store easily, and even if you couldn&#x27;t it&#x27;s on other stores and in OSS. That&#x27;s just not an option on iOS unless you&#x27;re a technical user. Or more broadly recent Epic and Fortnite situation.  Plenty of scenarios where Apple will decide what you can or cannot get and it won&#x27;t work for everyone - you don&#x27;t need to be a power user to be excluded<p>Apple has best products, HW and software wise, and they are milking that advantage as much as they can - not necessarily judging them but this arguing that it&#x27;s in user interest is ridiculous, they are optimising for number of users affected vs profit they can extract - for example they had to buckle with big players like Amazon and Netflix because that would alienate too many users, but they will enforce their grip on the ecosystem if that means limiting a small number of users - and that has nothing to do with security.')
