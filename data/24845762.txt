Of course, things tend to die in the process of being eaten, but they aren&#x27;t looking to murder humans. They are looking to <i>feed.</i><p>And it just so happens that they have a giant mouth full of  a zillion teeth, so when they go to taste you and see if you are anything tasty, they rip off a leg.<p>And we know they don&#x27;t really want to eat you in part because of the relatively high percentage of stories that end with &quot;And then my leg washed up on shore three days later.&quot;<p>So the Great White isn&#x27;t a murderous killing machine. It is a callous, heartless Cthuloid Horror that doesn&#x27;t give a damn about you at all and often doesn&#x27;t so much as deign to swallow the arm or leg they ripped off while wondering if you were a seal.<p>This is why we fixate on them and make horror movies about them and so forth. If they were actually killing machines who liked eating people, we just wouldn&#x27;t go in the water at beaches because the incidence of shark attacks is actually so remarkably low precisely because we aren&#x27;t what they really want to eat. If they really liked feeding on &quot;land food,&quot; the incidence of shark attacks on humans would be so high that people just wouldn&#x27;t go in the water -- because it is shockingly common for there to be sharks nearby in the waters of a crowded beach and they just aren&#x27;t chomping on people.')
