The issue is not &#x27;First Amendment&#x27; rights (this applies only to government, not private companies), but monopoly, which causes many problems - this being just one. (Although actually I think the specific decisions made here are the right ones.)<p>Now, in practice, it might be more accurate to call these markets oligopolies (certainly cloud infrastructure is more this), but this still leaves a few companies with dramatic power over important parts of society.<p>And monopoly is a problem for the government to solve; these companies aren&#x27;t &#x27;evil&#x27; (any more than most others at least, except in virtue of their size), and the lasting solution is not to try and shame them or call them out here or claim victimhood (as the right has done) - though exercising voice can work as a short term tactic sometimes.')
