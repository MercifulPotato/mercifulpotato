I have a small flat compared to US standards, but there&#x27;s plenty of Ethernet wiring and I have a small (passively cooled) 16-port Linksys PoE switch so I can run 2 wifi APs and 4 security cameras through PoE, which is nice because I don&#x27;t need the 230V power or the bulky power adapters.')
