My father was named for him (middle name).<p>Now, it&#x27;s also true to some degree that I benefit from society in a way that blacks don&#x27;t (at least not to the same degree).

(Where they don&#x27;t have to be any more careful in a traffic stop than I do, for example.)  But &quot;acknowledging the role that my ancestors played&quot;?  I do, with pride.')
