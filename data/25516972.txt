This leaves a gap in the region of 3.98 - 4.0 GHz for radar altimeters. The letter states &quot;recent research confirms that even this spectrum gap is insufficient to ensure radio altimeters are protected from harmful RF interference by 5G networks&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about a radar altimeter&#x27;s operation to speculate as to why it could be an issue.')
