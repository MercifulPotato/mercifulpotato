If &quot;time passes&quot; during the period after all black holes have evaporated and before the cosmology &quot;recycles&quot; itself, that does not seem to me to be a problem for the model. (Which of course doesn&#x27;t mean the model is necessarily right, just that this particular issue doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be a problem for it.)')
