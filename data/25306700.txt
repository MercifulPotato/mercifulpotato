But having had absolutely terrible experience with doctors first hand, I just don&#x27;t like how people&#x27;s concerns are dismissed. Take an ibuprofen, you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>And I get it, they have to deal with a lot of people, all with their own opinions, many of which are indeed wrong.<p>But that results in a rather sizeable minority of people who aren&#x27;t getting the care they need. And worse, they can&#x27;t just go and do something about it on their own, even if they take full responsibility, everything is tightly controlled.<p>Billions of people will receive the vaccine. I am quite sure there will be real side effects in a sizeable number of people (I hope I&#x27;m wrong, really). And I have no doubt that in many parts of the world, they&#x27;ll be dismissed, ridiculed and laughed at.<p>These otherwise normal people are marginalized and then join the more radical movements as they try to make sense of everything.<p>I&#x27;ve been saying we need public funded PSA&#x27;s against conspiracy theories, and not just dry science talk.
