After the initial trouble, we did remotely all the things that looked impossible to do outside the office.\nOnly one exception: the coffee break. The occasional chit chat which happened in the coffee area has not been substituted from any call, even the most informal one. We tried to do remote coffees but the magic doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Do you know anyone who tried to replace this moment with a remote tool?')
