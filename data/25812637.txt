For the general public I expect this to continue (at least until we with NixOS making self hosting things far easier someday :P).<p>However, just as regular users want to get off the Facebook ecosystem, business&#x27;s should want to get away from GSuite (Really, it&#x27;s embarrassing if you are anything close to a google competitor) and I have some optimism there. The &quot;element matrix services&quot; of course isn&#x27;t political decentralization, but is a helpful stepping stone, and still more isolated per tenant than GSuite (e.g. completely distinct accounts).')
