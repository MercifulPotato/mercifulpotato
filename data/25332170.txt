And next time you finish a good podcast, instead of rushing to the next one, take a pause. Reflect on what you learned, write down your thoughts about it, or simply enjoy the silence. Your brain and nervous system will appreciate the rest, and you’ll probably remember the podcast better tomorrow.')
