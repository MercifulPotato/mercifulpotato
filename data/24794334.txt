This assumes the population count and distribution of songs which you would consider &quot;pop&quot; vs. not &quot;pop&quot; is consistent year to year, which I don&#x27;t think it is.<p>What constitutes the top N pop songs each year is becoming more distilled and refined as the industry matures, which means they&#x27;re all converging onto each other and losing complexity. I also contend if you chart the volume of sales for the whole music industry vs. this tight cluster, the cluster&#x27;s ratio of single or streaming sales decreases.<p>Meanwhile there&#x27;s artists in an increasingly large tail making what you&#x27;d probably call &quot;pop&quot; in style but just without marketing push, which are more experimental and less refined, and these become underrepresented in the study.')
