This idea is an example of a proposal by Maldacena and Leonard Susskind of Stanford in 2013 that quantum entanglement can be thought of as a wormhole. The wormhole, in turn, provides a secret tunnel through which information can escape the interior.<p>What is this saying? Say we have a method for producing microscopic black holes, and a quantum computer capable of simulating them. What&#x27;s the experiment we can do to show that this happens? We hit the real thing with a photon and it shows up in the simulation?')
