I don&#x27;t need anything complex, I&#x27;m mainly looking for a reasonable guesstimate on the number of visitors per page. This is hindered by common use of ad-blockers, which understandably block many analytics scripts. Do I have to build my own solution to this or is there an existing product for counting visitors that is not blocked by ad-blockers?')
