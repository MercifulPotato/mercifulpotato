If one is feeling depressed, it might be due to hanging out with bad company, not pursuing your quest in life, simply lacking the stimulus you need or being too inactive. The worst is when people try to help you out of it, which makes one feel even worse. Some phases in life might be expected too, which changes over time. So having the perspective of impermanence and adventurous investigation can help explore any situation.<p>In many ways I&#x27;m still just a kid. Just trying to avoid being a spoiled entitled brat and act responsibly too.')
