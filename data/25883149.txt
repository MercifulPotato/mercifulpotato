Lombok tends to interfere with Eclipse&#x27; code evaluations (last time I used it, it kept interfering with searching for a generated method&#x27;s usage in your code base) and tends to confuse me when trying to figure out if something&#x27;s an actual method or a method that was injected into the AST during compilation.<p>Immutables has its own set of problems, but at least it uses the standard Annotation processor and has a clear separation of generated code and the interface you write.<p>Haven&#x27;t used Java&#x27;s new record&#x27;s yet, so don&#x27;t really know anything about that.')
