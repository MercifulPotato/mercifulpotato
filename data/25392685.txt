Have you had to call to delete a VM?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='We&#x27;ve been VERY slowly moving some legacy applications from Rackspace over to AWS. \nAfter we migrate one and we&#x27;re sure everything is good we delete the old VM. We&#x27;ve been doing this all of 2019 and 2020 (probably even a little in 2018). Never once have I had to call to get a VM deleted until today where I received a message saying I had to call them. This involved getting routed to &quot;the team that handles these&quot;, then giving my PIN (which is in the web console), waiting on hold, and typing &quot;I agree&quot; in a support ticket they opened. Total waste of time. They claimed additional security but I was able to to do all this from the web console after I called them. They also suggested that I just shut it down for a few days in case there were some weekly jobs running I might care about...<p>We&#x27;re down to only 4 VMs at this point and I have a feeling this is an attempt to hold onto some customers. Anyone else had this experience?')
