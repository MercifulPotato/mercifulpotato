But IoT devices are sold worldwide.<p>Ugh, the situation is even worst in countries with censorship laws. For example, in my country, all ISP are required to intercept all DNS requests and filter all requests to any blocked domains found in the government block list. At least they&#x27;re transparent about which sites are blocked though (the list is publicly available to query or download), but the fact that all DNS requests are intercepted causes various technical issues and some ISP are trying to profit from it by redirecting the blocked query to their own ads-laden landing pages. They even went as far as inspecting http host header as well as randomly injecting scripts on unencrypted http requests.')
