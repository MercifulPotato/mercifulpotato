I already moved on. First by still doing web and it stuff but for an non-profit. That meant cutting my revenues by 2. I deliberately chose a job in a smaller and cheaper city, so my way of life was not too much affected. As that non-profit could not afford me anymore because of Covid 19, I had time to reflect and recently decided to go further. I&#x27;m single without children (nor by choice, nor a problem, just my life as it went). It&#x27;s easier. But having a spouse keeping his&#x2F;her job with a regular revenue could also be quite helpful.<p>My new projet is to built a non-profit and seek funds to buy a large farm or a large piece of land. Preferably fields exploited for a long time through intensive exploitation (not bio, plenty of pesticides etc) e.g. some large place o heavily damaged nature. My goal is to repair the Nature within that property. Make it a natural paradise of biodiversity. The more diverse, the more resilient it becomes. Choose the right species so they&#x27;ll be fine in 20, 30, 50 years from now with climate change.<p>This project require a team. I imagine tiny houses spread around so we can all have a private life too. But many things in common. I&#x27;d like the place to be a sort of lab, a hack-space where experiment new way of life and working. One part of the economic model will be a camping and a training center. First paying course: how to yourself a ecological tiny-house, thermically passive so no need for heating or AC. People will learn by doing so the end, there will be a new tiny house available on the property.<p>I still like tech. It&#x27;ll just be low tech. Free software, Linux etc, so technology is an empowering tool, not a drug you are addicted to. A shop to repair and learn to repair computers, using only second-hand parts. This will be a paying course as well, for anybody interested. I imagine teenagers not that thrilled by their parents&#x27; camping idea but happy to learn and repair to build a pc.<p>This a long adventure. From bare fields to a forest totally bio with species that provide food, ten years. But it requires less and less work as it becomes a self-sustainable ecosystem. We&#x27;ll take a part for us humans, fruits, making and selling high-quality jam, honey. Some wood but most of it need to rote on the ground. we&#x27;ll also need to grow vegetables, poultry for meat and eggs, a few pigs leaving freely (well, until we catch one from time to time for meat).<p>I don&#x27;t want a closed community. Rather a small starting team, with many people staying a week or a month for intelligent vacation in a beautiful nature and learning DIY stuff for a sustainable world. Maybe the permanent community will extend with visitors willing to join. After some time, some will want to join another project or back to the city. That&#x27;s good. I think I&#x27;ll meet more people whom I may befriend by attracting them in this unusual place that I do living in the city. Maybe these new friends will come only a few weekends per year. Fine. That&#x27;s more cumulated time than what We achieve to spend with my friends in the city (overbusy, children, ...). And we&#x27;ll have parties around a fire, drinking homemade beer, trekking around or working on some free software. Or building a solar oven to dry fruits.<p>Nothing ideologically radical, like:\n- NOT 100% vegetarian or vegan. I like meat and think that our body needs it (my opinion) but we will eat less meat than many, because we eat too much of animal proteins for a good health. Less.carbo-hydrates and more vegetables. No autarcy, we&#x27;ll buy what we can&#x27;t grow, sell some to neighbors and locals. \n- NOT a closed community. A place where many people visit, are accepted by vote if they want to stay and free to move on. Or free to go and come back. \n- NOT a religious place. People are free to follow any religion and be respected, as long as it doesn&#x27;t impose rules onto others. My religion is atheism. \n- Diversity encouraged. All colors, all origins, all sexual orientations, genres. This must be 100% safe and comfortable for every body. No tasks assigned by genre.\n- NO TV. Movies and series on demand but reading of press and books encouraged.\n-')
