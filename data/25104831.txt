Nature just is and everything in it trys to adapt. Some prosper, some die out. Now with our technology we disrupted quite a bit, but why must we understand everything we do, when nature aparrently does not either?<p>With research like this, I am more worried, what things like this, does to us. To maybe get to the point, where new babys are created in a laboratory and the less successful experiments goes to the bin. All for Evolution.<p>Now I am grossed out by that thought. But from a philosophical point of view, I have to ask myself: &quot;who defines that this is bad?&quot;<p>Maybe this gets us to the stars, so life can spread, in case earth life gets vanished, by a big asteroid. So maybe it is ethical to do all we can, to get there? To preserve life itself?\n(humans are not at all adopted for space, radiation, zero g etc., so CRISPR?)<p>(well no, I don&#x27;t think it is ethical to do by all means, but I do think ethics are subjective and the next generations might have different ethics)')
