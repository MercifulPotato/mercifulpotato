He &quot;called for violence&quot; against people who attempted to physically disrupt his rallies, and I would go so far as to call the &quot;violence&quot; that ensued in all of those cases (forcible removal from the venue) justified.<p>Using this standard, I could accuse anyone against the Capitol &quot;protestors&quot; as &quot;calling for violence against their political opponents&quot;, except we both know that characterization omits a great deal of critical context. So it is here.<p>&gt;Which of course is why he refused to condemn it while it was happening,<p>He literally told the people assembled there to go home.')
