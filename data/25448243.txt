Item(by='Domenic_S', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608150980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446272, text='The standard is OSHA writing rules that govern workplace safety. What we have now is a bunch of soft &quot;when feasible&quot; and &quot;if possible&quot; <i>recommendations</i> and no rules save for what each state&#x2F;county give on their own, which are usually also pretty squishy.<p>Absent a written standard from the government body in charge of these things, it&#x27;s a free-for-all of liability. So I open my restaurant following local standards and a customer gets COVID and sues me because I used disinfectant X when I should have used Y, or the staff was wearing mask A instead of mask B, or whatever.<p>I don&#x27;t think its unreasonable whatsoever to - again, absent the proper rules - ask for protection in this case. Folks like to characterize this as &quot;protecting big corporations&quot; but if you read the proposal it protects school, universities, hospitals, and so forth as well.')
