Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=[25733422, 25733282, 25735194], score=None, time=1610388451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731703, text='Does the Mac version of Steam install through the Mac App store (or is it offered there), and does that store also have the webview restrictions?  If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s triggering them to use web login methods, and while I haven&#x27;t logged into steam on the desktop again since I installed it on this new one ~6 months ago, I have to log into the website and get a code almost every time I want to do something there, so I wonder if the Mac version of Steam is somehow under the web based login restrictions.')
