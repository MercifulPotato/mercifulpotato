Work-life balance is king.<p>This is the most important lesson I learned working at the fruit company. That and never have a long commute.<p>I now work at a place that&#x27;s ten minutes door-to-door in the morning and fifteen in the afternoon. I took a pay cut to achieve that (I live in East Bay), but maybe the new wfh culture post-COVID will open up more possibilities.<p>Anyway, point being that I&#x27;ve decided that my job is second to my happiness.')
