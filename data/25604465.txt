It sucked. I had no recourse.<p>But at the end of the day, I had well more than 2000 hours in the game. Which meant that my cost per hour of entertainment was less than $1. Which is really cheap as far as hobbies and entertainment goes.<p>Does it suck that I can&#x27;t go in any play an ARPG with any of the 50+ Marvel heroes I had and adore? Yes. But that&#x27;s what you should expect when playing any game that operates as a service or has an always-online component.')
