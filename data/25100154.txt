Support tickets have gone down to almost 0 (I still get the odd email from time to time, to which I promptly quote a price and never get an answer), and most who contribute actually give back value.<p>As Alex says in this blog post though &quot;it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer&quot;. Luckily this only happened twice for me, but it&#x27;s funny because in here you can see it on the open[2] as someone opening a PR adding this text to the README:<p>&gt;  If you spot a bug or any other issue you may go to hell because this software is officially Bug Free(TM).<p>On a very perverse way I am kind of happy that happened, since it ratified my decision and I became a lot more strict about when I help people. Any sense of &quot;guilt&quot; I had remaining after closing the Issues for not providing free support totally left after that incident.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;203" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;203</a>')
