However, what is possible, is having the government rethink social support, making sure that each member of society has a safety\nnet, and doesnt need to worry about getting his basic needs met (food, water, shelter etc). Basic income seems to be the best fit here.<p>This won&#x27;t completely solve the problem, because food, shelter will not heal the attachment problems of some people (people also need companionship), but it will provide a stable base, that is a radical improvement on today&#x27;s\nstatus quo.')
