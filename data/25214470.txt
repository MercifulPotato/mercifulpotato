I bought one for my wife. If you are lazy or not inclined you can actually pay after the fact to remove ads.<p>Alternatively you can deliberately break the ad functionality, install google apps, and android lets you change your home screen.<p>1 and 2 worked but they broke the ability to set your own home so the fix is a hacky app to hijack the home button to show the right home of your choosing. This worked for over a year then they repeatedly blacklisted such apps, then it worked but with a 2 second delay which is basically horrible and extensions started crashing the gmail app.<p>Worst piece of shit ever.')
