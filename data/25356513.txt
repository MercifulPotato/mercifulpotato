Worst sites are those that break visual contracts (cls in the article), and half of “fast” sites do that. You can see it when page is already loaded for few seconds, you scroll&#x2F;interact with it and then suddenly it behaves as if it was reloaded or jumps to another position right under your finger. You misclick on a link, go back, repeat. It does that not because a top banner loads, but on its own programming quirk. That’s annoying af and should be downranked to the bottom just like any snail-paced site.')
