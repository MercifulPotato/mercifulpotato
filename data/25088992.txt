Even without the decompiler, I found IDA&#x27;s structure support quite useful for managing disassembly, and Ghidra&#x27;s structure editing tool and assembly renaming were pretty poor when I tried playing with it, which is why I ultimately ended up resorting to editing objdump disassemblies to decompile the code, relying on Ghidra for the vtable analysis.<p>However, I use these tools strictly on a hobbyist basis, and I&#x27;m not sure that IDA Pro&#x27;s price tag is really worth it. I think I might have a copy of IDA Free kicking about before they really gimped it, but what I really want is a working IDA on Linux.')
