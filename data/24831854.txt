People who forgo freedom essentially are subjecting themselves to someone else&#x27;s idea of prosperity, and those who want to keep their freedoms are the ones that don&#x27;t believe anyone else&#x27;s exploration to find prosperity can necessarily be better than theirs.<p>&gt; The internet doesn&#x27;t (yet) actually interfere with freedom in this sense<p>But it does. Tremendous human potential is already being wasted in the name of showing ads to eyeballs; from PhDs who run the big data experiments, to the general public that waste their energy on outrage and unintegrable squabbles. Our collective intelligence suffers for this, we are less able to make sense of things as natural as pandemics despite the increased connectivity, and hopelessly stuck in argument for more complicated things. It tremendously and collectively blocks out a lot of prosperity, it just does in a way that doesn&#x27;t show up on quarterly earnings.')
