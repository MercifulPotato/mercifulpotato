With few exceptions, workers collaborating forms the basis of their power vs management. Management has money and the ability to wait out vs an individual that needs a job. Only groups of employees can successfully negotiate for major concessions outside of rare circumstances. An older tradition that would be even better is unionization on an industrial&#x2F;sectoral scale so you don&#x27;t even need to unionize your current workplace and workers across the industry can enforce demands.<p>Your politicians do nothing, your bosses do nothing. What do you have to lose? Fight for what you need together.')
