I actually didn&#x27;t go to a different FAANG a couple years ago, partly because I anticipated a dilemma: the company had been in the news for some alleged unfairness, and I decided that I could easily imagine being there, and trapped between wanting to speak up on behalf of a fellow employee facing a similar unfairness in the future, and suspecting that I would be terminated if I did.  Had I already been there (rather than merely anticipating the situation with a hypothetical) I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;d speak up.  (Personally, given past battle scars, I&#x27;d probably make quiet and delicate internal inquiries, trying to find a sympathetic person in a position to look into and correct or mitigate what seemed to be unfair, while being clear that I&#x27;m still a team player.)<p>So, I do think speaking up in a big-corporate environment, in the public manner these people have done, would tend to come with some personal risk in most companies.  When people do it (perhaps) despite a perception of personal risk to themselves in doing so, we should pause and consider what they are saying.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t blame people for not anticipating this situation to which they&#x27;re objecting (based on the information available I&#x27;ve seen at this point).  If the concern had instead been &quot;I&#x27;m shocked -- shocked! -- to find the amassing of intimate personal information of Internet users going on here!&quot;, then I&#x27;d wonder how they couldn&#x27;t have realized that before going to that company, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the concern.<p>I&#x27;m not taking a position on the concern itself, since the information I have so far is incomplete and complicated -- only suggesting that, when people are saying something at some personal risk, those people and what they&#x27;re saying shouldn&#x27;t be dismissed offhand.')
