So in that sense, you are correct to not see a reason to move to the cloud, but your advice does not apply to everyone.<p>And I don&#x27;t believe they make &quot;more money&quot; that way at all. AWS margins are either very low or very high, and the higher margins and prices tend to be the &quot;simpler&quot; ones: packaged, managed products such as Redshift that are billed on fewer tiers and flatter prices.<p>When you design your application with AWS, pricing has to enter your design considerations. For example if you are designing something that will interact a lot with S3 you want to minimize PUTs. You want to minimize ram usage on lambda by streaming rather than buffering. Etc.<p>AWS is not a suitable product for playground stuff. The only reason it gets used as such is because it&#x27;s easier if you&#x27;re already using AWS for other things (or it&#x27;s you&#x27;re already very familiar with it).')
