Meaning that whether the corporate tax is high, low, or nonexistent, it&#x27;s better to make money than not make money.<p>Given this, if a firm cannot see any good opportunities to pursue, incentivizing mass investment in zero or negative return projects, while coincidentally incentivizing lower government revenue is unlikely be a net good for society. That seems to me to be a encouraging massive destruction of wealth and also encourage enormous mis-allocation of capital.')
