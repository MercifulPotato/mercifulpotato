You might as well just start and end with this:<p>New standards have issues, people don&#x27;t know how to use them correctly, and compilers are slow to catch up. Wait 5 years to use a standard so all these things are worked out, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the details that don&#x27;t stick.')
