(Trump did get a lovely letter in a giant envelope and swooned about it, remember?)<p>How do you only worry about what you read about Biden and his record on wars, where you even bloody admit that you&#x27;re not really concerned about &quot;his family benefiting from it&quot;, and IGNORE everything else that should worry you? Like a denial of the reality of the actual virus killing Americans (1 website says at the moment more than 243000 dead, that&#x27;s like having a 9&#x2F;11 number of deaths, followed by a 9&#x2F;12, a 9&#x2F;13, with two towers and 4 planes crashing every day all the way past Thanksgiving, with the latest being 2 more planes smashing into 2 more WTC-sized towers on a 12&#x2F;1&#x2F;2001...).<p>Let me try to answer why I think that is: you like Trump, for whatever reason (maybe you&#x27;re racist, maybe you&#x27;re brainwashed by Fox to think Biden is the devil), and you looked for a justification for liking him, and you found one when you read about him &quot;profiteering from war&quot;. Good enough for you, everything else is irrelevant.')
