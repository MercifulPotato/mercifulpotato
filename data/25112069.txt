You can&#x27;t avoid having to calculate them numerically; from there you may also create approximations to construct them but you might as well just use a ruler at that point.<p>You can compute logarithms by hand but they&#x27;re notoriously tedious even by 19th century standards (and they had a great deal more tolerance for that sort of thing than we do today, for obvious reasons), which is why you could buy books full of them, and that&#x27;s generally what people used.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constructible_number#Algebraic_definitions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constructible_number#Algebraic...</a>')
