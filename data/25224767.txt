It seems that for example trying to cluster trajectories over time through real coordinates has a bit of prior work (there’s a bit of an unintuitive and costly metric called the Frechet distance that can be used) but is not the solved problem I would have expected for this type of fundamental problem (that would seem to come up a lot for human movement applications). Like answering the question of “what are the most commonly used paths to get to work” without resorting to discretizing steps into nodes on a graph seems tricky as far as I can tell.')
