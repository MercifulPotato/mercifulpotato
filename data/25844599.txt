Item(by='blackrock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611137335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836701, text='Taiwan nor TSMC cannot produce the key tool to make this all work: The photolithography device itself.<p>Only ASML currently has that technology.<p>And it turns out, the photolithography device isn’t really a plug and play device. It’s very fussy. It breaks often. And it requires an army of engineers (as cheap as possible), to man the devices, and to produce the required yield, in order to make the whole operation profitable.<p>This is the Achilles’ Heel of the whole operation.<p>I suspect that China is researching and producing their own photolithography devices, independent of American, or western technology. And when they crack it, then they will recapture the entire Chinese market for themselves. And TSMC will become irrelevant to any strategic or tactical plans for them.')
