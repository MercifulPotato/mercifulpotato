Having a strong social network has lots of advantages including providing better romantic and career opportunities, as well as improving physical and psychological health.<p>Humans have a long history of dishing out lots of money to be parts of strong communities too--country clubs and fraternities have high fees. Church goers regularly give up 10% of their (gross) income to be part of that group. Cult members might even hand over ALL of their possessions to join.<p>The camaraderie and experiences that go along with being part of a strong, long lived community tends to be the thing people value most in life. Yet finding those communities has become increasingly difficult in the modern era. People move away to different cities, or just don&#x27;t run into the same set of people everyday. With the rise of remote work, social disconnection is only going to rise. I think there&#x27;s a lot of room to create new social organizations with pretty minimal technology, and make a pretty profit from doing so. Humans are still human--they want those connections--they mostly just need an introduction.')
