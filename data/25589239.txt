Myself, two decades ago, I was happier. I&#x27;m still happy now, but I was much more exuberant, in general, back then. The zest and passion of youth sort of stuff. I&#x27;d rather live through COVID now that I&#x27;m older, instead of back then.<p>If I were still in my 20s I&#x27;d be very upset over these conditions and how that will compound over the rest of my life. The compounding really, really matters for young people. They&#x27;re being diminished. It&#x27;s an extraordinary trolley problem as another poster stated.<p>My view: we&#x27;re choosing to diminish youth to preserve the elderly. Maybe ok. Maybe not. Probably not; they&#x27;re the future. I don&#x27;t know what the balance should beâ€”which way to swing the trolley switch. My judgement is that public debate is shallow, binary, and without nuance. The weakest and poorest suffer as a result.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any right or wrong answer here. But lots of people are getting hurt in different ways and in different durations.')
