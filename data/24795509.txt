Little commercial or financial gain, lots of bad press.<p>The situation is a little bit comparable to Hercules, the IBM mainframe emulator (although not quite the same – Hercules is of course a hardware emulator, ReactOS is an operating system clone). You can use Hercules to run z&#x2F;OS, but not legally, IBM only licenses z&#x2F;OS to run on IBM&#x27;s own hardware, or authorised proprietary emulators that cost $$$$. Thankfully though, IBM doesn&#x27;t appear interested in suing hobbyists – IBM treats the hobbyist community as if they don&#x27;t exist. But, try building a business on Hercules, as the company TurboHercules SAS did, and IBM&#x27;s lawyers will start sending nasty letters to you.')
