These are all just my opinions.<p>&gt; Analysis, Topology, and proof-based Linear Algebra are certainly not needed for them<p>Although this is explained in the prose of the document, I should have highlighted it myself: only the nodes in blue are required. The orange nodes (Analysis, Topology, Functional Analysis, etc.) are extra. They aren&#x27;t required for ESL.<p>Honestly, as long as you get up to the level of the Casella &amp; Berger text, you&#x27;ll probably be fine. And a lot of C&amp;B can be skipped (like the focus on ANOVA or experiment design). But I also like that roadmap because after C&amp;B, there&#x27;s additional emphasis on Linear models which is helpful for ESL.<p>&gt; For the rest, I&#x27;m of the, perhaps naive, school of thought that one ought to jump in the deep end, and consult a variety of sources as need be.<p>And I suppose this is where you and I differ. I find it discouraging to need to stop partway though a text and go learn a whole new subject area before continuing. Instead, I find that building up the foundation and then working through a text to be a more enjoyable experience because it&#x27;s just building on what I know.<p>But to each their own!')
