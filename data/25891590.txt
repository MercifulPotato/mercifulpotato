Well, extremism is a relative term, depending on environment. In certain cryptocurrency circles I&#x27;m sure your stance is normal, in society at large it&#x27;s rather extreme  though, as is equating &quot;kill everyone who doesn&#x27;t agree with me&quot; with government action in any way.<p>The problem with this line of argument from my point of view is you oppose and obstruct highly needed government action on principle, without providing an alternative solution.
