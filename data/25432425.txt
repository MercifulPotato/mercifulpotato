There are many hoops to jump through.<p>Also, most widely sold Unifi equipment is expensive, cheaper devices are very rare to find in limited markets.<p>I would not consider this available if I have to order it from another country and pay customs + wait weeks for delivery.<p>And again, the equipment has to be whitelisted by the OLT and most ISPs don&#x27;t want to that. And cloning the S&#x2F;N is difficult&#x2F;impossible.<p>I think we have two different kinds of ISPs in mind.
