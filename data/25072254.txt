The emotions stirred by work, in general, have been a struggle for me. Emotional work is one of the most productive ways I&#x27;ve found to mitigate and reduce the effects of diminished motivation (especially from depression and its cousins).<p>I&#x27;ve talked about it some in the past, re: MKP and other men&#x27;s support groups along those lines (or just a solid group of friends). Much of it is just recognizing the emotion(s) and putting myself into a place where I can express&#x2F;vent it properly.<p>Along those lines actually, has anyone else noticed a boost&#x2F;burst of energy&#x2F;productivity&#x2F;etc after the elections last week? I think thats a malaise that hasnt really been talked about much (yet).')
