Are these the same people who reject addressing war crimes with truth and reconciliation, and instead advocate &quot;deny everything, make counteraccusations&quot;?<p>A proper apology—one that (1) acknowledges the specific harm caused, (2) acknowledges responsibility and remorse for specific choices, (3) explains how they hope to make amends specifically to the aggrieved party—seems to me to be self-evidently the only possible way to heal a community.<p>Doubtless many people have delivered &quot;apologies&quot; that omitted one of those elements, or even all 3 elements (&quot;I apologize if anyone felt offended&quot;), and thereby made things worse for themselves. But to me it is self-evidently corrosive to a community and to a person&#x27;s ego to adopt a practice of refusing to acknowledge mistakes.<p>For an example of the good that can come from a proper apology for a serious harm, consider Dan Harmon&#x27;s apology to Megan Ganz: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;11&#x2F;16879702&#x2F;dan-harmon-apology-megan-ganz-community" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;2018&#x2F;1&#x2F;11&#x2F;16879702&#x2F;dan-harmon-ap...</a>')
