Granted, the sheer volume of data is a barrier to making the index but removing that, only 4 US companies have crawled the entire internet. I&#x27;m going to have to disagree with you on that one. To write a crawler capable of the scale and timeliness to crawl the entire web in a week or two requires some pretty solid engineering. I don&#x27;t however disagree that building a good search is also difficult.')
