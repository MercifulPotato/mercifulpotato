So you explicitly or implicitly have to accuse someone of a serious crime&#x2F;offence they did not commit. Most people have a greater sense of honour than that. Those that don&#x27;t would still have to fear getting caught.<p>If someone actually does forge a message using the old private keys provided by Google then you would have to fight the assumption that you were using the system as it was designed. Everyone would just assume you said it and are now using the possibility of forgery to lie about having said it.<p>You can always claim a forgery anyway should you decide to do that. Perhaps someone got access to Google&#x27;s relatively poorly guarded DKIM private key. How would you know? You are probably not making a specific claim anyway.')
