If this is pursued in civil court, they&#x27;ll be up against an army of lawyers and any judgement would be minimal (I doubt youtube-dl maintainers can claim millions in damages). You&#x27;ll set a precedent, although its usefulness in future cases is questionable due to the reasons listed. The only hope is for this to be pursued in criminal court, resulting in heavy fines and&#x2F;or the lawyers being disbarred. However, I doubt this will happen given how cozy the RIAA is with the establishment.')
