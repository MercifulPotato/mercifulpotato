The app has to go out of its way to support OIDC, but it&#x27;s so common that it might be good enough for normal people.  And you can turn Dex or another OIDC provider into an authenticating reverse proxy with: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.envoyproxy.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;envoy&#x2F;latest&#x2F;api-v3&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;filters&#x2F;http&#x2F;oauth2&#x2F;v3alpha&#x2F;oauth.proto.html?highlight=oauth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.envoyproxy.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;envoy&#x2F;latest&#x2F;api-v3&#x2F;extension...</a><p>(I started writing jsso2 before this existed, and didn&#x27;t want to tie myself to Envoy necessarily... but if I were starting from 0 today, I&#x27;d probably just use Dex and that Envoy extension.  Seems simple, and has a lot of corporate support behind it for maintenance &#x2F; security.)')
