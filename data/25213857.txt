There&#x27;s nothing more natural than animals eating each other.<p>And no, humans are not herbivores. Some primates might be, but human evolution started the moment our monkey ancestors decided to get off the tree and eat meat. By promoting veganism you&#x27;re trying to undo the last 3-5 millions of years of human evolution. Talk about Catholic Church pushing us back to Middle ages... &#x2F;s<p>Another argument that I hate: by not eating animals you reduce suffering. If we take that to it&#x27;s logical conclusion, the only way for you to not cause any sufferning is to die. That&#x27;s why Buddhists (for whom &quot;reducing suffering&quot; is a religious imperative) came up with this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sokushinbutsu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sokushinbutsu</a><p>Life is an infininte circle of joy, pleasure, sadness, suffering, death... If you try to eliminate one of them you are against the life itself.')
