Acrobat might be more of a problem, but it&#x27;s still not quite the mainstream MacBook Air use case.<p>The question isn&#x27;t so much &quot;Do these apps work?&quot; but &quot;When will they work?&quot; MS and Adobe will be distributing Apple Silicon builds within the year - most likely within six months, and possibly by early next year.<p>So these are showstopper problems if you need these applications <i>on a Mac right now</i>, but not so much if you&#x27;re planning to wait and see a while.<p>Honestly, Catalina and Big Sur broke far more applications than the M1 move did. If you&#x27;re doing the prudent thing and running a year or so behind it&#x27;s very likely there will be fewer problems.<p>So ultimately there aren&#x27;t many reasons beyond novelty and a percentage of natural replacement why most people who lean heavily on Office and Acrobat are going to need a Macbook Air <i>right now</i>.')
