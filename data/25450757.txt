I plan to monetize the app on subscription basis because I see there&#x27;s an added value in this app. But the question will be is it ethical to do so? How should I approach this?<p>For me, It&#x27;s like a marketplace problem where you need to find seller and buyer. Sellers don&#x27;t want to place their products in your website if no visitor, and buyer will not even visit that much when there&#x27;s no seller to look on.<p>The same like this, I don&#x27;t have content to show to future buyers, buyers don&#x27;t want to use this app. But, using other content providers seems not so ethical.<p>If you have any advice on how we should approach this, would love to hear it.<p>*Edit: I don&#x27;t scrape website.  I&#x27;ll use API&#x2F;RSS provided, in hope will reduce the risk of the ethical matters.')
