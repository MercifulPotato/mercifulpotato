This is a more powerful approach!<p>There was an example of this that stuck with me in the (fantasy) book <i>Another Fine Myth</i>, in which the narrator must perform magic for a king, but lacks the ability to do magic. He has a single gimmick device and needs to pass it off as more than it is.<p>So he asks the king to choose one of two horses, and, when the king picks the real horse, says &quot;by your word shall that creature be spared&quot;. Then the narration remarks that if the king had picked the other (fake) horse, the trick would have been performed on &quot;the creature he [the king] had doomed with a word&quot;.<p>The lesson is, if you&#x27;re offered a choice, you need to know what it is you&#x27;re choosing before you make the choice. Participating in a process without knowing what the process consists of is another way to say &quot;being scammed&quot;.')
