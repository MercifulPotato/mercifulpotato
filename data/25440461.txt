If PornHub doesn’t like it, they can simply start their own credit card processing company.<p>I applaud Visa and MasterCard for shutting down the extremist content hosted by Pornhub (including rape, child rape, degradation of women, incest, and more). They are perpetuating and profiting from human trafficking and sex slavery. If that’s not hate speech, I don’t know what is, and it should be shut down, permanently.')
