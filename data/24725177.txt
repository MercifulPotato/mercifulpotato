They&#x27;d probably take out a massive loan, and the worst case is having to ditch the lidar gear and sell the fleet on the second hand market. But it&#x27;s doable.<p>But where did you get a million cars from? To equal Tesla&#x27;s existing fleet?<p>Uber has 3 million active drivers globally. If you assume that they&#x27;re working in 8 hour shifts, 1 million Waymo cars is a rollout sized to replace Uber.<p>Coming at the math from another direction, Uber does 1.6 billion rides a quarter. A million cars would mean 18 rides per car per day. Totally doable.<p>But Waymo would surely focus on countries with high wages - US, Canada, UK, Australia, most of Western Europe. Replacing Uber in only those countries would only need perhaps 500,000 cars.<p>Of course they&#x27;re going to ramp up towards those numbers, but once the tech works and it&#x27;s just a matter of cash, it&#x27;s going to happen very quickly.')
