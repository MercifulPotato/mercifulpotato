It&#x27;s like saying &quot;all drugs are good and have never had issues.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m concerned about a vaccine developed and tested in less than a year. There are safety concerns. There are people under 40 who may not consider the risk high enough to take. (Look at what happened in the the 1970s with the Swing Flu vaccine that wasn&#x27;t very effective, and although safely administered to millions, left 3,000 ~ 4,000 is long term neurological issues).<p>I&#x27;m glad this vaccine is coming out and I think people in high risk groups should evaluate if they want to take the vaccine after weighing the risks. I do not want to see forced vaccinations for people who are concerned about safety.')
