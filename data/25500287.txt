I use it for all kinds of stuff, all the time. I spent around $250 CAD on it 8 years ago, and considering how convenient and high quality its results are it has been great value. If it broke I’d do a bit of research to see how he market has changed, but I suspect I’d end up buying another zojirushi. Maybe even the same model.')
