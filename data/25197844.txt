For example, furniture will off-gas that stuff for months and years after manufacture.<p>Another common source of pollutants is regular household &quot;cleaning&quot; products -- look up &quot;indoor air pollution&quot;.<p>This stuff is rarely acknowledged in mainstream information sources, and it is certainly not easy to get away from. It requires a conscious effort, basically becoming your own EPA and FDA, and being much more strict than them.<p>I think it is worth considering for anyone suffering from migraines to try eliminating all this stuff from their life and seeing if it helps before trying to suppress the signal with drugs.<p>An easy way to try is to camp out in a clean outdoors area, bringing only clean food with you, while also avoiding new camping products, and any &quot;sprays&quot;.')
