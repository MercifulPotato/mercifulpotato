It works, for sure, but I always felt a bit iffy when doing a massive update after a while, and I felt like I was being dragged along with their choices instead of making my own.<p>I bought a beefy computer last year and installed Gentoo on it - it&#x27;s obviously not for everyone, but its reputation as a hard to install distro is overstated, and if you have enough horsepower and ram, an emerge update isn&#x27;t a big deal. Additionally, having the ability to tailor your builds to not include libraries you don&#x27;t need AND to install the sources and debug information is huge. Mostly, though, it feels logically designed, and standard sysadmin tools allow you to do maintenance without much hassle.<p>I&#x27;d recommend at least looking into it to see if it fits your use case.')
