My parents&#x27; home computer is about 12 years old. They have a Windows XP machine, which is too basic to install Windows 10, so even upgrading Chrome and Firefox is not an option. (They cannot use Linux, let us not go there.) Many websites don&#x27;t load because the desktop supports only legacy SSL, which the server (rightly, if it is serious about SSL), does not support. However, I feel that the point that the author makes about many websites not needing SSL is to the point. The author seems to suggest the right approach, since it leaves the choice to the user.')
