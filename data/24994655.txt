If you want to do it right, let out all people who are in jail for possession too. I can&#x27;t think of any legislative measure that would get more popular support. I&#x27;m not a user myself, but I have tried it (after voting for legalization in my state), and it&#x27;s ridiculous that it was illegal in the first place.')
