Something on the order of 24 hours. I don’t know what the real units are though (core-hours? machine-hours? simple wall clock?)<p>I am not surprised that they “make the film fit the box”, because managing compute expenditures is such a big deal!<p>(Edit: When I say &quot;simple wall clock&quot;, I&#x27;m talking about the elapsed time from start to finish for rendering one frame, disregarding how many other frames might be rendering at the same time. Throughput != 1&#x2F;latency, and all that.)')
