This is what I believe to be the case:<p>• Chrome is roughly planning to ship this in M88 (Q1 2021).<p>• There are no signals from Firefox or Safari, positive or negative.<p>• There were concerns earlier on from various spec and browser developers, but those seem to have generally been sorted out. But <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;standards-positions&#x2F;issues&#x2F;335" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;standards-positions&#x2F;issues&#x2F;335</a> is still open and awaiting a response.<p>• As far as putting things into the WHATWG DOM and HTML specs is concerned, at least two implementers must be interested, so it won’t be being landed there just yet.<p>I invite corrections if I’ve missed anything or erred.')
