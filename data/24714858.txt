Item(by='salawat', descendants=None, kids=[24717096], score=None, time=1602122181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714352, text='&gt;I have a bit of trouble with the concept &quot;the threshhold of too much&quot;, too, as it applies to this case. Google copied or paraphrased essentially _all_ of the text of interfaces they used from Java libraries<p>Oracle is trying to argue that just because you intentionally left a bunch of implementation detail out because it isn&#x27;t relevant toward transforming something like the Java API&#x27;s to a new context, it should still count as copyright infringement because they Still yoinked everything they did take... Which seems circular to me.<p>Google&#x27;s point is &quot;no shit, Sherlock, it wouldn&#x27;t be Java otherwise.&quot; Oracle is couching this issue from the perspective that Google should have invented a completely New language and runtime, absorbing the same costs of them doing so. Google argues, on the other hand, that what they made, in order to confer to the syntactic structure of the programming language known as Java, dictates the duplication of the organization of the fundamental functions, packages, and namespaces, and that furthermore, Oracle has no standing to call them on it, because those APIs are a necessary prerequite to drive the operation of the JVM, and are by definition the only way to do it, so that API constitutes a method of operation.')
