Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=[24892090], score=None, time=1603669390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24890790, text='&gt; This is very unusual among western peoples<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve noticed.<p>The primary nuance with China is the contradiction created in their constitution. Their need - and historical rationale from various civil wars and stalemates - to &quot;uphold territorial unity&quot; is an element that undermines all the other articles in their constitution.<p>The consolidation of control and single party exacerbates that, but there is primarily an inability of the courts to rule against this aspect of the constitution in support of other aspects of the constitution that would support free speech and other freedoms of association.<p>Outside of China, we have a caricature of what people there care about, and it is simply not accurate. Outside of China, we act like everyone is a victim, imagining they are all oppressed in their ability to speak about or learn more about a military massacre. But that&#x27;s simply not the case. The government keeps everything &quot;rated PG&quot;, it spends most of its paternal energy doing that, and its pretty successful at doing that, the outcome is pretty benign and people support that. This is the expectation people have from their government, this is the social contract there. Many corporate walled gardens are the same, and service providers work inside of those walled gardens, this doesn&#x27;t make the service provider unethical. I think it is disingenuous to be automatically offended just because a public sector entity acts this way.')
