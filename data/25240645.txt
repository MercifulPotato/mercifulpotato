I understand it; I understand the perceived need for it, but I submit that it paradoxically does the exact opposite of what it intends to accomplish (&quot;social equality&quot;) because it directly diminishes the value of whoever ultimately &quot;loses&quot; the exchange, oftentimes whoever perceives a greater debt to the other person, which is generally the person of lesser social rank.<p>&quot;Taarof represents the kind essence of Iranian people. In our culture, it can be impolite to express ourselves in very a direct and objective way,‚Äù but it in fact demonstrates a kind of disrespect for both the other person&#x27;s time and validity, and I&#x27;d argue that by enforcing systemic dishonesty, it&#x27;s one of the main culprits of another far darker aspect of Persian culture:<p>Backbiting. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iranian.com&#x2F;1998&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;people-of-extremes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iranian.com&#x2F;1998&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;people-of-extremes&#x2F;</a><p>---<p>Do not emulate this.
