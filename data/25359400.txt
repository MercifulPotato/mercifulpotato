You really want to optimize for ease of entry and memory, rather than using the largest character set or having the longest password. For a point of reference, these three choices have (roughly) equivalent security (128 bits of entropy):<p>1. 27 characters - all lowercase, randomly selected<p>2. 20 characters - upper&#x2F;lower case + 15 special characters found on the first page of the iOS keyboard, randomly selected<p>3. 45 characters - 10 words from eff&#x27;s short diceware wordlist, randomly selected<p>the first option would be the easiest to enter, despite being 7 characters longer than the second one, because you don&#x27;t have to constantly switch between the various character types (since you&#x27;re using a touch keyboard). The third one is 66% longer than the first one, but probably is easier to remember.<p>As for how many bits of entropy to use, AFAIK a preimage attack against md5 (128 bits) hasn&#x27;t been pulled off yet, so it&#x27;s probably safe for for the foreseeable future. You can probably go lower than that and still be safe, considering that a md5 preimage attack is significantly easier than cracking a phone pin (eg. no memory&#x2F;cpu hard KDF, no trustzone&#x2F;secure enclave).')
