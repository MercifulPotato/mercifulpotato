Any mainstream Linux distro released in the past 10+ (maybe 20) years would have better font rendering by default - but if you wish, you can disable those defaults by changing a few symlinks in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;fonts and revert to 1980s style pixelated rendering. Which is ok, some people prefer the retro look.')
