I previously did my undergraduate degree here as well.<p>1. Are there any restrictions to doing so while still a full-time student? E.g. would I be able to form an LLC while still a student?<p>2. Is there a way to use the STEM extension if you are self-employed? I&#x27;ve seen contradictory information on this.<p>3. If the answer to 2. is No, what would be the best visa to try to transition to after the first 12 months of OPT? O-1, E-1, or H1-B? Or something else entirely?')
