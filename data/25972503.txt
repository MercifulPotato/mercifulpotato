I agree, that&#x27;s a choice they made.<p>The comment upthread argues that Robinhood &quot;chose&quot; to retrict trading in meme stocks. That argument appears to be false. Robinhood did not have a choice whether or not to restrict trading; it simply didn&#x27;t have the money to cover the clearing for those trades.')
