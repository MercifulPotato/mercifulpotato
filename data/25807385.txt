At each level, a public&#x2F;private keypair is used to authenticate valid records for the name. Eg: .com has public&#x2F;private keypair(s) to represent who can sign x.com records. .com owner only needs to publish these. Reliable sources ( ISPs etc ) can then share these.<p>2. The x.com records themselves would be: Mapping from x.com to IP address(s) &#x2F; public key.<p>3. The x.com owners could then publish out their x.y.com records freely and they could be mirrored by everyone.<p>Unlike the current methodology, there would be far less need to trust where you get the records from. The public&#x2F;private keypairs should change WAY less frequently.<p>Agreeably in such a widely distributed system you wouldn&#x27;t have nice TTL, but that is for the better. DNS records should not be changing that frequently.<p>Such a new system also should be done in a fully distributed way and NOT controlled by a bunch of money grubbing bastards who make way too much money from records.<p>It should NOT cost $20&#x2F;yr to own a record pointing x.y to a number. It&#x27;s absurd and really needs to stop.')
