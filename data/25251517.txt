Elementary questions like whether a vector has a start and end point, has it got an orientation along its own axis, is it possible to determine if two given vectors are in the same frame of reference, etc are simply not obvious from most treatments of vector algebra I have seen.<p>I do see a pressing need for a full treatment of the topic without notational or conceptual ambiguities. Atleast mathematics owes it to the other sciences that much, is what I feel.')
