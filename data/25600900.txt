He did so in an aggressive manner, often trash talking everyone.<p>This is when Nintendo decided to create a game around Jumpman, with its name changed to Mario, after Mario Segale.  Because Segale is Italian, they also made Mario Italian, and it&#x27;s possible that the entire game started as some bizarre parody of Italians made by people that have no idea about Italy, and then was toned down and made more abstract.<p>And by the way, &quot;Goomba&quot; is a racial slur for Italians.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goombah" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goombah</a><p>&quot;Koopa&quot; sounds similar to &quot;Cumpa&quot; which means the same as &quot;Goombah&quot;. Basically they made all the enemy names sound like &quot;Goombah&quot; and this is no coincidence.')
