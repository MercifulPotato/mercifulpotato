If there is one near you, they might be doing remote meeting during COVID. There used to be an international babywearing organization but it disbanded a few years ago. YouTube us also a great babywearing resource.<p>There a many different styles of carriers so it is worth reading about and, if you can, trying out some different styles. Ring slings and stretchy wraps are great for newborns and are pretty easy to use. Woven wraps like I prefer are great for all ages and very comfortable but there is definitely a learning curve so keep that in mind and donâ€™t get discouraged if it takes a while to get a good fit. There are buckle style carriers that can fit at any age. My personal favorite is the Kinderpack by Kindercarry.')
