Since 1982 (arguably the beginning of the modern inflation-targeting era), the USD has lost no more than 6.3% of its value year-over-year, nor gained more than 2% (CPI measured, source <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;CPIAUCSL#0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;CPIAUCSL#0</a>).<p>In contrast since 2016, Bitcoin has 60% of its value year-over-year (2018) and gained 1700% (also 2018).<p>A store of value is <i>not</i> a story of appreciation and hoping for a gain, it&#x27;s a story about holding a stable and most importantly predictable value into the future.  The USD more than satisfies this condition.  Bitcoin does not, no matter its speculative merits.<p>Most importantly, society does not owe people a fictional store of value guaranteed to never lose purchasing power.  People don&#x27;t eat quarters, nor do they live under dollar bills.  It strains credulity that a nominal token (however minted) should hold a guaranteed value, without taking capital-like risks required of any productive investment.')
