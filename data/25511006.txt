Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608669844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509137, text='&quot;The internet is primarily funded by the collection, analysis, and trade of data-the data economy.&quot;<p>s&#x2F;internet&#x2F;www&#x2F;<p>The internet is a medium.  Interconnected ASNs.  Cables, switches, routers, etc.  It&#x27;s hardware.<p>Whereas the above statement -- the likes of which sounds very much like it is proposed &quot;dogma&quot; coming from Shoshana Zuboff -- presumes that a medium is synonymous with whatever it is used for, e.g., a www filled with &quot;content&quot; created as bait in order to lure consumers whereupon &quot;content providers&quot; can then surveil, collect data, process and commercialise it.<p>If the internet, the medium over which our bits travel, is funded by collection, analysis and trade of data, then why are we paying ISPs?<p>Unlike the author, I see a big difference between the medium itself and whatever I might connect to using this medium.  I pay for the ability to use the internetwork to connect.  Not all the cruft someone else may decide to provide to the public as a lure in order to collect data.<p>Pet peeve: When a piece of hardware starts connecting to other computers the moment I plug it in.  It presupposes the hardware vendor knows the computers to which I will want to connect using the medium.  However I am paying for access to the medium, not the hardware vendor and not the other parties I might connect to using it.  It should not be their choice, it should be mine.<p>In the not-so-distant past we paid telcos to rent equipment such as telephones.  These telephones did not automatically start dialing numbers as soon as we connected them to the network.  We paid for access to the telco network so we could call our friends, family, etc.  The network was not funded by companies running &quot;services&quot; that we could call.<p>This is like saying that personal computers are funded by the crapware that comes pre-installed on them.  That may be partially true, but it is grossly misleading.  As if abolishing pre-installed crapware would mean personal computers would be too expensive for anyone to own.')
