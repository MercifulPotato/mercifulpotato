I suspect you might have liked the way the speaker changed the sound, but you could have gotten the same effect (with greater control) with the headphones and digital preprocessing.<p>The headphones will give a more faithful reproduction of the original recording.<p>Making a nearly-perfect class D amp isn&#x27;t hard (which is not to say a lot of people haven&#x27;t messed it up; there are a lot of pretty bad amps out there).<p>The hard part is the speaker itself. The mechanicals of moving a lot of air accurately are hard. You need a physically large woofer which moves over a long distance. If you do that, your woofer and tweater won&#x27;t be in the same place, so your phase response will be wonky. You don&#x27;t want the air cavity acting as a spring overpowering your driver, so you need a large box. Etc. By the end of it, it&#x27;s super-complex. Headphones are super-easy in comparison.')
