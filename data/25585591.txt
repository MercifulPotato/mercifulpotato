Many US States provide a State ID for $20~$50. Even if you don&#x27;t drive, it&#x27;s very difficult to survive without at least a State ID (just to buy alcohol or for anything that needs legal identification ... like a job or I-9 form).<p>The arguments against requiring voter ID are silly now. Yes, at one time reading tests were required to vote in the Jim Crow era, and they were intentional to prevent blacks from voting. But we&#x27;ve come a long way since then. Asking someone to set aside one day and $30 to get an ID, in order to vote, should NOT be considered an unnecessary hardship. It&#x27;s a bare minimum effort if you want to vote.<p>Some will say, &quot;Well there are all these poor disenfranchised people who can&#x27;t afford a day off work or the $30 to get an ID!&quot; ... You&#x27;ve gotta be kidding me. Unless they&#x27;re working under the table, how do they even have a job without ID? We cannot keep lowering the bar.<p>My best friend, a friend from Ecuador, talked about how some of the worst leaders in South and Central America worked on lowering voting ages down to 16 and 17, because they knew it was way more easier to influence younger people. It&#x27;s straight up corruption.<p>State issued ID should be required to vote, period. This entire election cycle is a mess because of massive, unsolicited ballots with no chain of custody mailed out to dead people and people who have left their states. It&#x27;s insane that all of Big Tech and US media is claiming there is no proof at all of fraud, when countless people are testifying in every state under oath. Just today in Georgia, people brought videos showing trucks shredding ballots. When they called the police, and even went to the Sherif, they were told law enforcement was specifically ordered not to send anyone to any voting precincts.<p>There is not excuse to not require Voter ID except to allow more fraud.')
