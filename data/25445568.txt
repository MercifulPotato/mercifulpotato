There really aren&#x27;t much &quot;ethical&quot; for-profit endeavors in capitalism. I can criticize near anything with valid criticism. The fact that he casually chose a mass-polluter, anti-union, low wage, government subsidized mega business as &quot;normal&quot; says a lot of the normalization of oppression, or at least extreme apathy for workers, under capitalism. Not to mention its not good for customers either as the level of quality you get from the cheaply sourced Walmart-like inventories isn&#x27;t good and if it is good, its also good at a certain level of planned obsolesce.<p>I think from an ethical perspective being a marketer who helps keep a business afloat by convincing people to sign onto low-cost monthly subscriptions for a service and keeps white collar professions with good jobs employed is vastly more ethical than a low-wage, anti-worker, no benefits, etc retail monster like Walmart.')
