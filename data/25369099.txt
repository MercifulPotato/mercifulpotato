Its nots the <i>cheapest</i>, its more middle of the road (though, I think in absolute terms there are places around Chicago that outpace the cost of the highest cost parts of Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro last time I looked, granted that was a few years ago).<p>Its culturally though, very liberal (from my own experience, tends to also be very much a democrat state). One thing I will say is Minnesota&#x27;s public school system is great, and the collegiate system is both affordable and high quality, on average.<p>It&#x27;s still cheaper than California, New York, Seattle, Portland etc. paying 2000 a month for a place to live in Minnesota is still very much not the norm, even in nice parts of the Twin Cities.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to live up North a bit, Duluth is amazing, its mostly a college town now, and you can surf in the summers!<p>The downside is always the snow, though if you live in the Twin Cities there are upscale parts of downtown that have miles of indoor walkable paths that take you all over the city.<p>I really love the state. I&#x27;ve contemplated moving back several times. I just don&#x27;t think my tech industry connections would carry over as well, so it would limit some of my job opportunities, even with this big push to work from home by a lot of companies. That will have to shake out for me personally first before I would consider moving back.<p>Though, they&#x27;ve done a decent job netting progressive employers and have in large part been able to avoid the economic collapse that hit much of the Midwest (the rust belt, in places like Ohio). I know a lot of people out there employed in highly trained manufacturing jobs (highly skilled CNC work, maintain automated manufacturing facilities etc.) and those jobs are the only ones in that sector that aren&#x27;t leaving the USA in droves yet, plus there are a lot of medical technology companies there. Also, a lot of enterprise software companies have HQ or large presence in the cities as well.<p>It&#x27;s not a startup scene like SF, but its changing. When I was a kid the state had these huge policy pushes to try and get people entering college to focus on technical degrees (be it 2-year technical school at a community college doing CNC machining and the like or 4-year degrees in engineering&#x2F;cs). It&#x27;s also one of the most educated populations in the country [0][1]<p>Now I just feel like I&#x27;m selling it. Though I want to mention one quirk about the population that stands up to everyone I know who has visited. Minnesota Nice [2] is alive and well still. People tend to just be more friendly there than anywhere else I&#x27;ve lived or travelled, and I&#x27;ve been through more than a dozen states from coast to coast. It&#x27;s just a general demeanor thing. Thats not to say that <i>everyone</i> is nice <i>all the time</i> though, of course. I&#x27;d say on average you&#x27;re less likely to have small confrontations though, than anywhere else I&#x27;ve been.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kare11.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;outreach&#x2F;back-to-school&#x2F;minnesota-among-top-states-for-public-education&#x2F;89-62549d9e-aebd-4280-8754-9e9e8a875f4b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kare11.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;outreach&#x2F;back-to-s...</a><p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ohe.state.mn.us&#x2F;fc&#x2F;2108&#x2F;pg.cfm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ohe.state.mn.us&#x2F;fc&#x2F;2108&#x2F;pg.cfm</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Minnesota_nice#:~:text=Minnesota%20nice%20is%20a%20cultural,%2Dmannered%20and%20passive%2Daggressive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Minnesota_nice#:~:text=Minneso...</a>.')
