What I am suggesting is that the laymen will demand blood, and the easiest and most vocal way to do it is government, or agents of the government (in this case large internet content controlling organizations) will restrict speech.  That is already fraught with political vengeance and revenge.<p>Find the culprits. Prosecute &amp; punish. Force large internet content companies to scrub.<p>We can demand to force sites to pop up about cookies. Certainly we can demand that with a single quick request &quot;to be forgotten&quot;.<p>(Mark my words - if this gets legs, it will be the speech control, and the control will be handed to companies or quasi-government agencies, made of companies.)')
