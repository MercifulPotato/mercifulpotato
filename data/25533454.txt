Can you name some benefits (perhaps let&#x27;s say 3) that you expect will be negotiated more favourably for the UK within a year that the UK was unable to get as part of the EU.<p>Also ... being part of a a trade bloc always has benefits and positives, but the two key negatives touted as &#x27;deal-breakers&#x27; in the Brexit negotiations have been related to (1) sovereignty and (2) concessions.
