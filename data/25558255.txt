It covers topics like hacking (black hat, white hat), activism, hacktivism, cyber security and so forth, with a narrative approach that&#x27;s very pleasant to listen to. This episode in particular talks about what PSYOP (Psychological Operations) is (basically how to use techniques to manipulate people to reach an outcome both in a war scenario and not) by talking to experts in the field and telling their stories. The episodes are all very good and high quality in my opinion, in fact I&#x27;m still working my way through the whole backlog, but I don&#x27;t have much left already. I picked this one because it left me particularly uncomfortable at the end, while at the same time having taught me something.<p>Each episode also lists its sources (of the information, ndr) on the episode page of their website, which I find amazing.<p>Bonus episode: The Athens Shadow Games - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darknetdiaries.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;64&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darknetdiaries.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;64&#x2F;</a>')
