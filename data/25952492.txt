That sounds legitimate, but that&#x27;s the real reason why OpenBSD has never taken off outside of its small niche of geeks - despite being an amazingly designed OS under the hood.<p>And I know many of those geeks who are quite proud of being part of a tiny niche that scuffs at Bluetooth, USB 3.0, QHD displays or anything that a &quot;normal user&quot; might want - had it been for them a 640x480 screen with a working session of xterm would have largely sufficed. But that&#x27;s also the reason why there aren&#x27;t many &quot;normal people&quot; using their OS.<p>At some point one should also ponder why we support and contribute to open-source projects (especially considering that we mostly do it in our spare time, that, in the case of developers, is often limited and precious). Is it because we want to make the (IT) world a better place with more free and cool products and attract more people, or is it because we like our own well-curated niche and we don&#x27;t want to let anybody in?')
