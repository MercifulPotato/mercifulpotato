Some of them were reporting this doing WFH prior to Covid.<p>The most amazing social life outside work won&#x27;t compensate for that daily gap which occupies about half of their waking hours.<p>Some people need more regular personal interactions throughout the day than that.<p>On top of that, some people&#x27;s work creativity or mental stimulation thrives on social interactions with colleagues in the same or related work domain.  A social life with friends and family does not substitute for &quot;work-oriented social interactions&quot; with people who are grinding on the same kinds of problems, for example drinking buddies with whom you can discuss code.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter if these people are long term friends, as it&#x27;s a different kind of stimulation.')
