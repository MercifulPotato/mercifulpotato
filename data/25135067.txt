I can listen via Apple Podcasts but not via Spotify, which as usual declares that it’s “not available in your country”.<p>By the way, an Apple device is not required—Apple podcasts work on Windows, and on Linux you can paste an Apple podcast link into a podcast client like GNOME Podcasts.<p>If I don’t have any app, at least I can read what podcast is that and find it elsewhere, while the error page seen after following a Spotify link takes care to not disclose a single bit of information about the podcast that could let one find it elsewhere online, and even podcast URL offers no glimpse due to being mostly a hash. Each time I am given a Spotify link without further context I basically can only respond with “sorry can’t access that, give me at least a name so I can find it elsewhere online”.<p>Of course, a canonical link to podcast page, if such exists, is best.')
