Attack vectors will presumably always exist. I look upon any argument against openness - be it software licensing, protocol federation, data export, binary blob usage, or anything else - with _extreme_ skepticism.<p>&gt; ... I generally have to trust every single host that any of my contacts has decided to sign up with ...<p>In general, you should only have to trust a particular host with communications going to the specific contact that uses it.<p>&gt; Am I the exception here? Does everyone here only have friends who are IT security experts ...<p>No, I think you&#x27;re just looking at the problem the wrong way.<p>With a centralized model, you generally have to unconditionally trust the central authority.<p>A federated system offers much more flexibility. Metadata is likely to be spread piecemeal across multiple hosts and network paths, making it much more difficult for an adversary to analyze in the general case. Instead of a blanket trust decision, you make a per-contact decision based on the nature of the interaction you intend to have with them. If you feel the need, you can even self host and insist that a particular contact register with _your_ server to communicate with you.<p>If you absolutely can&#x27;t trust someone to make good decisions with security critical information, it&#x27;s unlikely Signal can do much to change the threat they pose to you in a real world scenario anyway. At the end of the day you&#x27;re ultimately choosing how much trust to place in the person you&#x27;re communicating with regardless of which system you use to do so.<p>&gt; ... there will eventually appear &quot;supernodes&quot; which have a disproportionally high number of edges&#x2F;connections to other nodes ...<p>That&#x27;s certainly an interesting dynamic but it&#x27;s hardly an argument against federation. Centralization is literally the worst case in that model (ie a single node and nothing else). In a federated network you have a choice of whether to make use of such supernodes. If it really matters, I can (for example) refuse to communicate with a particular contact regarding some sensitive topic via (say) gmail. A centralized system doesn&#x27;t provide that option at all.')
