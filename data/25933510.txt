The powers that be (dark money) have long sought to remain in control of their subjects. Just because we don&#x27;t have monarchies doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t have a few elite who few themselves as rightful directors and owners other all things on Earth.<p>They have manipulated markets through various institutions and making knowledge so hard to come by without going into massive debt in order to maintain their elevated status.<p>In their arrogance though, they thought they could reverse the trend of the democratization of their power to the masses, and have literally tried to move heaven and earth in order to remain in power and reverse the trend.<p>My curious position is I think they are realizing that the trend is irreversible, that power eventually will always diffuse to the masses eventually as no system is perfect, there will always be leaky abstractions, and I have no doubt they have a nuclear option in their back pockets to try and quell the massive shift of power that seems inevitable at this point. Question is, what is that nuclear option?')
