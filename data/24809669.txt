However, working hard is a necessary condition but it&#x27;s not a sufficient condition.  For every Jim Carey there are countless failed comedians who worked just as hard.  I&#x27;m not saying he doesn&#x27;t deserve it, but we labor under the delusion that the free market always rewards hard work and if you don&#x27;t reach your goals it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t work hard enough.  Of course you can&#x27;t reach hard goals without working hard, but working hard doesn&#x27;t always get you there.  You can do everything right and still not catch a break.')
