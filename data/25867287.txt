At the time I felt silly admitting that, but I have since read a lot of antique philosophy and the majority if it is the same - a bunch of babbling with a few sprinklings of ingenious ideas. If you want to comprehend the immense ideas from great historical philosophers you are much better off reading primers or summaries with the high-points than reading the entire original texts.')
