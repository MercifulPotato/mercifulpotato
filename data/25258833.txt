The M1&#x27;s GeekBench scores are impressively high, and general-computing workloads like compiling code are very fast as well, indicating that the M1 is fast in general, not just for specific tasks.<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of hype about things like &quot;specialized hardware for NSObjects,&quot; but AFAIK that&#x27;s more of a flawed&#x2F;outdated design on Intel&#x27; side than a specialization on Apple&#x27;s: the &quot;magic&quot; is really just ARM&#x27;s weaker &amp; more modern memory consistency model, which makes things like reference counting substantially faster.')
