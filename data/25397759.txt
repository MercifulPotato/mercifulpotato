Servers won&#x27;t go IPv6-only until most users have IPv6. This it&#x27;s on providers to take the initiative to deploy IPv6. Some have. Some have not.<p>For example, approximately nobody has IPv6 in Spain. It&#x27;s one of the countries furthest behind in dual-stack adoption. This is entirely the fault of Spanish ISPs.<p>ISPs won&#x27;t be forced to deploy dual stack IPv6 until IPv6 only servers are commonplace, and IPv6 only servers won&#x27;t exist until that wouldn&#x27;t lose them a significant fraction of users. And thus progress is glacial.')
