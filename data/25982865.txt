Before then, Robinhood just sends records: John bought 2 GME for $600, Mary sold 1 GME for $290. If that&#x27;s all that happened that day, then Robinhood would need to provide $310 dollars to the clearing firm, and receive 1 stock.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s a credit risk - what if Robinhood doesn&#x27;t have the money on settlement?
