This is a bit strange to me as I&#x27;ve always thought about things—mind you, not necessarily things of great importance but about things in general. It&#x27;s dead easy for me to daydream time away (unfortunately). <i>(When I was at school one of the punishments was to be sent to stand in a corner and stare at the wall.  It used to send some kids almost crazy but never bothered me much—all I had to do was to go into daydream mode to pass time away!)</i><p>Since reading this article it&#x27;s occurred to me that those people who&#x27;ve really struggled with the isolation of COVID-19 lockdowns and who continually seek the company of other people are perhaps those who suffer this &#x27;inability to sit quietly in a room alone&#x27;.  I mention this because during earlier posts on the topic of large numbers of people who were not coping with the enforced isolation, I said that for me, if anything, the enforced lockdown was a blessing as I wasn&#x27;t continually having to deal with people I&#x27;d rather not deal with.  Similarly, I find noise and activity distracting, even annoying at times.<p>No doubt when COVID-19 is over and the postmortems begin in earnest, this connection will be researched.<p>Another afterthought, perhaps those best suited to interplanetary traveling will be those who do have a good  ability to quietly contemplate things (after all, it&#x27;s likely they&#x27;ll be forced to do lots of it).')
