Lots of USB ports (and display ports), large built-in monitor but I use a docking station for a larger one, usually bring a mouse and the keyboard is full-sized (includes numpad) and the dock also has a keyboard, has a spot for an optical drive (I just refreshed, so my new one doesn&#x27;t have one installed, but that&#x27;s an easy buy as there&#x27;s still a slot), it has 2 hard drives (and you can get multi-terabyte hard drives, now).<p>Upgrading stuff and costs are both really significant for personal use (which is why I am typing this from my home desktop), but if money is no object, I just get a desktop-replacement laptop.<p>I hate the whole &quot;let&#x27;s just make laptops like tablets&quot; thing, where &quot;like tablets&quot; means &quot;no ports.&quot;<p>I need ports for all kinds of stuff, including driving robotics and interfacing equipment. Which is also why having a laptop is nicer than a desktop. It&#x27;s really great to have a built-in UPS and be able to move my office easily.<p>EDIT: Just checked, and it&#x27;s easy to upgrade RAM or replace the battery, and I have room for a 2.5&quot; hard drive and actually 2 NVMe SSDs (they make 8TB ones) plus an optional SIM card and a PIV card and SD card and the built-in camera and microphone array <i>are</i> really nice to have nowadays. But I do love desktops. You wouldn&#x27;t think 10 USB ports is that important, but nowadays everything uses USB, so it&#x27;s nice to have for pure convenience.')
