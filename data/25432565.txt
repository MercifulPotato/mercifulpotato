But maybe the main use case for trap is implementing try&#x2F;finally logic and you really want it to fire whenever the shell exits, not matter how (to clean up resources like temporary files). Bash&#x27;s `trap EXIT` mostly does what you want (&quot;run this when the shell exits&quot;), but writing something that behaves this way across shells (and doesn&#x27;t fire multiple times etc). is amazingly painful.')
