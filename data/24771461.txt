Generally only a copyright owner can sue an infringer. A license operates as a defense against a claim of infringement. If a licensee fails to meet a condition, then the license is invalid.<p>So, in the case of the project owner who (1) starts out owning all of the rights to the project, (2) incorporates code licensed from a contributor and, (3) distributes the combination, the only person who could possibly sue the project owner for copyright infringement is the contributor. The claim would only pertain to the contributor&#x27;s code, because that is the only part he owns the copyright to. The project owner&#x2F;defendant would raise the license as a defense and the key question would shift to whether the owner&#x2F;defendant violated any of the conditions of the license.<p>Where the license is the GPL, one of the conditions is partially affected by the &quot;preferred form&quot; definition of source code. The court would look at what the owner&#x2F;defendant did and whether he met that condition. Importantly, the condition and &quot;preferred form&quot; definition would only be considered in relation to the plaintiff&#x27;s code; the owner&#x2F;defendant&#x27;s code wouldn&#x27;t be relevant.<p>Regarding the contributor&#x27;s code being &quot;inseparable&quot;, that will not be the case for one very simple reason: If the contributor sues the project owner, then he must identify which portion of the code he is suing about. If he can&#x27;t do that or can&#x27;t show ownership of it, then he will lose.')
