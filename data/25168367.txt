I haven&#x27;t touched any ARM board ever since. We specifically used OrangePi zero. The armbian at the time had thermal management problems to the point the boards would straight up fry to a brick. I remember there was an update that fixed the thermal problem but it would corrupt the SD card once in about five reboots. And it really didn&#x27;t solve the thermal problems. They&#x27;d get hot enough to be unresponsive. So the clever decision by management was to add a fully self designed avr based board to periodically poll the device on one of the GPIO pins and somehow reboot the OrangePi if it didn&#x27;t respond. So reboots were common and SD cards only lasted 1 month tops.')
