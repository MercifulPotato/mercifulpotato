The worst-case scenario is the customer is unable to get another flight (for whatever reason) and &#x27;has to&#x27; board the 737Max that one time. The customer can then choose not to book with that airline again. I&#x27;m already not a fan of AA, and with this news I can happily avoid this situation by simply not flying AA.<p>Will I always feel this way? We&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;m fine with letting other people be volunteer guinea pigs before I commit to something.')
