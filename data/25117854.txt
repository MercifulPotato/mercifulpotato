First the foremost, get G&#x27;s Take Out option ASAP.  At least you&#x27;ll have backups.  I do that actually in two ways:<p>1. Take out<p>2. IMAP to local email client.  Take Out format not always great and you don&#x27;t get attachments.   So doing the IMAP can litteraly be your identicial backup.  I simple created a trucrypt encrypted 30GB container with portable thunderbird on it.  The I fire it up once in a while to replicate&#x2F;sync.<p>I&#x27;m also doing what others have suggested both:<p>1. I&#x27;ve captured as soon as services became available my name on all of the significant email services and I do keep them alive.<p>2. got my own domain but I realized having it on GCE cloud isn&#x27;t the best idea.  I may retain the domain but will need to the replicate my server onto diff cloud.  Guess will need to think that through.<p>yeah I feel your paranoia.<p>Side note: I&#x27;m also wondering with their AI&#x2F;ML. If I could get a psych profile based on my emails, searches etc...  that would be an interesting read.  I mean they have my searches and emails which they&#x27;ve scanned and profiled since their inception!')
