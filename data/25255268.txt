Just injecting spike protein doesn&#x27;t work, because it isn&#x27;t recognized as a threat. The AstraZeneca one uses an attenuated virus that the body is going to respond to anyway.<p>I believe the mRNA vaccines work by getting cells to express the spike protein themselves. You can&#x27;t smuggle the protein into cells just by injecting it, but mRNA will get in there and do its thing.')
