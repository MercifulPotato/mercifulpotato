Once I got one (I was maybe 8 or 9) I was more or less independent, as were all of my childhood friends.<p>This is in stark contrast to people I befriended in college, who were (1) largely reliant on their parents for socialization and exploration until they were old enough to drive, and (2) incapable of handling the general mishegass that happens in urban environments without me as their tour guide. This doesn&#x27;t make them bad people or dependent in some profoundly handicapping way; it just goes to show that a frontiersman&#x27;s notion of &quot;independence&quot; is perhaps not the most interesting one in 2020.')
