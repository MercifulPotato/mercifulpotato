The day Tesla updates something that causes someone to get hurt Tesla will be sued into the ground as all software updated cars that haven&#x27;t had their update tested are illegal. It is also illegal to change a car to make more HP (there&#x27;s a limit, AFAICR it is at 5%) without getting it recertified. While Tesla don&#x27;t give a f... about legality some (like me) have been through the process of recertification on way less changes than Tesla does. It is both time-consuming and expensive and the testing was insane. It baffels the mind that none of Tesla&#x27;s competitors has cried foul yet.')
