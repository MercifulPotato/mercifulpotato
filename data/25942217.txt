The US government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone &quot;interstate&quot; commerce (described in the Constitution as &quot;Commerce... among the several states&quot;).
