They only leaked DNC material (via their cutout Wikileaks so people can claim in bad faith it wasn&#x27;t really Russia), and did so at the time it was most needed by the Trump campaign. If you consider receiving state-hacked materials and leaking them in perfect coordination with a political campaign (see Roger Stone indictment) journalism, then there&#x27;s nothing else to discuss. Oh, and it wasn&#x27;t just any political campaign. It was the campaign actively supported by the state actor that gave you the materials to begin with. All common coincidences in the journalism world I guess, right?<p>&gt; So based on something he did in 2016<p>Speculation no one can answer, ignored.<p>&gt; The need for intelligence agencies to keep their information secret is not more important than the accused&#x27;s right to a fair trial.<p>You aren&#x27;t listening to what i&#x27;m saying. If you suspect someone of espionage and they are already sitting in prison of sex crime charges, you have no reason to expose the methods and sources you used to catch said person.<p>And responding to any claim made exposes you publicly to confirm what you know and how you know it, which further damages your intelligence collection efforts. Which is why &quot;show me the evidence&quot; is not in good faith, especially not someone like Snoweden that knows damn well how intelligence works. He knows he won&#x27;t get push back publicly, so he has complete ownership of the narrative. &quot;None of my leaks results in anyone dying&quot;. The American IC is not going to list their assets that were executed in hostile countries as a result, for the reasons I mentioned.<p>&gt;  accused&#x27;s right to a fair trial<p>Funny, both Assange and Snowden fled their respective &quot;fair trails&quot; to hide from justice. Neither had any intention of risking jail for &quot;what they believe in&quot; - yet some people still view them alongside whistleblowers that actually did.')
