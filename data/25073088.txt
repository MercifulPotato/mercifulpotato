My only point is to argue that living in an apartment is not really so bad for an animal. If you&#x27;re avoiding an animal for your own sanity while living in an apartment, that&#x27;s fine, I do not fault you for it. If you&#x27;re avoiding an animal for the animals sake, then I think the animal would prefer an apartment to a cage.')
