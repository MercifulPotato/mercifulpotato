All of his behavior in the relevant Github issues looks like someone who is having a tantrum and wanting to take his ball and go home.<p>So, while I pretty much totally agree with everything you&#x27;ve written, especially the part about &quot;I must really commend the noncombative, factual tone taken by the issue opener&quot; it&#x27;s also hard for me to fault others who are letting their annoyance show when simple, factual requests are met with tirades of assholery.')
