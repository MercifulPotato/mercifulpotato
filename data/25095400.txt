The North Hollywood shootout is an extreme example, but it illustrates the point; if bank robbers in a car are shooting at everybody they see, the cops shooting back at them is the only reasonable response.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean cops should be making a habit of having high speed shootouts on freeway;  nobody wants that.  It means the rules need to allow reasonable leeway for people to do what they think is appropriate in the unique situations they encounter.  Blanket bans enacted by people reasoning about generalized scenarios are not a good idea.  Those sort of absolute rules are too simplistic to be good for anything other than pandering to crowds.')
