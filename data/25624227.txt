I&#x27;m older now and the dream is lost a bit, but in the beginning it really drove me towards some good and kowledgeable people. I worked in Film (and Animation), but once I saw the working conditions (low pay, long hours, difficult to find work) I moved to SWE.. I still rarely do some work on the side for VFX&#x2F;Animation.. and I think that is the way I keep it so I don&#x27;t loose the &quot;fun&quot; in all of it.')
