Item(by='themodelplumber', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611600853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906881, text='&gt; Route of administration makes a really big difference in how addictive and dangerous a drug is<p>This is interesting, I had no idea. What a fascinating article.<p>I have wondered if there are also some specific personality differences involved in addiction, like the dichotomy of reinforcing preferred mindsets vs. reinforcing under-utilized mindsets.<p>To give an example, let&#x27;s say Person 1 likes a given stimulant because they are essentially an all-out person, and stimulation is the law for them. The stimulant therefore reinforces their theme. But addiction is more likely because they are taking it for reinforcement reasons and literally don&#x27;t know what to do about being less-than-stimulated. We can say that fear of the unknown is a factor that keeps them clinging to the drug.<p>Person 2 takes the stimulant because they are a bit of a low-mood type, and it brings things up to normal-human standards for them. They have learned to appreciate some of those new high points, now that they&#x27;ve seen how low things can get. Addiction is less likely because they are not really &quot;into&quot; stimulation in general, and can operate fine without it (well--much of the time), but they have also learned that they can use a bit of a mood upgrade. This person has a new knowledge of the now-known, which is more about learning and growth and less about fear.')
