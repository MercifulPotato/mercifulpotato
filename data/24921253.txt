We need to stop pumping more carbon into the air faster than we need to stop taking it out, simply because <i>it takes more energy to get carbon out of the air than the energy that carbon was used for in the first place</i>.<p>To use a financial analogy:\nWe have a high-interest credit card. That debt has compounding interest rates, <i>and the interest rate is accelerating because of positive feedback loops.</i><p>A &quot;carbon removal&quot; strategy is basically like putting X dollars on our accelerating-rate credit card in order to invest X in a fund with a lower interest rate than the card itself. Obviously this will result in spiraling debt.<p>The ONLY solution is to take carbon spending to ~0 and <i>only then</i> focus on removing it from the air.')
