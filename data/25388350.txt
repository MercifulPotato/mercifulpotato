It&#x27;s like when you press F5 and you get a compiler error because you accidentally used `.` when you should&#x27;ve used `-&gt;` to access a member function.<p>Does this tell a lot about your abilities as a programmer? Do you hide this incident from your boss so that he doesn&#x27;t realize you&#x27;re a fraud? Should you tell your customers about this? It&#x27;ll be much worse if they hear about it from someone else.<p>The difference between `.` and `-&gt;` is basic engineering! You&#x27;re trying to ship a product, but you can&#x27;t even get out of the compiler in one piece!')
