The blocks on the left (in the timeline) represent the individual time records. These are indeed &quot;glued together&quot; when a new record starts right after another stops. You can only drag a record in the timeline when it&#x27;s first selected, so it should be impossible to affect multiple at once. You can also move and zoom the timeline though, perhaps this is what was happening?')
