Say I want to share a single file with a developer - maybe it&#x27;s a config file, or a simple script, or a secret token. I would run:<p><pre><code>  hyperbeam hey-jane-here-you-go &lt; mygoodfile.txt\n</code></pre>\nAnd Jane would run, on her end:<p><pre><code>  hyperbeam hey-jane-here-you-go &gt; fwips-good-file.txt\n</code></pre>\nNote that the existence of npx makes this even simpler! You can tell your friend over discord &quot;Hey, type in: &#x27;npx hyperbeam hey-jane-here-you-go&#x27; and you&#x27;ll get what I&#x27;m sending you. :)&quot;<p>Note that &quot;hey-jane-here-you-go&quot; is effectively a one-time passphrase that I&#x27;m using, and will only be sent to computers listening for that exact passphrase at the time you send it. If you&#x27;re sending military secrets, you might need to use very long and complicated passphrases. But if you&#x27;re sending a cat picture, you could probably use &quot;for-jane&quot; without risk of collision.')
