Sure, it might kill a lot of people, but think how many others could be saved! It&#x27;s reckless to require demonstrated safety and efficacy of drugs!<p>What&#x27;s missing, using this analogy, is that it is only a net loss to slow down the vaccine that actually works, which we don&#x27;t know a priori. But if you fast track something that kills a bunch of people, then it might have been a waste. You might not learn enough for it to be worth the cost.<p>What if we push out Tesla&#x27;s cars and all we learn is that vision based neural networks with the particular models tesla&#x27;s using today aren&#x27;t good enough? How many lives would you sacrifice to learn that when a big investment in a more careful testing strategy might say the same thing?<p>To say nothing of the criticisms of the utilitarian perspective. If we believed in it as a society, we&#x27;d round up the poor&#x2F;unskilled&#x2F;uneducated for mandatory medical experimentation, but thankfully that idea is horrifying.')
