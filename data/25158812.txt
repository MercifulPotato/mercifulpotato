Currently I cross compile Mac (and Windows) build on a linux machine and from time to time test those builds in a VM (not sure about the legality).<p>I don&#x27;t think this will be possible with ARM build - cross compilation probably won&#x27;t be supported for ARM, I can&#x27;t run ARM VM on my x86 dev machine, there&#x27;s the new requirement for mandatory notarization (possible only on mac) ... maybe more but that&#x27;s enough anyway.')
