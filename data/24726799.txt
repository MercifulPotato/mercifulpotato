I won&#x27;t leave my country (Japan) so circumstance is something differ.<p>Without smartphone or PC browser that has useful translation and dictionary feature, I wouldn&#x27;t start reading English texts initially.<p>Some Netflix content only has sub (no dub). It helps listening English. I can even show multiple subs for learning purpose. Even dubbed, Netflix supports to show sub and some foreign dramas are useful to learn cultures. Amazon Prime Video is worse for sub&#x2F;dub perspective.<p>I found that English YouTube content is very well made, interesting, and English spoken by YouTuber is relatively easier to hear and understand, compared to like CNN. And YouTube&#x27;s auto sub feature works very well for English. It&#x27;s really useful so I wish I can use it for other sites.')
