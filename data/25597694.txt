When I started getting serious about lifting way back when, I used an app to manage my routines. At a certain point, I decided I was getting advanced enough that I could make use of some of their premium features, at which point I converted and have been a happy customer ever since. I have friends who feel the same way about (eg) Spotify, TODO apps, or any of a number of services for which the free version was essentially an unlimited-length, limited-feature trial version.<p>These seem to me like completely aboveboard, mutually beneficial implementations of freemium. To your mind, what makes this &quot;pure evil&quot;?')
