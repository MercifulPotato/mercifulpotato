Some unsolicited ideas: this sounds like the kind of thing you could take to blogs or newschannels to tell the kind of interesting story: &quot;imagine getting locked out and then getting conned! locksmiths can be shady sometimes, but people really need them, so we make it safe.&quot;<p>I imagine you could find places that would do an interview of you or let you write a short guest blog post to get links back to your domain and drive up your domain&#x27;s authority for the keywords, and also to directly drive traffic there. Locksmiths and landlords might also be good sources of traffic over time. Or a homeowner&#x27;s association!<p>It also might be interesting to experiment with a kind of &#x27;locksmith insurance&#x27; model, where you pay a small monthly fee for the peace of mind that a locksmith will be dispatched if you need it -- up to a limit of say 2&#x2F;year or something.  I can pretty honestly imagine paying for a service like that, at least during a normal year where I leave my house every day. Landlords or property management could also then &#x27;sign up&#x27; with you on tenants&#x27; behalf, as a service available to their apartment, making their own lives easier too.')
