That&#x27;s how it buffers and caches things.<p>Even if it doesn&#x27;t leave a copy on the HDD, a copy in RAM is still a copy.<p>But all of these things are happening inside of my own computer. YouTube already sent the bits and bytes to my computer and I am allowed to do whatever I want with those bits and bytes.<p>There&#x27;s nothing illegal about keeping a copy of something that was in memory and anybody arguing otherwise should be viewed as an enemy of humanity.')
