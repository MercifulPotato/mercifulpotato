So a better way of putting it may be the internal view of the service, where partitions are between nodes that are part of S3 itself (as opposed to between a client and S3) and they affect the overall health of the system. I’m not referring to a single node being partition resistant (hence why I said node level, and never mentioned single) which as you said wouldn’t make any sense.')
