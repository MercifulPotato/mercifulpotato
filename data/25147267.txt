No legal right is being infringed upon. It is not against the law for a private business to control its platforms, in fact its something that private businesses routinely do and have done long before apple came along.<p>Marketing and PR is also unremarkable and not peculiar to apple. iPhone customers are absolutely not being lied to in the relevant sense - there is no representation that an iPhone will allow you to run any software outside that approved by apple in the app store.<p>&quot;The customer should be able to do whatever they like&quot; is a nice sounding dogma, but has no legal basis and isn&#x27;t supported by standard practice for many products. Your example only demonstrates a power imbalance if we assume that the customer has already been forced to own an iphone for some reason. In reality the corporate and the consumer have the same power - the corporate to develop and offer a product on its terms, and the consumer to either accept that offer or to purchase a different product.<p>Developers demonstrably do benefit from apple&#x27;s strengths. Their revenues are overwhelming on the back of an ecosystem built and maintained by apple essentially from scratch. If developers didn&#x27;t benefit, they wouldn&#x27;t develop for ios, simple as that.<p>The point is, the developers are on the same boat as apple, so sinking it is a case of cutting off your nose to spite your face. And there already are &#x27;others&#x27; - it&#x27;s not apple&#x27;s fault that they&#x27;re shit.')
