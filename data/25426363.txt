Interstates have all kinds of potential hazards owing to their multi-purpose function. But especially on rural highways that aren&#x27;t limited access there&#x27;s a ton more, like driveways hidden behind signage, or some kid on a 4-wheeler flying out a drainage swale.<p>Just because you <i>think</i> you&#x27;re alone on a road doesn&#x27;t mean you actually are. I&#x27;m not clutching pearls. I grew up in a rural area with relatively long (but not Texas long) distances between points of interest, and where people often flew down rural county roads. There&#x27;re reasons car accidents are so frequent out in those parts. You get lulled into a sense of complacency until the tragic moment you realize your perception was wrong. Having grew up in said rural area, I&#x27;m probably less risk averse than most people. But I don&#x27;t feel the need to point out the crazy stuff I&#x27;ve done or seen growing up to establish my credibility; some stuff is just objectively dangerous to oneself and bystanders, and driving 100mph on American public roads is one of them. And, to be clear, pointing out the danger is not the same thing as admonishing people for doing it. Pretending it&#x27;s anything else but dangerous, though, just leads to people making even more dangerous decisions. The OP said the law was dumb; it&#x27;s not dumb because it <i>is</i> dangerous.
