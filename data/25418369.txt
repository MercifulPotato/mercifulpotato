I will also note that the SEK&#x2F;USD exchange rate is not quite the same as when it sort of got fixed in my mind. I think of it as about 10:1, but I guess it&#x27;s really more like 8.3:1, so instead of approx. $15K USD maybe it&#x27;s more like $18K.<p>Anyway, here are some numbers that I know or can give pretty accurate details for:<p>Rent under 4500 SEK&#x2F;mo<p>Phone data SEK 400 per 6 mo. -- pay as you go - 20 GB for 6 months and never have had to add more. Wifi at home, on the train, and both in the city center and at the University means I rarely use my own.<p>Phone calls SEK 100 has lasted me god knows how long for minutes. I don&#x27;t think I add minutes more frequently than every six months or so.<p>Car insurance is something like SEK 2500 or 3000 per year for a &lt;10 year old car.<p>Food ~1500 SEK per week -- we are vegetarian and rarely buy anything fancy; we also grow fruit and veg in the summer; this of course can be quite variable, with some weeks being SEK 1200 and others SEK 2000 or more.<p>Utilities: we have a geo heat pump; we don&#x27;t pay very much in utilities; we mostly charge our EV at the train station for free.<p>Clothes: H&amp;M primarily, Amazon.de occasionally (I guess we have Amazon.se now too) -- my wife and I don&#x27;t buy new clothes very often, though my children definitely need new stuff regularly. Still, we don&#x27;t spend very much on clothes, but I will freely admit that this is the one I don&#x27;t have as much sense of.<p>So, minus an exact number on utilities and clothes, it looks like a bit more than SEK 10,000 per month. Add some exact amount for utilities and clothing, and I think we are within a $15K-18K range.')
