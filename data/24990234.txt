Shipping glass is both dangerous and VERY energy intensive. Treated paper doesn&#x27;t hold pressure, and is easily damaged. There are a lot of other reasons why plastic is suitable for packaging that I won&#x27;t enumerate at length here, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that there are legitimate uses.<p>I will wholeheartedly agree that plastic packaging is over used. That said, fishing and marine waste are still the single largest source of ocean plastic.')
