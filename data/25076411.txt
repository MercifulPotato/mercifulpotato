But if your goal is to improve at distance running then you&#x27;re going to have to <i>run</i>.<p>Instead of grinding out a slow 11 minute mile try running at a 9 minute pace for a shorter distance. Then rest for a few minutes and repeat several times. Do that a few times per week and gradually increase the distance you run at the 9 minute per mile pace. Eventually you&#x27;ll get to a full mile at your target pace.<p>Also if you&#x27;re overweight you&#x27;re going to struggle with running and be at higher risk of injury. If that&#x27;s your situation then stick to lower impact sports until you drop the extra weight, then ramp up the running.')
