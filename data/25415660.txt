If you switch to a growth regimen that gives the plants a bit more time, you will generally get a better flavor, even under hydroponic settings.<p>Given that you can sense a lot of compounds that make up a fruit non-destructively, I&#x27;m pretty optimistic that you could optimize for flavor too in a robotic&#x2F;vertical farming setting.')
