And hopefully your large system is composed of many modules that work together in harmony, as opposed to being just a huge mass of code.<p>In any non-trivial codebase, having good interfaces &#x2F; contracts is key to keeping a good clean design.  You can make a nice clean large codebase without OO, but you can&#x27;t without good clear interfaces.  It&#x27;s important to know what you can change in one part of the code without having to go change the rest of the code to adapt to that change.<p>Python doesn&#x27;t have the equivalent of C# interfaces or Java interfaces, but having a clear definition of what&#x27;s expected is still helpful even in a dynamic language like Python.  These definitions are helpful to make the code clear, maintainable, and understandable.  At a bare minimum it&#x27;s helpful to do that with comments, but doing that with something like python&#x27;s ABC module is even better.')
