That when used for comparison, it doesn&#x27;t mean anything, unless it compares between the program running on the native OS and virtualized on the <i>same machine</i>.<p>So, saying<p>&quot;Near native performance&quot; i.e. not native&quot;<p>(a) doesn&#x27;t say anything as a general statement (of course it&#x27;s less than 100% of native, as its virtualized), and<p>(b) is moot as an argument against the M1 (since this &quot;non native&quot; performance could still could be e.g. 100% or even 120% of the native performance of another machine, which would make it more than enough).')
