Basically most people, even smart people don&#x27;t understand entropy correctly.<p>Entropy is not a law. It is a derivation. You can derive entropy mathematically from other axioms we assume are true in reality.<p>Let me state it plainly in a sentence that is not entirely correct but will help elucidate the meaning of entropy:<p>Systems tend toward disorder because there are more possible disordered configurations then there are ordered configurations.<p>This is entropy (sort of).<p>If your system is a bunch of 6 sided dice one ordered configuration is rolling a 1 on all the dice. Another ordered configuration is rolling a 5 on all the dice. A more likely but ordered configuration is rolling either a 1 or a 2.<p>There are numerous ordered configurations of a system but the number of unordered outcomes is by far greater then ordered outcomes. If you have a system of dice all facing up with 1s the system is in a low entropy ordered state. If you shake all the dice, it is more likely for the dice to come out in a random state all with random numbers. Shaking the dice is increasing entropy. Entropy increases. But you see here because you relate the dice to probability it&#x27;s easy to see how by probability the dice should trend toward more disordered states.<p>The same phenomena goes for particles in a box. Instead of the numbers on the side of the dice replace it with the position of each particle. Shaking the dice is exactly isomorphic to particles traveling in random directions. By probability, dice will roll random disordered numbers just like how by probability randomly moving particles will move into randomly disordered positions.<p>The same probabilistic intuition that you have for why throwing a bunch of bricks at the ground won&#x27;t be accident construct a house is exactly the intuition behind probability AND as a result entropy.<p>The real phenomena here is probability. Why does it apply to reality? We don&#x27;t know. But entropy is just a consequence of it. Entropy is simply saying (again sort of) systems tend toward more disordered states because disordered states are more numerous and therefore more probable.<p>The axiom or &quot;law&quot; as you call it is probability and entropy is a theorem or derivation that is a consequence of probability.<p>This is just a really simple explanation of entropy. Entropy is actually more general then this. It applies even to systems where &quot;ordered&quot; states outnumber &quot;unordered&quot; states. You can see my other explanations in this thread I get into it deeply.')
