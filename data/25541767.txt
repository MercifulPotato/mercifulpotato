Maybe that would even save them from the anti-trust push (one indexing and retrieval back end + multiple ranking, filtering and UI front ends).<p>But I&#x27;m wondering if this would not be better implemented at browser level. Can we have the white&#x2F;black list run locally in the browser, re-ranking results on web pages and hiding what we don&#x27;t want to see? Not just on Google, but also on the rest of the web, like ad blocking extensions.')
