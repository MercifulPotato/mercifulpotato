Blizzard killed it. Studios left the genre when SC2 came out because at the time it was launched, SC:BW was, literally, e-sports. Power user players sought legitimacy for their games, hoping it would rise up to occupy that position, in the form of punishing, unfun mechanics. The result was that for a 4 year period prior to the release of SC2, games patched themselves to death to cater to the complaints of competitive players, players who promptly dropped the games they tailored to themselves for SC2.<p>Following SC2&#x27;s announcement, RTS games almost stopped being developed entirely - no studio wanted to compete with blizzard&#x27;s release. Unfortunately, Blizzard created a game which had very little of the UMS lobby scene, and very little of the captivating visual spectacle of SC:BW.<p>Blizzard&#x27;s response to the decline of SC2 was made very clear very early; they didn&#x27;t see the point in investing further in the genre when Hearthstone and WoW both featured recurring revenue and SC:BW had it&#x27;s popularity owed to recurring fan based content at a set upfront price.')
