They don&#x27;t want to think of being on their own, with civil society in disorder. They feel (understandably) helpless in such a situation. So they cling to the idea that it &quot;won&#x27;t happen here&quot; and anyone preparing for it is foolish.<p>We&#x27;d have to get over that mental hill, before folks can come out on the other side and start sensibly preparing.<p>I&#x27;ve thought a civil preparedness plan could be building-by-building for instance. Multi-family dwellings could have a set of shared resources. Makes it more palatable, when &#x27;everyone is doing it&#x27;.')
