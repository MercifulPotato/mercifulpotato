I had a strict set of requirements and I didn&#x27;t want to bite the bullet til I was sure I&#x27;d gotten the right one.<p>My dad asked my wife what to get me for a birthday present. She knew I was tent shopping so he got me one. I don&#x27;t want to sound ungrateful because it was a lovely gesture, but I also could have just picked the first one on Amazon that looked good. I didn&#x27;t do that because I wanted a specific thing.<p>I don&#x27;t want to return the tent because it&#x27;s a present, I don&#x27;t have space to store 2 tents and I don&#x27;t want to use the one he got because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the features I wanted in a tent.<p>Anyway, now I don&#x27;t tell anybody when I&#x27;m planning on buying something like that.')
