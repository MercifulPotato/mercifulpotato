If the rich people, etc etc, behaved better and weren&#x27;t awful, it would be a lot harder to mount such an attack. But it was made easy to do, and for that reason the whole &#x27;freedom of speech&#x27; thing is nothing more than an attack vector at this point. We&#x27;ve lost that. There is no way it&#x27;s sustainable the way some people would like it to be sustainable. There are powerful interests, state actors, weaponizing every little shred of freedom to destroy Western society, and I don&#x27;t see any good answers at this point.<p>It was a weakness. We could have freedom of speech as long as it wasn&#x27;t being weaponized on a massive scale against us. We could have freedom of speech so long as massive calculated lying wasn&#x27;t a primary tactic, so long as people could be taken at face value. That&#x27;s simply not true anymore.')
