Given free choice, I&#x27;d probably got a T495 or T14 with AMD.<p>Mostly the P14s feels the same as the T480 did. I have none but the usual complaints (+ too new hardware so drivers are still a bit flaky), though I think the underpowered discrete graphics is a waste of money at least for my use.')
