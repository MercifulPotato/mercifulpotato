Utter is too strong of a word, the keyboard has the same qualities for me that made the butterfly keyboards suck.<p>They may have fixed the reliability issues, but they have <i>not</i> fixed key travel issues. The person that designed this keyboard is a very particular person, and this person probably does not like the keyboard in the 2012 MBA.<p>It isn&#x27;t just preference, the new keyboard is slightly uncomfortable to use, the key pressure is too high and the travel too low, so the impulse on the tendons is too sharp.<p>The gist is that Apple has over designed its product and made design the number one metric. Design only works when it is subservient to function.')
