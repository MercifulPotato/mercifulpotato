I feel like KDE never really abandoned this kind of look-and-feel until Plasma was released, which is very clean and pleasant. It has discarded cartoon-ish icons and has sharper lines and colours which are nicer to look at. I am a big fan!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Everaldo_Coelho#Crystal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Everaldo_Coelho#Crystal</a>')
