The Russian Troll Farm&#x2F;Cambridge Analytica&#x2F;social ads scandal is mostly noise and no signal. But you’re missing something important: Russian state sponsored hackers spearfished and stole data from the RNC, DNC, and the Clinton circle. They deliberately released the latter two and withheld the first. Those releases don’t define the entire election, but they had a demonstrable and empirically validated impact on voters. Those deliberate and asymmetric releases probably changed the outcome of the election.<p>Russia really did interfere in that election and you’ve ignored this crucial fact.')
