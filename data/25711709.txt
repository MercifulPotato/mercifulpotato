Is Twitter or Facebook basically a fundamental human right in the US? Is losing Twitter like losing your ability to own a firearm?<p>The whole “censorship” label seems quite entitled at best. These are private companies. They are under no obligation to let someone’s crazy uncle talk about hanging the VP of the US or overthrowing Congress.<p>Donald J Trump has every opportunity to call into Lou Dobbs, Judge Jeanine, Sean Hannity, or Fox News. He can publish directly on Brietbart. He also has the podium in the WH press room, which he doesn’t like to use, and for a decent chunk of the Presidency, had no daily press briefing.<p>The American liberals cry over the smallest thing, and the conservatives are equally, or perhaps worse entitled cry babies. Twitter owes American individuals absolutely nothing.  They’re a business. Presumably they don’t want to get sued because we already knew people were using Twitter to plan another attack on American elected officials and Twitter did nothing.')
