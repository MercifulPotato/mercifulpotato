While I&#x27;ve not used it, and it doesn&#x27;t really compat with much, it&#x27;s not the most horribly designed build system out there.<p>CMake is still the defacto, it allows the most flexibility when needed (albeit very painfully) and provides good-enough support for hierarchical projects.<p>xmake doesn&#x27;t solve any of the deficiencies CMake still has, and isn&#x27;t close to feature parity. Further, it&#x27;s not improving the 80% use case much over Cmake, which is simple enough for smaller libraries and packages and covers cases like packaging building and installation out of the box without really much extra overhead.<p>Unless a build system comes along that is 10x better at all aspects, I don&#x27;t see CMake going anywhere.<p>Now if Autotools could just die already...')
