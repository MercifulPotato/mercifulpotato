Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601761470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674595, text='I think you&#x27;ve been downvoted because your reply is too dismissive of the motivations why people do open source projects in the first place, and of the way joy depends on how other people behave.<p>For myself, I have worked on projects where I continued long past where I felt joy in doing the project, because the goal of the project was still worth doing, and not just for myself but for other people&#x27;s benefit.<p>I&#x27;ve done many things like that which you wouldn&#x27;t call projects too.  If I quit at the first sign of not enjoying them, I would have abandoned a lot of people by now!<p>There is also reputation.  For better and worse, some people&#x27;s reputation is bound up in how they handle their projects, and this has become stronger since &quot;GitHub is the new résumé&quot; for some.  To step down from a project is to potentially drop a career-building opportunity.<p>To apply your principle to that sort of thing, we would need an expansive definition of joy that goes beyond feeling uplifted in the short term, and go deep into a pandora&#x27;s box of why people choose things, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.<p>We would also need to figure out how to apply the principle when joy isn&#x27;t a passive result of whether you work on the project.  It&#x27;s <i>affected</i> by how things like bug reports are handled, on talking publicly about what we want from each other, about the importance of politeness and reasonable expectations, learning how to respond to people, and other things such as this discussion.  Sometimes unpleasant experiences are needed to create more joy in future.<p>I think it&#x27;s more fruitful to just let joy be good old simple joy, and when it comes to deciding whether to &quot;step down&quot;, instead of a simple assessment of &quot;am I enjoying this&quot;, talk about better ways to accomplish things we think are still worth doing, even when we&#x27;re not currently enjoying it.')
