Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=[25393313], score=None, time=1607703201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25386837, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could buy these<p>Because Apple offers luxury products. People who buy luxury products are willing to pay a premium for it. Not understanding that different people value different things from you is a very weird stance to take. I personally wouldn&#x27;t pay the premium price to lease a luxury automobile, but I understand why other people do it.<p>&gt; I purchased the regular AirPods and this point was reached even sooner, after ~2 years of heavy usage they don&#x27;t work longer than 15 minutes.<p>That&#x27;s not been my experience, mine have a few hours of lifespan after two years, but for earbuds that&#x27;s not too bad. I regularly killed wired earbuds faster than that due to wear and tear.<p>Everything else on this design seems to me like they&#x27;ll be longer lived than their competitors. Steel headbands and magnet attached earcups sound much more durable than plastic and plastic. I&#x27;d be willing to bet that more headphones meet an early demise due to worn out earcups and broken headbands than batteries reaching EOL, so this might not be a bad trade-off for users willing to pay $500 for headphones anyways.')
