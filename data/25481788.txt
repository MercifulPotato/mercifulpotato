You&#x27;ll almost never see actual <i>users</i> whining about the App Store; usually the complaints about &quot;walled gardens&quot; are from the companies and devs who <i>prey</i> upon users and would love to have a free reign.<p>Too many times I had a shitty experience with an app or service I paid for and Apple refunded me without question, but I&#x27;ve almost always had to fight an uphill battle to get a refund directly from developers&#x2F;publishers (currently against Couchsurfing, whose app bypasses the standard In-App Purchase system).')
