I think it is a bit black and white to think of a perfect separation between code and config. In a perfect world and easy situations yes. But I think you are all missing the point of these languages. In my eyes they are templating languages. Have any of you guys seen the Helm charts some of us have to write daily? Mustache coding is terrible! I would love any of these languages instead of that. The only thing worse would be to have to write all the yaml yourself every time instead of any templating at all.<p>To that end, you could use any programming language to generate the yaml for your config. But then some of these has some nice features. I really like that Dhall is only a total lang and it does some nice things with importing dhall files.<p>That is not to say you should unnecessarily complicate your config. Keep it easy and separate from code as much as possible.')
