If your rent is 1.2k for a 2bd in SF (because resident since 2000s), whereas market rate for a 2bd now is 3.9k in SF -- what is your determination -- is a person able or not able to move-out?<p>Why would anyone move out every 2 to 3 years if they&#x27;re rent-controlled, and they&#x27;d have to pay significantly more for any new place?<p>Likewise, if you&#x27;ve been owning a property since the old times, and it&#x27;s fully paid off, the property tax liability in Cali is tiny, and for older owners perhaps entirely a wash-off due to infamous Prop 13.  Which is part of the reason that many owners don&#x27;t even bother renting their properties.')
