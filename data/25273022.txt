That&#x27;s _INCREDIBLE_.<p>I think people mistakenly think that cloud costs only go up exponentially and that costs are an unmanageable mess.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with teams with hundreds of engineers serving a major enterprise and only an AWS bill 3-5x yours.  And they only had a small team managing it all.  Comfortably.<p>To do similar with physical servers requires a massive stack of people and salaries. The ongoing recruiting costs to maintain staffing would dwarf what the AWS bill is.')
