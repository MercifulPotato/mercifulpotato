I have no prescriptive views on how to host things.<p>The only thing I can really offer you is that in the spirit of this article, when I did some work that would run on AWS lambda it was very handy not to have to think about any of the infrastructure that was around the business logic I needed to code.<p>I fully expect that code will spend its entire useful lifetime running in AWS Lambda with no need for it to escape the vendor or technology behind it. It&#x27;s even possible no one will think about it until it breaks and stops sending events.<p>If it costs the company Â£50&#x2F;hour for me to look into something, me being able to complete a task quickly and then never look into it again is almost certainly going to save more money than writing a dedicated process and running it on a physical server that I then need to maintain.')
