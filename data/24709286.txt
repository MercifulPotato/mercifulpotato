Is Android &quot;compatible&quot; with Java programs if those programs need to be recompiled first, but no source edits are necessary? What if source edits <i>are</i> necessary, but can be automated? What if recompiling <i>isn&#x27;t</i> necessary, but you need to hex edit the binary?<p>&quot;Compatibility&quot; is a spectrum, and I&#x27;d say Android falls within that range.')
