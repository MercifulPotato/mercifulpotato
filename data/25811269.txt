It&#x27;s like a canary in a coal mine, It seems perfectly alive to me, I&#x27;ll be concerned when I dont see that statement any more.<p>Personally, I find the government censoring the CDC, and not getting accurate information from government agencies a much larger imposition on free speech. The silencing or the Florida data scientist sharing public information that conflicted with official reports.<p>Why? Because the government is using legal threats to silence someone on every channel.')
