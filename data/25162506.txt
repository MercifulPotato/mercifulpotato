In a certain sense of the word, this is indeed an off-the-shelf library, but only in the same sense that Google Chrome uses off-the-shelf Blink. Epiphany a major contributor to Webkit-GTK, and one of its largest users.<p>Should Epiphany ban everyone <i>else</i> from using Webkit-GTK? I don&#x27;t actually think they can, it&#x27;s all open source after all.<p>&gt;  A better one might be to figure out how Google disambiguates Safari from the iOS webview, Chrome from the chromium webview, etc, and follow the same path.<p>Google is probably doing some kind of ridiculous obfuscated fingerprinting. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s viable to work around something like that without cooperation from Google. It would be a constant cat-and-mouse game, with Google having the upper hand.')
