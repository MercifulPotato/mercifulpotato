The point with ld is that the distribution has one central point for linking. If static linking with go, rust, C, etc. would work in a similar fashion, each executable could be shipped with a &quot;re-link&quot; script and the distribution could again provide security patches efficiently.<p>But when linking happens in some poorly maintained script, inside a custom build systen, written in two or more languages, running inside a docker container, executed by some year-old CI integration, patching security issues becomes impossible.')
