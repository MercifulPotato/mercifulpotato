This is largely because <i>you don&#x27;t see the people who are being careful because they are staying in</i> so there&#x27;s a massive bias towards careless, selfish jerks when you go out.<p>If you want to promote Covid safety, ask this question about holiday plans on Facebook, Twitter, whatsapp, or whatever social network you use. Or a more general question: &quot;How are you&#x2F;your family staying safe from Covid?&quot;<p>This question brings everyone who is staying safe out of the shadows and into view, and all the sudden rather than feeling like you&#x27;re &quot;the only one&quot; being careful, you realize you&#x27;re in very good company. It&#x27;s great to show other people as well. So if you want to &quot;do something,&quot; start discussions on social media about what people are doing to stay safe!')
