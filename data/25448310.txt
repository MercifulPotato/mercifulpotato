But my therapist, in his forties, has experienced (and relayed to me) the &quot;life begins at 40&quot; philosophy (I didn&#x27;t actually realize it was something other people said until I saw this article).<p>It&#x27;s not just wishful thinking for him: he felt that he didn&#x27;t really figure out who he was, didn&#x27;t really start self-actualizing en force before 40. Having known him a few years, it&#x27;s clear to me that he genuinely has a very balanced and happy life, one with a family that he loves but also with his own goals and small pleasures, his own meaningful friendships, etc.<p>So I guess: I would tend to agree that the midlife crisis is a trap constructed by our western culture, and one that it&#x27;s very possible to simply pass by. I think you just have to never stop working on yourself and asking (and listening to) what your needs are. Keep a balanced life of relationships, and pursuits, and self-care, and - yes - some accomplishments too. Don&#x27;t put all your eggs in one basket. Don&#x27;t get complacent, but don&#x27;t burn out either. Be in it for the long haul.')
