How it&#x27;s changed within the recent past is it&#x27;s become more diverse in the ideological slant of outlets, so every major outlet isn&#x27;t telling you the <i>same</i> thing to think about what happened, regardless of slight divergences in the information they select to include about what actually happened. So, more of the difference in outlets is on narrative&#x2F;spin than fact details. This makes the spin more noticeable.')
