It was sometime in 1992, and the standard &quot;publishing&quot; mechanisms of the time were FTP (super common), Gopher and WAIS. Later in the year I remember showing my boss the alpha NCSA Mosaic running on a Slackware Linux I had cobbled together. Two years later I moved out to SF and before a year had passed, started a company with friends that became one of the early web design agencies.<p>Life moved REALLY FAST back then, it&#x27;s kind of shocking how quickly it all went from barely there to &quot;the next big thing&quot; (air quotes not required in this case). My entire career has largely been built on a thing that didn&#x27;t exist until 3 years after I started college, which even today seems super weird.')
