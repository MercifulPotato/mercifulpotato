New DXRacer\n2. New Ergochair2 \n3. Used Aeron Classic<p>I currently use the Ergochair2.<p>The DXRacer had all the problems you stated, I could never feel like I was comfortable. Sold to a friend.<p>The Ergochair2 was my &#x27;I want a Herman Miller but I don&#x27;t want to buy a Herman Miller&#x27; purchase.  It&#x27;s comfortable for me, and is the perfect height for my setup.  My complaints though are the creakiness, O.K. build quality (all plastic), arm rest are very meh, and no warranty.  The flat and somewhat firm cushion is just right for how I sit.<p>I got lucky on an Aeron Classic, as my Dad&#x27;s office was throwing it away... I took it home and tried it for 1 month.  It was used, but I couldn&#x27;t seem to get comfortable in it. My thighs felt like they were getting pinched at the base of the chair.  I often sit with 1 leg crossed underneath me (weird I know) but this chair is NOT built for this.  I feel like this chair was used quite a bit, so I can&#x27;t speak on a new model. I will say the build quality blows the Ergochair2 out of the water.  The warranty is a huge bonus as well. Luckily I gave this to my Dad as his office chair and he loves it vs his 20 year old Office Depot chair.<p>Sit in what you can, I&#x27;m happy didn&#x27;t buy an Aeron.')
