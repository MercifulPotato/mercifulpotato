Rosetta2 is not a pure static translator, because such a thing can&#x27;t exist (see: self-modifying code).<p>Just because binary translation is used doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s magically as fast as native code. Converting code that runs on architecture A to run on architecture B always has corner cases where things end up a lot slower by necessity.')
