If only 10% of the folks who could pass those interviews and get those offers were willing to relocation, that&#x27;ll cause a much larger downward pressure on prices than if, say, 75% were, in which case the pool doesn&#x27;t expand as much.<p>[0] the usefulness of the algorithm interview can be debated, but I don&#x27;t see remote work putting any pressure on this process')
