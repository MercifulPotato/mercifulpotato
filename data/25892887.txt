That&#x27;s maybe not mission critical on a small scale, but on a large scale it absolutely is.<p>Deep learning models are black box models, which means they are not formally interpretable. You can still sometimes get interpretations out of these models using various methods, but they are fairly underdeveloped, and without actual theories of neural network behavior I don&#x27;t see that improving anytime soon.<p>You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s true with or without ML. In fact, it&#x27;s true with human-run systems, too. Consider a police officer who is more likely to pull people over in a certain neighborhood, and that neighborhood was 95% AfAm. IF they were asked why they pulled over more people in that neighborhood, they could say they were discriminating against the neighborhood, which, in and of itself is not racial discrimination. Of course, further inspection of that police officer&#x27;s records could show that they are biased towards neighborhoods with a high AfAm population, which would be racial discrimination.<p>The same scenario can easily arise in an ML context, but interrogating a machine is a very different context from interrogating a human. First of all, people believe that computers are innately &#x27;unbiased&#x27; because they are computers, so making the case that an algorithm is biased is already more difficult. Second, going back to the point I made before -- interpreting a model is not the same as providing a human-readable explanation. Asking a question about racial bias in a model which doesn&#x27;t even encode for race (as many do, in an ill-conceived attempt to be &#x27;neutral&#x27;) requires skilled people to understand how to ask the question and how to interpret the answer. There&#x27;s no plug and play process that one can follow to &quot;scrutinize the solution to see if it&#x27;s complete enough and correct enough&quot;.')
