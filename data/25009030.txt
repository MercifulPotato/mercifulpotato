Of course the victim device has to be alive on the target machine that runs said hypothetical bejeweled.<p>Adversaries won&#x27;t have to physically plug the device in, though, because there are plenty such potentially exploitable devices that are readily available on average computers(desktop or laptop). BIOS ROM chips, gaming RGB LED controllers, motion sensors, power management microcontrollers, internal Wi-Fi or Bluetooth chips, potentially some HDMI monitors, SSDs, HDDs, potentially Blu-ray drives, certain USB drives, gaming mice, GPUs, high end network controllers, BMCs for remote server management... Today even a microSD card runs some sort of software.<p>I think you&#x27;d have to go back to at least Pentium 2 or III days, further back if you want a laptop, to be confident that there is _no_ standalone microcontrollers that can be hacked from OS by adversaries, and that any reprogramming features in components are&#x2F;can be fully disabled in hardware or at least by OS. Microcontrollers were usually overkill for simple management tasks back in those days, and ROMs either had hardware write enable pins or external reprogramming voltage supply required to do it.')
