Item(by='RubenvanE', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602184566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720241, text='Thank you, this truly warms my heart!<p>I have poured too many hours of my life into this little detail. It still doesn&#x27;t work great though:<p>1. It is hard to click on on mobile devices<p>2. It sometimes renders behind the comment or is not clickable (not always, just sometimes). I am afraid this has something to do with the way browsers render the CSS sticky position, so I might not be able to fix this. I am not very experienced in CSS though, so if you&#x27;ve any advice on how to fix this I would truly appreciate it!<p>Because of the above two issues I might need to go back to just a fixed minus button. :(')
