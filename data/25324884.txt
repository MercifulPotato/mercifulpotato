I usually get bored with the first type of book because it just rehashes the same thing over and over again.<p>So, when you choose book vs article, I think this distinction should be part of the thought process. Basically, if you do give up a blog post or article in favor of a book, make sure you&#x27;re getting the right bang for you buck and are not just re-reading the same idea over and over again.')
