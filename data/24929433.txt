Item(by='cassalian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603971702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926214, text='&gt; I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”).<p>The point I wish to make is that Jeremy is either experiencing some cognitive dissonance, or his frustration is overriding his fear with regards to his position on CoCs in general.<p>Whether he intends for it or not, his article taken as a whole aligns much more closely with the gripes from the &quot;anti-CoC crowd&quot; than one in support of CoCs; despite him stating that he is attempting to deter the anti-CoC crowd. Why? Well his argument is that the CoC committee is essentially a capricious entity. This is evidenced by his expected experience versus reality, among other things:<p>&gt; I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to convey it at the response team meeting”.<p>but then the actual experience did not go quite as planned:<p>&gt; I was stunned. The representative could not even commit to a time when they would get back to me, or tell me what would be happening next. I told them that I thought that telling someone that they had a violation report, but then not saying what it is, or when or whether they would be able to provide their side of the story, or providing any time-frame for any next step was cruel.<p>&gt; The next call did not happen for another week (I had made myself available to meet any time). I was shocked to read that the purpose of the call would be to “discuss the results of our investigation”. I could not understand how they could have completed their investigation and have results, without any input from me.<p>And Jeremy&#x27;s true feelings about the situation were laid out at the top of the article:<p>&gt; The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future.<p>And directly following it is his dissonance&#x2F;fear kicking in:\n&gt; ... for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.<p>Throughout the article, we find Jeremy constantly defending the ideas behind CoCs. Despite that, the entire article serves to show how those ideas utterly failed in practice; and as such, serves as an example against CoCs. As such, I hypothesize that this is either because Jeremy does not actually agree with CoCs, but is too fearful that he feels it&#x27;s necessary to consistently defend their ideas. Or he still hasn&#x27;t come to terms with the fact that CoCs aren&#x27;t all he&#x27;s made them up to be, and now that he&#x27;s gone through the other end of it and been left feeling &quot;shattered&quot; is struggling to reconcile his emotions and experience from his ideology regarding CoCs.<p>In the event Jeremy&#x27;s defense of CoCs is fear based, then I am saddened about the current state of affairs. On the other hand, if it&#x27;s the case that he is experiencing cognitive dissonance, I wish him the best of luck finding clarity.<p>Does any else have other ideas on the author feels compelled to defend CoCs while at the same time damaging their reputation via example?')
