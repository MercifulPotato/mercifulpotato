How on earth can you say that inflation has remained low??? All of those have become insanely expensive and people die all the time because they can&#x27;t afford them!<p>Just because cheap, crappy electronics and egg McMuffins don&#x27;t appreciate in cost and stay crappy and cheap does NOT mean inflation is low.
