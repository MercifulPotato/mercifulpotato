It is hazardous, but so are a <i>lot</i> of other substances that are dealt with in large volumes every day, and again, nuclear waste isn&#x27;t even that large of a volume!<p>Meanwhile coal plants pump radioactive particles directly into the air, and communities surrounding coal plants have higher rates of cancer, but people complain less because it is in the air and not in barrels labeled with a scary symbol.<p>With modern nuclear plant designs, the waste would be even less, and there are even designs for plants that would use existing nuclear waste as fuel.<p>Nuclear is a technology with trade-offs like anything else. There is no need to dismissing it outright.')
