I wouldn&#x27;t accuse you of implying that it would also apply to e.g. Date.now(), but I firmly disagree that it applies to hooks.<p>I get that hooks are declared in the form of functions, and that pure functions are the desired pattern in many cases. But I like to think of hooks as hooks, not functions (emphasized by the naming convention of prefixing with &quot;use&quot;). We are in the context of React, after all, and I think it is comparable to critique of JSX because of &quot;separation of concerns&quot;. Yes, valid critique in many cases, but not necessarily applicable to React.<p>Having been a React developer for over 5 years now, I think hooks solve a lot of problems that before would typically have been solved with Redux, Redux Saga and other libraries. Or with home made solutions, leading to various degrees of mess. From what I&#x27;ve seen, hooks have enabled React devs to write code that is even easier to understand, while also keeping things simpler and external libraries fewer.')
