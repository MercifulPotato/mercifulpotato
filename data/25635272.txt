With some altcoins you can cause a 10x increase in price with a few thousand dollars.  Why?  Because with a few thousand dollars, you&#x27;ve bought up all the supply in the order book, become the monopoly provider, and can name your price for anyone that comes around after you wanting to buy.<p>With more participants, there&#x27;s going to be someone out there that undercuts your 10x ask and offers a more reasonable price.<p>For the statistically inclined, you could look at this as an application of the central limit theorem.  One random variable (the price you&#x27;re asking for an asset) could be all over the place.  A million random variables (each a market participant) added together tend toward a normal distribution with the sample mean converging to the population mean.')
