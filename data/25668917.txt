This adds 16-bit instructions to the 32-bit instruction set.<p>There are many reasons why this was a huge and very shortsighted mistake, but the <i>most</i> painful part of this is that you can now have an instruction spanning two cache lines.  This has many awful implication and precludes many tricks that would make implementations faster.  But it was important for Andrew Waterman to get his thesis work be mandatory part of the Unix platform, so here we are.<p>ADDENDUM: It&#x27;s near trivial for a linker to pad such that instructions don&#x27;t span cache lines and that would have made this a lot less painful, but RISC-V refuses to specify the line size (it&#x27;s implementation dependent), so now we suffer this nightmare.')
