Household 2D printers do bitmaps.<p>There&#x27;s 3D bitmap printers as well, like the SLA resin printers and laser sintering.<p>The bitmap thing at a high resolution requires higher precision equipment than a typical 3D printer which makes it more difficult to do as a hobbyist. Not impossible, but a factor.')
