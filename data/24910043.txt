All that one has to do is write the specifications for the software, and the computer will find a program [...]</i><p><i>The oldest paper known to me that discusses automatic programming was written in the 1940s by Saul Gorn when he was working at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. This paper, entitled “Is Automatic Programming Feasible?” was classified for a while. It answered the question positively.</i><p><i>At that time, programs were fed into computers on paper tapes. The programmer worked the punch directly and actually looked at the holes in the tape. I have seen programmers “patch” programs by literally patching the paper tape.</i><p><i>The automatic programming system considered by Gorn in that paper was an assembler in today’s terminology. All that one would have to do with his automatic programming system would be to write a code such as CLA, and the computer would automatically punch the proper holes in the tape. In this way, the programmer’s task would be performed automatically by the computer.</i><p><i>In later years the phrase was used to refer to program generation from languages such as IT, FORTRAN, and ALGOL. In each case, the programmer entered a specification of what he wanted, and the computer produced the program in the language of the machine. In short, automatic programming always has been a euphemism for programming with a higher-level language than was then available to the programmer. Research in automatic programming is simply research in the implementation of higher-level programming languages.</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;class&#x2F;cs99r&#x2F;readings&#x2F;parnas1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;class&#x2F;cs99r&#x2F;readings&#x2F;parnas1.pdf</a>')
