I do believe that&#x27;s required everywhere. For native Chinese it&#x27;s becoming easier to visit other places because the registration system is becoming more digital. That unfortunately has the side effect of making it increasingly more difficult for foreigners since the manual method is becoming less common and therefore more confusing for local police.<p>It is interesting in the context of AirBnB - with the registration system they can&#x27;t use the same &quot;it&#x27;s better to ask forgiveness than permission&quot; approach they used in US. I have seen very successful foreign run businesses, for example a friend who imported steel in China, do really well for many years because the government wasn&#x27;t interested in their industry, and then all of sudden find himself against several competitors and be completely out of business in the space of 6-12 months. I&#x27;m bullish on AirBnB but depending on success in China is a risky strategy.')
