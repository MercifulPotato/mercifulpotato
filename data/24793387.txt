If I kill millions of mosquitos and reduce malaria fatalties by 100 per million population while blinding 1 per million, then unless there is a <i>better</i> way to kill the bugs we should consider this approach.<p>I don&#x27;t really see how this line of argument really translates to this issue with Google. First of all I should have acknowledged that imprisoning data is almost assuredly unacceptable and that unless Google is acting directly in response to a law enforcement action they should give you a way to download your data when they tell you that they have chosen not to continue the business relationship they have with you.<p>But there will be cases where they cannot do that, and in some cases it will be a mistake but the reason they cannot solve this problem cheaply is because usually it is not a mistake and so litigating 99,999 cases to find the one worthy of saving is a hard case to make, why should Google pay for that?<p>I should have mentioned up-front that this article scared the hell out of me and I&#x27;m probably moving to Fastmail. I&#x27;ve had my own domain for going on two decades and am still grandfathered into the free gsuite for it but I&#x27;d much rather <i>pay someone who will support me</i> than use a free service that could cost me access to data that I might want again in the future. I also realized I could be vulnerable to a trap where my DNS account is disabled at the same time my email is, meaning I couldn&#x27;t even move the DNS without first recovering access to my mailbox.')
