There&#x27;s too few of them anyway to gain any statistically meaningful insight even if we did follow up on these study participant washouts.  This is hydroxychloroquine all over again.  When you are looking at inadequate data, you can find all sorts of patterns.  It is very rare that such patterns turn out to be real.  The most reasonable approach is to assume that there is little to no durable protection from a single dose, just like most prime&#x2F;boost vaccines.')
