After all, dictatorships are more &quot;efficient&quot; at getting stuff done than democracy (note, not saying GOOD is done, just more efficient when you don&#x27;t have to consider others concerns but your own).<p>However, reality is that is never seems to play out that way. Even if it plays out that way for a little while, someone always inevitably joins the higher ranks and abuses that power for their own interests and selfishness.<p>The same reason this fails in countries is the same reason it fails in online communities where the content is community created. Eventually, someone joins the moderator ranks (if they aren&#x27;t already their) and starts pushing their own agenda when it comes to removing posts or locking posts.<p>I think reddit has crossed over into this stage of things on most subreddits at this point. It is clearly a cultural issue with the admins who seem to encourage this behavior, as well as no way for the user base to have any recourse against this abuse of mod power.<p>Thus, you get endless censorship now on most subreddits now, and no more open discussion on topics where USERS actually get to decide what they get to read or comment on. After all, what is the point of an upvote&#x2F;downvote button if mods can just override it endlessly and often do?')
