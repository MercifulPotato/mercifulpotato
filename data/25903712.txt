Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=[25904117], score=None, time=1611586194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903457, text='&quot;for whom the only reason they continue to be homeless is they can&#x27;t do anything other than figure out what they&#x27;re gonna eat that day&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure I believe this. Why did they become homeless in first place? With most there is an underlying issue. It might be that they are a felon, addict, or other medical issue. It&#x27;s not that hard to ask for a job while also asking for money or food. Especially if you&#x27;re already going to food establishment dumpster or begging outside of them.<p>The person I know the best who homeless had a combination of issues. He was in a coma and lost his job. He was also required to pay child support and the bank account ran dry during that time. A warrant was issued and he was arrested. You can&#x27;t find any &quot;good&quot; jobs with a record and warrants being issued. He basically gave up on the system and finds it easier to just let family support him.')
