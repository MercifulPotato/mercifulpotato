Every now and then. It&#x27;s very weird. Recently I heard an interview (on one of the Jupiter broadcasting shows) about how btrfs is exposing errors of underlying hardware using their checksumming features, I had a bit of an Aha! moment. The files in question (BAM files) have a sort of checksumming built in (called cigar strings) and I am getting more and more convinced that the discrepancies I run into are actually bit flips on the hardware. Anybody else have any experience with this? BTRFS would be a good tool to prevent such bitrot, imo...')
