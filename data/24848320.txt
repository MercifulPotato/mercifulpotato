Without detail, you can&#x27;t really tell unless you&#x27;ve seen the exact photo before. I picked 95 even though they showed me a black and white image.<p>I learned I don&#x27;t really know much about clothing styles.<p>From the site:<p>&gt;When you were dating the photos, you probably looked for context clues â€” what people were wearing, if there were any familiar buildings, and if you recognized any faces. You were probably also looking at color.<p>I would argue that the very nature of the site makes it more likely that most people were using context clues.  I also wonder if color gives you more detail&#x2F;clues and hence in most of the photos I was shown, the color guesses were closer to the actual year.<p>I would find the accuracy of the guesses (as opposed to the difference between color and B&amp;W guesses) more informational, for a larger data set.')
