Julia got its first stable release in August 2018, meaning that more companies could be adopting it now, but R has been around since 1995. If you like Python, Julia is probably easy to pick up though. Octave is incredibly slow and no competition for Matlab, Matlab is terrible as a programming language if you&#x27;re used to Python, so it&#x27;s likely you wouldn&#x27;t enjoy your job if it involved Matlab.')
