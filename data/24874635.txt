PSG is probably the fastest way for anyone moderately familar with python to throw together an ugly-but-servicable GUI program and I reach for it when I&#x27;m in a hurry. The two tricks behind PSG are: 1. very concise and memorable GUI layout with only python code and 2. use of an event loop instead of handlers. All of this sounds pretty basic and obvious, but <i>no one else does it this way</i>.')
