The best way to describe it was that it felt, mentally, like my consciousness was fading and that I was dying. Closest sensations I’ve experienced to it would be fainting or moments of low blood pressure. Sort of like getting dizzy after standing up too fast, but for hours and hours. Not pleasant.<p>My doctors have no idea what caused these symptoms, but in both cases going off the statin (first Crestor, then Lipitor) got me back to normal.')
