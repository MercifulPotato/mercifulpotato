That is simply a wrong headed reading of Austrians by people who hate it.<p>If anything it says, natural monopolies exists, but some of the regulation designed to fight it, can be more harmful.<p>Austrians also try to not narrow down market so much, that monopolies are everywhere. Is Tom Hanks a monopoly on Tom Hanks, sure but does that matter. Is the market acting? Entertainment?<p>Just saying &#x27;its a natural monopoly, therefore government need to come in with some strong handed specific regulation&#x27; is often a bad approach that can stop other mechanism from functioning. For example, locking in natural monopolies forever, even when future technologies means that monopoly would have been broken.')
