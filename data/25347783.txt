Hearing and taste are two things that are literally unique (almost impossibly equivalent, probability wise) for every single person.<p>As you go towards the top end of these things, the delusion creeps in, which is that the objectivity extends from the foundation to the roof, so to speak.  The fact of the matter is that it was gone somewhere in the middle, e.g. why &quot;trained listeners&quot; cannot distinguish between a coat hanger and $1,000 cable, and while &quot;wine experts&quot; will often pick a $15 grocery store bottle over a $300 bottle in a blind taste test.  And they will reverse their answers if told the price ahead of time.<p>These same concepts exist in other product categories, but I don&#x27;t know of any better examples than audio and wine.')
