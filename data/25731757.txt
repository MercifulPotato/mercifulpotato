Politicians are fickle.<p>Trump isn&#x27;t really a Republican, it&#x27;s just that on some key issues, his position aligns better with the Republican party. The majority of the Republican party was openly anti-Trump in the beginning, then later turned around due to his massive public support.<p>That hasn&#x27;t really changed, his approval is as stable as ever. The only people buying into the &quot;failed coup&quot; narrative are the ones that never supported him to begin with. Dropping Trump, as much as the party might want to, is not a recipe for success. Strategically, dividing the Republican party will be the prime objective of Democrats.')
