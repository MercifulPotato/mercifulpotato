So it should be easy for them to recreate their entire own tech infrastructure to host whatever nuclear waste dumpster fire app they want, after all it should be very easy for &quot;smart, hardworking real Americans&quot; like them. Hey, capitalism is all about competitions right? Last time I checked there may even be some money involved in the tech industry so I&#x27;m actually a little puzzled why they haven&#x27;t done so already.<p>If you think I sound like a smug douchebag in this comment that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> how I feel from reading these news these past few days.')
