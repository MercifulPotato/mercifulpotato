This is an application undoubtedly built with Apple hardware, probably using an Apple-developed programming language and an IDE made by Apple, to be used on machines created and manufactured by Apple, and provided on a store that’s setup and run by Apple.<p>This isn’t even a so-called ‘walled garden’. Let’s take Instagram for instance: built on technologies provided freely by others (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) and exploiting user-created content, I still need to sign-up to a Facebook service to be able to see that freely-provided content.<p>If these apps were boxes on a Walmart shelf, why would it be seen as some sort of civil-liberty infringement if you got a call someday, to say that Walmart had decided to discontinue selling your product?<p>Just change the name and move on.')
