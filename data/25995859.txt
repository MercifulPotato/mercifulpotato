Item(by='01acheru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612224169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994902, text='Each one of us has his or her own way of expressing opinions, from my point of view there is more than just those three lines of text in what I wrote, some people got it, other people didn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s what I find great about HN comments.<p>I really appreciate that people took the time to express their opinions starting from a simple statement like the one I wrote, and I don&#x27;t think that each and every comment needs to be a complete analysis of every possible nuance of the subject we are commenting about.<p>I&#x27;m not a monolithic person, I prefer a conversational approach when discussing opinions, but that&#x27;s just a matter of personal taste.<p>Anyway, to make my point I&#x27;ll use as an example two projects I was personally involved and still bring food on the table: NodeJS + MongoDB (started 7 years ago, still on it); MariaDB + PHP + FORTRAN (started 4 years ago, after the first two years only consulting from time to time).\nFun fact: right now I could swap one DB for the other and I wouldn&#x27;t mind the difference, maybe some minor tricks here and there.<p>You can get burned with MongoDB (totally inconsistent data model? Well, that sucks bad), you can get burned with PostgreSQL or other SQL databases (thousand line long business critical stored procedures starts getting inefficient? Self join time explodes after some time in production? Ouch...)<p>The main point I wanted to make is what jeff-davis (your sibling) summarized for me with words way better than my own: &quot;If you are building something and excited, then keep going, don&#x27;t stop because a blog told you &#x27;never&#x27;&quot;<p>Too often I read blog posts like the one we are commenting when I was starting with software development as a job, they scared the shit out of me! I didn&#x27;t have any experience on the tools so reading that some much more experienced guy working on some Silicon Valley billion dollar corporation was saying &quot;This is shit: you touch it, you die&quot; didn&#x27;t bring anything useful to me, just stress...<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve heard everything and its contrary about... anything! There is normal people here on HN, there are young devs starting right now that read those comments, not everyone is building mission critical rocket firmware, billion users social networks or AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;Blockchain fanta-finance trading bots (not that you are implying anything like that, far from it) but my advice after some years in the business is what I wrote: know your tools, get to like them, get proficient, use them well and try to build something good... your personal experience, be it success or failure, is worth a thousand times more than the success or failure narrated on a random guy&#x2F;girl blog from N years ago')
