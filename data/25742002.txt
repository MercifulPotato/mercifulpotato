You get all the stuff in the dashboard, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s fairly primitive compared to what you&#x27;d be used to in ***sense. It&#x27;s a good solution for people who want something turnkey, but if you&#x27;re a prosumer&#x2F;homelabber type you&#x27;re better off leaving switching and APs in Unifi but using something else for the gateway. I do quite like the EdgeMax routers like the ER-4 paired with Unifi, however. Just my own perspective having tried all of the above.')
