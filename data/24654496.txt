That&#x27;s what building hardware is like for many product companies. At Instrumental, we&#x27;re building a manufacturing optimization system that collects data no one else can, and uses machine learning and visualizations to automatically identify defects and help product companies understand their assembly processes.<p>With ~35 people we are a small but mighty team with a collaborative, friendly culture. We value an inclusive environment and actively work to promote diversity in our team.<p>We also value good tools. For example, I manage the web app team - our deploys involve running a single command and take just a few minutes, so we deploy frequently and with confidence. &quot;Watch mode&quot; compilation usually takes under a second. We have &quot;branch environments&quot; to test any pull request in a production-like environment with real data. And we have robust tests.<p>Open roles:<p>- Senior Backend Engineer, Platform: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instrumental&#x2F;4c155db0-8506-4096-ae7d-ce42677bd7d1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instrumental&#x2F;4c155db0-8506-4096-ae7d-c...</a><p>- Senior Backend Engineer, Web App: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instrumental&#x2F;317d0eb2-e2db-498a-b79c-67970f05be64" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instrumental&#x2F;317d0eb2-e2db-498a-b79c-6...</a><p>- Senior Full Stack Engineer, Factory Software: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instrumental&#x2F;9d9cee6e-a0b2-4484-8171-785aa38ab682" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;instrumental&#x2F;9d9cee6e-a0b2-4484-8171-7...</a><p>- and others at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instrumental.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instrumental.com&#x2F;careers</a>')
