Even these schools now require some publications, which is where the predatory journals come in.  Schools where research is supposed to be part of your job will have a list of journals that count, and they may have a point system.  Better schools have shorter lists.  This is enforced at the dean level, since deans don&#x27;t have the expertise to evaluate individual papers.  Here predatory journals won&#x27;t help you.')
