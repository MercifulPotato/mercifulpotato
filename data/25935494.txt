The #1 and easiest change is for the government to just pass a law mandating reference based pricing. This is not M4A, the government just says you can&#x27;t charge more than Medicare plus 20% (e.g.) and cash gets your Medicare flat. This gets rid of brokers, negotiations, out of network and any of the other nonsense. Probably removes 20% of the national healthcare spend. The other changes are straightforward too and again require no new taxes and are not single payer.')
