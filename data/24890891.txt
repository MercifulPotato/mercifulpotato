To feel immediacy, latency must be less than about 50ms, ideally less than 30ms.  However we are capable of dealing with latency up to around 1s without wincing too much and even half duplex can work some times.<p>However, that is for one on one conversations.  Unless everyone has reasonably decent comms (10 people, with video: roughly 10Mbs-1 each way at about 10ms to ISP router) then drop to voice only.  You only need 64Kbs-1 for a high quality voice channel.  Mobile quality is about 16Kbs-1.  The killer is latency and the related jitter.<p>I spend quite a lot of time twiddling various parameters to get voice comms to work as well as I can.  Latency is the biggest contributor to quality.')
