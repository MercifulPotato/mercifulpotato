I have kidney failure but when being diagnosed they presumed it was likely due to NSAIDs but the real reason was finally autoimmune disease. I think they say long term use of NSAIDs is not good for kidneys. For me NSAIDs are entirely excluded. But my nephrologist say Tylenol is fine for long term if I stay within limits. Fortunately I&#x27;ve not had to use it often. And I don&#x27;t take OTC medicines now without doctor review.')
