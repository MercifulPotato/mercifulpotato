I use the internet on N devices for probably 12h a day and I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m worth even a positive amount anywhere.<p>I max out free tiers of OneDrive&#x2F;DropBox etc, use my free minutes of build time at the dev sites, I use some social media features but I browse Twitter and reddit on custom apps that don&#x27;t show any ads. I never ever click an ad in an article or search no matter how interesting or relevant.<p>So if since I&#x27;m  a net loss, that means that for everyone who is like me, there has to be someone who is an even larger gain for these companies.  I have all of those services (Google, fb, twitter) and I&#x27;m still pretty sure I provide a negative revenue for all of them. So Someone needs to provide the revenue I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a scary amount. My internet activity is subsidized by someone who must be doing a <i>scary</i> amount of clicking on the sponsored google results, or something.')
