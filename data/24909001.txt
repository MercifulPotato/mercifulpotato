Streamlet is (essentially) in the same setting as paxos. Just like in paxos, messages can take arbitrarily long to deliver.<p>The only assumption is that <i>clocks</i> are synchronized, which is much, much weaker. (We can actually remove even this assumption. But it&#x27;s easier to think about this way.)<p>i.e. I think it&#x27;s monday at the same time you think it&#x27;s monday, or I think it&#x27;s epoch 1 at the same time you think it&#x27;s epoch 1. or my quartz crystal oscillates at the same rate as your quartz crystal. Importantly, a message sent during epoch 1 might arrive in epoch 3, or never at all.<p>Paxos is also in the partially synchronous setting - it requires some network synchrony in order to terminate, just like streamlet (For truly asynchronous protocols, there&#x27;s a whole, complicated literature).')
