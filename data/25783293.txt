They are very insightful. To piggyback a bit:<p>Assuming you are a competent data &quot;analyst&quot; who wants to become a data engineer, how would you go about it? Is &quot;go back to school and get a CS degree&quot; the answer? I suppose this question is very broad, but I am curious if a practitioner like you has an opinion.<p>---<p>To give some context:<p>I recently graduated with a STEM PhD, and looking to move into data science. Reading the comments, I feel like I fall into the &quot;pointless data scientist&quot; cohort derided in this thread. Eg: I am very comfortable doing typical analytical work &amp; occasionally training models inside a notebook, but I am neither a cutting-edge theoretical statistician nor a data engineer.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to improve on the engineering side. For example, I did a project recently where I set up a rudimentary pipeline that continuously pings an API, uploads the data to a cloud database, then serves up the analysis via a Flask app. For me this was a big step up from just doing notebooks on a csv file :)<p>But moving beyond the basics, I am not sure what to study next. Hence my question. If you have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it!')
