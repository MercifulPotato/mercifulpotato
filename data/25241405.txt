Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=[25242065], score=None, time=1606605431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237545, text='&gt; What makes Mishima so dangerous today is that he produced beautiful art and culture from which the downstream political conclusions were unavoidable.<p>This is strange to me. I can see a line between the kind of characters young Mishima constructed (extremely perceptive in limited ways, weird, [sometimes literally] impotent, and prone to mixing shame and violence and adoration) and the pretty basic understanding I have of the political ideas of the older Mishima. But the political ideas hardly seem &quot;unavoidable&quot;. It&#x27;s certainly plausible to me that somebody (apparently) traumatized by childhood weakness and confused identity would take up right-wing politics. It&#x27;s also plausible to me that they would take up bodybuilding (check), realize that physical strength wasn&#x27;t totally the problem (not check?), and, I dunno, go see a therapist or something.<p>I guess I see the eventual politics as one natural way all that could have played out. But to me the root themes of Mishima&#x27;s work aren&#x27;t intrinsically political. This may also be biased because I&#x27;ve only read <i>Confessions of a Mask</i> and <i>The Temple of the Golden Pavilion</i>, which Wikipedia tells me pre-date his political writings, in the former case by quite a while.')
