Or is it limited to people that your partner banks &quot;want&quot; to deal with?<p>I&#x27;m thinking about the unbanked and others that financial institutions tend to not want to deal with.  Living in a large city, I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people that use gift cards, transit cards, etc as their &quot;bank&quot; because bank services are unavailable or the fee structure is too onerous.  Or, for example, someone that has been in prison for financial crimes and needs a way to rehabilitate back into society.<p>Thanks!')
