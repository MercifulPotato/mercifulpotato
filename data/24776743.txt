However, please know that the service they offer goes against our T&amp;Cs and due to this violation, the app has been taken down. \n\n  If you want to transmit your personal data to another service, we can help you request to receive a copy of that data and give it the other service.\n\n  Due to the large size and complexity of the data retrieval, you will receive your personal data in three separate packages. \n\n  First, you will receive a ZIP file with a copy of most of your personal data via our Download your data function, after you verify your request in the confirmation email sent to your registered email account to ensure secure delivery. \n\n  This download will include information about your playlists, streaming history, searches, a list of items saved in Your Library, the number of followers you have, the number of accounts you follow, the names of the artists you follow, and your payment and subscription data. For more detailed information about what is included in each file of your download, please see Understanding My Data. \n\n  The second data package will include the technical log information of your account that we collect to provide and troubleshoot the Spotify service. The data description is provided in the Read Me file together with the data.  \n\n  Finally, the third data package will include your entire listening history for the life of your account. Each of the above data packages will be made available to you as soon as they become ready in the coming weeks.\n\n  You can request for the first data package via the Privacy Settings section of your account page. If you want the 2nd and 3rd data package, please let me know your username so we can help you request for these data. \n\n  I hope this email clarifies. Let me know if we can help you with anything else.\n</code></pre>\nAnd I replied with:<p><pre><code>  Regrettably, your answer didn&#x27;t clarify anything at all. In fact, it seems that you are ignoring the substance of my previous two messages.\n\n  If you have not already done so, I strongly advise you to forward this email conversation to your legal department. I will not hesitate to file a complaint (verzoekschriftprocedure) at the Dutch civil court (Rechtbank Midden-Nederland) if you do not allow me to exercise my rights under the law.\n\n  The process you are describing would fall under GDPR article 20 subsection 1. However, my previous demand isn&#x27;t about those rights. Instead, I want to exercise my rights under GDPR article 20 subsection 2 to transfer my data directly from controller to controller, for example (but not limited) to SongShift, when you have specifically shown that it is technically possible.\n\n  GDPR article 20 subsection 2 is Dutch and European law. You cannot overrule the law with your terms and conditions. You have an obligation to me, a Dutch citizen, to allow me to transfer my data to another controller when technically feasible. Your message tells me that you are refusing to do so.\n\n  I demand, again, that you re-enable the API or allow for some other method to allow me to exercise my rights under the GDPR, so I can transfer my personal data directly from Spotify to another controller such as (but not limited to) SongShift.\n\n  Seeing how you responded the previous two times with unsubstantive answers, I&#x27;m giving you 3 days to respond substantively. If you promise to provide me a timeline about when and how I can exercise my rights under the GDPR or otherwise want a delay, I will give you an additional 10 days.\n\n  If you do not respond or offer no solution, I will send a registered letter (aangetekende brief) to your Dutch offices in Amsterdam with a last warning before starting the verzoekschriftprocedure. Note that I will be hiring a lawyer to draft this letter, and will thus be incurring costs, which I will recover from you as damages.</code></pre>')
