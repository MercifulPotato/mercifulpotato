Fender has really ramped up their mail order and online business plus customer service. So why should I go into GC where the available model choices are slim, or they have floor models that have been flogged to death with &#x27;Stairway to Heaven&#x27; when I can order exactly what I want right off the production line at Fender and get it delivered to my door and can return it if there&#x27;s any issues?')
