I wanted to add an external CD-ROM to it so I could play games and load software for college, and it had a SCSI port. I went to the local computer store and asked the guy for a &quot;ess see ess eye&quot; CD-ROM drive, he busted out laughing and said &quot;oh you mean a scuzzy drive?&quot; Very embarrassing for me at the time but that&#x27;s when I learned that computer acronyms have a preferred pronunciation so I should try to learn them myself to avoid future confusion.')
