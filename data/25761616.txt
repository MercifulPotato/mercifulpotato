Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25763156], score=None, time=1610544047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761225, text='I did think of working for a FAANG, but they don&#x27;t really do much in my corner of Europe (there&#x27;s a group working on Docs and similar in Germany but I don&#x27;t want to move to Germany), and they are scary in that they seem to aim for the university high-achievers. I don&#x27;t want to have to learn leetcode for a job interview, knowing full well that leetcode is not the day job there either.<p>Plus I like being (or ok, feeling) productive, instead of spending 99% of my time on politics, analysis and waiting for small code changes.')
