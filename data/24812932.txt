One of the screen hinges is broken, I&#x27;ve replaced numerous keys, the keyboard is now developing some debounce&#x2F;key registration issue all over the right-hand side, the speakers are both blown (left first then the right), the trackpad sits 0.5cm above the case (needs replaced), the glue holding the rubber to the bottom of the case expanded with heat and leaked out everywhere. Probably more I&#x27;ve forgotten<p>I&#x27;d still consider buying another, but I&#x27;d also strongly consider changing vendors once this machine finally dies')
