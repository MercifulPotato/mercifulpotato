Fines need to be big for big corporations if they are to pose a risk worth avoiding.<p>&gt; Do they go to the users impacted - nope.<p>As with any fine, it goes to government, which means that same expenditure requires less taxes. So it gets shared among all french population. Which is a good proxy for “users impacted by google cookies in France”.<p>&gt; Do changes happen as a result - slowly if at all.<p>So if 2 companies are fined for not complying with a law, the problem is that the law is overly punishing &#x2F; fining does not work? It would seem the other way, that the fine risk was not big enough!<p>&gt;  who ends up paying for it...the users&#x2F;people..again.<p>Which are also the ones that receive the money, through their government.')
