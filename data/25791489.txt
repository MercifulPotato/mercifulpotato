CPUs have stagnated massively.<p>Intel CPUs still give 16 PCI lanes on the consumer chips, despite any modern graphics card using that entirely.<p>(Meaning your nvme drives all compete somewhat).<p>Compared to phones which have real, huge, generational improvements every couple of years which is sometimes jarring.<p>However, this is different.<p>AMDs previous Ryzen laptop line performed incredibly well, both in power consumption (which equates to battery life) and thermal envelope (which, also equates to battery life) while also delivering jaw dropping performance.<p>I am a “devops” and farm out a lot of compute to the cloud, but that comes at a cost (iteration times, price, bandwidth, not all flows can be remote). And gaming does too (stadia has mixed results- though I am a fan).<p>I would posit that your workflow has become remote likely _because_ of this stagnation.')
