Item(by='dvtrn', descendants=None, kids=[25306328], score=None, time=1607107909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306102, text='<i>It still seems reasonable to fire anyone who sends such a message to their colleagues rather than working through the office&#x27;s politics more quietly</i><p>Can you unpack this a bit? Several employers, past and present have encouraged employees to communicate and attempt to resolve conflicts (presumably, maybe ostensibly, giving them opportunities to work it out as adults and professionals) amongst employees first as the first actionable steps. In fact, current employer has this as a point of policy for interpersonal conflicts barring severe enough circumstances where a reasonable person would say &quot;yes this requires intervention from on high&quot;.<p>That said, why should it be any different in a situation such as this? I feel there may be context to your suggestion that isn&#x27;t fully stated here-as to why it&#x27;s reasonable to fire someone over this. Maybe there are implied parameters of just how egregious a situation has to be in your opinion that I didn&#x27;t intimately tune into?<p>To me the final sentence reads as a continuation of the hypothetical the author is asking the reader to consider, as a metaphor for the treatment she experienced, not a direct <i>j&#x27;accuse</i> to the reader&#x2F;recipient.')
