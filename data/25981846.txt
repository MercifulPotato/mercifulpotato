Item(by='csydas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612122156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980021, text='yeah, I realized I maybe misread your statement, so that&#x27;s why I edited it.<p>&gt;I wonder if a solution is to let them add their feature to your software (like browser addons)?<p>In fact we have a powershell integration and RESTAPI they can develop on. But the simple fact is that a lot of these users don&#x27;t want it, they want it baked into the product core functionality since we don&#x27;t personally support such custom projects. We offer that we will validate that all the endpoints work correctly, but that&#x27;s it, and for medium larger businesses, this typically is a &quot;no go&quot;. It&#x27;s either baked in feature, or it&#x27;s not a feature.<p>Even for the smaller &quot;power users&quot;, most of the time they don&#x27;t want to take the time to develop the functionality themselves (which I get, it&#x27;s time consuming to develop). But the option is there, just not utilized.')
