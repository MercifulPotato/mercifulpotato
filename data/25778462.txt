Of the 704 participants with positive FIT results, 165 had advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACRN) and 539 had no ACRN (FP results). Of the 1303 participants with hemorrhoids, 291 showed FP results, of whom 81 showed FP results because of hemorrhoids only. Participants with hemorrhoids had a higher rate of FP results than those without hemorrhoids (291&#x2F;1176, 24.7% vs. 248&#x2F;2361, 10.5%; p&lt;0.001). Additionally, the participants with hemorrhoids as the only abnormality had a higher rate of FP results than those experiencing no such abnormalities (81&#x2F;531, 15.3% vs. 38&#x2F;1173, 3.2%; p&lt;0.001).<p>The discussion section (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5122631&#x2F;#__sec16title" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5122631&#x2F;#__sec1...</a>) has more, particularly some conflicting results with past studies.<p>Also, everything is different for a patient than a population. If a patient has reasonable expectations (ie, that a positive result could easily be false, and is nowhere near conclusive), <i>and</i> they would otherwise obtain a colonoscopy rather than putting it off, then by far the bigger concern is false negatives. That is, if you can take a FIT (or two a few months apart) and skip a colonoscopy based on negative results, the false positive rate doesn&#x27;t matter much - you&#x27;re replacing something annoying with something not at all annoying. I couldn&#x27;t find any good studies of false negatives.<p>After reading this stuff, the one thing I wouldn&#x27;t do is completely replace colonoscopies in favor of FIT.')
