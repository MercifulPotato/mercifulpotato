Has built maybe six. So consequently I get involved.  I’m not very impressed.  The prices are extremely rich on everything.  There is an extreme social media marketing bs around everything. But the worst part for me is the PCB boards are mostly all coming from kbd fans (apparently one of the better makers) and their technical support is awful. Two different boards have developed problems which I’ve gone to great lengths to debug. The assistance from kbd is awful.  Basically their answer was “here is a 12$ coupon, just buy a new $39 pcb”.<p>And before fan boys attack me, both keyboards worked for a while and then developed problems. In the dz60 case somehow the cascading comm channel of the RGB stopped working.  In the kbd67, far right column quit responding even though I trace the continuity to the atmel microprocessor.<p>Cannot find a schematic for the kbd67 so I’m reduced to buying another so I can compare the circuits....<p>Another dislike is that full size keyboards are scorned and generally unavailable.  Hey check it out, I’m a full sized adult doing full size job with my pc, so I actually do use the number pad, etc.<p>Overall bad value for money and too much social posing.')
