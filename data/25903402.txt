The social welfare eventually suggests a different system for such people: pay the rent for them and give a special card that can be used for anything except alcohol and cigarette. If the people keep refusing that other option, then they went homeless on their own accord and keep spending the welfare on alcohol and living on the streets. Such people are very rare in Finland in reality however, but they do exist.<p>There is also one woman [1] who for whatever reason chooses to live homeless with bunch of luggage. She doesn&#x27;t drink at all, and keeps moving from town to town with all her luggage, by walking.<p>Here&#x27;s also a discussion about the Roma beggars you see in Helsinki streets.

It also has problem of artificially inflating housing and rent prices. Especially in the capital where most career opportunities are. (Helsinki is very expensive place to live)')
