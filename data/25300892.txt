Item(by='Philip-J-Fry', descendants=None, kids=[25301909, 25301069], score=None, time=1607077911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300449, text='No, and conveniently they say they can&#x27;t confirm or deny it was them because the original monolith was installed illegally.<p>But it seems like the site is more of a community. Not really a team doing these stunts. So anyone can do a stunt, join the community and then claim it was this community which did it.<p>I&#x27;m sceptical though, because the other stunts on that site are very in your face stunts. That monolith was very much not that since it was installed in 2016 based on satellite imagery, and discovered in 2020. Perhaps the artist joined this community recently so they can imply responsibility under this group. Or perhaps they are just trying to make a quick buck.')
