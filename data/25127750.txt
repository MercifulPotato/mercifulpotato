In San Jose a normally busy clean commercial street was boarded up on every store front with graffiti on most boards(BLM riots&#x2F;protests). Trash was everywhere. Everyone was wearing masks. In NYC in April mobile morgue trucks flooded the city as the dead exceeded the capacity of the city&#x27;s morgues. Drive by some parking lots and see hundreds of cars waiting to get covid tests. During the spring many stores in major metro areas ran out of basic supplies like paper towels&#x2F;tiolet paper, cleaners, meat. A friend of mine had to wait 3 hours to get toilet paper at a target(3&#x2F;20). In Italy and Europe busy tourist areas were empty and soldiers were patrolling the plazas with rifles. This stuff is like nothing I have ever seen in my life and my parents and grandparents lives as well.')
