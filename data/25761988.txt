I would class the Daily Mail (alternatively known as the Daily Heil) as extremely right wing, their editorial slant appears to be designed to drag the Overton window as far to the right as possible by outraging middle England about Muslims, refugees and house prices. I also wouldn&#x27;t call the Guardian even vaguely left wing any more, given their relentless campaigning against Jeremy Corbyn and backchannels with the &quot;Blue Labour&quot; crowd. Sure, it&#x27;s left of most of the British press, but then again Dutarte is left of most of the British press.<p>On TV, I&#x27;d say Sky News isn&#x27;t _that_ far off Fox. Extremely selective on their guests and very partisan in their correspondents.')
