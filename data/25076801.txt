Keeping tabs is a signal from the user about which entries were useful.  A form of curation.  Without that signal, what is there?<p>However, I think bookmarks would be profoundly transformed from nearly useless to better than tabs by improvements to bookmark navigation, UX and a little extra context.<p>So I have to give credit to you for the idea - history navigation improvements might be transformative in a similar way.')
