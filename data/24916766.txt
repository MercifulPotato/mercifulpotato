Please use your existing Apple power adapter or add a new one before you check out.&quot;<p>Being French, I read that as &quot;does not include a charger&quot; indeed. Reading you I now realize that means only the power adapter, and not the cable.<p>I think it mostly comes down to me not being a Native English speaker I guess.<p>Oh well, I&#x27;ll know it for next time.')
