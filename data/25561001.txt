So you spend 20 years engineering a &quot;perfect&quot; payload, the costs do what they always do, and now you have a billion-dollar payload.<p>But if a launch was $2M and bookable with a month&#x27;s lead time, you&#x27;d just de-risk the whole thing by having a simple-to-build, likely-to-work payload. Or ten.<p>(This might not apply to something like the JWST specifically, since even a terrestial mirror of that size is a huge challenge. But I bet a lot of other kinds of science payloads will be built very differently a decade from now.)')
