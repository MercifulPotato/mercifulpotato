From a 2018 Forbes article, there are 8 &#x27;scientifically proven&#x27; traits[0]. I surmise that the more of these traits one exhibits, the more likely they will attain &#x27;success&#x27;, and yes, the article casts it in more nuance than simple financial success:<p>1. The ability to delay gratification<p>2. Conscientiousness<p>3. A belief in free will<p>4. Being in an open network<p>5. Childhood adversity<p>6. Avid reading<p>7. Past success<p>8. Grit<p>If we work backwards and imagine persons who have fewer of these traits, it becomes easier to imagine that they&#x27;d also be more likely to have mental disorders of increasing severity. A lack of grit and lack of conscientiousness could be signs of depressive personalities, for example. Or not believing in free will and not having an open network may stem from paranoia.<p>My takeaway is simply that social programs may want to focus more on proactive measures to address mental health of children in lower socio-economic circumstances.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;briannawiest&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;23&#x2F;8-traits-that-are-scientifically-proven-to-predict-future-success&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;briannawiest&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;23&#x2F;8-trait...</a>')
