It&#x27;s going to be a bit before it percolates through to lower price point devices, but I&#x27;m a very, very happy usb-c&#x2F;thunderbolt user.<p>My phone, headphones, drawing tablet, personal laptop, work laptop, and monitors all plug in using a single port.<p>Not just for connectivity, but also for power.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly liberating.  Everything charges from the same charger, everything plugs together.<p>I vividly remember the days of trying to find the right wall wart for the right device. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that my work laptop and personal laptop can both share chargers. That alone would make me ecstatic. That my phone&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;tablet also all work with just that charger is candy on top. That my monitor can provide that power while also using the same cable for display in? Incredible!<p>There are absolutely still issues, and it requires more research than it should, but once it works, it&#x27;s SO DAMN NICE that I simply can&#x27;t imagine going back.')
