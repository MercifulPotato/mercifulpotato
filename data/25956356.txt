If you think any broker (let alone retail) will let the client&#x27;s risk taking threaten their existence, you are deluding yourself. It&#x27;s a little bit like insurance: as long as most clients take diversified risks and don&#x27;t push the system to it&#x27;s limits, the system works. When a significant portion (majority?) of the clients all pile into an increasingly hairy position, the broker will step in and prevent the clients exacerbating the situation further.')
