But I think his criticism per se is valuable, especially his reminder that one cannot simply ignore sixty years of research.<p>EDIT: and of course he is not the only renowned scientist who calls for reflection; here is a quote from an interview with Judea Pearl: &quot;<i>AI is currently split. First, there are those who are intoxicated by the success of machine learning and deep learning and neural nets. They don’t understand what I’m talking about. They want to continue to fit curves. But when you talk to people who have done any work in AI outside statistical learning, they get it immediately. I have read several papers written in the past two months about the limitations of machine learning.</i>&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;machine-learning-is-stuck-on-asking-why&#x2F;560675&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;machi...</a>)')
