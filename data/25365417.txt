In most of the EU you&#x27;re permanent after passing the first year of employment. I&#x27;ve never worked more than 3 years in a place so far, so in the NL I would have never reached permanent status, continuously being at the risk of on the spot termination. I dunno man, sounds pretty bad for me IMHO.<p><i>&gt;And nervous breakdown is quite common culturally. </i><p>That actually sounds legit bad IMHO if mental issues are the becoming the norm in employment relationships.<p><i>&gt;The employer can protect himself by simply not hiring anyone for more than a couple of years, making &quot;flex work&quot; a real problem in NL</i><p>I used to work for a top NL based company and this situation was often discussed around the office that NL companies are abusing expat workers from poorer countries by promising them riches in exchange for hard work and sacrifice and instead using them for 2-3 years then rotating them with new workers until they get fed up with this and move back to their home countries. Rinse and repeat. Sounds really good for Dutch business though.')
