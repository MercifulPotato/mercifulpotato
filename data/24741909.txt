I&#x27;ve found they typically don&#x27;t have the best prices anymore and many of my tastes have changed over the years.<p>They are still super useful to find those hard to get parts that would typically be impossible to find locally or at least very expensive. Like a carburetor for a chainsaw or a part for an appliance, bearings for a hood fan motor, monitor arm, etc.<p>A lot of retailers have picked up their game when it comes to online shopping. Places like rockauto.com for auto parts are super competitive and offer a massive inventory (what a great acquisition it would be for AMZN to break into the auto parts sector). Newegg&#x2F;MicroCenter for PC parts, Costco, etc.<p>But over all I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had to return anything and my experience over the last 20 years has been a positive one.')
