So the clinics would convince their customers that they needed major dental work, then would do the work and bill the government. The clinics were totally specialized just for this.<p>&quot;Frontline&quot; pinned the blame on the clinics, sort of &quot;how could the do that&quot;. Of course, they&#x27;re right. But blaming the clinics doesn&#x27;t work, because the actual problem was the government set things up so that the rise of clinics to exploit the rules was legal and inevitable.<p>You&#x27;re now faced with the problem of crafting a bureaucratic rule to define a &quot;necessary&quot; major dental operation. Of course, it&#x27;s impossible, and the same problem as &quot;management by metrics&quot;.')
