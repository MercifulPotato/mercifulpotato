Is the pay scale there just completely inflated for non-tech jobs due to the tech jobs and if not, where do the policemen, teachers, cleaners and so forth live? I can&#x27;t imagine them earning a salary in which paying 3000$ per month is sustainable? Where do all people with &quot;normal&quot; jobs live?')
