The founder of WEF has wrote a book about this and there is even a podcast. Basically, they are mentally preparing policy makers and their citizen(-slaves) for much a much lower quality of living, with the blame on covid (not the bad policy the WEF attendees have pushed in their respective countries...how convenient).<p>Case in point - the WEF tweeted a (now deleted) video about 8 predictions for 2030. The first is: &quot;You will own nothing. And you&#x27;ll be happy&quot;[1]. My questions - who does the &quot;owning&quot; and does this apply to the &quot;elites&quot; that attend Davos?<p>I am not one for conspiracy theories, but this is not a conspiracy anymore. The &quot;elites&quot; don&#x27;t even hide their intentions.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weforum.org&#x2F;great-reset&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weforum.org&#x2F;great-reset&#x2F;</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;conspiracy&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jio3r3&#x2F;youll_own_nothing_and_youll_be_happy_the_great&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;conspiracy&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jio3r3&#x2F;youll_ow...</a>')
