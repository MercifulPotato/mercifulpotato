That is, when it isn&#x27;t a classic rock (The Doors and Warrant) or &quot;new&quot; classic rock (RHCP and Linkin Park) station that some gas station or family-friendly bar&#x2F;grill least-common-denomitored their way to putting on the speakers.<p>My Mom is the only person I know who admits to liking them. We tried to get her Spotify but she wasn&#x27;t interested.<p>One day, very soon, the Imagine Dragons will be considered classic rock, but commercial radio will have long bit the dust and there won&#x27;t be any classic rock stations left to call them it.')
