I used to love sitting down at the keyboard and churning out code on a project I was excited about. Slowly but surely I started programming less and was not as excited about jumping into projects as I used to be.<p>For me, the problem was Alcohol. I was drinking more alcohol than I ever had in the past and it, for some reason I do not know, was causing me to not find the some enjoyment in things especially programming.<p>So, I realized this and stopped drinking alcohol and I have now been working on projects non stop in my free time and am enjoying programming as much as I ever had.<p>In all, I would say don&#x27;t be too hard on yourself. You are still the same person that loved programming. I think you need to take a step back and see what else in your life has changed.')
