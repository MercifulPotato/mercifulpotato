It always ends up one way: rage-quiting at 3am on a work night never to watch another episode. All due to the fact that usually the episode boundaries are placed in the most suspenseful places.<p>However, shows like ST:NG or Stargate SG-1 I enjoyed completely. I&#x27;d watch one or two episodes at a time and leave feeling good.')
