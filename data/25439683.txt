USA: development base established from colonial direction, then exploitation &#x2F; slavery, not actually democratic when considering timeline of enfranchisement. Ability to exploit labour is central to initial growth. Canada: base built by colonial direction &#x2F; crown corps. Post War Germany &amp; UK: again, base established under monarchy, post war destruction is just a hiccup in terms of actual development continuity. Marshall plan was a reconstruction &quot;1up&quot; for rebuilding industrial base, but physical capital is the easy part. The hard part, the _initial_ pool of human capita that takes generations cultivate has not so far manifested under democracies which seems systemically incapable of coordinating long term generational projects. Part of that is the conditions for development is predicated on the ugly business of &quot;solving ethnic and sub-national conflicts&quot; including groups that operate contrary to state development interests, like these unions. Authoritarians &#x2F; state controls simply is better at starting the ball rolling. On paper it doesn&#x27;t have to, but there aren&#x27;t counter examples, so India is pioneering. They may very well succeed, but cards are stacked.<p>As for democracies working in the long run, modern democracies has not existed long enough for these dogmatic believes to hold true. The irony of your quote from wiki is that it&#x27;s from WEF&#x2F;Davos, embodiment of problems undermining democracies today. IMO current democracies thrived because US has overwhelming geopolitical advantage, multiplied post war when continental competitors got glassed and had the ability to suppress non-democracies - the wank around democratic development and democratic peace&quot; exists because preeminent superpower happens to be democratic and made war with ideologic rivals while handwaving away the contribution of their authoritarian roots. That said, I broadly believe those &quot;virtuous&quot; democratic concepts are true and something to work towards, when the time is right. I think too many Davos&#x2F;liberal democracy enthusiasts forget that &quot;end of history&quot; still started from somewhere, and historically that somewhere is authoritarianism. It&#x27;s also just useful to evaluate most recent successful development models: Japan, S.Korea, Taiwan and really the only comparable analogue, China.')
