If people only used it as a currency, not as a speculative &quot;investment&quot;, the price would be orders of magnitude lower.<p>Stocks are much &quot;safer&quot; because the intrinsic value is often similar to the market price.<p>Gold and some stocks (Tesla) are somewhere in between. They have intrinsic value but people also buy it speculatively so the price is way higher than the intrinsic value.')
