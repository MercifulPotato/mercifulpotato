Amazon, Facebook, and Google have L6 as the second level of management. (Facebook sometimes uses the &quot;L&quot; indicator, and M1 is L6). There is no company where &quot;L6&quot; means upper management.<p>&gt; Historically, the org levels pull from military enlisted&#x2F;officer E1-7 vs O1-7 splits so actually would lean towards our definition more.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s reason to believe this. Google, for example, doesn&#x27;t have a split. Nor does Amazon. Facebook does, but it only resembles the military rankings by coincidence, since it likely took more from Google&#x27;s leveling system originally (and afaik there are still leftovers from that).<p>To the main point, while the compensation methodologies work differently at every company, I expect that the &quot;rising tide&quot; effect is always present.')
