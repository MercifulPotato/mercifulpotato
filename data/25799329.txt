This part, in particular, resonated with me:<p>&gt; Querying data is a little harder. Apacheâ€™s Cassandra uses Cassandra Query Language or CQL which, interestingly, does not allow for joins. MongoDB just sends JSON objects in reaction to requests. Need all users in Ohio? MongoDB sends a big chunk of data.<p>I fondly recall the late night debates with fellow colleagues in the industry, several years ago, when we were pitching a database design to a startup bank in South Africa.<p>Back then during those fights some even suggested that the NoSQL vs <i>Yes</i>SQL debate was a religious war - much like vi vs emacs - but in the case of data storage it quickly became obvious that each philosophy had its respective strengths and weaknesses - which were in turn easy to understand, to sell, and to add value with.<p>But nowadays I must confess I do not know of many shops using NoSQL, and I suspect it is for the reasons quoted from the blog post that I shared above.<p>I would love to read your insight if you&#x27;ve been part of a big NoSQL deployment. We struggled to sell it, so I suspect we must have missed out on some interesting opportunities.')
