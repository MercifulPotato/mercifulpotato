They wanted our class to all memorize Wilfred Owen&#x27;s poem &quot;Dulce Et Decorum Est&quot;. I couldn&#x27;t do it, got terrible marks in that class. But the Latin phrase itself sticks in your head.<p>Wilfred Owen did not live to see the end of that war.<p>It was at first astonishing to me that the same words are etched into the Arlington cemetery amphitheatre, but of course that&#x27;s almost why Owen refers to them. At the time the building was constructed it would have been the thing to do - to portray death in war as a noble sacrifice.<p>Owen&#x27;s point is that there&#x27;s nothing noble about choking to death in a fog of gas, of so many dying so far from home, war is not noble or patriotic, it&#x27;s horrible.')
