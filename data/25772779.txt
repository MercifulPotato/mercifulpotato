Thanks for ruining a company for the countless others who were staying there, regardless of your experience, because they believed in what they were doing, and working towards their own personal goals.  I don&#x27;t know the details, but I know if someone did that to a company that I was invested in, I would be devastated.<p>Please go away, never to return.  Go be a bartender or some other profession where being an asshole will get you ahead.  Leave software to people who still care about ethics and have empathy for customers and coworkers.')
