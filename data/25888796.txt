Because if it was one city then they could iron out all the edge cases there.  And even with all the places it&#x27;s deployed now, it is starting to get close.<p>But personally I think that Waymo is going to be a bit safer because it has the LIDAR which even if you don&#x27;t think that matters, it can definitely see farther because of its position above the car.<p>And I think that Waymo will be deployed in several cities by the end of 2021 or 2022 at least. And I think it&#x27;s great to have competition.  Cruise will also probably be able to deploy.<p>But Tesla probably will force them to build systems that require less stringent mapping so they can add cities quickly.')
