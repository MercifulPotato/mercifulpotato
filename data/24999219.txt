Similarly, once I get to around 1000 lines of python code, I&#x27;m better off switching to compiled, statically typed language (e.g., Java, C, C++, etc.).<p>So my own heuristic has become:<p><pre><code>    shell script when &lt; 100 lines of script\n    python code when &lt; 1000 lines of code\n    else statically typed, compiled language</code></pre>')
