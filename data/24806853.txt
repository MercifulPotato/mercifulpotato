And how does &quot;blame&quot; enter the picture at all? Developers went into it with their eyes open. That&#x27;s not shaming or blaming them, there simply is no &quot;blame&quot; to be had. They made something and decided to give it away with few&#x2F;no strings attached. There&#x27;s decades of precedent for such projects being used to great financial profit by millions of people, so I don&#x27;t find it plausible that most developers aren&#x27;t fully aware of what they&#x27;re doing. In fact I&#x27;d argue many want exactly this to happen. To develop something that proves incredibly useful and gets adopted by many users.<p>If someone did inadvertently choose a more permissive license than intended, I&#x27;m not sure what to say. &quot;Blaming&quot; them has too negative a connotation, but there is some <i>responsibility</i> on their part for the mistake, though I can sympathize with them given that licensing choice can be complex.<p>There&#x27;s a catch 22 with choosing a restrictive license though. On the one hand it may help you monetize a product if it becomes popular, but on the other hand it becomes a lot harder to gain users and achieve that level of popularity.<p>However I acknowledge that the open source ecosystem and incentives have deep seated problems on this. The rise of networked society is in many ways built on such work, so there is a public good achieved that might never have been possible otherwise. On the other hand, maintaining a project can be thankless and exhausting. There&#x27;s been plenty of discussions on how to help this situation, with no clear answer that I&#x27;m aware of. I certainly don&#x27;t have one.')
