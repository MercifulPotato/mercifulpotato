Ask (“Can I give you some feedback?”)\n&gt; 2. State the behavior (“When you X…”)<p>Yes, please do this when giving feedback<p>&gt; 3. State the impact (“…the result is Y.”)<p>Your conversation partner might hear an immediate accusation out of this. Your statement will never be objective. Rather talk about yourself as in &quot;... this is how I perceive your behavior&quot;.<p>&gt; 4. Encourage effective future behavior (“Keep it up!” for positive feedback ...)<p>Yes, it&#x27;s great to get positively reinforced.<p>&gt; “Can you change that?” for negative feedback<p>If you do this to me after 5 seconds of conversation, I will shut off and not take any advice from you. This is bossy.<p>Tell your conversation partner what their behavior makes you feel like. Formulate a wish for the future. You&#x27;re not entitled to &quot;change&quot; people. Tell them how you would like to be treated.<p>If you want to change people, then give them positive reinforcement. If you try to &quot;change&quot; others by negative feedback, they will likely do less of everything and try not to be caught doing anything because it might be the &quot;wrong thing&quot;.<p>edit: formatting')
