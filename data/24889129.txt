Marginal costs are nearly zero as the major expense is likely fixed (crawling and indexing the internet) while variable costs are a small percentage (serving search results for each request).<p>Google, like Nike, Gucci, and Procter &amp; Gamble, has spent billions to build their brand perception and cement the habit of using their products despite there often being minimal actual differences between competitive products.<p>But the critical one really does seem to be attracting new users.  The history of DDG, ClickZ, Bing all seem to validate this.  Just getting a user to _try_ a new search engine is very difficult despite it being &quot;one click away.&quot;  Certainly a deal with a browser maker &#x2F; mobile manufacturer would aid this but it&#x27;s priced amazingly out of the reach of competitors denying perhaps the most obvious way to get trials and traffic.<p>Google clearly knows this.  How can it be true that switching is so easy (&quot;just a click away&quot;) as to suggest that being the default is meaningless, and yet pay &gt;$8 billion a year to be that default.')
