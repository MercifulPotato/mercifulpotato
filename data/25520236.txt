Not among scientists (they don&#x27;t really care what postmodernism says about epistemology), but among the public.  And part of this is I think deliberate.  Postmodernism put forth ideas about epistemology, and science was over there, not involved in that discussion, but reputable, delivering results using <i>science&#x27;s</i> epistemology.  The existence and success of science was a counter-argument to postmodernism&#x27;s epistemological claims.  So (at least parts of) postmodernism attacked science, and science&#x27;s claims of knowing objective reality.')
