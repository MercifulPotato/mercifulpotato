Satire takes a commonly held belief and exaggerates it to the point where problems are easily visible. How is that happening here?<p>I can almost see it in the &quot;six hours&quot; part, which I think is the weakest part of the essay, but it doesn&#x27;t fit because the usual motivation for long hours and hard questions is not the negging&#x2F;hazing  explanation here, but because you want multiple perspectives on the candidate and because you want to establish the candidate&#x27;s limits. It&#x27;s useful to know the difference between &quot;Candidate is good enough to work here&quot; and &quot;Candidate is insanely talented&quot;. The only way to get that is by asking questions that differentiate between good enough and insanely talented.<p>Other than that aspect, the essay seemed straightforward. It seems true that it would be hard to make the questions the author asks and easy to fake &quot;Tell me about a time you took initiative&quot; style questions.<p>I think the interview described here seems challenging and designed to hire quick thinking hackers, but it doesn&#x27;t seem absurd or obviously wrong or terribly flawed as I would expect from a satirical piece.')
