If that&#x27;s your job, you have no excuses not learning command lines and all the other stuff.<p>This, I think, is more intended for people who are not really programmers, but would like to write a bit of logic, and find themselves with tools intended for professionals.<p>Because I am an experienced programmer now, I may be biased but I have a feeling we raised the barrier to entry for programming. The author mentions Excel, that still exists and us used all over the world by non-programmers to write terrible macros. But I am also thinking about Visual Basic, a lot of stuff by Borland (thinking about Delphi). DOS even shipped with Basic IDE.<p>As a general rule, I consider all &quot;don&#x27;t be lazy&quot; arguments wrong. Machines are meant to work for us, not the other way around. The only ones who shouldn&#x27;t be lazy are those who write the tools, so that users can be if they want to.')
