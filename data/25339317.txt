When you combine that with Apple&#x27;s margin and taxes, it&#x27;s a <i>really</i> tight margin I found (even at 6.99$&#x2F;month). If rerouted traffic could be much, much cheaper there could be a business there -- but there&#x27;s always a threat Apple will just copy those features. I did get some paying customers though who really liked it.<p>There&#x27;s also whitelisting on iOS, might that be enough for your use case? Otherwise there are plenty of blacklist&#x2F;blocking services.')
