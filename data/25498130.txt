Had an ultrasound done and a BUNCH of labs.  $500 copay for the whole visit and insurance eats the rest - regardless of where I am on my deductible.<p>I&#x27;d had the exact same ultrasound done &quot;routinely&quot; 2 days prior, at the same hospital, and similar lab the week before..  I had to pay about $1,300 for the privilege because that all falls to my deductible.  (Insurance paid nothing)<p>So it cost <i>me</i> almost 3x as much to go during the day than it costs during the ER - but my insurance paid out about 6x as much for the ER visit.  I wonder how many &quot;ER Abusers&quot; have figured out it&#x27;s actually cheaper for THEM to go to the ER than &quot;normal doctors&quot;?')
