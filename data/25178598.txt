My UK estate agent is trying to get me to use an American signature service to renew my lease.<p>- What I get is an email from a third party (the signature service) with whom I have no business relationship.  Why would I trust <i>anything</i> they say?<p>- How do I know the agent has signed the lease?<p>- What can I do if the American service claims I signed a contract when I didn&#x27;t?  If I sign even a single contract with them I&#x27;m effectively giving them power of attorney to accept any contract on my behalf.<p>- Anyone who gains access to my email can enter contracts on my behalf.<p>It&#x27;s mad.<p>The point of signing a contract in each other&#x27;s presence is that both parties understand they are agreeing to something, and both have no doubt that the other is also entering the agreement.  Online signature services do not achieve this.<p>And finally, PKI is worse.  I won&#x27;t rehearse the arguments.  Read Ross Anderson.')
