Like it or not, getting a job is a lot like a sales process, and you can&#x27;t close every deal. Putting all of your chips in one basket is a recipe for disappointment.<p>Regardless, about 1&#x2F;3 of them fall in love with a specific job posting and lose a lot of time assuming their first choice will work out.<p>Everyone should treat the interviewing process like a numbers game. Apply to many companies. Don&#x27;t get into a position where a single company decided to pass on you will destroy your finances or make it difficult to put food on the table. Don&#x27;t become emotionally attached to companies before you&#x27;ve been hired.')
