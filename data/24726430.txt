But that would be seriously mistaken and I would totally expect employers to play hardball if employees take their benefits for granted and want to play hardball as well.<p>There are definitely environments where unions are needed and have made working conditions better but unionizing in tech where most jobs are cushy is a mistake that only puts money in the hands of union bureaucrats that don’t do anything except complicate everyone’s lives.')
