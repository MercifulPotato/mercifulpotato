So you end up with three &#x27;IT Projects&#x27; folders, in three different places. And worse, multiple copies of the same document in different places, all slightly different.<p>Sharepoint should have been able to fix all that, but somehow it just made it the same, but slower. Even after 20 years, I never know where the f__k I am in sharepoint, or when someone sends me a link to a sharepoint doc, I can open the doc, but I don&#x27;t know where the f__k the document _is_. I dont know quite why sharepoint is so confusing, I think its because it tries hard to pretend to be something other than the document store that it should so obviously be. Just when I get the hang of it, they redesign it all, and add some new front end like Delve.<p>If I join a project, something that rings alarm bells is if the Project Manager has created sixty empty folders in Sharepoint arranged into a three level hierarchy with different folders for every stage and stream of the project. Most of the time, most of the folders remain empty for the duration.<p>So yep I really like this Johnny.Decimal idea, simple and workable.')
