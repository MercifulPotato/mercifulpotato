As directed by the author here, users would store no data on these computers.1<p>1. By their nature, each user-owned supernode computer would provide some discoverable metadata, as would any router, namely, the IP addresses of the members of the private network&#x2F;s it supports and which of those IPs are connecting to each other, but this would be unlike the centralised repositories of millions of users&#x27; metadata we have now, managed by private tech companies.<p>As for the rest of this writeup, it sounds much like the need for a supernode in &quot;LAN-over-Internet&quot;-type P2P networks that encapsulate Ethernet-like packets in UDP packets.  The supernode does not necesarily need to route traffic between nodes behind NAT (rarely necessary), it only needs to store the equivalent of an ARP table accessible by all of them.')
