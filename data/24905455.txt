Create socket, call a function to send data. Bluetooth? <i>inhales</i> okay, first of all we need to know what operating system you&#x27;re on. Then we need to know what stack.. Oh you&#x27;re on Android and using the ndk? There&#x27;s a stack but we may remove it at any time. How about some FFI to java land to use our bloated wrappers with managers, personalities, and all that other good stuff? Oh you want it to work on Apple too.. And on Windows you need to choose among multiple stacks, which you may have to install yourself, if you want THAT device to work. Or THAT feature. And then things just don&#x27;t work reliably. Gotta re-pair (no pun intended). Gotta increase buffer sizes to megabytes.<p>It&#x27;s just such a mess. Just go WiFi direct or cable.')
