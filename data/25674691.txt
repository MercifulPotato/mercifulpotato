It was not the Trump administration.<p>The policy of deliberately maximizing use of the cages by maximizing family separation and using the induced psychic harm as a deterrent is a policy adopted by the Trump Administration.<p>The policy of requiring segregated detention of children, when actually detained, which caused the cages to be necessary was a judicially-imposed policy.<p>The policy of minimizing detention of children so as to minimize the use of the cages, including <i>not</i> detaining adults accompanying children without reason beyond illegal crossing, was a direct response to that judicially-imposed policy by the Obama Administration that was abandoned by the Trump Administration.<p>So, if one is using “built the cages” with the peculiar meaning you suggest of “adopted the policy for their use that is the subject of the objections”, Trump “built the cages”.')
