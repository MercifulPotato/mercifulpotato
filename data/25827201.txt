Since the availability of [PyCall.jl] and [RCall.jl], the transition to Julia can already be easier for Python&#x2F;R users.<p>I agree that most of the time <i>data wrangling</i> is super confortable in R due to the syntax flexibility exploited by the big packages (tidyverse&#x2F;data.table&#x2F;etc). At the same time, Julia and R share a bigger heritage from Lisp influence that with Python, because R is also a Lisp-ish language (see [Advanced R, Metaprogramming]). My main grip from the R ecosystem is not that most of the perfomance sensitive packages are written in C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Fortran but are written so deeply interconnect with the R environment that porting them to Julia that provide also an easy and good interface to C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Fortran (and more see [Julia Interop] repo) seems impossible for some of them.<p>I also think that Julia reach to broader scientific programming public than R, where it overlaps with Python sometimes but provides the Matlab&#x2F;Octave public with an better alternative. I don&#x27;t expected to see all the habits from those communities merge into Julia ecosystem. On the other side, I think that Julia bigger reach will avoid to fall into the &quot;base&quot; vs &quot;tidyverse&quot; vs &quot;something else in-between&quot; that R is now.<p>[PyCall.jl]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaPy&#x2F;PyCall.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaPy&#x2F;PyCall.jl</a><p>[RCall.jl]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaInterop&#x2F;RCall.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaInterop&#x2F;RCall.jl</a><p>[Julia Interop]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaInterop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaInterop</a><p>[Advanced R, Metaprogramming] by Hadley Wickham: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adv-r.hadley.nz&#x2F;metaprogramming.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adv-r.hadley.nz&#x2F;metaprogramming.html</a>')
