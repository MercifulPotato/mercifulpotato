Patient data is not the only thing being analyzed and it includes things like manufacturing, transport, etc<p>&gt; Where is this MD, MPH from Johns Hopkins wrong?<p>He&#x27;s not wrong but his worries as a clinical trial expert are a subset of the worries of an agency like the FDA. And I&#x27;m sure his workflow as clinical study expert is more fine tuned for that.<p>Or as in a developer analogy: making a code change is a 5 minute job. Actually making the change, testing, deploying, etc may take a whole day.<p>&gt; Why is the UK able to approve it over a week ago but the FDA needs longer?<p>Pfizer sent the last info to the FDA on 22th of November. The MHRA had started a rolling review and received the last batch of info they needed on the 23rd of November.<p>I am certainly frustrated with the speed as well, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much of a difference. Yes, maybe it could be faster.')
