Linux is the kernel. It is the desktop environments and the things added to them to make each distro distinct (and fat).<p>There are significantly less bloated desktop environments, but people like their bling, and bling by default includes an accompanying increase in resource consumption.<p>Look at Raspbian. It looks pretty good, but uses a lot less resources than gnome and kde. You can add to it if you <i>want</i> it to be as bloated as the typical desktop environments. But it&#x27;s a choice.<p>Personally I&#x27;m in love with tiling desktops which use even less resources yet. And they&#x27;re blazingly fast.')
