Is there a meta website that collects all of these websites? I&#x27;m interested because I would like to analyze these websites and see if I can find some heuristic or threshold for what constitutes enough impact to support the creation of such a vanity website (one of the earliest examples that I remember is heartbleed). Maybe there is some insight for me personally or, if I can find something, for a wider audience.')
