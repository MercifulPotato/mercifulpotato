It still doesn&#x27;t make legal sense - Obama&#x27;s DOJ publicly declined to charge him given the evidence, and extradition from Sweden would still have required extradition from the UK since he would&#x27;ve been serving time in both countries.<p>Assange never got charged by the US administration he actually embarassed, successfully jumped bail, waited out the clock on the rape charges, and finally got his extradition denied. It seems to me he got everything he wanted out of this - he just wasn&#x27;t careful what he wished for.')
