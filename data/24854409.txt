For a intra-building sized deployment, sure, but metropolitan tube-to-the-premises network with hundreds or thousands of endpoints per node you&#x27;d surely need automation.<p>Plus, it would be pretty simple to adapt internet routing architecture to the tube sorting machines. As long as you can embed a destination (node and endpoint) address in a barcode or NFC tag on tube ingress to act as your &quot;packet header&quot; you can leave the routing decisions to the tube sorting machines much like existing interior gateway protocols.')
