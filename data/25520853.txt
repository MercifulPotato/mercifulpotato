The work that Intel has done on Kata Containers is great. It seems like AWS, Fly.io, and others are leveraging Firecracker. AWS delivering bare metal machines has been a pretty big game changer in the cloud space.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much easier to deal with the MicroVM model would be. I think it would be great to add the additional layer of security that gVisor and Co have. There&#x27;s also benefits of being able o run a special kernel per workload. On the other hand, you do gain some complexity by having to run a separate kernel per workload, and having to inject all the sidecars (SSH, secret manager, etc..) into the VM.<p>From a performance perspective, there&#x27;s a lot of unknowns. Up until relatively recently, virtfs did not exist, so you had to carve off a block device. You can&#x27;t do things like share a page cache and dedupe inodes and dentries AFAIK with MicroVMs. Then, on top of that, there are still security boundaries we need to enforce, like network filtering. If you do this with VMs, you need to do it at the packet layer versus the connection layer, which is much more expensive. There are others...<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s a question of maturity. &quot;full blown&quot; VMs are very mature. On the other hand, containers have been maturing for upwards of a decade now. We&#x27;ll probably explore MicroVMs further in the future, but for now, Linux containers are the tool of choice.')
