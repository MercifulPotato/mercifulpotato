I didn&#x27;t hear &quot;No&quot; very often.<p>Eventually, I found myself working on software maintenance at a bank, a job I become attached to because I thought I wasn&#x27;t worth much without a degree. I worked there for 5 years.<p>In corporate, my three role models have been Wally, Costanza, and Gibbons, so I can&#x27;t say I strained myself too much. I probably spent more time entertaining myself online than proper &quot;working&quot;. I was comfortable, and for a while I thought I&#x27;d beat the system. I was certainly better off than many who struggle daily.<p>I worked on CMBS, from the flush days pre-2007, through the crisis, and into times of slow attrition and incremental cost-cutting. Eventually, I was laid off.<p>I scrambled to find another job, was fired after a month or two for regular and unrepentant tardiness, and then got another one and stayed there for about 3&#x2F;4 of a year until being laid off. I rode out six months on unemployment, also eating through my savings.<p>I realized that with five years at the bank on my resume, it will be much easier to find another job, so I did that. I went on a spree of under-a-year stints at different companies, enjoying the first month honeymoon, integration and learning phase, leaving when I became bored.<p>At this point, I could find a new job before leaving the old one, and my work was good enough that there were no hard feelings. Regardless of how long I worked somewhere, I contributed and was a net positive.<p>After getting one small raise at the bank over five years, I doubled my salary in three. I was so happy to tell my family that I broke the six figures mark, and they were proud of me.<p>It sounds good on paper, but here is the problem. Of all the different places I worked &quot;professionally&quot; in 20 years, there is maybe one or two projects that are still in use. Most of what I&#x27;d worked on is gone forever, there&#x27;s probably not a copy left anywhere. Of the systems that are still in use, they&#x27;re used by a handful of people, and will never see the &quot;light of day&quot; outside of their cellar.<p>Of all the systems I&#x27;ve worked on, I can only think of one which actually contributed something positive to the world. Most of them were basically negative karma for me.<p>I played a small part in selling unsound financial instruments, which ruined many people, and left many without a house to live in. I helped integrate advertising into webpages, which helped invade people&#x27;s privacy and reduce the quality of their Web experience. I worked on countless advertising campaigns, which amounted to helping convince my fellow humans to spend their precious resources on things which would probably harm them, like sugar delivery products and oil drilling.<p>But the worst of it was that my time was largely out of my control, under the control of someone else. Even if I did absolutely no work at the office and spent all my time browsing [redacted], I was still obligated to get up at a certain time, show up and spend the better portion of a day there, dress a certain way, etc.<p>Eventually, I realized that this was unsustainable, so I started unsubscribing from those things one by one. One of the first things I unsubscribed from was paying monthly rent. This allowed me to unsubscribe from having to work full-time. I think unsubscribed from many other things, one at a time.<p>I learned that if you make it a priority, and only change one small thing at a time, there is little to fear and much to gain. Not only that, but my life became infinitely richer and more interesting.<p>One of the most incredible changes I&#x27;ve experienced is that I no longer get that feeling of, &quot;wow, that was 3 years ago? feels just like yesterday... time flies&quot;. In fact, I have the opposite experience often, when I think, &quot;wow, it feels like that was 3 years ago, but it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks&quot;.<p>I attribute this to the amount of new and unique experiences I have every day, which used to be close to zero, and is now several per day.<p>I might come back and write more, but I have to go for now. Thank you for asking your question, and I hope this helps.<p>One more thing: If you consider the quantum nature of our Universe, and the power of observation and intention, you will begin to see just how powerful your intention is, especially when you intend well, and work to improve your karma every day. There&#x27;s a lot more to our Universe than today&#x27;s science admits, it&#x27;s tuned for love and enjoyment, savoring, and if you focus your attention, incredible, magical things will begin to manifest. I say this as a clear-minded computer programmer and systems maintainer who&#x27;s spent most of my life figuring out how systems work and experimenting with them.')
