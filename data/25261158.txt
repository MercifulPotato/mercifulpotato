I lumped yield in with the pessimistic 75% factor for area utilization of the wafer.  I should have been more clear.  The area loss for square die on a round wafer should be much less than 25% of the total wafer area.<p>If you look at process tech cost trends, the $17K is also very pessimistic.  I think a customer the size of Apple is probably getting a much better rate than that.  Remember, they sell well over 200 million TSMC fabbed chips a year.  Hard to know for sure of course, but I imagine these chips are ultimately costing Apple well under $40.  We&#x27;ll never know of course...')
