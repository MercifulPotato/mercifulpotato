Completely obliterated. It&#x27;s like, you think you know what &#x27;total darkness&#x27; is like until the first time you&#x27;re in a cave and someone turns off the lights. It was like that but for smell. I couldn&#x27;t smell an open bottle of vinegar under my nose.<p>Anyway, I can confirm that I could only appreciate the basest of flavors. As a food addict, I honestly wish it had been permanent because it removed a whole lot of temptation to eat for entertainment.')
