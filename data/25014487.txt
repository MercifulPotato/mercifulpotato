I just am wrong, right?  So says the voice of science!  (I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better example of how science pays lip service to the scientific method only!)<p>I link to wiki, not because I think it is authoritative, far from it.  Like the NYT, CNN, Guardian or BBC which deliver us our daily propaganda messages, wikipedia delivers us the historical narrative we are meant to accept.  When they themselves say 70% science studies are unreproducible (ie lies) you know that we&#x27;re in a world of BS!<p>Science is busted, but I find that individuals are able to relay the truth more fairly and accurately.')
