Say what you will but there&#x27;s no objective way in which Cali is &quot;Deciding that people of a certain race&#x2F;social class are the cause of all problems&quot;. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re talking about white people? Let&#x27;s not forget Silicon Valley is mostly white with a minority of Asians mixed in, and no one&#x27;s trying to take it down for that reason. Yet these comments are always way high up. Move to Texas if you want, but don&#x27;t think that Texans want a bunch of Silicon Valley liberals who, in their eyes and according to their news sources, are responsible for censoring the alt right on FB, YT, and twitter.')
