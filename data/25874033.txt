But heavy charging cables have enough copper you&#x27;re basically leaving a few dollars for every person with a pair of bolt cutters and a shopping cart. Not to mention vandalism or ICEing due to someone wanting to protest electric cars.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible; just you need to design in making them robust and vandalism, theft and denial-of-service resistant.<p>On a more humorous note my first mental image had a cyberpunk vibe: someone walking around the city with an unregulated nuke generator (stolen recycled waste or maybe a stolen weapon) selling electricity by the watt from a repurposed hot dog cart.  Or maybe WattWallahs if it turns into a semi informal business.<p>I believe EVs will come into their own as battery technology improves to the point that charging is no longer a multi hour affair. Whether that&#x27;s the Bill Gates battery, super capacitors, hot swap battery clubs or some combination thereof remains to be seen.')
