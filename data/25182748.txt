It&#x27;s OK to care about other causes too. Is it racist of my company to buck the norm and put up a flag or fliers supporting an environmental cause like recycling or composting instead?<p>You&#x27;re right, though; politics cannot be completely avoided. I just hope my friends don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;m racist because I&#x27;m not constantly publicly shepherding racial equality and civil rights. A person should be allowed to have other hobbies and interests. A person should not be required to be vocal and outspoken. Neither should businesses.<p>As an employee, I&#x27;d prefer if my company did its part in hiring diverse candidates and fair pay, but I don&#x27;t want to work at a place where I feel compelled to join in political discussions and movements that aren&#x27;t really part of my job description.')
