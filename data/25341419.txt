Item(by='to11mtm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607398363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25340066, text='Both options have trade-offs.<p>When I used to work in the telecom industry, burying conduit or cable in the ground was anywhere from 3x (bury in some dirt on the side of a county highway) to 20x (directional drilling in a heavily populated city where there&#x27;s utilities all over the place) the cost per foot compared to hanging it aerially from a labor standpoint.<p>However, as you correctly point out, there may be restrictions on what you can hang on the poles and where, and oftentimes you&#x27;ll find poles where it turns out it never should have had the number of attachments it did, but guess who gets to foot a large part of that bill if they want on?<p>But even then, I&#x27;ve seen absurd lengths gone to in the name of not digging. On Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, I believe they wound up using a super-special Self-Supporting fiber that could be hung in or near the Power area of a Pole. Yes, that requires a far more trained&#x2F;well paid worker than normal aerial work. Also, in that region, NESC 250C&#x2F;D comes into play which makes it even more of a PITA. But it still was far cheaper than putting cable in the ground.<p>I wonder whether Teraspan or other Vertical Directed Conduit would be a good fit for the bay area (Saw-cut a minimal depth in the street, just lay in a special zip-up conduit for fiber or twisted pair.) If the weather doesn&#x27;t tend towards large temperature shifts it works well.<p>Speaking of which, a couple drawbacks worth noting for buried conduit; You have to go out and do your markings, or pay someone to do them for you when a dig request is made, and you have to be ready to handle the repair when someone inevitably forgets to call or the markings are done incorrectly.')
