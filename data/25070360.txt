Here again x86 compatibility is worth something but for a lot of people it comes down to whether it runs Chrome and Office, so there’s an upper bound on how much money you can squeeze out with such effective competition.<p>Intel has the resources to do better than this but I no longer have confidence that they have management who can effectively run the company.')
