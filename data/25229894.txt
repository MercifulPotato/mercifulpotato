There’s some overloaded language here that I’d like to unpack:<p>The original issue at hand is to talk sensibly about “half way” between 0 and infinity. But in the standard way we think about distance between numbers, there’s obviously no way to do that — you can’t add and subtract real numbers to infinity!<p>So, implicitly what’s happening here is that by talking about a map between a finite interval and (0,inf), we are equipping (0,inf) with a new, special definition of distance between numbers. This is called a metric.<p>Usually, when we talk about the distance between x and y, we mean `d(x,y) = |x-y|` — this is called the Euclidean metric (in 1 dimension).<p>Here, we’ve introduced a new metric on (0,inf): `d2(x,y) = |tan^-1(x) - tan^-1(y)|&#x2F;(pi&#x2F;8)`<p>The half way point between 0 and 1 under the Euclidean metric is 0.5. The half way point between 0 and 1 under our fancy new metric d2 is ~0.414.<p>TL;DR: You can generalize the notion of “distance between two numbers”, using distance functions called metrics. Under the typical metric, the half way point between 0 and 1 is 0.5. Under our cool new infinite-tan metric, the half way point between 0 and 1 is ~0.414.')
