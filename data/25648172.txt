One of the best tax deductions we get is the one on mortgage interest.<p>Also this isn&#x27;t really that great since lower interest means higher home prices. I&#x27;d rather have high interest and low home prices if I were a buyer and try to pay if off ASAP or refinance to lower interest when the rate drops. Buy when interest is high and home prices low and sell when interest is low and home prices is high.')
