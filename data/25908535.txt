The story may still be happening by the time the piece is published. You don&#x27;t have all the information, so any opinion will inherently be misinformed.<p>Report the facts and leave the opinion to someone else.<p>It&#x27;s possible that what we really need is a separate class of people in between the two. Reporters who provide facts on things that are actively happening, and commentators who provide opinion on things that have finished happening, e.g. a month later once the facts are better established and there has been time to do a thorough investigation, but not years or decades after the fact.<p>The problem is how to prevent the two from merging together and creating what we have now.')
