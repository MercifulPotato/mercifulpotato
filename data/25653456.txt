I assume almost any company is going to have contracts with entities I consider immoral. That&#x27;s just living in society. You have to pick your battles, and to me this one isn&#x27;t it, although I respect those who want to make it such. Doing software development without interacting with any companies who have contracts with entities I consider immoral is probably impossible. I personally consider any contract with US DoD equally indefensible morally, and it&#x27;s just not realistic to avoid business with companies with DoD contracts. But I assume I could find such contracts among github competitors too.<p>I&#x2F;my employer currently only use free github though.<p>Although if I worked for a company, I&#x27;d be trying to figure out how to advocate internally to get them to stop -- avoiding working for a company with DoD contracts has been part of my own personal career choices.<p>I assume Apple, Google, and Amazon definitely have contracts with morally indefensible entities, especially government agencies, including ICE&#x2F;CBP&#x2F;DHS -- I still use AWS, and most of y&#x27;all do too right? If people boycotting github over ICE contracts are not boycotting AWS, have you thought about why or why not? I&#x27;m not assuming you can&#x27;t have a good reason, just curious if you&#x27;ve thought about it and what it is. i don&#x27;t totally understand why github has become the posterboy for this, when they seem pretty typical and probably far from worst, when compared with say AWS.<p>While the company I work for uses github, we don&#x27;t pay for it; we DO pay for AWS, which also has ICE contracts...')
