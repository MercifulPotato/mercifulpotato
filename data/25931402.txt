Browser bookmarks are cool but they quickly get disorganized and I forgot the folder where I have bookmarked the website.<p>So, I built Bunklist to collect my favourite websites into simple lists for my personal use and also to share it with my friends and team. If you are looking for something to organize your bookmarks, give Bunklist a try and let me know your thoughts about it.<p>You can set your list to be public or private, Public lists are discovered by other users, they can add comments, like, bookmark, or save websites into their list using the “Bunk it” button .<p>I have also made a “Shuffle”, an alternative to StumbleUpon to discover one random website from public lists.<p>Bunklist is completely free to use &amp; I am looking for your feedback and suggestions to improve our product.')
