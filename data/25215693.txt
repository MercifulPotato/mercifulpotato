And with Thanksgiving around the corner, I&#x27;d expect cases to skyrocket right after these celebrations.<p>&gt; Nobody is being &quot;kept on the job&quot;. Nobody is being forced to work. Those nurses are volunteering to stay on the job.<p>Because they know their patients will die if they don&#x27;t perform.<p>&gt; The army demonstrates that anyone can learn these skills in a few days.<p>Once again with the army comparisons. Its easy to build a training program when you have a $700 Billion&#x2F;year budget. If you want to make an army-like training program for nurses, then I agree with you. That&#x27;d be great for our country.<p>But I recognize that I have a minority opinion and that most Americans won&#x27;t accept raising their taxes to pay for such a thing.')
