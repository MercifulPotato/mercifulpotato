Stand mixers. Cast iron pans. And I&#x27;m sure lots of industrial equipment I don&#x27;t know about.<p>None of these really changed much in the past 50 years that made it useless, and I can see these being useful for the next 50 years pretty easily.<p>The only thing I can think of is a base computer with some interface to a breakout box that can be upgraded based on how computers work.<p>This definitely cheats the idea of a 100 year computer, but you could have a wifi breakout board. Maybe a reader for the next storage format that&#x27;s popular. Neural whatsit chip that may revolutionize computing. But, again, that&#x27;s cheating. And at that point just buying modern hardware makes so much more sense.')
