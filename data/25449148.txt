I&#x27;ve had a pretty high &quot;win rate&quot; when playing non-chess enthusiasts around my workplace or friend group.<p>The issue I&#x27;ve encountered with memorizing openings is that it assumes both sides are playing perfect openings that complement each other. In reality, in my &quot;lower rated&quot; games, my opponent is likely to make suboptimal moves against the opening I memorized. There are ways to punish their moves, but I would&#x27;ve needed to memorized that. So, I have to come up with changes to the memorized opening on the spot.<p>Going through the checklist allows me to play without memorizing movesets even though the moves I make are not the &quot;best&quot;.')
