I should have been writing these down over the years. A few common points of confusion off the top of my head:<p>People expecting to put &quot;mod foo;&quot; at the top of foo.rs, to declare that foo.rs is a module.<p>People expecting to put &quot;mod foo { }&quot; with the contents of the file inside the {}s to declare that foo.rs is a module.<p>People expecting that &quot;use&quot; declares a module, not &quot;mod.&quot;<p>People expecting every file inside a directory &quot;foo&quot; to be the contents of the &quot;foo&quot; module, regardless of filename, all concatenated together.<p>People expecting that mod statements never need to exist because it should be inferred from the filesystem.<p>General confusion about the privacy rules; that &quot;pub&quot; may not mean that your thing is globally public.<p>General confusion about crates vs modules; main.rs and lib.rs being in the same directory, but declaring different crates. Not understanding how to import stuff from lib.rs into main.rs, because it feels a bit different than other modules.<p>People used to also struggle a lot with &quot;use&quot; and paths pre-Rust 2018, but that&#x27;s been mostly cleaned up at this point.')
