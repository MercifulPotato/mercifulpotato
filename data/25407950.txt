So one professor has to take care of much more students, exams, etc.<p>To me the Fernuni seems great if you want to study while having a job, during a pandemic, are just interested in the degree, are not a in-Person Person, are a Self-motivating learner or live far away from a Uni City.<p>The traditional Uni seems great, if you want to experience social life, are a study group kind of person, want to go into academia, like noodles for 2â‚¬ in the Mensa. Also a lot of STEM or medicine that needs access to research facilities will be easier in a traditional Uni.')
