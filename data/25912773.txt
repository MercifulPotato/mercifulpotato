It only makes sense to have a policy framework to deal with these things rather than flying by the seat of your pants. Perhaps the policy will be &quot;we won&#x27;t take down group chats without a court order&quot;, or perhaps it will be something else. But to just punt until a link to some folks planning a lynch mob arrives in press@signal.org is irresponsible both to the platform and to the society.')
