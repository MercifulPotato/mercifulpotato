You will probably also <i>see</i> more, because you are used to identifying it.<p>If you say &quot;a third [1] of the people in this group experience a bad thing&quot; I would say that&#x27;s pretty wide-spread.<p>The OP was specifically saying &quot;it&#x27;s not widespread, I&#x27;ve never seen it&quot; [2]<p>I&#x27;m not trying to claim there&#x27;s a nefarious subtext. I&#x27;m not saying the op is sexist or racist. I&#x27;m just trying to point out that a lot of people experience this, and one of the stated goals of CoCs in open source or at conferences is to help combat it. I think that&#x27;s a good thing, and while you or perhaps others have pointed out that a community <i>could</i> combat such negative behavior without a CoC, the CoC does give some indication of how such behavior will be dealt with (before I join the community&#x2F;attend the conference), which can increase my confidence recommending a conference or increase someone else&#x27;s confidence attending (or participating in an open source community etc)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;sexism-in-the-tech-industry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;sexism-in-the-tech-industry</a><p>[2] not a real quote so please correct me if it&#x27;s way off, I&#x27;m being lazy<p>Also, I know they were referring to open source - maybe they&#x27;ve seen workplace sexism etc and were specifically excluding that.
