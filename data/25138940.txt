I feel it nicely sets expectations to what I can get out of checking out each project and thinking &quot;well, it&#x27;s just a tiny project after all, why can&#x27;t I have made something like this ever month too?&quot;. The 12 startups idea was also inspiring to me but I disliked how the term so frequently leads people to (IMO) somewhat pointless analysis of &quot;Is this even a real startup?&quot; around each individual project.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levels.io&#x2F;12-startups-12-months&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levels.io&#x2F;12-startups-12-months&#x2F;</a>')
