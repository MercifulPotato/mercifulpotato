Just give them a water dish and at least 10 will promptly drown themselves. They&#x27;re either suicidal, or so painfully stupid that the only reason they haven&#x27;t been wiped off the face of the planet is the incredible rate they reproduce at.<p>In a less facetious sense, I do believe that insect neurology is substantially different. Crustaceans have a nervous system web, which is why you have to cut crabs and lobsters in half to kill them rather than just stabbing them in the head.')
