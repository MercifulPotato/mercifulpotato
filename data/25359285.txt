This is fairly common for vaccines. It&#x27;s not cutting corners either. If you expect severe allergies to adversely affect outcomes, you don&#x27;t gain anything from having them in your general trial population, because unless you make sure your data gather and trial protocols are designed to test for the difference, you&#x27;re unlikely to be able to form a robust opinion on the safety of the drug for allergy sensitive people, but are highly likely to taint your understanding of how it affects &quot;normal&quot; people. (that is, you could probably observe risk fairly easily, but you wouldn&#x27;t be sure to confirm its safe for them if nothing showed up)<p>There might be something about being conservative to avoid what happened to these people without notice, but in the scheme of things its a pretty small pain point.')
