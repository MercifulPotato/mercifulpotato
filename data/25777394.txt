It says nothing of what happens along the way (the &quot;means&quot;), it only cares about the ends.<p>Why is there a dichotomy between &quot;[any and all ideas] fighting in the open&quot; and &quot;squashing hope of discovering many truths&quot;? I also see no reason why this argument on the basis of truth would not justify restrictions on things which do not even foster dialogue on truth. The truth-value of &#x27;hate speech&#x27; (if there <i>is</i> any truth value) is likely negligible compared to the same ideas expressed otherwise.')
