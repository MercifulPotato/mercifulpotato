That way the &quot;=&quot; character sent in the encoding of the form elements doesn&#x27;t interfere with the meaningful JSON content.<p>There might be a clever way to get it to submit dynamic JSON that changes based on user input without JavaScript, but I haven&#x27;t thought enough about it.<p>This technique is sometimes useful for CSRF attacks.')
