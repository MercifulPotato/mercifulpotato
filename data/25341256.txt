All the while, you process what&#x27;s happening and use that feedback to possibly change your decisions.<p>It strikes me as a generic but useful way to think about surviving unexpected situations.  I&#x27;ve thankfully not been in a position to implement it, but since learning about it I have found myself doing a bit more practice (both mentally and in real life) and trying to be a bit more prepared for dangerous situations.')
