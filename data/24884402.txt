It seems weird that we&#x27;ve made this paradigm shift which I find potentially dangerous and at best disingenuous. It also makes population wide immunity conversations difficult because people are using the same term with pre-covid and post-covid meaning.<p>Edit: I should also note that <i>this article</i> uses both terms which makes it difficult to read and confusing.')
