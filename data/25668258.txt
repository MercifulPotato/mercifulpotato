There was advance warning of potential conflict.<p>However, your statement that the police are overwhelmingly Trump supporters seems weak and inflammatory and is what I suspect drove downvoting.  There are several examples of individual police taking stands against the crowd.  Directly linking police performance today to politics is also questionable.  When dealing with rowdy crowds it may be best to take things easy and act to calm tensions.  A large number of cops ended up behind the crowd surge where the best course of action becomes ambiguous.')
