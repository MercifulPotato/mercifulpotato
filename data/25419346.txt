So much of driving at speed or at edge of vehicles performance is understanding the balance of the car as it shifts in bends or slides etc, something you simply can’t feel in a static chair no matter how impressive a force feedback steering wheel you purchase.<p>I’ve unfortunately been in several cars where driver has lost control and avoided an accident - most drivers in my experience can counter the scenario you describe intuitively - steer opposite way of slide, lift off gas to correct etc, just feels natural if you have driven a car even a small period of time.<p>Other’s mileage may vary of course!')
