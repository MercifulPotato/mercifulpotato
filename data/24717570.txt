A game company? A game engine? Something like Steam?).<p>First, there&#x27;s no clearly visible direct link to the company page from the blog (the logo doesn&#x27;t take you there but to the start of the blog).<p>Second, I removed &quot;blog.&quot; to get to the main roblox.com page, and it&#x27;s a form to sign up without saying WTF this is.<p>The closest thing to this is an &quot;About&quot; page -- which is still so cryptic, I don&#x27;t have any clear indication what they do.<p>And I cared enough to go through this and read some of the About text. The average person landing on their page &#x2F; blog wont care that much.<p>P.S. I still don&#x27;t know what they do. Looks like a game store. Or not.')
