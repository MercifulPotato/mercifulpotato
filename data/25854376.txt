At the very least it seems like they don&#x27;t have a very good idea of whether a person who&#x27;s playing basketball in the hotter part of the day on the hottest day of the year would like some shade or not.<p>If someone complains that we cannot build housing because there is not enough infrastructure and someone else complains that we cannot build additional infrastructure because the current residents do not need it, they may both have coherent belief systems, but some trouble is afoot that need not be.')
