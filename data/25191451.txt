A newer, larger machine could easily replace two of them. Maybe three. As harvest is typically the labour bottleneck, I can see how having as few people in the combines as possible is beneficial to the farm. The article would suggest that there are five of them regularly working on the farm. A couple of truck drivers, a cart operator, and that only leaves two to run the combines. If they, like your farm, need four 1680s get the work done they would have to find seasonal help, which can be quite difficult.<p>But naturally other farms may have different needs and requirements.')
