Item(by='pizza234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604241866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959711, text='I&#x27;m a keyboard-first user, and I don&#x27;t find, generally speaking, applications to be keyboard-oblivious, although, the exceptions stick out like a sore thumb.<p>Worst offender is certainly Gnome, which is nothing short than antagonistic. They went as far as disabling mnemonics by default. They removed the fast search in the file manager, in favour of the fancy (and broken) one; keyboard user must use the awkward, inline, one. The file manager also lost the &quot;New folder&quot; shortcut.<p>Another notable entry is Sublime Text (which is not antagonistic, but somewhat oblivious). Very surprisingly, the file panel doesn&#x27;t respond to keyboard events. For example, if the user wants to rename a file via keyboard, they&#x27;re forced to copy the filename, then perform the operation via terminal.')
