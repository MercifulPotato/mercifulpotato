It&#x27;s not a dichotomy at all.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to have a stable grid even with solar and wind.<p>The problem is that neither nuclear nor coal power stations are load following and &quot;base load&quot; has lowered over the years (industry has moved to Asia, devices became more efficient, etc.).<p>Stand-by power (like natural gas powered generators) hasn&#x27;t been built up the way the way it should have been. Same goes for smart grid technologies and buffer storage; not to mention the maniacs (especially in South Germany) who basically protest <i>everything</i> - from nuclear power, to wind power, to required infrastructure like north-to-south high-voltage transmission lines.<p>It&#x27;s way too oversimplified to reduce the issue to just wind and solar.')
