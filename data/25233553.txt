It’s okay to have that world view at his age, and it is probably serving him well right now.  I remember being 22-23 and wondering why everyone didn’t want to work 12 hours a day.  Why were some leaving before 5, some came in late, some just in general did not give a shit.  Here I was working hard not only to learn brand new systems, but build a disaster recovery plan, capacity planning, and production control scheme from scratch. And trying to finish my degree on the side. While I’m doing all of this, these shiftless people were making excuses about kids having to be places, or wives who wanted their husbands home, or people who always seemed to be sick.  I didn’t understand.<p>I’m 47 now and I completely understand.  Over time, I realized that there was life outside of work.  Kids were actually fun to hang around, and my wife is my best friend.  Not my job, and not my coworkers, the wife I chose to spend time with actually is fun to spend time with.<p>I get what Alexandr is saying, I really do.  Except for the CEO bit, I had the same world view 25 years ago. And it’s a good world view for that age.  However life will change, our experiences will broaden, and I feel he will probably have a completely different idea 20 years from now.')
