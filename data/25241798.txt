That said, it doesn&#x27;t mean commercial VPNs are placebo&#x2F;snakeoil. They still provide:<p>* anonymity from the websites you visit: your home internet connection&#x27;s IP typically uniquely identifies you&#x2F;your household (assuming no CGNAT). Meanwhile, a VPN server might be used by tens of hundreds of people, which greatly increases your anonymity set. It&#x27;s further improved if you rotate VPN servers, because a VPN service might be used by millions of people.<p>* extra degree of separation: your ISP knows a lot of info about you (name, address, payment info, maybe even credit score), whereas a VPN service might only know your email and the ip you connect from. If your VPN service decides to go rogue and sell your browsing habits, they&#x27;ll have a much harder time associating it with your real life identity.')
