This helps make an association similar to how some kids books overlay hiragana over pictures of things that start with that letter, e.g. overlaying &quot;い&quot; (i) around a strawberry (ichigo). There are tons of similar examples in both japanese and chinese (pronunciation prefixes being a common tool used by chinese learners)')
