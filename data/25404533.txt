It takes 5 minutes to drive legally, and if you take less than 4:37 then you get the ticket.<p>Assume you drive at 60mph and then you suddenly have to &quot;speed up&quot; to 80mph to avoid a situation.  How long can you drive at 80mph before you&#x27;re ticketed?  69 seconds.<p>If you&#x27;re driving for 69 seconds at 20mph above limit then you&#x27;re not &quot;avoiding a situation&quot;.  You are speeding.')
