I never suggested they ought to, the point is they seem NEVER to take any significant contribution from outside the Google team, like at all.<p>&gt;For people outside if their thinking aligned with core team they will feel welcome and others will feel unwelcome due to high handedness of core team.<p>No, whether you align or not major contributions are not accepted. See the godep vs. go modules debacle for example.<p>And again, that&#x27;s all fine with me, and I can see why they&#x27;d operate that way, but they claim not to which is my major beef (and allow people to work very hard at contributing without realising it&#x27;s not going to get them anywhere).')
