It seemed difficult, so I dug my heels in and say &quot;No! I don&#x27;t wanna! It seems like friction and that&#x27;s too hard.&quot;<p>The fact is, once I got over myself and sucked it up and got my head around it, it really only took 2 days of effort to grok what I was doing and now it&#x27;s easy.<p>So biggest advice I can offer is this: Get over it and get on with it. It seems like a pain in the ass now, trust me I know, but you&#x27;ll thank yourself for making the effort in the long run.')
