Some of the air would become radioactive, but so what?<p>In free-fall, a reactor at the end of a long-enough tether would present no risk of environmental contamination or user safety, and so could dispense with both the containment vessel and shielding. Even there, though, pB seems a more atractive goal than thermal neutrons, because destroying your plasma focus apparatus every few months would get tedious.')
