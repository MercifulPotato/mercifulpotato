So when I&#x27;ve had to go to the emergency room and end up seeing the doctor for about 20 minutes, that&#x27;s about $54 worth of doctor-time (as an order-of-magnitude approximation, ignoring fully-loaded employee costs since I don&#x27;t have that number).<p>And yet the bill that arrives is on the order of ~$6000. Sure there&#x27;s also nurse salary to pay for my visit and other legitimate overhead that&#x27;s part of the actual &quot;care&quot;.<p>So from that bill I got, over $5000 are inefficiencies and non-care-providing rentiers inflating the cost. Nearly all the bill goes to entities other than the actual medical care providers! So no, it&#x27;s the the actual doctor+nurse salaries that makes the USA health care so exceptionally expensive.')
