Facebook only made this space a bit more diverse, actually letting some criticism in, weakening mass media influence. But it&#x27;s ridiculous to think this affected &quot;democracy&quot;, the US isn&#x27;t even considered to be a democracy outside of the US, but more like a capitalist-ruled police country.')
