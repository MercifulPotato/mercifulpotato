I worked for two years for a medium-sized Seattle-based tech company in their London office, and the last 12 months in a British tech company. The American company had way more bureaucracy and rules around stuff than the UK company. The UK company paid way better, had a barista on-staff, much more up-to-date tech, and less work hours to boot.')
