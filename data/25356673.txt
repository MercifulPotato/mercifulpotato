If they had a strong sense of social responsibility, the confidence men would have nothing to sink their claws into. But you don&#x27;t need much reason or even a convincing liar to talk you into selfish or stupid behavior if you already wanted to behave stupidly or selfishly, so the confidence men are having a rather easy go of it.
