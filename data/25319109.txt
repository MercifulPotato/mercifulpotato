There is a real risk that advice is going to be taken litearlly<p>If &quot;be yourself&quot; is a metaphor of some sort that means &quot;assess if your personality needs change and then change it if you are a jerk&quot; then that needs to be what people say in the first place. And realistically even then &#x27;jerk&#x27; is too abstract. This is advice that requires psychic powers to interpret and as such is bad advice.')
