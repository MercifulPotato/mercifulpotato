It is really a shame that they hamstrung it like that. It would have been smarter to either leave it as a miniseries, or commit to a quality second season. As it is now, I’m less likely to recommend it and I add caveats to my recommendation. They eacked out a few more viewers by making a half assed second season, but hurt the brand long term. Which is what I think they are missing in general, that they are not properly counting the people that leave or fail to recommend Netflix because of a culmination of half-baked and abandoned shows that finally break the camel’s back.')
