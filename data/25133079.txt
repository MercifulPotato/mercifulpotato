Item(by='npsimons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605672187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25132450, text='&gt; Why do we leave office workers to figure out on their own how to get things done?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m dense, or oversimplifying, but the answer seems obvious to me: because there&#x27;s no one size fits all solution. Sure, people can be lost and confused, but being told there is one and only one way to things feels like a straitjacket to me. It&#x27;s the same reason I despise the term &quot;best practice&quot; as if some arbiter of &quot;best&quot; determined that every other way of doing something sucks.<p>I&#x27;m very much of the eclectic school. I don&#x27;t follow GTD strictly, but I pulled what I found useful from it and went from there. Honestly, it&#x27;s been so long since I reviewed the method, it&#x27;s probably time to go back and review it again. You can&#x27;t just rest on your laurels; as another good (but often overpraised) productivity book put it, you need to sharpen the saw every once and a while, and this includes <i>always</i> questioning &quot;best&quot; practice.')
