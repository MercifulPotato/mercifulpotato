About 1&#x2F;5 rides would have some memorable event. A drunk yelling slurs at no one in particular, a mother screaming at her kids to the point the driver is threatening to call child services if she doesnâ€™t calm down. Police pulling the bus over in the middle of nowhere and arresting someone. These kind of things.<p>Generally it was only the poorest people who would be riding Greyhounds up north, or those unfortunate enough not able to drive themselves.')
