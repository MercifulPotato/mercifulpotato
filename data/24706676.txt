There is no such thing as an instable test as such in a test environment, in this case it was a broken test with unmocked data which occasionally threw errors, depending on the OS and speed of the machine it was running on.<p>In another scenario the was a random number involved, which randomly chose a picture in the test development and depending wether it needed cropping or not, an additional popup would open.<p>I was told: &quot;well, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t&quot;. Nobody actually investigated further, tests were excluded instead. Noone ever looked at the artifacts&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;logs.<p>Always investigate, there is a reason for every &quot;magical&quot; behaviour.')
