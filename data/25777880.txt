TO my ears most Dutch people have a distinct English accent; some more than others, but almost always identifiable as from Dutch origin.<p>Walter Lewin (as in e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sJG-rXBbmCc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sJG-rXBbmCc</a>) is a quite extreme example, despite the fact that he has lived in the US since 1966. Carice van Houten (Melisandre in Game of Thrones) has it too but less pronounced.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that Flemish people have a distinct English accent too, and that I simply don&#x27;t notice it as much (being Flemish myself).<p>Germans speaking English are often recognizable as well.')
