My son, the youngest, isn&#x27;t much interested in baseball yet.<p>I played baseball, not at a high level or anything special, but I played and loved it. Then I had kids, the first two girls, and I got them started with fastpitch softball. It took me awhile to get up to speed with what I&#x27;ll call &quot;modern training methods&quot; - and did a lot of trial and, unfortunately, error with my oldest daughter.<p>I&#x27;ve coached both of them and I can say that when I started training my younger daughter how to hit, at age 6, I had about 4 years worth of modern training&#x2F;coaching knowledge fresh in my head. My older kid, who started at 9, had a dad who kind of knew how it worked, but it was rusty.<p>So what I ended up with is an older daughter who became great, eventually, around 14u, but spent a lot of time on the bench and a lot of time spent re-learning how to <i>correctly</i> do things.<p>Then I have a 10 year old (at the moment) who was taught the correct way to do everything, from step 1.<p>Currently, the only objective results I can give you is that I had one kid who didn&#x27;t make any teams for two entire seasons before making one because we attended 90% of their practices (open practices). Then I had another kid who has only not made one team in the last 2 years. This fall she made 4 out of 4 teams that she tried out for. She finally failed to make a team when we went over a large organization in Oklahoma that plays at an extremely high level, and they were only looking for 2 more players to complete their roster.')
