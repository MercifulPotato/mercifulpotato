For a long time, I had planned to buy another set of headphones - ironically because Apple refuses to exchange the worn-out earpads of my older beats. It is quite bad for the environment, if you have to dispose a product because a part like earpads, which has a very obvious wear limiting its lifespan, cannot be exchanged. Same of course applies for the battery, but that is still ok.<p>Hearing about the rumors of Apple headphones I postponed any purchase, as I was curious to see first what these headphones would be like and quite willing to buy them, even if more expensive than what I had before. So why arent the AirPods Max not an instant buy for me now?<p>First of all, the release 2 weeks before Christmas is odd timing, but that probably was beyond the control by Apple, they were not ready for production early enough, also this means limited stock. Basically the question was already decided as there was no chance to get them with the initial run and now are out of stock till spring.<p>A rather big gripe of mine are the colors. It is great to have different colors, buy why are they all so toned down? For the same reason I don&#x27;t like the identical colors of the iPad Air. For some things I really like the colors to be ff0000 or 0000ff, alternatively at least 000000. I would like to see whether the &quot;space gray&quot; is dark enough, in the video by iJustine they looked nice, would like to check that out in a store before ordering.<p>The other one would be the rather weird case. Not only is it odd and I really don&#x27;t need a case for my headphones in the first place, it is also mandatory to use to be able to switch them off. Which is probably the reason I won&#x27;t get them. I don&#x27;t want to have to put my headphones in a case every time I put them off for more than a very short while. Especially not in a goofy one. There needs to be an off switch on the device. Shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to reprogram one of the two switches to work that way.<p>The other one is of course the issue with the device compatibility. As Gruber points it out: the spatial audio is great, but there seems no way to actually use this. I am not going to watch movies on my iPhone (I actually did this once to test my Homepods as a movie sound stage, which worked great. But I did it exactly once for satisfying the curiosity, watching a movie on the iPhone is no experience I want to replicate). This is a huge stinker and I don&#x27;t know what Apple is thinking. It is already more than aggravating, that you cannot (reasonably) use Homepods as your Mac speakers. I just set up a new MacBook Pro, and indeed, my Homepods appear als sound output devices in the audio control, but as separate devices. How is it possible, that they don&#x27;t communicate their pairing to Macs? Again, what is Apple thinking?<p>As a consequence, I am quite undecided yet. They do tick quite a few boxes, good build quality, probably great sound, Apple certainly has used all their vast acoustic skills on those. Battery and earpads are exchangeable, they should have a good life time. The price certainly gave me a short pause, this is not impulse by territory. I would be willing to pay it though for a product I am convinced about.')
