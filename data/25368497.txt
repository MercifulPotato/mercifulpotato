That&#x27;s a growth of 168%, or compounded annual 5% (more precisely 5.06%, but Ackman likes round numbers). Very, very far from 8%. So far that the investment outcome at the age of 65 will be $160k instead of $1MM.<p>But wait, this return is not deterministic. The annual volatility was 20% (the precise value being 19.8%). Even if the annualized return were 8% as Ackman postulates, your median investment outcome at 65 will be less than $275k. In other words in 50% of the cases you&#x27;ll get less than that.<p>If you use the realistic growth rate of 5% and volatility of 20%, then you have a 50% chance to get less than $43k at 65 (starting with the $6750 at birth). If we see an inflation rate of 2% (this is much less volatile, it&#x27;s quite deterministic actually, being the Fed long term inflation target), that&#x27;s about $12k in 2020 dollars. Which is slightly below the official poverty level. For an annual income, that is. If you want to make that work for the rest of your life (today&#x27;s life expectancy at 65 is about 18 years, in 65 years from now it&#x27;s going to be higher), then you end up with less than $1k per year. That&#x27;s in 50% of the cases.')
