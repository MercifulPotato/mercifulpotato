I&#x27;m sympathetic to your thought here on having an external service and going with a simple approach.<p>Situations with a slow deployment process has been a big motivator for building Config.ly -- and I&#x27;ve seen it happen at companies with medium-sized eng teams (taking hours to swap values during incident fires), and I know it&#x27;s a problem _all_ iOS developers have due to the app store deploy process.<p>I also think there&#x27;s other value here... For instance  having a UI means non-technical folks can update it. A lot of my time as an engineer has been spent making copy tweaks (I&#x27;ve felt existing CMS products were too heavy-weight and difficult to plugin).<p>Also, having turn-key libraries mean you don&#x27;t have to copy&#x2F;paste hardcoded values among many clients (or store on the server build an API for _every_ constant). I&#x27;m a big fan of DRY.')
