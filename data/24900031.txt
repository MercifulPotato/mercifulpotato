Let the people decide for themselves what is true and false<p>This only works if they remove themselves from choosing what to show who, what to promote, and what to demote.<p>As long as they are actively choosing who will see what, how often, what things will be promoted, etc. Then they are basically the judge and jury. This is their current dilemma. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re starting to have stronger moderation.
