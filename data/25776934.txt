You said that you downvote other ideas because they (the ideas) are “dangerous”, here is your quote:<p>&gt; “ I mean answers that are dangerous, vulnerable, misleading, or represent an extreme viewpoint as fact (&quot;buhh object orientation is dangerous, you must write C++ using functional paradigms, it&#x27;s the only way to make good programs&quot;)”<p>So you are claiming that an <i>idea</i> expressing “OOP is dangerous” <i>is itself dangerous as an idea</i> and that this danger is what merits your downvote.<p>Yet you’ve done nothing to explain such an extreme and unreasonable point of view.')
