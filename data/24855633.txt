One of the things LTE started (and 5G continues) is to push more and more of this  to the edge of the network. Traffic from the UE does get tunnelled through the Serving Gateway (S-GW), but there can be multiple SGW&#x27;s on a network. Mobility management is also a big enough issue that the Mobility Management Entity (MME) is an entity unto itself on the block diagram.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that eNodeB&#x27;s (the radios) can now talk directly to each other via X2 and can actually hand over a subscriber without particularly involving the core network.<p>tldr: I think it&#x27;s enough of a problem for it to be not entirely trivial.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yatebts.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;lte-concepts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yatebts.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;lte-concepts&#x2F;</a>')
