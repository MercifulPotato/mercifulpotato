I had tank of an HP laserjet 3 in the 90s, and patent life is 20 years. For the basic functionality, they should all be expired at this point, and the limiting factor at the time was the high cost of memory and compute.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t anything relevant have expired years ago? The first laserjet came out in 1984 it seems. Prices have come down, but I haven&#x27;t seen any real innovation in printers (not that I really need any- I just want them to print)- since 2000.')
