Item(by='new_guy', descendants=None, kids=[25807721, 25807556], score=None, time=1610850969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807468, text='&gt; It makes sense to patent an idea based on what he&#x27;s hoping will eventually become a fleshed out scientific theory with proofs and whatnot, it doesn&#x27;t mean any of it will turn out to be correct. It just means if it does find proof, he could get rich.<p>It would just make him yet another patent troll. The US patent system is beyond absurd.<p>Unless he can physically demonstrate a fully working &#x27;gravitational wave generator&#x27;, the patent shouldn&#x27;t be granted.')
