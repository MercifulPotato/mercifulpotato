For example, I studied linguistics and whenever I had to read Plato about language I was reminded that he really had no idea what he was talking about.<p>I also personally don&#x27;t like Plato (he always creates these absolute strawmen as opponents), but that&#x27;s more personal. I agree though that it&#x27;s valuable to read at least some of it and to see whether it speaks to you or whether you find the method of inquiry interesting.')
