I remember it, because the company I worked for at the time flipped out and banned all Android phones from their network for over a year.<p>It was fantastic; I got a whole year of not being able to see work emails after I went home, and then they let us opt out of the invasive MDM software that they wanted to put on Android phones to let them access corporate email. All for a bug that my phone wasn&#x27;t even vulnerable to.<p>By the time I left, I had gone 4 years without ever responding to unexpected evening emails.
