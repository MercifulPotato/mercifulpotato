The benefit is that I don&#x27;t have to write these boring, but necessary pieces. As applications grow larger, especially with Go&#x27;s desire to have an interface with only one method&#x2F;function, DI requires a lot of boilerplate.<p>If there was a DI for go that used generate, then I would have compile time checking of dependencies.
