Maybe its because the terms and conditions on points say they aren&#x27;t assets, debt or anything really. Hard for me to place it, its the people in the churning communities trying to replicate travel bloggers that irk me. Maybe I’m just being classist, I enjoy being around people that can afford the business-class situations they are in, and theyre typically not bragging about it as its just fact of life and a fact of their peer’s life.')
