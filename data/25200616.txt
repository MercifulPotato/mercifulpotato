Let them have fun! There&#x27;s no reason to care about someone using capacity on your network when almost no one else is using the network.<p>During peak times, it makes sense to give priority to those who use less data while still offering an acceptable level of service to those who use a lot of data.<p>I&#x27;m really hopeful that the next few years will bring competition to the home internet space.  T-Mobile has been adding a lot more areas to its home internet footprint recently. Their service certainly isn&#x27;t perfect and might not be what people here would be looking for (given that wireless home internet is likely to be slower than wired for a bit). However, competition would put pressure on Comcast.  When T-Mobile started offering better terms for their mobile service, a lot of people said that T-Mobile&#x27;s coverage wasn&#x27;t good enough for them to switch.  It was good enough for enough people to switch that AT&amp;T and Verizon vastly changed their offerings. They went from offering me 3GB of data for $30 to offering me unlimited.  It&#x27;s hard to remember the 2012-era data plans at this point.  Verizon has started offering wireless home internet as well, albeit on a more limited basis than T-Mobile.<p>T-Mobile&#x27;s mobile offering didn&#x27;t work for a lot of people back in 2013-2016, but it provided enough competition that Verizon and AT&amp;T reintroduced unlimited data.  Even if people on here won&#x27;t switch to wireless home internet, it could provide an excellent option for people looking for a bill without hidden fees and unexpected increases in price. The churn from those customers will put pressure on Comcast to offer better terms for their service.')
