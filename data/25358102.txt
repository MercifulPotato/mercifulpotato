Wade</i> is the <i>Lochner</i> of liberal jurisprudence: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lochner_v._New_York" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lochner_v._New_York</a>. Both decisions only make sense under a sweeping libertarian view of the Constitution that isn’t broadly embraced anymore (if it ever was). Even Ginsberg didn’t like Roe’s privacy formulation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;us&#x2F;ruth-bader-ginsburg-roe-v-wade.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;us&#x2F;ruth-bader-ginsburg-ro...</a><p>&gt; The way Justice Ginsburg saw it, Roe v. Wade was focused on the wrong argument — that restricting access to abortion violated a woman’s privacy. What she hoped for instead was a protection of the right to abortion on the basis that restricting it impeded gender equality, said Mary Hartnett, a law professor at Georgetown University who will be a co-writer on the only authorized biography of Justice Ginsburg.<p>Ginsberg realized that “equal protection” has the benefit of being in the constitution, while “privacy” nowhere appears in the document.[1] As the left has shifted away from social libertarianism, the ideological underpinning of <i>Roe</i> has become increasingly unsettled. That’s why in the recent confirmation hearings you only heard discussions of “super precedent” not any sort of debate about a sweeping privacy right.<p>[1] “Privacy” as an “unenumerated right” makes little sense under either liberal or conservative readings of the constitution. If you, like Scalia, believe that the “unenumerated rights” were those that were understood to exist at the time of the founding, then privacy isn’t one of those rights. But even if you subscribe to a “living constitution” view that fundamental rights can change over time—what’s the basis for your claim that “privacy” is generally recognized as a fundamental right <i>today?</i> I’m not aware of any constitutional court in the world that has embraced a notion of “privacy” broad enough to include both abortion and freedom from surveillance. Around the same time as <i>Roe</i> courts in Canada, France, Italy, and Germany declined to recognize any <i>right</i> to an abortion. The first three found it to be a legislative matter. The latter found legalizing abortion to be <i>unconstitutional</i> as a violation of the German Basic Law’s right to life.')
