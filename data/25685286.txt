For example, when logged into a Google account, if the site uses Google Analytics and you are logged into Google, then Google can build a profile of you and target ads at you based on your activity.<p>Also: Browsing artifacts may be left on a machine anyway due to swap (on Linux) or Windows&#x27; memory paging file. This is why I advocate for using something like TailsOS[0] if you don&#x27;t want to leave a trace and be as anonymous as possible.<p>Yes, TailsOS is a lot of overhead for most people, but worth it if you want your privacy real bad.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tails.boum.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tails.boum.org&#x2F;</a>')
