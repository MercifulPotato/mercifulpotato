Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604200111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956899, text='<i>&gt; Clearly the real numbers are a model for these axioms. But as it turns out the countable set of rational numbers is a model as well.</i><p>You missed the crucial property that rules out the rationals (more precisely, the rationals with their standard ordering): one way of stating it is that every sequence that has an upper bound in the set, must have a least upper bound in the set. The rationals do not satisfy this property (for example, consider the sequence of successive decimal expansions, each one to one more decimal place, of sqrt(2)), but the reals do.<p>The challenge for me is to understand how there can still be <i>countable</i> sets that also satisfy that property of the reals. (Obviously any countable set can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the rationals, but for a countable set that satisfies the least upper bound property of the reals, such a correspondence with the rationals would put an ordering on the rationals that was not the standard one.)')
