Saying this isn’t “the norm” because it doesn’t happen in the majority of counties misses the point, since the voter suppression is <i>targeted</i> at specific places. I could have been more clear on what I meant by “the norm”. Of course it isn’t happening everywhere or even a majority of places. I mean that targeted voter suppression i.e. either methods of voting or locations of voting with the highest impact on likely democratic voters, has been the norm.<p>Your linked article stated “Florida saw a scant 6-minute average wait time in 2016”  but at that same time Florida had closed polling places  in majority black and Latino areas and showed a statistical decline in their turnout. In Texas, if you can target just two counties, both with huge populations and huge numbers of democratic voters, you can affect overall outcome. You don’t have to slow down every single voter in the state for voter suppression to be the norm in that state.')
