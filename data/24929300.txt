I distinctly remember playing it at roller rinks and arcades and as a poor teenager I wouldn&#x27;t have been playing it if it was more than that. The first &quot;big&quot; game that was more than that (or maybe the first that was a dollar) was Dragon&#x27;s Lair. Perhaps this was a local thing, but in my area (suburban Minneapolis, MN, USA) it was a quarter.<p>The points about communications are huge though. If you didn&#x27;t grow up during that time you don&#x27;t understand how different it was just to try to get ahold of somebody at any random time.')
