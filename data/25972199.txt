This also applies to things like recklessness - the legal definition and the layman definition are different.<p>Furthermore, AFAIK it’s not that something like “market manipulation” is illegal - it’s usually more complex than that, and might only be illegal under circumstances XYZ.<p>It’s tempting to read laws as if they’re written in plain English, but it’s really more like a specialized dialect where words and phrases have different (and often complex) meanings.')
