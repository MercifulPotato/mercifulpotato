Item(by='johnnyapol', descendants=None, kids=[24735154], score=None, time=1602283067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732943, text='A course scheduler for my school, QuACS ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quacs&#x2F;quacs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quacs&#x2F;quacs</a> ) was built entirely around git scraping. Around 7:30AM EST each morning, a GitHub Action is kicked off to scrape various things (class hour schedule, course catalog, faculty directory, etc) and produce a commit containing the current data. Then, the website is rebuilt (also using GitHub Actions) and hosted on GitHub pages. The only thing that&#x27;s not static about the site is a call is made to our Student Information System (SIS) to retrieve current enrollment numbers in courses for seats.<p>It&#x27;s helpful as the data is now open for everyone in a nice format, so some other projects that utilize course data have been taking advantage of it.')
