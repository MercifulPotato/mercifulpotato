Namely:<p>- default parameter values<p>- union types<p>- names arguments<p>I would also throw in list and map literals, to do away with something like varargs.<p>All of these are much simpler, implementation-wise, than method overloading.  None would require anywhere near the compiler or bytecode-level support that method overloading does.  It just has a very low power to weight ratio, when other langauge features are considered.  And, unfortunately, it makes implementing all those other features (useful on their own) extremely difficult.')
