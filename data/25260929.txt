Yes, I think you put what I was trying to capture here really well. When I first attempted to learn programming I got stuck on how to _actually_ run the code and eventually gave up but then started in an actual class in college. So being painfully aware of the gaps that can be left in explanations I try to avoid creating more of them.<p>The ultimate solution that will probably happen at some point is a kind of collapsable&#x2F;expandable explanation that takes your knowledge into account and can omit the bits you are overly familiar with. One of the difficulties with this would be adoption from the creators so it needs to not have too much overheadâ€”writing is already difficult enough.')
