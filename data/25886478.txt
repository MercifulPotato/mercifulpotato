For history older than X, where X is a sufficiently distant time in the past, there will always be widespread consensus on the hash of the true chain, and numerous reputable parties that the hash of the true chain can be obtained from. Some poison node attack where fraudulent websites provide a hash of a fake history will not be viable.<p>Checkpointing is also currently being utilized in Bitcoin Core, so relying on it further is not a major departure on how things are currently done.<p>And at 100X current block sizes, validating the entire history with no checkpoints will still be possible for thousands of hobbyists with beefed up but still modest hardware&#x2F;bandwidth.<p>The empowerment from 100X more people being able to write transactions to the main chain, with their own private keys, will be well worth the relatively tolerable compromises on full node validation.')
