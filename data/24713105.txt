Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602107029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710739, text='&gt; This is way overstating the complicated-ness of marginal income taxes for 99.9% of people.<p>Only because it is a <i>cause</i> of 99.9% of people operating that way. The amount of tax and other paperwork involved is one of the primary reasons people don&#x27;t commonly take on small side jobs (or do but don&#x27;t report them). That is one of the major costs of the complexity.<p>&gt; And with the use of computers and electronic databases containing individual&#x27;s unique ID # (e.g. social security #) and the internet to transmit payroll information<p>You don&#x27;t see how this is, itself, a dramatic increase in complexity? With a flat tax individuals wouldn&#x27;t even need to <i>have</i> a unique ID.<p>That we might be able to dump the complexity of this on businesses instead of individuals isn&#x27;t making it go away, it&#x27;s just making it harder to do business because now you need complicated tax software and central databases.<p>Also, the individual is still doing paperwork, because how else is the employer getting their ID number?<p>&gt; This is irrelevant and I don&#x27;t see why anyone would have a problem with people &quot;minimizing&quot; taxes in the way shown as it&#x27;s above board, and tax policy taxes individuals, not families.<p>It&#x27;s clearly a violation of the spirit of a progressive tax system. If a rich person buys his nephew a car, he has to pay his own marginal tax rate on it. If he instead pays his nephew the value of the car as a salary, he pays no tax on the money and the nephew pays the lower marginal rate. And that assuming the entire thing isn&#x27;t just a kickback system where the rich person ends up with use of the car anyway and they privately agree to do it that way to split the &quot;savings&quot; from the marginal rate arbitrage.<p>It&#x27;s subverting the intent of the system, in a way that can&#x27;t be done if they were both paying the same marginal rate and progressivity was achieved by giving everyone a large fixed starting credit (i.e. UBI).<p>&gt; That kind of stuff doesn&#x27;t last too long in my experience though, once people get a taste of financial independence, the individuals in a &quot;family&quot; start looking out for themselves first.<p>But it&#x27;s still a dependent relationship. The nephew only continues to get the money by staying on the good side of his &quot;employer&quot; -- it&#x27;s the same situation where the wealthy use their money to control those in their social circle, but now you&#x27;re giving them a tax discount for doing it.')
