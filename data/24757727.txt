Things are open, people can buy stuff, etc.  You can buy toilet paper.<p>Item: For most of human history (millions of years) you would have been in a small band of maybe twelve to twenty-five people.  You would have encountered other bands only rarely.  Crowds are abnormal, &quot;isolation&quot; is highly relative.<p>What am I saying?  I don&#x27;t really know, exactly.<p>I am pretty sure that things are not going back to &quot;normal&quot; any time soon, and they may never go back.<p>Mass international travel is the kind of thing that just may not work with the reality of human infectious agents like viruses.  If we keep flying all over the place, and encroaching on more and more places where these viruses hang out (not to mention new old viruses thawing out of melting permafrost), we are going to have more global epidemics and pandemics.
