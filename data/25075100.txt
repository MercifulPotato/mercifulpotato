People can even get vaccinated, and we try to vaccinate as many as we can every year - not an option we have with Covid19.<p>A new disease with unpredictable long-term effects, that kills at least twice as many people as the flu despite unprecedented preventive measures is bound to cause more alarm.<p>Remember that regions hit early and unprepared were carting dead people by the truck load, most notably in Northern Italy. If we didn&#x27;t have lockdowns and other measures, that would have continued and escalated all over the world - we would have probably easily had 10 million or more dead just this year if we had treated this just like a flu.')
