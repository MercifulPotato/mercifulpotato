The term &#x27;electromagnetism&#x27; is wrong because it refers to the scientific field of study, rather than the field of engineering. It would also be iffy to call an electromagnet &#x27;electromagnetic&#x27;, even though it clearly involves both electricity and magnetism.<p>Also most electromotors will use magnets at some point, if only because it makes it many times easier to generate a reasonable amount of force.')
