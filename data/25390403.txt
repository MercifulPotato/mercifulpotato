Call it a civil duty; call people who wear their masks patriots&#x2F;hero; equate a refusal to do so is like kneeling during the national anthem or burning the flag.  I don&#x27;t really care what, but they need to do something.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of science supporting mask wearing as an effective way of mitigating the impact of covid.  If everyone wore masks in public and around any person who is not a member of their household, the economy would not be so stressed; hospitals would not be so stressed; and we could largely go back to &quot;normal.&quot;<p>At this point, every time you go out in public without a mask, you are lighting cash on fire.  You are hurting American companies and helping foreign ones.  No amount of government stimulus is going to bring back all of the people who died or were permanently crippled from covid.  Nor will it give back the year of schooling that children have lost due to covid.<p>The cynic in me thinks that some leaders are dragging their feet with the goal of dragging the American economy into the toilet so that they can blame the next guy for it.')
