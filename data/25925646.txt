Abstracting the market requirements completely, the new technologies are very slow to create an mvp out of.<p>For example, a week ago I started a Symfony (php framework) project and let it on default server side rendered setup. I bought a $20 css+html template. I created some entities and then just inserted a form for that entity into an html file using one line of code. It took me less than 1h to do this, with containerization and db setup and figuring out how things work in Symfony.<p>It blew my mind. I totally forgot how easy it was and I could focus on the things that mattered. To do the same thing in React&#x2F;Angular would have taken me much longer since I simply had to build 2 things (a frontend and a backend).  I think this is why today software takes longer to build: You simply have to build more behind the scenes so that the end customer sees a form&#x2F;page&#x2F;button.')
