What features of your clients do you use to prejudge them and make unfounded assumptions about them? Should your clients worry what clothes they wear in case you think it means they are gay, which maybe you associate with having Aids...  Personally I woukd think things like that are none of my business but apparently you don&#x27;t think like that.<p>Please don&#x27;t smooth the way for the wrong things. I can&#x27;t demand, obviously, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a request with the word please.<p>It seems to be a small thing but big things are made out of small things, and you and I can only do small things. All we have is the choice of which kinds of small things we do.')
