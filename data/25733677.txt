Item(by='eqvinox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610390189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733087, text='Your first paragraph is technically right but in actual reality cables with only 2 superspeed lanes exist.  Also, the article (and comment) aren&#x27;t solely about Type C; USB3 cables going to good ol&#x27; A&#x2F;B will only have 2 superspeed lanes.<p>Your second paragraph is half-wrong.  Thunderbolt cables must have an e-marker: refer to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usb.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;USB%20Type-C%20Spec%20R2.0%20-%20August%202019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usb.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;USB%20Type-C%20Spec%...</a> Figure F-1 (&quot;SOP&#x27;&quot;).  If the cable has an e-marker but doesn&#x27;t have the Thunderbolt ID, you get passive Gen2.  However, the problem is that USB3 TypeC-C cables aren&#x27;t required to have an e-marker at all...  in which case you drop out at the very first fork in the flow diagram.<p>This also leads to the funny situation that any 5A USB3 cable should work for Thunderbolt (because 5A requires the e-marker), while 3A cables may or may not work.  I mean, of course the power rating makes complete sense to determine TB3 capability, right? :D')
