We both believe that freedom of speech is generally a good thing and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re coming from a good place. But surely you must acknowledge that I should not be free to, for example, dox you right here and now (my freedom of speech is overruled by your expectation of privacy and right to pseudonymity); likewise I should not be free to go around telling all your friends and colleagues that in your free time you prostitute yourself to lonely grandmas in nursing homes. And even if, for whatever reason, you wanted to waive these rights, that does not give you the right to decide that <i>I</i> should waive my own claim to those rights.<p>The bottom line is that there <i>are</i> exceptions to freedom of speech, including morally-justifiable ones. We don&#x27;t need to treat adherence to freedom of speech as some sort of religion that admits no heresy. It is a generally good idea to distrust anyone who tells you how (not) to exercise your speech, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t independently derive from first principles a reasonable set of self-consistent morals around when it is proper to value other rights above it.')
