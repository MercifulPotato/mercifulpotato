We like mysteries and inside knowledge. We don’t always have the answers, but we know the problems that nobody else understands.<p>It’s an easy thing for propagandists to exploit. UFOs have been used to conceal weapons programs in plain sight. (In my home area, tomahawk missile testing in the 80s was often linked to that). Now anyone with a little money can mobilize an army of bots and idiots to push any message.')
