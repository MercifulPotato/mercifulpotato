I don&#x27;t know the lifecycle of the organic chemistry yet, as its discovery was only published this year so they haven&#x27;t had time to perform accelerated aging tests upon it, so maybe the solution might have to be replaced sooner than 50 years, but based upon what I saw in the paper I suspect not. With appropriate civil engineering (pozzolanic concrete, basalt rebar), the containers can be built to last 5+ centuries.<p>Build enough of these redox flow plants on the grid, pour in enough excess from all kinds of renewables, and hopefully in 3-7 generations our children won&#x27;t worry about coal-originated mercury poisoning from eating &quot;too much seafood&quot;.')
