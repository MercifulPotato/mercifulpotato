Other than that equal pay is more fair indeed. I think things have mostly gotten crazy along with some housing markets. Perhaps this will slowly disperse the extreme concentrations of wealth throughout countries with employers opening up more offices at cheaper locations. Or they will have to prove that those extreme concentrations result in equally large productivity&#x2F;quality improvements.')
