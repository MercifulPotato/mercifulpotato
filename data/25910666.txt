Item(by='javagram', descendants=None, kids=[25912860, 25910855], score=None, time=1611619391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910567, text='&gt; Seems trivial to &#x27;randomly&#x27; sample a select subset of the votes. And that does nothing to guard against vote dumps. Non existent voters cannot validate their votes.<p>Incorrect. Voter rolls have information about who voted, and this information is public record. You can simply call up a random sample of recorded 2020 voters in Georgia and ask them to confirm that they voted in the election.<p>There is no way to undetectably insert additional fake paper ballots (“vote dumps”) unless you are alleging a vast conspiracy that removed the real paper ballots from storage after the election and replaced them with new fake ones, without any whistleblowers on the (Republican-run and Trump-supporting) elections staff speaking out.')
