Apple does not end-to-end encrypt iCloud backups (on by default on every iOS device), and it serves as an effective cryptographic backdoor to the end-to-end encryption in iMessage by escrowing the keys (as well as the full message content and attachment history) to Apple each night, using <i>Apple</i> keys, which permits Apple (and by extension the FBI, <i>without a warrant</i>) to read every message sent or received by a device in such a default iCloud backup configuration, without ever touching that device.<p>They were going to fix this, but Apple Legal killed the project while it was underway.  This was done at FBI request, according to Reuters&#x27; sources.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive&#x2F;exclusive-apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-backups-after-fbi-complained-sources-idUSKBN1ZK1CT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusiv...</a>')
