If by &quot;working out&quot; you mean cementing the rule of left wing extremists.<p>Remember that Kickstarter didn&#x27;t unionise over wages or worker rights. They unionised because Kickstarter management removed a funding project that was violating their terms of use, by being filled with hatred towards and calls to violence against conservatives. The Kickstarter workers are so Marxist that they actually unionised the workplace in order to force it to re-instate the funding for this project, against the will of management.<p>The article goes into all this in detail. Kickstarter is exhibit A in the case against unions in tech. They aren&#x27;t gonna be used to give everyone a pay rise and more vacation. They will be used to try and cement the rule of radical extremists over management, they will force you to join them and fund them via union fees, and then they will use those fees to engage in anti-worker jeremiads against the white and asian men that make up most of the workforce.')
