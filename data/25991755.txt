I certainly don&#x27;t need a navigation system to get to work, home, my favorite bar, the homes of friends or family, the local supermarket or other stores I frequent, etc. I only need navigation a handful of times a year, and even then, I usually wish I&#x27;d reviewed and memorized the directions ahead of time rather than relied on blindly following step-by-step directions.<p>This just means that you&#x27;re blindly following older, possibly out-of-date directions.  What happens when you discover that a road is closed?  Do you pull over, pull out your maps, and try to guess what the next best path is, possibly involving a fair amount of backtracking?  I&#x27;ve done that before - I drove east to west across the US with just printed maps - and it&#x27;s not anything I look back on with nostalgia.')
