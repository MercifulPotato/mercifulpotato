The way I see it it can mean any of the following:<p>- Participants were asked to self-report their “race”, any that did not report “white” were excluded.<p>- Participants were given a pencil test to determine their “whiteness”, those failing were excluded.<p>- Participation was drawn from U.K. residents<p>&gt; <i>The extent of the over-representation is so great that edge cases are likely to have no impact in changing the overall bias of the data.</i><p>You say so, but I feel this distinction is more a cultural meme than biologically meritful. I for instance rarely see, prominently in the title “in those of Boston descent” when all participants were selected from Boston, which could produce similar biases.<p>I feel it is likely that it is highlighted because they feel that “race” is more meaningful than it biologically is, and are attempting to draw inferences from it.')
