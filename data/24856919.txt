Imagine something like archive.org where all search engines would get the content from. This could also be used to enforce copyright legislation (e.g. deletions of documents, etc...). Today, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to collect the data as google does, because most website owners won&#x27;t even allow that you crawl them (e.g. distill networks anti bot protection, etc...)<p>- Metrics (e.g. data from google analytics, dns resolvers, browser toolbards, browser statistics, etc...). Again this data should be available to everyone from a central authority.<p>Then there could be more independent search engines building on top of that data. If that doesn&#x27;t happen, then there will never be any competition. Todays copyright and data privacy laws even further strengthen a monopoly position, as smaller players will not even get access to some data (or at different pricing then google does)')
