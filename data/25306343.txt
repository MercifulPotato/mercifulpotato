I like the low-pressure life here. Rents are lower than the US too. We have socialised healthcare, safe gun-free cities. That&#x27;s worth a lot more than a number on a bank statement.<p>I hear that in the US people will lose their healthcare when they lose a job and it could cost $1000 a month (which is more than my monthly rent)! Here it&#x27;s simply free. That brings a lot of peace of mind.')
