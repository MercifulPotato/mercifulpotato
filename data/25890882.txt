It&#x27;s &quot;built for people who want cars, not people who don&#x27;t want cars&quot;.<p>I lived in Singapore for a while and there was a <i>very</i> strong demand for cars.  This is despite a world class public transport system and very high fees&#x2F;taxes on owning a car.  The point is, having a car is a luxury that many people desire.  Even with public transport alternatives.')
