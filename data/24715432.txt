Some of the material will remain undecomposed (or take a really long time) so it is a net carbon sink. I think this depends on properly sealing landfills and arranging extraction infrastructure.<p>Seems like a good resource:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;lmop&#x2F;basic-information-about-landfill-gas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;lmop&#x2F;basic-information-about-landfill-ga...</a><p>Another idea would be to curb methane generation or decomposition somehow. Apparently aerobic decomposition reduces or prevents the release of methane:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agric.wa.gov.au&#x2F;climate-change&#x2F;composting-avoid-methane-production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agric.wa.gov.au&#x2F;climate-change&#x2F;composting-avoid-...</a><p>Burning trash directly is also an alternative I guess, though one I&#x27;m not very comfortable with due to trace elements contained in everyday items -- surely some mercury and heavy metals will sneak into residues? (and then into the atmosphere and our lungs)')
