You need a &#x27;Employment Authorization Document&#x27; but I think that&#x27;s just a formality and is easy to do. I think there&#x27;s some funny rule about not &#x27;supporting&#x27; the J1 holder though, so I don&#x27;t know if you can earn more than her which you probably would if she&#x27;s a postdoc? I&#x27;m not a lawyer - you should instruct one.')
