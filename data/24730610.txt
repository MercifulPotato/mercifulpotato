No large industrial process to solve a global scaling problem can use even 1g of such metals.<p>There is a reason tons and tons of money in battery research is spent on removing every single metal that is even remotely expensive. Cobalt is being cut out. Gravity is on the getting cut soon. Once those are achieved the nickel will be replaced with sulfur. Once we have sulfur-silicon batteries the material cost of the battery will be incredibly low and will TWh factories the marginal production cost per battery will also be incredibly low.<p>Why should we spend lots of time and resources on a technology that has so many issues, when we already have a working much better solution, with much better prospect of being much better over time. In fact, in those technologies there is already a cost-curve happening right now that makes it cheaper every year and there is no reason why it should stop now.')
