Item(by='xyzelement', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608525048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486990, text='Laurent, this sounds dismal and I am sorry. What you talk about in paragraph one is a real thing - there are plenty of people who are your friends when everything is great but fade when you need a little bit of help (even if you&#x27;re not even asking them for it.) I experienced that recently, it&#x27;s really disappointing. But I also experienced a surprising amount of help from people I wasn&#x27;t even close to and it was just a reminder to me to default to be that kind of person. That&#x27;s actually what inspired my original post.<p>About your paragraph two, I kinda agree - there&#x27;s a big divide between people who talk a big game about inclusivity etc and those who quietly practice it as a matter of principle.<p>Anyway, for what it&#x27;s worth I hope things turn better for you, and I just want to say that destructiveness and self-destructiveness aren&#x27;t going to help anything.')
