It was not a metaphor.<p>The parent of my comment has the following reasoning:<p>1) If a model has a fundamental flaw that allows horrible things to persist despite their effort, the whole thing should be shut down.<p>2) PH has a model that allows horrible things to persist despite their effort<p>3) Therefore, PH should shut themselves down<p>My cash example was a counter-example to 1). I was not saying that PH should definitely not be shutdown, but that the manner the parent came to such a conclusion was flawed.<p>Specifically for PH, we don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s happening on their servers. How many illegal videos have been taken down? How many fell through the cracks? How many accounts have been banned?<p>That&#x27;s why I suggested that PH should be challenged in court, where evidence can be presented and an informed conclusion can be made. Otherwise, you are not weighing severity against benefits; you are just weighing your intuitions.')
