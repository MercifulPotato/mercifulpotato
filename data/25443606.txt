It being not user friendly is an advantage there. It often takes time to process as well, so while it&#x27;s still pending you can undo the transfer.<p>Over here, for a European transfer you need to fill in an IBAN number, which contains the country code of the destination. The transfer will fail as well if you don&#x27;t provide the right name with the number.<p>For international transfers, you need to provide even more information like BIC numbers, etc.<p>With crypto, it&#x27;s a random address. If you or someone else manipulates the address by even a single bit, it&#x27;s gone.')
