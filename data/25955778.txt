That one comes from stocks and the other from bonds and loans? Or the amount of risk associated with it?<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a difference for an investor who just picks whatever instrument yielding higher ROI, whether it is risky tech startups or risk free government bonds.<p>Tech startups have higher return on capital with higher risk, government bonds have low yield but small risk. Risk adjusted those terms seem interchangeable to me.')
