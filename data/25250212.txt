Unlimited 8k recording is neither a stated feature nor a goal of this camera. If you peg a smartphone CPU at 100% the system firmware will throttle it down to a safe limit. This is no different. The R5 is a tiny full-frame weather-sealed camera that&#x27;s designed to be hand held. Which other camera that is comparable does things better?')
