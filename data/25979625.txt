Animals will run or fight. An onion will make you cry with chemistry.<p>Think of any life function you do with movement. There are equivalent function for a tree that doesn&#x27;t require movement, and they are all chemistry.<p>Plants do a lot of amazingly sophisticated, almost impossible (photosynthesis!), chemistry to live. More chemistry means they need more genes.')
