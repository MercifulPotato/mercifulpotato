I’m not surprised it’s taking so long so salvage.<p>Ships have to be able to withstand substantial side forces (in both tension and compression) as part of torsional loading in normal operation.  There&#x27;s no internal framework needed.  Even if there was that would require a stupid amount of effort compared to just adding more lifting points.<p>It&#x27;s stupid easy to figure out lifting solution in this case because this is a new enough ship that CAD models exist.   If the owner doesn&#x27;t have the CAD files you pay whoever you need to to get them (you just need a low detail model of the hull and bulkheads, not the high detail models that include plumbing and whatnot, those would be needlessly expensive), then import the models and then run numbers until you get numbers you like (e.g. section sizes the crane guys won&#x27;t complain about and a safety factor corporate won&#x27;t complain about).  Then you tell the intern to use the CAD models to whip up a set of matching plates for lifting.  If they have extra time on their hands maybe they&#x27;ll make some random feature dong-shaped.  Then you forward that attachment to the sales guy at the steel supplier you usually use.<p>All this stuff is routine business for the parties involved.')
