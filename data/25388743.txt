I use DDG and while it&#x27;s better at this than Google, Mojeek seems to be better at showing more obscure sites.  To me, this is a blessing.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s just one search, but based on this one search alone I&#x27;ve added Mojeek to my bookmarks and will be using it to find the more off-beat paths on the net now.')
