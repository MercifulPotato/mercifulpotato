But you&#x27;re still gonna have to open it and turn the pages whatever scanner you use. And the book is open in the photo of it. If the photographer had moved a little closer, I bet you could read the text.<p>&gt; A phone light may not be healthy<p>The thing is, you and I have phones in our pockets and can test this theory. It&#x27;s an overcast day in Seattle. I turned out the room lights. It&#x27;s too dark for me to read comfortably, in fact, I have to struggle to read. Took out my phone, took a picture (phone light off). I can read the text in the photograph just fine (though it&#x27;s not as sharp as taking it with more light). I didn&#x27;t even use a stand, I held the phone in my shaky hand. I only took one snap, not a bunch and select the best.<p>You and everyone else can do this experiment yourself. But instead, you <i>assumed</i> it wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>&gt; pops up to tell you where you&#x27;re going wrong with D?<p>Sometimes they&#x27;re right. How do I feel about it? I feel embarrassed. But it&#x27;s hard to deny reality, and I accept my lumps and move on.<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t assume people are being stupid and you&#x27;re the only smart one.<p>Don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;m wrong about the phone camera without trying it yourself. I have tried it myself. I use my phone all the time to make copies of things it is inconvenient or impractical to scan, like oversize scrapbooks.<p>I challenge you to point your phone at documents you have at your desk and try it.<p>BTW, the phone camera also works great at literally taking &quot;screenshops&quot; of my computer screen. I do it because it&#x27;s faster&#x2F;easier than doing screen grabs.')
