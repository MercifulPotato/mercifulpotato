This is basically like what V8&#x27;s baseline JIT used to be and they switched to an interpreter without that much of a performance hit (and there&#x27;s still a lot of potential optimizations for their interpreter). LuaJIT 1&#x27;s compiler was similar, although somewhat more elaborate, and yet still routinely beaten by LuaJIT 2&#x27;s interpreter (to be fair LuaJIT 2&#x27;s interpreter is an insane feat of engineering).')
