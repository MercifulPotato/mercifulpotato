It doesn&#x27;t need to be, it just shows tables and graphs, but these days any new page seems to needlessly be made as a sluggish SPA.<p>If you want to check hospital bed occupancy by state, it&#x27;s 3 clicks, a 5 second spinner while it loads the results and shows the first 20 rows. It doesn&#x27;t sound that bad, unless you refresh, in that case it throws you back at the landing page.<p>This should be a static site, but even if not, this is actually slower than a server-side rendered page. SPAs are not desktop-like when they constantly request server data, even if they hide it with slow animations and spinners.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gits.igg.unam.mx&#x2F;red-irag-dashboard&#x2F;reviewHome" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gits.igg.unam.mx&#x2F;red-irag-dashboard&#x2F;reviewHome</a>')
