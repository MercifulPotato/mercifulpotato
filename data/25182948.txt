I prefer saying &quot;no thanks&quot; to the alternative I tend to face in europe--where the waiter only comes to take the order, drop off food, and take the bill.<p>Trying get a second bottle of wine or address a problem with one&#x27;s food is hard in Europe b&#x2F;c of that.<p>I wonder if it America&#x27;s rule that its rude to snap or point to grab the waiters attention.')
