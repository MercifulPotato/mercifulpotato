But actually the biggest pain point isn&#x27;t the hourly wages -- we all love to earn money, after all. The biggest pain point is labor minimums. If you need to hire from Department A, you need to hire a minimum of 3 people even when only 1 is needed. Or if you need to hire from Departments A and B, then you&#x27;re required to also hire Departments C, D, and E (all with their minimum crew requirements).<p>It makes for accomplishing smaller projects near prohibitively expensive. And typically you can&#x27;t gang together multiple projects in order to optimize labor usage.<p>Honestly, I have very mixed feelings about the arrangements I have to work with.')
