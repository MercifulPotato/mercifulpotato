If there is such a thing as a non-flaky e2e test, I have yet to see it. That, or the test does nothing.<p>Selenium seems fine for the most part. It&#x27;s a solid tool. Where it falls apart is when developers do not account for all the various ways the browser session will go wrong. There are simply too many variables at play. A&#x2F;B tests, cookies, popups, network conditions, machine speed (and current load). Writing e2e is like being blindfolded and tying one hand behind your back while your coworkers take turns spinning you in your chair.<p>It constantly amazes me that companies think they can put more tasks on a developer&#x27;s plate with zero impact to productivity. They really do believe that all testing is free and will somehow pay for itself. And yet a single QA human going through a simple testing plan will catch more actual bugs than hundreds of e2e tests that cost a literal fortune to maintain.')
