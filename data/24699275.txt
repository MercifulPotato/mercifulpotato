So for example you could set a threshold of 2 - 5 nodes&#x2F;droplets. This way you will always have at least 2 nodes running, even with zero traffic, because that is the minimum you requested. Likewise the upper bound limit of 5 nodes&#x2F;droplets would limit the maximum nodes that the service would generate.<p>So it autoscales up until it hits the maximum threshold and stops. Yes, if the app needed more resources than this, due to a spike in traffic, than performance would obviously suffer. But depending on the budget and needs of the project this might be the preferred outcome over incurring unexpectedly high server costs that you are not prepared to handle.')
