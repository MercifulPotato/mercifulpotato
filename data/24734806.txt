Item(by='rochester46', descendants=None, kids=[24735302], score=None, time=1602280429, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24734484, text='I was able to enable it myself through the web interface, no contacting customer support required.<p>&gt;And to enter it, you ... append it to your password?<p>Are you implying this is wrong somehow? It&#x27;s a fairly common way to do 2FA and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. On the backend, all it&#x27;s doing is taking the input, substringing the final 6 characters and inputting that as the code, and then uses the remaining characters as the password input. It&#x27;s essentially just a shortcut that allows you to log in with one click rather than having to enter your password, click submit, enter a code, then click submit again.<p>Per the FAQ, if you for some reason don&#x27;t want to append it to your password, it&#x27;ll send you to a normal &quot;Enter your 2FA code&quot; form like you&#x27;re probably used to.<p>The main issue for me is that the 2FA is locked to using the Symantec VIP 2FA app, which is disappointing from a usability standpoint.')
