FOSS ideas, open culture ideas. What the world wide web actual is... It&#x27;s not even that they disagree, they aren&#x27;t even aware.<p>We spent decades fiddling arguments with one another while  events just took their course. Politicians don&#x27;t understand or care about any of these ideas. The public doesn&#x27;t either. When &quot;something must be done&quot; about this or that... because digital culture progresses to some point, the deep well of ideas that dominated web culture have zero impact.<p>Ultimately, the encryption argument is being had between spooks and tech monopolies. Politicians are bystanders. There is no &quot;freedom of speech&quot; equivalent, no idea of the current technological age to guide them. No flag for the public to rally to.<p>The right to privacy is great, but we can&#x27;t just keep arguing by analogy. We need modern age thinking to define this for modern circumstances.')
