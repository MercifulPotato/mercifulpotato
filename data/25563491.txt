I will say though that a couple of times where I was able to find out how much the client was paying for me, there wasn&#x27;t as big of a gap as I had expected - I think the largest was about 6%, and when I was a lead my employer was losing about $15&#x2F;hr on me. I have to assume the team as a whole was profitable enough that they weren&#x27;t that concerned with it.')
