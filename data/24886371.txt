Most hard core third party voters would be pleasantly surprised to hear this ;-)<p>Then they would, objectively speaking, be complete idiots. It happens literally every major elections in other countries with better electoral systems.<p>For instance in NZ&#x27;s 53rd General Election which just concluded, despite Labour functionally sweeping the election, <i>four parties</i> exceeded 5% of the vote. And while I&#x27;m not going to say that it happens every time, it&#x27;s not an abnormal result at all for the country.<p>Furthermore, it misses the point I was underlying, which is that this only assists in funding the next election, which is only useful if you can transform this into a long-standing regular position, which <i>has never happened</i>. Getting 5% on an election doesn&#x27;t in and of itself give you <i>anything</i> in the US.')
