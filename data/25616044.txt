If you think that then you haven&#x27;t understood my argument.  Let me try again:<p>HIV was first identified in 1983, so by the mid-90s the virus had been known for just a little over 10 years.  Part of the prevailing hypothesis at the time was that the virus <i>occasionally</i> had incubation periods in excess of 10 years, but that it would inevitably kill you sooner or later.  I do not see, on the basis of the data available at the time, how you could definitively rule out the possibility that, for example, some people could successfully defend against HIV indefinitely based on some to-that-point unidentified immunological mechanism.  Or that AIDS was caused by some unidentified factor that weakened the immune system, and that HIV was an opportunistic infection that was harmless if you happened to have it without the actual unidentified causal factor for AIDS.  Or maybe HIV was a co-factor.  I can think of a lot of possibilities that AFAICT could not have been definitively ruled out based on what was known in 1995.<p>Yes, the establishment got it right.  But it is far from clear to me that it wasn&#x27;t for the wrong reasons.  The history of science is full of examples of the establishment getting it wrong.  It&#x27;s possible they just got lucky with HIV.')
