The field will only continue to grow, rapidly, for quite some time.<p>On top of that, you have something incredibly valuable to a budding data scientist: domain expertise. Being able to manipulate data is great, but to most effectively solve real-world problems you have to understand (or communicate very closely with someone who understands) the main problems in a domain. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve heard scientists frustrated by their lack of data skills, and data scientists frustrated by some arcane domain fact that stymies their model production.<p>Far from being a liability (or just a sunk cost) your background in agriculture will make you extremely valuable as a data scientist.')
