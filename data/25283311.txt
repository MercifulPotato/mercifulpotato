I usually code everything while writing&#x2F;running tests. Then it always works the first time I run it, so there’s no need for “edit; reload”.</i><p>I write tests, too. I guess I&#x27;m not as good of a software developer - because just as my code has bugs and unexpected edge cases, so do my tests, and they don&#x27;t catch every mistake I made, since I&#x27;m the one making them.')
