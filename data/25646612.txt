It&#x27;s called <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oneironotes.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oneironotes.com</a> and it&#x27;s a dream journal app for (lucid) dreamers. Think Evernote (or well, that&#x27;s a bit old now... let&#x27;s say Notion or Bear or Standard Notes... so, a note-taking app) specifically for &quot;oneironauts&quot;.<p>Currently there&#x27;s a pilot version as a PWA available for a lifetime subscription, but I&#x27;m working on more robust, mobile &amp; desktops apps.<p>As a sole founder &amp; developer I&#x27;ve been doing everything myself. I&#x27;m not really actively looking for a co-founder, but if anyone here is interested in working with me on this, send me a message! Technical or not, doesn&#x27;t really matter. The project would mostly benefit from someone who&#x27;s an experienced lucid dreamer, knows the niche and has excellent marketing &amp; community building and&#x2F;or design skills.
