Twitter was not in an enviable position from the get go. Trump had been on there for years before he ran for president, and banning the president IS a big deal no matter how you spin it.<p>There is some grey area that was definitely crossed the last few years where banning him from twitter would have been the right thing to do. It was long before Jan 6th but i don&#x27;t think it was so early in his term either.<p>What&#x27;s done is done, I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s over now tbh.')
