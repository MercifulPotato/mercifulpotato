If you just maintain space, most of your relationships can remain in neutral status for a long period of time. This is good for long term networking professionally.<p>Lately I’ve being doing worse because I compounded all these healthy (as healthy as can be) connections at work but fell into the trap of talking too much with them. Need to scale back and stick to the process.<p>I know this sounds sociopathic, but the amount of problems you can avoid by just shutting the fuck up and maintaining space (against all of our instincts to socialize) can be healthy for everyone.<p>This thing pays dividends in the long run since neither party will feel any which way about the other.
