No further description is given.<p>This could be something as simple as &quot;someone@harvard-faculty.org&quot;.<p>For the recipient, this is effectively indistinguishable from a legit address. Not just because people are unsophisticated, but because many orgs really do use this sort of ancillary domain for conducting real business.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Fortune 50 corps, hospitals, and banks make this mistake.<p>Even if Harvard does not, has not, and will not ever make this mistake, an outsider would not be surprised to see it.')
