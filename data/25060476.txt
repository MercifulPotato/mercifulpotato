Technically, they don’t need a third party to talk to each other. It seemed like there should be a communication option that took advantage of that.<p>Thus, Tin-Can:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;tin-can&#x2F;id1435356247" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;tin-can&#x2F;id1435356247</a><p>In short, TC is a one-to-many messaging app that has no central service.
