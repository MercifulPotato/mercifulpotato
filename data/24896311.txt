Imagine finding out that a straight, married politician of the strict &quot;family first&quot; type is logged into a gay dating site. That would lead to some interesting &quot;opportunities&quot; to get them to vote in ways they would not otherwise do.<p>There is also the possibility of leveraging this type of information in social engineering scenarios. Imagine getting compromising information on a sysadmin at a major commercial port and blackmailing a root password out of them, then leveraging that to set up a persistent threat and deleting their database every hour for a few weeks until they finally manage to lock you out again. The damage would be in the hundreds of millions. You could potentially do all the usual interesting things to foundries and&#x2F;or oil refineries too if you manage to compromise insiders. Really, the sky is the limit if you use your imagination a bit.')
