Then, they let it leak out of the lab.<p>But yet, reports now indicate that the virus existed in Europe, before it was identified in Wuhan. [1]<p>Any one else scratching their head here about this logic?<p>Oh wait.. I got it. A Chinese spy carried the vial to Europe, and release it into the population of Italy and Spain, months before they “accidentally” released it in Wuhan.<p>This must be the most plausible explanation for how it leaked out of a Chinese lab, and infected people in Europe, before it infected people in Wuhan.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DrEricDing&#x2F;status&#x2F;1345438947137236993" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DrEricDing&#x2F;status&#x2F;1345438947137236993</a>')
