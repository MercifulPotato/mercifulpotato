Maybe it was 100 years ago when it made no difference whether you live near a plain or a river (just easier access to water?). The problem is, housing become linked to economic opportunity in a particular region. For example, people who might have lived in Long Island might not have a much different life&#x2F;income than those who lived in ElPaso. It was just different weather.<p>But the mighty Manhattan changed this. The people who were born to Long Island&#x27;s households now have access to this city. This is an economic opportunity that is not available to anybody else&#x27;s in the entire world. Would it be fair to incorporate this economic opportunity in the value of this home? I think so. The market thinks so.<p>This is a result of the winner take all economies will live in. Whether you are a person, a city or a country. The same logic still applies.')
