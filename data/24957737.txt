Time can be included as an input. Previous system state can also be communicated forward in various ways (ex the LSTM architecture).<p>Conceptual context: I&#x27;ll agree, since that seems like it would require general abstract reasoning ability (ie strong AI). Similarly, robust treatment <i>in the general case</i> of physical continuity and cause and effect both seem like special cases of conceptual context to me.<p>That being said, bear in mind that we already have examples of not so robust treatment for special cases of physical continuity as well as cause and effect.
