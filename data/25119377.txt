Just need to find some interesting topics to start.<p>Also more broadly I believe that mathematical derivations in scientific papers should be done computer algebra systems and term rewriting. They would be easier to check, reproduce and leave no ambiguities. It’s probably still many years from now but I hope to see that someday.')
