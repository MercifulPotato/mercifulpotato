I haven’t tested that out myself, but we do have a note from Samsung. They say The Frame needs almost the same amount of electricity in Art Mode as in TV mode. In hard figures, external reports talk of 100 watts in TV mode and 60 to 130 watts in Art Mode, depending how bright the room is. While Samsung themselves give 118 watts as the average value, they don’t specify if this is while watching TV of admiring art. But we can safely assume this isn’t a top-scoring environmentally friendly product yet.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitec.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;page&#x2F;the-exciting-bit-is-when-you-turn-it-off-we-put-samsungs-the-frame-to-the-test-6219" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitec.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;page&#x2F;the-exciting-bit-is-when-you-...</a>')
