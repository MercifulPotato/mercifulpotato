Even better, using Windows Scriptlets let me write dynamically-compiled COM components in JavaScript that I would call from the web pages. As a result, I could launch updates independently in a microservice-like fashion, share the same libraries (like validation) on client and server, and use the same COM components in crons. Not bad at all! Also, because we had COM components, we could now use Window&#x27;s built-in message queue MSMQ for async processes like payment transactions. I started doing this in 2003 - looking back, that was a pretty good developer experience.')
