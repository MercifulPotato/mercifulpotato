In fact, the new &quot;Redux Essentials&quot; [0] and &quot;Redux Fundamentals&quot; [1] core docs tutorials specifically say &quot;we assume you know React already&quot; as a prerequisite.  (And yes, I really wish bootcamps didn&#x27;t throw devs straight into Redux, but I understand why that happens.  That&#x27;s a large part of why I just rewrote our tutorials.)<p>&gt; Not many people advocate redux these days, which I find unfortunate given how good redux toolkit makes it.<p>Appreciate the kind words :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;essentials&#x2F;part-1-overview-concepts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;essentials&#x2F;part-1-overview-co...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;fundamentals&#x2F;part-1-overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;fundamentals&#x2F;part-1-overview</a>')
