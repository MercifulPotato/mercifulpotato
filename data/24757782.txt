Think of articles about health. Articles about how to get rich. Articles about a new revolutionary cleaning device. Probably all fake. But in some cases maybe not. \nIts not up to Facebook to decide these matters.\nFacebook should change into what it should be. A social network for friends. Not a crappy advertising agent. In the latter case it&#x27;s best to forbid the entire business called Facebook.')
