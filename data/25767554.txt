I was young enough when I started down this path that I wasn&#x27;t really conscious of the decisions I was making and its impact on my emotional wellbeing, it was just an internalized reaction to losing my friends over and over.<p>When I stopped trying to make friends I let my ability to form meaningful connections rot. Being around people made me sad because I wouldn&#x27;t let anyone know me and that made me feel misunderstood, like I didn&#x27;t belong. And being alone all the time just would sap all colour from life.<p>I made a conscious effort to be more forthcoming and open with people last year and its made a world of difference for me. I&#x27;m still pretty miserable, somedays can be pretty rough, but life is more than just sadness and emptiness now.<p>I only realized this when I started smoking pot constantly outside of work. It helped me calm down and see things for what they really were. I wouldn&#x27;t outright recommend becoming a pothead like me, especially if you have mental issues, since it can be dangerous but I&#x27;d strongly recommend talking to a professional.<p>I was in such an awful state of mind that I couldn&#x27;t think rationally even though I was convinced I was.
