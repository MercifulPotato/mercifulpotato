An x86 instruction can theoretically have an unbounded number of prefixes, meaningful only after decoding something after that - maybe you can do it with a FSM but an enormous one.<p>All in all this doesn&#x27;t sound like a master&#x27;s project in the slightest, because remember I said design and verify not just build a never-used-again toy.<p>There have been probably hundreds of millions of dollars spent on this over the years, and they&#x27;re basically stuck on the current width and multiple pipeline stages.')
