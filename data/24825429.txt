If you can do it without meta-programming, then you should.<p>If you start meta-programming when you don&#x27;t have to, then you have already lost.  If you are doing this when you shouldn&#x27;t, and then you experience pain and say, &quot;This system needs to be fixed&quot;, then make sure you fix the correct part of the system: yourself.<p>&gt; JS [[Prototype]] is equivalent of class hierarchy.<p>Which <i>nobody</i> is futzing around with (because they can&#x27;t, and they shouldn&#x27;t futz with it anyway) on the level that you&#x27;re insisting we do, in the ordinary course of writing programs.  (The level where you are seeing &quot;problems&quot;.)  Once again: keep that stuff in your REPL.  If you are editing a regular source file that will be committed to the repo and you are typing out &quot;prototype&quot; or &quot;__proto__&quot; or &quot;setPrototypeOf&quot; more than once or twice every 10k lines, then you&#x27;re almost definitely doing something wrong.<p>&gt; You&#x27;ve got burned by Java and C++, bad for you.<p>No, it&#x27;s that the world is burning because of thousands of programmers who can&#x27;t behave responsibly because they pick up a dynamic language and say, &quot;There are no adults around to discipline me, so now is the time to go nuts.&quot;<p>(And the irony is that this thread exists because of your complaints about JS and how it burns you, where I started out arguing that JS is fine at the beginning.  But now you&#x27;re the champion for JS?)')
