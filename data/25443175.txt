At my $PREVIOUS work place, we answered all questions from auditors and RFPs using the most favorable interpretation towards us of the question.<p>For example, one of our audits for our product asked if we implemented admin idle session timeout with timeout of less than 15 minutes. There was 3 admin panels: one with 10 minute idle session timeout, one with 1 hour idle session timeout, and one with no idle session timeout. The manager said after I explained the 3 admin panels to him something like &quot;since one does have idle session timeout of less than 15 minutes, we answer yes to the audit question&quot;.')
