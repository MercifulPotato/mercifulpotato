If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve realized over a number of jobs where I tried to do things right, it&#x27;s that most of the time all the work you do doesn&#x27;t matter, won&#x27;t last, and your bosses only care that they can list some feature on the product page. They define good programmer as someone who gets their tickets in on time, and if it matters, they can budget for you to improve it with another one.<p>It&#x27;s also totally fine to waste some of your user&#x27;s time if you first create value for them that they didn&#x27;t have before. That&#x27;s the nature of iteration and MVPs')
