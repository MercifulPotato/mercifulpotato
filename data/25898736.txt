My chats in Signal can&#x27;t be disrupted by a change in MX records.<p>&gt; <i>In any case, it would be possible to further enhance email using something like SMTorP so that .onion addresses are used instead.</i><p>Yes, but then why are you using email at all? The whole point of email has been that it uses the domain registry as a routing mechanism.<p>It&#x27;s like telling people that the WWW is decentralized as long as you use .onion addresses. That&#x27;s not true because as soon as you get off of public domains, you&#x27;re not on the WWW anymore.<p>&gt; <i>The same is true of any system which is proposed as an alternative to email.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think you understand this topic.<p>There are protocols with encryption schemes built into them. Email is not one of those. From the article I linked:<p>&gt; &quot;A number of standards exist for end-to-end email encryption, but so far, none have reached critical mass with vendors. Take Symantec. It supports both the S&#x2F;MIME and PGP&#x2F;MIME encryption, says Symantec&#x27;s Kriese. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the system easily interoperates with those of other vendors.&quot;<p>That is in contrast to Signal Protocol[1], where all clients&#x27; E2EE are compatible with each other as long as they&#x27;re using the same protocol.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Signal_Protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Signal_Protocol</a>')
