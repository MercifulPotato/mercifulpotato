This is no more useful than asking me whether I&#x27;m in favour of the universe being a simulation.<p>I&#x27;m in favour of you building it. Then let&#x27;s see what happens. Does that answer your question?<p>&gt; <i>I just don&#x27;t see how whatever advantages you claim facebook has given to &#x27;assholes&#x27;, it hasn&#x27;t given to e.g. BLM twice over- with feeds tuned to engagement and rage etc. and also the Official Blessing.</i><p>What of it? I&#x27;ve already said Facebook has too much influence. You can be against having a king, and in favour of the king doing something about, idk, taxes.<p>&gt; <i>Would you deny facebook to everyone if you could, because the shape of facebook-like sites is corrosive to the mind in and of itself, in a way that private chatrooms aren&#x27;t?</i><p>This is such a weird question. Are you asking if I&#x27;m in favour of Facebook existing? I already said I&#x27;m not. Or is your question &quot;if you were King of the World &amp; Master of the Universe, would you make Facebook disappear?&quot;, which, again, this isn&#x27;t the Matrix.<p>These aren&#x27;t useful questions, you&#x27;re just trying to figure out what my stances are. My positions don&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m just trying to try to help you understand a concept which is <i>incredibly easy</i> to grok to a lot of people.')
