Slack is fantastic as well, especially the paid version.  If Discord can pivot into the &quot;professional&quot; space, I would certainly try it out.<p>The problem I have is that all of my work situations are tied to MS Teams and that&#x27;s likely to never change within the ORG I&#x27;m contracting for.  Teams is absolute trash compared to Slack.  Between downtime, the way channels are organized, the way files are organized, the way discussions are organized, the way notifications are presented, I just can&#x27;t get any comfort level with it.  No one at my company even uses Teams for voice&#x2F;video conferencing because it&#x27;s so poorly performing (I&#x27;ve not experienced this tho), we all have to use Zoom.<p>I never thought Discord was going to do more than what something like Teamspeak did, but they have really done an incredible job.  They have pretty much single handedly made native game voice chat irrelevant.')
