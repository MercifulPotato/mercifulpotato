But given that the US is awash in Chinese equipment and software, using that argument for <i>this</i> pernicious attempt at a ban is foolish sophistry. It is a farcical foundation for a justification.<p>It&#x27;s telling that one of the most common, and earliest, comments to justify a TikTok ban is &quot;well China banned&#x2F;blocked XXXX&quot;. It is similar to this administration repeatedly justifying super-spreader events by citing looters. Is that really the standard you are striving towards?<p>&quot;Would you feel different if TikTok were software of Russian origin?&quot;<p>No, I wouldn&#x27;t at all. That is absurd. Russia actually has a fairly healthy software industry, including many games and even <i>security</i> tools like Kaspersky.')
