The argument is that if you want to watch it again then you&#x27;ll have to rent it again, and after a couple times you would have saved money by buying it. That&#x27;s not true if there&#x27;s a decent chance buying it still wouldn&#x27;t let you watch it again in a couple years.<p>I&#x27;ve just accepted that I&#x27;ll only be able to watch things once and that&#x27;s fine, I have much better things to do with my life than watch movies (like starting arguments on HN.)')
