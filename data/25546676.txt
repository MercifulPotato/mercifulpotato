I feel like this is key to avoiding the chicken-and-egg effect.<p>Now that Apple has proven it to be possible, others may follow. Ultimately, users don&#x27;t care about their CPU architecture, they care about being able to run their software.<p>If you make users choose between a new platform that promises to &quot;soon&quot; be able to run 80% of the software (but currently runs at best 50%) or a slower, more expensive  version that runs everything, the new platform has no chance.<p>If the new platform can run the existing software, albeit &quot;only&quot; as fast as their old platform (because the advances in CPU speed make up for the emulation overhead), this huge obstacle simply disappears.')
