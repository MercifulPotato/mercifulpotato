It made me a better entrepreneur and business owner later, which is what I really wanted to do.<p>But as I&#x27;ve gotten older and have a family now I&#x27;ve been removing obligations for my businesses. And working more normal schedules. Taking random times off to help. Being better at triaging what&#x27;s really needed from my time.<p>Yet, I wouldn&#x27;t have change a thing with my path. It&#x27;s hard to get to financial freedom and the goal of owning your own businesses with 40 hrs a week.<p>I don&#x27;t think working more than the normal is necessarily a bad thing. Some people actually do enjoy their jobs. Or their team. Or they enjoy learning.<p>I know it&#x27;s hard for some people to understand why some people are workaholics. I certainly have friends that don&#x27;t like their jobs that have said I work too much. If you hate your 40 hour job, it&#x27;s hard to imagine doing any more than that.<p>In the right environment, the 7+ hours per week extra to be considered a workaholic isn&#x27;t much different from reading books or practicing your craft in your free time.')
