When those practices are sufficient the plastic isn’t an issue (or is much less of an issue).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;plastic-pollution#where-does-our-plastic-accumulate-in-the-ocean-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-futures" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;plastic-pollution#where-does-our-...</a><p>The summary of those details from that document:<p>“However, it is the management of plastic waste that determines the risk of plastic entering the ocean. High-income countries have very effect waste management systems; mismanaged waste – and plastic that ends up in the oceans – is therefore very rare. Poor waste management across many middle- and low-income countries means that these are the main sources of global ocean plastic pollution\nThis makes the improvement of waste management systems across the world critical to reducing plastic pollution.\nAn estimated 20 percent of all plastic waste in the oceans comes from marine sources. In some regions, marine sources dominate: More than half of plastics in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) come from fishing nets, ropes and lines”.<p>If this is true, then the best way to address the pollution would be to address those poor practices.')
