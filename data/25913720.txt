Obviously, he says he cannot &quot;time the market&quot;, but it seems clear only small remnants of humanity will be left once we hit a tipping point where food costs exceed our remaining energy stores. When that happens, discussions of Cold war era &quot;first strikes&quot; will be revived by those who hold the nukes.<p>The coming collapse of modern civilization has been talked about since before we were born. Everyone just laughs as those original predictors grew old and died, thinking the predictors were wrong, when in reality we&#x27;re just incapable of dealing with future risks of this magnitude and long timeline.<p>We are watching a crash happen that spans longer than a human lifespan, therefore most of us are unable to even comprehend the danger. Maybe 1% of us see it. I should be carving this in stone for future historians to dig up, not write it in a server that will be certainly destroyed.<p>Sadly other than reducing his footprint and not reproducing, pretty much all my friend has is weed and short term distractions to keep him alive and sane. He says he&#x27;s sorry he&#x27;s not smart enough to know how to save humanity, just smart enough to know we&#x27;re doomed.<p>He says he would just take the early exit and reduce his footprint further, but there&#x27;s too much joy in the lives of his loved ones to hurt them that way. They wouldn&#x27;t understand, they don&#x27;t see it yet, or think the world burning is prophesied and can&#x27;t be altered. So he&#x27;s trapped, but he can distract himself sufficiently well and toke when he cannot.<p>I&#x27;m truly sad for my friend, and sad for all of us.')
