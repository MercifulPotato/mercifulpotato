Item(by='HexagonalKitten', descendants=None, kids=[25382057], score=None, time=1607655846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380150, text='&gt; If you&#x27;re open to a real example, the &quot;pronoun police&quot; at my workplace suggest that when writing about hiring candidates, we use singular &quot;they&quot; instead of &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, in order not to call too much attention to the gender of that person when those evaluations are read by decision makers. The intent is to reduce any possible gender bias in hiring.<p>I am, and I like that. Like the example of hiring musicians after a blind listening. Kind of the whole schtick of that music show where the hosts spin around only after listening to the artist. fwiw, that&#x27;s actually not considered progressive anymore because it amplifies the homogeneity of choice. Because of this or that factor, many cellists are one sex, or the QA department skews heavily towards one demographic. Without active HR grooming you don&#x27;t get those SV pleasing diversity numbers where you have a numerical microcosm of the country. But yes, the idea of a meritocracy and blind hiring is always refreshing.<p>&gt; To my eyes, in this thread, the person who is harping on pronouns the most, seems to be closest to having a mental breakdown over them, who can most accurately be described as &quot;pronoun police&quot;, and who shows the greatest explicit tendency to control others&#x27; use of pronouns, is also the person who in the first place corrected an in-the-wild usage of singular &quot;them&quot; to &quot;him&quot;.<p>Have you cared for groups of children? Like all bullies, SJWs try to make the victim appear the aggressor. As a current example, Letitia Wright got taken in by pseudo-science, but people attacked her (viciously!) for retweeting it even though she had been victimized by the &quot;hoax&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re pushing a message that KILLS PEOPLE! F you, cword&quot;, and so forth. Presumably if they found anyone taken in by Letitia&#x27;s post they&#x27;d attack them too. Simply put, none of this is what you&#x27;d do to actually fix a problem, or if you actually cared about people.<p>In our case, look at how the person who used &quot;them&quot; responded to the criticism. They went straight to trying to ideological slander.<p>&gt;&gt; It seems like you dislike trans folk. I&#x27;m not sure what they did to hurt you, but I suspect your fears and hate are the result of conditioning.<p>Accusations of transphobia. That&#x27;s not the kind of allyship that anyone needs. In fact, that&#x27;s almost exactly how a troll who wanted to make people hate each other would act.<p>Yes, this is obviously a non-problem, but by their own rules, the OP assumed someone&#x27;s pronouns. And when called on this they didn&#x27;t respond reasonably but lashed out with essentially accusations of hate. If they intend to be helpful they should check themselves before they wreck their allies.')
