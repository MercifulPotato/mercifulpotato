The Web itself is the second piece of evidence - despite all the UX experts&#x27; love for &quot;simplicity&quot; and &quot;intuitiveness&quot;, every single website looks entirely unlike any other website.

Minimizing unnecessary complexity is a good thing, but removing capabilities for sake of further UI simplification is taking things overboard.<p>(I&#x27;m forming a new hypothesis that tries to explain why this happens: it&#x27;s because SaaS products are trying to turn a <i>workflow</i> into a service. So anything that deviates from their perfect workflow, including any flexibility, integration points, or general ability for self-help, is ruthlessly pruned. The users must follow the prescribed workflow.)')
