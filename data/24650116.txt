That&#x27;s the scientific process. The authors need to defend the null hypothesis as vigorously as you can.<p>The authors posit plausible evidence (observed variance across states with different introduction dates of laws, car ownership, going from 2 to 3 children) that car seat laws was a deterrent to having more than 2 children. A substantial criticism would be to come up with some possible confounders or alternative model of the variation. Saying that it might be caused by anything is a low effort dismissal.<p>&gt; Have you ever gone through a peer review process? Seriously?<p>Yes I have, on both sides. Maybe it differs by field, but I (and my fellow PhD students) took it serious enough that we rarely read and finished writing a peer review within a single day. (This was mostly on economic theory &#x2F; methodology papers, where even understanding the paper can take multiple days.)')
