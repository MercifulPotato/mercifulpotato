If I read a paper that long about liquid rocket fuels I&#x27;d learn that 99% of the things I might want to use as a rocket fuel won&#x27;t work and I really have a choice of Hydrogen, Methane or RP-8 and Oxygen.<p>If you were out to &quot;build a better BERT&quot;,  even a slightly better BERT,  that paper doesn&#x27;t give clear guidelines about what you should do.<p>It&#x27;s got all the trappings of a field which is preparadigmatic but could be mistaken for paradigmatic because of the sheer volume of researchers,  conferences,  papers,  etc.')
