HIV would be interesting though.<p>And bacteria aren&#x27;t in general limited by immune response.  The immune system has zero difficulty detecting a bacterial infection, but it happens at a wildly different scale and can&#x27;t be fought with a fundamentally chemical means like our bodies do with virii.<p>And the point about prions seems to misunderstand this technique.  The way an mRNA vaccine works is by transmitting <i>blueprints</i> for a viral protein (but not the rest of the virus) into the body&#x27;s cells, where ribosomes then synthesize the disembodied proteins, which get detected as &quot;foreign invaders&quot; and produce a lasting immune response which would then be effective against the real virus.<p>Prions, remember, are just misfolded versions of your body&#x27;s own proteins.   They have the same sequence of amino acids as &quot;correct&quot; proteins and just an incorrect shape.  mRNA only transmits the sequence, not the shape.  And in any case your cell&#x27;s DNA already <i>has</i> the sequence encoded, because you&#x27;re not dead.')
