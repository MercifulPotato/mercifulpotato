If I send a PPT you are almost saying to a client “you can edit this if you want, because I provided it in a format which is designed for editing rather than a format that was designed for view-only”.<p>99% of the time it stops the “Oh great, so when you took that presentation we prepared for you as a consultancy, you kept our logo on it but changed the content and also removed our caveats!”<p>Also it stops people seeing my personal notes and comments that I have included throughout the document if it’s a ppt, and it also stops me sharing the data behind any graphs which is normally internally stored in the ppt file. You can set a ppt as view only, but nobody does it and clients don’t like it.')
