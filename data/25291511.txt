Item(by='lopmotr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607016210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288380, text='I once taught in a physics curriculum that went a step beyond calculators. Students never had to do numerical calculations in the exams. For example, a question asking you to find a force, could have an answer like &quot;F=ma where m=3 kg and a=2m&#x2F;s&quot;. There were higher grades for showing insight into the physics that you could get by looking at the form of the symbolic equations you&#x27;d derived but would have trouble noticing if you&#x27;d substituted numbers early on.<p>I wish I had learned times tables properly as a kid though. I struggle with things like 6*7 on a near daily basis for my work and general life. Not really for number sense but for not having to shift my attention to a basic math problem while I&#x27;m working on something else.')
