That figure isn&#x27;t close to true in Chicagoland at least, unless you&#x27;re commuting suburbs to the boonies (and even then, you&#x27;d need to be lucky and have a tollway route).  A 30 mile commute into the city, with traffic, takes like 50-70 minutes, a large reason why Metra commuter rail is so popular.')
