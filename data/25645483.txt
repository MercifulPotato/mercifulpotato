Avoiding taxes (e.g. Amazon&#x27;s Project Goldcrest) to undercut competitors, mishandling data for profit, and then abusing market dominant positions to prevent European competitors from rising up; forcing those potential competitors to sell to US firms.<p>You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s probably too late to reverse all of this economic damage that the US has intentionally caused.
