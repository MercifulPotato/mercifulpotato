Mechanical design, welding, electricity, electronic design, programming, etc. Crazy. That company started with 2 brothers, and they did everything from top to bottom with only the both of them.<p>It was really inspiring to see how some people can have knowledge and skills (eg welding) in so many fields, and are able to pull it off commercially.')
