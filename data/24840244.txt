There would be no single point of attack, and therefore harder to do social engineering by manipulating the feeds.<p>This is <i>precisely</i> what we&#x27;re trying to propose in the original article :)<p>In terms of UI, visualising the filters could be as simple as &quot;98% of the rooms in this list have been hidden by your #nsfw filter&quot;, letting you peek behind the filter to see what you&#x27;re missing, etc.')
