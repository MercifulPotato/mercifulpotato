What is the manufacturing&#x2F;resource cost of making batteries? What is the efficiency or cost of producing the electricity to charge the batteries? How does this compare to making the photocatalyst and compressing and&#x2F;or distributing the hydrogen compare? I remember seeing a breakdown of making batteries, distributing them, and charging them, compared with oil resource procurement, refining, and distribution. I&#x27;ll take a look again, but does anyone have such a table reference? Thanks!')
