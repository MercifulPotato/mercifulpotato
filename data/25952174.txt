I&#x27;d be super curious to know is anyone&#x27;s just tried plugging the hard drive into another controller. Won&#x27;t surprise me at all if the &quot;security&quot; here is just not starting the USD drive controller without the correct pin being entered. There isn&#x27;t any evidence here for enough hardware to turn that pin into an encryption key and encrypt&#x2F;decrypt data on the fly. (I guess it&#x27;s possible that&#x27;s all built into the USB controller?)')
