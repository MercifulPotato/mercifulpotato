These people are crazy smart and experienced. Nobody slacks, everyone&#x27;s valuable and productive.<p>- I&#x27;m challenged in my daily work. It&#x27;s never boring (I work on an internal tool that&#x27;s very complex). All my previous jobs have been &quot;plop features on this CRUD app&quot;. I&#x27;m positive this is one of the best places to become a highly competent software engineer as fast as possible.<p>- Comp is nearly double my previous job. After being on the inside, seeing how it&#x27;s run and how competent everyone is at their job, I&#x27;m also pretty bullish on the company&#x27;s future and stock price.<p>- I get to write Rust daily. It&#x27;s still in early stages of being supported at FB but had a decent following and should be well supported soon. Developer experience is extremely important to me and Rust is just great to work with.<p>- My manager is great. Very empathetic and I trust him with any problem I have, he always does his best to solve any issue I bring up.<p>- Internal mobility is great. I&#x27;m thinking after a couple years on my current team I can go work on VR, Rust infra, Pytorch, or whatever else seems interesting, anywhere FB has an office. Can go full remote after one more promo.<p>- The company is structured so that incentives are fairly well aligned. All the organizations I&#x27;ve been at previously had problems with this. It&#x27;s not easy to game the system or be too self-serving here.<p>- Internally, dissenting voices are not silenced. There&#x27;s a healthy discourse about the company&#x27;s decisions, people are very free to bash it or Zuck without fear of repercussions.<p>- I think that the hate FB gets is somewhat deserved but not to the extent that HN believes it is. There are a lot of media stories that are exaggerated or plain false (example: FB does not sell your data to anyone), but I&#x27;d only know that because I get to hear both sides of the argument. There&#x27;s also a perception of neglect or malevolence that is associated with FB, but the truth is that solving every single problem with running a social network is incredibly difficult and despite FB&#x27;s size, it&#x27;s not possible to make everyone happy. Example: conservatives complain that FB is censoring them unfairly, progressives think FB isn&#x27;t doing enough to counter hate speech. Finding the perfect balance is virtually impossible. We&#x27;ve also come a very long way since Cambridge Analytica, there&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of resources being put towards making sure there are no privacy violations. FB is the least popular big tech company but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any less ethical than Google or Amazon.<p>- I also think FB&#x27;s benefit to the world is largely underestimated by HN. Reducing friction for finding and maintaining human relationships is incredibly important. We&#x27;re also loved by small businesses, countless companies may not exist without FB advertising.<p>- It&#x27;s the only big tech company that would give me the time of day. I probably work have taken a Google offer if I had the choice.<p>I intend to be here for a few years, at least.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s all good: FB infra is all in-house and breaks often. Hack (PHP with a type system duct-taped on) sucks, is totally proprietary, and is everywhere at FB. The company steals product ideas from other companies. It&#x27;s secretly more or less stack ranked, so there&#x27;s a lot more stress than other companies. I&#x27;m very wary of who I tell where I work given the negative sentiment.')
