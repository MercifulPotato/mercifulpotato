This is ACTUALLY fascism (a word that&#x27;s thrown around wrongly many times): for years the people&#x27;s voice has been heard, and now we have a leader (and many supporters) that don&#x27;t support a democratic system anymore. That&#x27;s fine, democracy isn&#x27;t the only available system, but it&#x27;s a hallmark of the USA.')
