Folks around here take free-as-in-free-software seriously, and good for them (us).  I&#x27;m confident the median iPhone user just downloads apps and uses them; they haven&#x27;t thought much about alternate app stores and probably wouldn&#x27;t use them if they were available. I&#x27;m pretty sure that iPhone users who complain about software freedom are a tiny minority of all users, especially since the wild world of rooted Android phones is out there for people who feel strongly about such things.<p>I do get your point, though: consoles are luxury playthings if you&#x27;re not in professional esports, and phones are a de facto necessity of modern life. It doesn&#x27;t follow that most, or even many, iPhone users, are discontented with Apple&#x27;s policies: I figure the bulk of them haven&#x27;t thought about it once, quite sure my mother and brother haven&#x27;t.')
