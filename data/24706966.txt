In fact, I think I may have actually used bash; and if I were doing it today I&#x27;d probably use python.  The point was to have something that you could reasonably guess what it was doing from looking at it.  You don&#x27;t have to know anything about perl replace &quot;A&quot; with &quot;E&quot; and vice versa.<p>And although I wouldn&#x27;t call this exercise &quot;fun&quot;, it&#x27;s something that connects with a part of their life they understand.  Nobody would actually write a script like this, but someone could totally write a function like this as part of a larger program, and have exactly the kind of &quot;bug&quot; that was displayed there; or, could be hacked in exactly the same way.<p>Kids are sharp enough to know when a skill is going to be useful, even if it&#x27;s not &quot;fun&quot;.')
