However, if the lie on Twitter is used to commit fraud, than it is no different than getting a court order to track down someone who used a phone call to commit fraud.<p>This isn’t charging someone with lying in a tweet. This is someone who used twitter to contact people in order to commit a crime (or at least that is what is alleged in court)... they can use the law to attempt to find out who this user is.')
