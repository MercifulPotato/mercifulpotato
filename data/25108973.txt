The HN guidelines keep this in mind and are designed to inspire curiosity and humility.<p>However, the quoted moderator narrative appears to pin the blame on the OP; there&#x27;s a non-zero affect of &quot;you should have know better.&quot;<p>Should he?  A ton of posts like these get squashed or ignored, some much less thoughtful ones get celebrated, and the attitude towards big companies like Facebook or Google has changed over the years.  COVID has additionally made people behave in unexpected ways.  It&#x27;s really hard to predict the reaction of the crowd these days.<p>I have been deeply disappointed with the HN moderation in the past few months.  At the very least, a &quot;you should have known better&quot; message should be delivered in private and not posted as conspicuously as this one.')
