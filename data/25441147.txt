As somebody how&#x27;s native language is very dissimilar to English, my intuitive language rules are no help speaking English. The grammar you are taught at school is descriptive of English and not a prescription. The distinction s very similar to &quot;laws in physics&quot;. Nature doesn&#x27;t really care about the rules we impose on it.<p>Learning grammar alone is not enough. Learning vocabulary alone is not enough. Immersing yourself to a language without a guide (like your parents guided you into language) is completely ineffective.<p>Grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation are equally important if you want to get fluent in both spoken and written communication in a different language.')
