Convolution follows from these -- though there&#x27;s something to be said for putting convolution above derivatives and integrals in importance.<p>(A deeper thing going on is that a periodic function can be thought of as a function whose domain is a circle.  Circles have obvious rotational symmetry, and when you have symmetry you can use representation theory to decompose things into an (orthogonal) basis.  In this case, rotations commute with each other so by some theory the decomposition is going to be entirely through eigenvectors of rotation, which happen to precisely be the exponential functions e^(n theta i) for n an integer.  This decomposition is also an isomorphism that carries convolutions to point-wise products in both directions.  Also: if you make it so the circle is the complex unit circle, a Fourier transform is the idea that you can create a Laurent polynomial that extends the function to the complex plane minus the origin.)')
