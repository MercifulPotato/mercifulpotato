I&#x27;ve still never heard of this person.<p>I&#x27;m still not sure why everyone assumes everyone else must have heard of this person, and downvotes everyone who hasn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a weird, exclusive, gatekeeping vibe going on here, and it&#x27;s extremely unwelcoming to people who didn&#x27;t have a very specific background growing up. My background didn&#x27;t include whatever sport this person apparently played, so I don&#x27;t know them, so I&#x27;m somehow a bad person? I don&#x27;t get it.')
