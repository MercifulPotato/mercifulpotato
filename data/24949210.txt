Or they should be made a public company.<p>If they can&#x27;t afford to run the grid infrastructure given new requirements then it&#x27;s obvious a private company is not a safe caretaker of the states key infrastructure and the state will need to take up the costs so that California can remain a first world state. That&#x27;s why you all pay taxes, to provide services not make profit.')
