I mean, just look at the effects of the pandemic. Many independent retail stores in my city have closed up shop but Amazon is booming like never before. Even local restaurants that have switched to delivery, it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re barely scraping by (if they haven&#x27;t already closed) but DoorDash etc. are raking it in.')
