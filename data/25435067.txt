The 2600 as a machine has no interrupts, so if a section of code doesn&#x27;t push&#x2F;pop&#x2F;call anything, stack memory is never touched and you can do whatever you want with the stack pointer register.<p>There&#x27;s more tricks with the stack pointer on this machine too.  Set it to point to the top of a sequence of video registers, and then you can rapidly write values to that sequence of registers just by issuing push instructions, which are faster than load&#x2F;store&#x2F;decrement!')
