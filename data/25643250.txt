I don’t even know what the point of the article is.<p>It comes across as science&#x2F;intellectual shaming.<p>&gt; Possibly illiterate dilettantes on the internet might see and bring to attention legitimate theoretical flaws.<p>And if the flaws are legitimate, no matter how much work a scientist has done, then he has to take these into account now. Science is incremental and self-correcting. Is it a flaw if someone points out something wrong?<p>&gt; All the years you spend in graduate school counting angels on pinheads in your respective theoretical framework is mostly a waste of time.<p>What is the point of saying this? There are dead ends to science and some of these dead ends may seem like wastes of time but it’s all about incremental knowledge and discoveries. If something revolutionary comes along that disproves years of work, then that for science is a success.<p>&gt; Most of the scientific work is not meaningful outside of the theoretical framework that gave rise to it.<p>What does this mean? Isn’t this “theoretical framework” based on our observations? Sure there is this chance that it might be wrong but if most of our data and observations show that this is true, then it is until proven otherwise.<p>If someone tells you that the earth might be flat and what we can see with our eyes and what we currently know might not be true, is that sufficient evidence to make you think, “oh the earth might be flat after all”?')
