Kingspan has argued this was not a consequence of its product, but the firm&#x27;s own internal report warned the new insulation had performed ‘very differently’ — burning on its own and continuing after the test fire was put out.<p>&gt; But the market was not told of these findings, nor that the product had changed. In fact, when the country’s largest private building control firm, the National House Building Council (NHBC) threatened to reject the product due to fears over its combustibility in the mid 2010s, Kingspan called in the lawyers and threatened it with defamation. The NHBC backed down.<p>This doesn’t mean that the government gets off scot-free but obviously this is a major corporate scandal that deserves to be investigated regardless of perceived political motivations.')
