But they still needed to learn the rules. Having a textbook just makes it easier.<p>I don&#x27;t think TFA is claiming to be the <i>only thing</i> anyone needs to reach fluency. It&#x27;s clearly just meant to be a learning aid. Unless you believe it&#x27;s counterproductive, and that lists like that actually make it <i>harder</i> to learn a language, then I don&#x27;t understand the complaint here.')
