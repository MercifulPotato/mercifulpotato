Actix web and rocket are best positioned to get there soonest.  There comes a point where people invest effort into convenience projects such as command line boilerplate generation, but I don&#x27;t think anyone using Rust right now has this as a priority.  Rust crates and modules design make re-use and importing functionality straightforward and explicit.  I am not aware of an admin area, but that may very well be what people contribute next.  Actix web has the most robust ecosystem at the moment. You&#x27;ll struggle less than I did because of it (I was an early adopter).')
