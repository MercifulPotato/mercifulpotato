It just declares it has one. However, I can sympathize. I teach drawing and design. Of course, most of my students were raised on digital media. For some, their first experience drawing was digital! I have a lot of trouble explaining to them the value of pencil and paper.<p>In “Personal Dynamic Media.” (1977) Kay, Alan and Goldberg described a computer as a meta medium: a medium that can &#x27;fake&#x27; other media (my synopsis). I think we are always aware of this when working digitally. There is something in us that is aware of the essentially ethereal nature of the digital. I&#x27;m not sure that is the right word though.')
