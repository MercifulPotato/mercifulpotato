Assume good faith.<p>The word is slang, but it&#x27;s described by multiple dictionaries with multiple meanings, and many include a definition that relates to people regardless of gender, based on their actions or behaviour:<p>&gt; Used as a disparaging term for a person one dislikes or finds extremely disagreeable.<p>&gt; offensive slang a mean or obnoxious person<p>&gt; (a contemptuous term used to refer to an unpleasant person.)<p>It&#x27;s funny that you didn&#x27;t worry the comment where I referred to the exact same company&#x2F;people&#x2F;activity as &quot;a bunch of pricks&quot;. Coincidentally, that phrase <i>can</i> relate to genitals as slang too, but it has other slang definitions... I wonder if these look familiar.<p>&gt; A person considered to be mean or contemptible, especially a man.<p>&gt; a nasty, obnoxious, or contemptible person.<p>Also, I can&#x27;t help but notice that you replied to a comment where I highlighted the irony of a post complaining about me calling a company&#x2F;CEO who undertook indefensibly scummy tactics &quot;cunts&quot;, by suggesting that I &quot;come off as a tosser&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s the definition of that word...<p>&gt; a stupid or despicable person<p>I didn&#x27;t see you admonishing that poster for <i>insulting someone else</i>.<p>The original comment was clearly directed at a company, and those within said company responsible for specific actions.<p>If you&#x27;re one of those people: I stand by what I said. The people who thought that idea up, and followed it through, are cunts, or pricks, or yes, even tossers.<p>If you&#x27;re not any of those people, why the fuck do you care what I call them?<p>The world has enough problems without people getting offended on behalf of asshole CEOs and yes-men or yes-women reporting to them, because someone called them a rude word.')
