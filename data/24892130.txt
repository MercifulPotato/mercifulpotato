Not buying a place anytime soon, just find it interesting to see.<p>I also took a short trip to Okinawa (the beach islands of Japan) and the Airbnb prices were anomalously low, in fact it was more expensive renting a car for the time I was there than my stay. Not surprising, considering that last year ~31 million tourists visited Japan but this year that number must be <i>very</i> low.')
