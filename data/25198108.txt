They lived in a different town, got a different newspaper, and the comics were different.<p>The big ones like Beetle Bailey, Garfield, Family Circus, they were all there. But some of the smaller ones were missing. And there were other comics I never heard of.<p>None of them were the same size or on the same pages. We had Peanuts on the front page. They got a tiny version of Hal and Lois. But the oddest thing is that some of the comics were in a vertical instead of horizontal format. Then my dad explained syndication and editors and all that stuff flew right over my 10 year old head')
