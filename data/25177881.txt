Item(by='SloopJon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606056887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177121, text='&gt; Apple did not promise anything wrt. 3rd party apps<p>Of course they did: &quot;With the introduction of Rosetta 2, M1 and macOS Big Sur seamlessly run apps that haven&#x27;t yet transitioned to Universal versions. So without updating, you can keep working on Fusion360 projects or reach the next level in your favorite game.&quot;<p>Rosetta 2 (and Rosetta before it) may be an amazing technical accomplishment, but it&#x27;s entirely fair for a reviewer to say it doesn&#x27;t cut it for him.  As funny as some of his choices are (Edge on a Mac, on purpose?), he&#x27;s not reaching; this is what he uses everyday.  It&#x27;s also fair to point out that if your favorite game doesn&#x27;t happen to be Rise of the Tomb Raider, your mileage may vary.<p>I think the reviewer is a little unfair in his emphasis on &quot;Apple-chosen&quot; reviewers, but this frankly is the kind of thing I look for.  Five-star reviews are rarely as useful to me as three-star reviews.')
