For me, the religious belief shapes my worldview and is about two things: 1. A feeling of complete reliance on God, as my creator, to help and guide me throughout life, which feels.. liberating. 2. It gives a purpose to life, so I believe in the after-life and that we were not created and do not die in vain.<p>I consider myself a rational person, and I do not think that faith is irrational. Besides historical and natural evidence, If you dig into the notion of rationality itself, you&#x27;ll find that our actions and beliefs are based on a set of axioms&#x2F;assumptions anyway, and that those assumptions themselves are not subject to rationality. As Ludwig Wittgenstein said: &quot;At the foundation of well-founded belief lies a belief that is not founded&quot;.<p>Good luck on your journey!')
