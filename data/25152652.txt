So the probability that you&#x2F;one group doesn&#x27;t have the virus and the other hasn&#x27;t is already low since both groups live in the same region and would have already transmitted it to each other.<p>If you live far enough that you have to fly then you most likely have a completely separate social sphere where you live plus traveling by plane means being close to 100s of complete strangers. So the chance that one person&#x2F;group is coming from a region with an outbreak to a non-outbreak region is higher and the risk of catching it during travel is higher.<p>It&#x27;s just like ring security theory.
