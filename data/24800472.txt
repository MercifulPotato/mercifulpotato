Item(by='haswell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602853957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799398, text='&gt; <i>That suggests you and your team have communication issues and meeting in person is just a plaster over it.</i><p>That&#x27;s an interesting conclusion. What makes you believe that?<p>Would you say the same thing to a band trying to practice together...virtually&#x2F;remotely? Why or why not?<p>&gt; <i>Why exactly do you need to see other team members in person?</i><p>I covered this in another comment under this thread.<p>&gt; <i>Why do you think getting friendly with people at work is appropriate? Mixing work and personal life will introduce unconscious bias and you will give different treatment to people who didn&#x27;t invite you to their weeding. This is bad for business.</i><p>I see you&#x27;re intentionally being snarky about my typo.<p>But on topic - again, I ask, what makes you believe that? There are plenty of studies and psychologists who would disagree with you. Go read some of the articles on Harvard Business Review that explore the dynamics of friendship at work, and how important &#x2F; rewarding they can be.<p>&gt; It seems like you just feel lonely and you use workplace to find friends. Can you see how wrong that sounds?<p>I&#x27;m not lonely. I&#x27;m also an introvert. But when friendships form, it&#x27;s a beautiful thing.<p>Why do you believe this to be so &quot;wrong&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s a simple matter of simplicity and practicality. I&#x27;m more likely to meet like-minded people in the workplace, and those people aren&#x27;t necessarily even on my team or even in the same department.<p>As I mentioned in my parent comment, I do feel bad for people who have not had a chance to experience this - it seems you fall into that category.<p>&gt; <i>Did you think about finding a hobby, getting good at something other than work and meet people that way? (there is plenty of meetups for people sharing the same interests)</i><p>Of course! And I do those things, too. But my hobbies tend toward solitary activities (cycling, tinkering with electronics, coding side projects). Yeah, I meet interesting people at the local Raspberry Pi enthusiasts meetup, but rarely people I&#x27;ll form close friendships with.<p>---<p>Friendship at work might not be right for you. But don&#x27;t mistake that with it being &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;inappropriate&quot; for everyone.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious (and feel free not to reveal anything you aren&#x27;t comfortable sharing), but I really wonder if age&#x2F;geo&#x2F;length of career factor into this.<p>Often, the mindset you&#x27;re promoting seems to come from a lack of maturity and understanding of the importance of relationships in the workplace. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s necessarily the case for you, personally but I&#x27;m genuinely curious to understand where you&#x27;re coming from when there&#x27;s so much evidence to the contrary.')
