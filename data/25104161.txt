If it&#x27;s for learning, then I don&#x27;t let it discourage me. If it&#x27;s to complete a task, then I&#x27;ll just use the established products.<p>I feel this would vary person to person. If you have the goal to monetize it, or use it to create some other value (employment prospects, social status, etc), then my approach probably doesn&#x27;t fit. I&#x27;ve pretty much come to accept I will never make money nor increase my employability with my side projects.')
