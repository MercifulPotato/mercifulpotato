It&#x27;s rather blatant, and a few antagonistic people with free time have spent countless hours documenting these abuses.<p>The employees of the city laboring under these politicians are burnt out and have little good to say about their bosses in private. The politicians won&#x27;t devote effort to anything that isn&#x27;t: extinguishing a fire, enriching themselves,or getting re-elected. So the managers of various departments settle into autopilot because they don&#x27;t have the support they need, and this apathy trickles down through the ranks destroying morale, wasting money, and ultimately causing far greater costs to the taxpayers in the long run.')
