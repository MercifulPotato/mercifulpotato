All the existing US law both statute and Constitutional is that the president is Commander in Chief of the US military and has sole authority to launch nukes.<p>Congress can impeach, but I am not sure I am happy with a precedent of political leaders going to the military and telling them to abrogate the constitutional authority that their political opponent has.<p>There are already other Constituional remedies such as impeachment or the 25th Amendment to deal with a rogue President. Telling the military to unilaterally assume authority in a matter is not one of them.<p>The military should <i>Never</i> be brought into any political dispute. That path only escalates and leads to ruin.')
