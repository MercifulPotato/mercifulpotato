It has usually involved them being a thin proxy between myself and management, with the PM <i>constantly</i> pushing for firm numbers and dates, pushing for forecasts, asking for meetings to explain all of the things they have already been communicated...<p>I invariably end up feeling like a baby sitter, and feeling like I&#x27;m doing most of the work the PM should be doing, and with frequent, pointless meetings cutting severely into my available time. Aside from that, as soon as there is any pressure from the customer, the PM projects that onto the team, lambasting and pushing, <i>pushing</i> for more with less.<p>On <i>occasion</i> my experience is different, with the PM actually using the data they already have available in Azure DevOps (or whatever), keeping meetings to the minimum, and shielding the team from outside stresses. Very rare though.')
