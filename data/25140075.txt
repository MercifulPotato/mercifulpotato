We already know what the inherent tension is here. Do we value the sanctity of a human life over the greater social order?<p>Of course both answers to that question have very far reaching implications, and to answer one way or another almost always reveals oneself to be a hypocrite in some way. But instead of actually engaging with these hard questions we equivocate and try to build logical defenses that allow us to have our cake and eat it too.<p>Unfortunately with modern science and medicine we will be forced to reckon with the consequences of these unspoken choices soon or later. I don&#x27;t pretend to know what is correct here, and I don&#x27;t necessarily pass judgement on those who would answer these questions differently than I, but I do have large amounts of contempt for anyone who tries to ignore the realities of their positions and even more contempt for those who think the answer is obvious and self explanatory.')
