It&#x27;s kind of UBI, with flat payments and no means testing, but it fluctuates a lot.  When it&#x27;s payment scheme time, my bank puts up posters near ATMs reminding people to go to the government website and register their accounts to receive the wire transfer.<p>That being said, we have a very high wealth gap here.  My understanding is that social programs are generally very lacking.')
