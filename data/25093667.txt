In fact they may have already worked through something similar to this particular issue: Those nerfed batteries in your link were nerfed by the same ~10% loss that GM has had to place on Bolts, implying it was the high charge causing both issues. Most telling, Teslas&#x27;s issue was with batteries they stopped using 4 years ago. I don&#x27;t know if that signifies a 4-year lead on GM, but they&#x27;re certainly ahead.')
