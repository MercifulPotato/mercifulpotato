The Apollo Guidance Computer was not redundant (though there were two AGCs onboard-- one in the CM and one in the LEM). The aerospace industry has a history of using redundant dissimilar computers (different CPU architectures, multiple implementations of the control software developed by separate teams in different languages, etc) in voting-based architectures to hedge against various failure modes.')
