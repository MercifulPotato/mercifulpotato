I question the obsession with perf&#x2F;watt. It makes sense if you&#x27;re running a data center, or if you need to do &quot;light&quot; work.<p>But almost everyone I know with a laptop spends the majority of the time working with it docked to power, and often a monitor. If you&#x27;re using a laptop for work, and you&#x27;re not running out of a coffee shop, do you want a Zen3 with 32-64Gb RAM, 8-16 cores and an RDNA2 graphics APU at 50W (Rembrandt), or do you want a a device that will play video for 18 hours?<p>Especially for gaming, Apple&#x27;s GPU is still years behind AMD and NVidia. They&#x27;re bragging about 22Gp&#x2F;s fillrate when latest mobile discrete GPUs do 5-10x that.<p>Certainly, they have achieved a lot and are crushing Intel integrated chips at the low end, but there&#x27;s a ton of marketing fluff and special case comparisons going on, and I look forward to seeing a real head-to-head matchup, of say a Zen3 based system against a MacBook on a heavy CPU and GPU  bound benchmark like a triple-AAA title.<p>Years of synthetic benchmarks that exercise giant CPU caches leaves much to be desired.')
