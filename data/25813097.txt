You just buy them from solokeys.com.  There&#x27;s been Somu since that, and Solo2 is in the offing, with plenty of storage, apparently.  I bought Somu partly for convenience, and partly for the promise of PGP support, which unfortunately hasn&#x27;t been added yet (though there is a development version).<p>In answer to the expense question, two Solo keys appear to set you back 38 quid at the current exchange rate.
