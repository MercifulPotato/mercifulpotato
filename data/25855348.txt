But I wanted to add (since I can&#x27;t respond to the parent comment):<p>&gt; historical appreciation of European settlement of the Americas<p>What is there to appreciate? Like, say you&#x27;re completely willing to ignore or just completely ignorant of the brutality of all of this. What is to appreciate or celebrate about European settlement of the Americas? Like, it&#x27;s astonishing to me that this is just such a rote value and I sincerely cannot imagine anyone has an explanation for why it&#x27;s so important or valuable or worth celebrating. Like pretend the Euro story of an &quot;empty continent&quot; had any validity... okay what then? You made... lebensraum? Cool beans, you put more people on more land. Big fuckin deal, welcome to being literally every human group on literally every piece of earth.')
