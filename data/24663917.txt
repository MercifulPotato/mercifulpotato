My samsung S20 ultra costs me ~1300, and has ads on the phone, as in the native Samsung apps for everything. And since none can be installed I now have worthless bloatware I had to replace with ad free working alternatives.<p>Samsung tvs are hilariously bad with ads all over.<p>On neither item is it possible to flash this crap away or disable it. People love to tout things being free for our data, but this is paying over $1k to still have some of the most intrusive ads ever.<p>You must own one of their products to watch their ads with shows thrown in (Samsung channel) and this means you <i>have</i> paid for access to that channel and are <i>still</i> being served disgustingly intrusive ads(as others pointed out they screen grab and send home images of <i>everything you watch on any input</i>)')
