The way to &quot;beat&quot; piracy is to consider it as a competitor, which it is. When I was a kid, everyone downloaded raw mp3s and now that number is a fraction of a fraction because there&#x27;s 1) YouTube and 2) Spotify et al. You can listen to music all day with ads and not pay a cent, or you can pay a reasonable fee and get all the HQ music you can eat without ads. Publishers continue to screw content makers, but that&#x27;s another conversation.<p>Just trying to ban pirate sources is a wonderful dream for publishers for sure, but there&#x27;s no way it can work. Scientific papers are just too easy to share, the need for them high, and the current pricing too insane for it to be otherwise.')
