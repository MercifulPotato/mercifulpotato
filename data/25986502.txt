People are a part of ones environment.<p>Compared to someone who sits at home all day, the odds of &quot;having luck&quot; increase dramatically simply by going outside and walking around.<p>This includes &quot;meeting new or old people&quot;, talking to them, sharing what you do etc.<p>What the author completely ignores is that it also increases the odds of getting unlucky.<p>I feel like the author has a rather romantic perspective on this.')
