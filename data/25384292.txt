Item(by='supernova87a', descendants=None, kids=[25384306], score=None, time=1607683242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383598, text='I have no idea what the build is like, but if I were dropping $550 on some headphones, I would want them to not feel loose, rattley, or like they have plastic hinges&#x2F;joints that are probably going to gradually accumulate &quot;play&quot; or break after a year.  I would want shiny stainless steel joints that feel &quot;buttery&quot; yet reasonably tight.  A feeling that if you accidentally sat on them or tossed them in a bag and got crushed, something might bend, rather than crack and break.<p>Btw, I wonder how they will let people try them in the stores.   Seems like putting something on your head&#x2F;ears that others have tried before you feels a little icky.')
