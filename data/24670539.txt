Those phones have literal cancer as apps and uninstallable shit.\nXiaomi even &quot;recommends&quot; apps in their launcher as some sort of light color and clicking just installs them. I have attempted to use adb to remove apps but many apps refuse because rom has locked them down.\nBesides, why should a phone have ads anyways? Arent users paying for a physical product at once? The same Samsung TV ads bullshit.<p>Besides f-droid, do you know of any store that has respected curated or non curated list of apps?')
