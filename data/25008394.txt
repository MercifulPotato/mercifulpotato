Web search seems like an extremely adversarial problem with people constantly hacking your search algorithm instantly as you change it. One would hope that the benefit a giant firm can provide is the amount of R&amp;D they could afford to devote to countering this. But perhaps when they&#x27;re paying for ads they don&#x27;t seem so adversarial to google.')
