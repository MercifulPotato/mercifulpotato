As consumer prices go down, the purchasing power of the average salary increases, and jobs become less shitty.<p>It&#x27;s through this dynamic that wages have grown 20 fold, in inflation adjusted terms, since 1820.

The seemingly miracalous advancement of income and quality of life since 1800 was because of breakneck rates of industralization. Change, in this context, is good, and anti-capitalist policies that reduce the expansion of capital are bad.')
