Whether they post fake jobs, slow response, no-show, are rude, or ghost candidates.  This helps developers prepare themselves for what to expect if it happens to them.  They should be rated on how professional they are.  Similar to how customer service representatives are surveyed after calls.  Hopefully, this will educated all developers on which companies to avoid and which to ramp up their expectations.')
