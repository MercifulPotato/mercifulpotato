Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=[25897267], score=None, time=1611527881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25896661, text='&gt; I wish there was a nice wrapper dedicated to abstracting hardware support better so developers can focus on the interesting parts<p>The University of Utah had a research project back in the late 1990s which offered exactly that â€“ the OSKit project [0]. A set of libraries for common (at the time) x86 hardware so OS developers and researchers could focus on what was original about their OS instead of writing yet another hard disk or Ethernet driver<p>Unfortunately, the research project ended circa 2000 and it is dead now. No support for contemporary devices like Wifi and USB. But, if you just want something to run in a VM (QEMU or VirtualBox or whatever) it probably still works.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;flux&#x2F;oskit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;flux&#x2F;oskit&#x2F;</a>')
