Many successful films are based on a pure, authentic vision of an auteur after all?<p>I also don&#x27;t know if your assertion is necessarily true either. I&#x27;ve been at a modestly successful startup and I have to say most of our early successes came from all the people around our Founder who pushed back against, and checked his more impetuous and self-destructive tendencies. I think the Founder story is, as often as not, an act of self-aggrandizing myth-making. In my company&#x27;s case, our Founder&#x27;s best skill was having a nose for talent, but his notions of how to build good software were wildly off-base.<p>It is akin to the &quot;Great Man&quot; theory of history or even the auteurship theory around filmmaking that erases all the surrounding actors and the interplay of forces that drive the eventual outcome.')
