The DJI Mini2, which any civilian can buy for $449, has a similar size, weighs 249g, and advertises a flight time of 30 minutes. (In my experience with the Mini 1, it&#x27;s plausible).<p>Side note: the DJI Mini 1 is an excellent drone -- stable flight, great camera, and great range. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it outperforms this &#x27;Bug&#x27; drone by most metrics, except for the critical (at least for military purposes) &quot;not being made by a Chinese company&quot; metric.')
