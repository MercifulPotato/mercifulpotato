AOSP is one patch away from booting off of it, assuming you have drivers. To that end, Google is beginning to move the ecosystem toward a generic device kernel, with a set of hardware interfaces for handling those drivers in a standard way across devices.<p>This would enable custom kernels to target a range of compatible devices at once, which (among other things) would then simplify porting over alternative Linux-based OSes. Including the convergent ones we&#x27;re starting to see pop up on <i>way</i> less impressive hardware.')
