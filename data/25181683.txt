I have used it to read several psychology and CS textbooks and hundreds of papers in those fields and philosophy and neuroscience. For size, this has been satisfactory for me as a middle-aged person with good uncorrected eyesight.<p>My wife has an old iPad mini (no idea what year&#x2F;gen), which I have read some technical documents on. That was sufficient as well, though not quite as good as the larger iPad.<p>I&#x27;ve never used the larger sized iPad models, so I can&#x27;t really compare.')
