Without monetization you wouldn&#x27;t have the proliferation of the ads, and not everyone is willing to pay directly.<p>It creates jobs, supports businesses, helps otherwise unsustainable content. It helps the small businesses grow their market. It supports economy.<p>You are also sort of missing the point. We are trying to make ads relavant for everyone, but even if it&#x27;s relavant, you don&#x27;t click on everything you see. This is true because of how you as a person do things. You don&#x27;t buy the first car you see on the street, you do research, you spend days etc. Just think of that, and you&#x27;ll see why why 1% ctr is actually not a terrible thing as you made it sound like. if you clicked on everything you see, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to do _anything_.<p>Disclaimer: Current FB and ex-Google employee working on ads for 8 years. And no, my pay doesn&#x27;t depend on me saying these, i could just work _anywhere_ i wanted, literally.')
