But it is these goals, values, and assumptions that separate the population into different factions. It is not simply a matter of we&#x27;re right and they&#x27;re wrong when it comes to settling these foundational issues.<p>&gt; I simply in some kind of &quot;spell&quot; and am I not, objectively speaking, correct, because my opinion on those matters are backed by science?<p>You are under a spell that maximizing lives saved from the virus is the obviously correct goal, which is why its never even stated out loud. But your policy choices given that goal are objectively correct. The issue is whether maximizing lives saved from the virus is the correct goal. Lockdowns have a cost which is mostly borne by those who do not have the means to go for weeks or months without work or cannot work from home. There&#x27;s also the mental health costs of extended social distancing. These questions are not answered by simply referencing the science behind controlling pandemics. There are very contentious foundational issues that that must be settled before we can make factual determinations about policy.')
