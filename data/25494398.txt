Sure, the 7MP megapixels are bad. Sure, the ISO noise is pretty bad compared to modern smartphone postprocessing. But the telephoto isn&#x27;t some pitiful &quot;optical zoom&quot;, it&#x27;s instead incredible powerful optics. The low aperture prime lenses produce beautiful shots whose distortion is matched to human preference.<p>The idea that phones can &quot;catch up&quot; to even 10 years ago on DSLR&#x27;s would be very cool.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not holding my breath. Phone sensors are what 10X smaller? Doing great things with 10X less light is impressive, but at some point, you need a big sensor and good quality glass.<p>Would love to see us get DSLR quality pics from a phone tho.')
