Proper taxation is not looking to eradicate rich people, it would simply make them pay their fair share of taxes (if collected). I am a middle class worker and I pay proportionally a lot more taxes than the uber-rich, is that fair?  If I were a billionaire and employed an army of lawyers and accountants to help me avoid paying taxes would that be fair to you? How about tax heavens? Regardless of what&#x27;s fair or not,  when the gap increases beyond certain limits instability ensues. If we don&#x27;t do anything - and if you have a different solution bring it to the table - we could end up in a much worse situation in which all of us, rich and the poor, would have a lot more to lose')
