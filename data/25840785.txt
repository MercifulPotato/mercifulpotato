(No, more, at least 9.)<p>All but one of them is totally silent from 100m up. Most of them I can&#x27;t even make out the noise from 50m up.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be personally bothered too much by delivery drones that flew at ~100m and only dropped straight down to my or my neighbours houses to make final delivery. (But I live with a fair bit of aircraft noise already, I&#x27;m less than 1km from the main runway at Sydney airport and directly under it&#x27;s flightpath, so perhaps my level of annoyance isn&#x27;t typical.)<p>My largest these days isn&#x27;t exactly a heavy lifter though, 10 inch props capable of lifting a dslr and a reasonably heavy lens on a gimbal - probably 1 - 1.2kg or so of practical payload. I do occasionally play as camera operator of a friend&#x27;s big octacopter - 16inch props carrying 3 gimballed dslrs (and 3 fixed gopros), so probably 5+kg payload,  which is similarly quiet, imperceptible at 100m altitude.<p>(My &quot;noisy&quot; one is one of my smallest, a 4inch prop FPV racing drone that runs 6 cells, it&#x27;ll do close to 100mph straight up, and practically vanishes within 1 sec if you punch the throttle right open. But it&#x27;s tiny little props are doing 60+k rpm at full throttle. It&#x27;s very very annoyingly noisy when flown with vigour. Still hovers fairly quietly though, but its noisier in correcting for gusts than ess extreme 4inch sized quads.)')
