There are a few important distinctions, most notably (from the article itself):<p>&gt; &quot;We praise drawings ... because we want our kids to continue to work hard, and to do good work... But what we really want to teach our children... is that they should do good work because of the satisfactions it provides.&quot;<p>While I understand how this could apply to children (if not necessarily agree), we don&#x27;t manage teams to have fun, we do want to encourage them to do good work.<p>As for the wider question, if a team is doing really good work, why not give credit where it&#x27;s due? I feel like not acknowledging when people are putting in extra effort is a great way to discourage them from doing that.')
