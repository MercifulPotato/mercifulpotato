The vaccine is slowly grown in large volume bioreactors. If you need long time from investment till finished product, then obviously people who invested sooner can expect that they receive the product before those who invested only now.<p>What happened is that both the first UK and the first EU batch had a low yield. The problems were (hopefully) fixed but it will be months before the next batch will be ready.<p>If the EU had invested sooner, these problems might have been already fixed by now. The UK risked more with earlier investment, so they should get some payout from the risk.<p>From the moral side I think that it would be fair for the UK to send some vaccine supplies to the EU to show solidarity. Maybe they will do if we talk about this more dispassionately. On the other hand, legal threats are not going to work and may only spoil relationships.')
