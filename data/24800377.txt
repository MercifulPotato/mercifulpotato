Why don&#x27;t you use your brain and navigate solely through memory? You could still do it, why use a smartphone for navigation? Because it helps.<p>The same is the case for augmenting information you have, in a car it can be quite useful if you end up missing a sign for the maximum speed (as I&#x27;ve done through Germany in some Autobahn stretches that change speed, most of the times due to construction). The same is the case of giving more spatial awareness through data, who is around you? That is the most basic skill you need as a driver, if there are systems to feed you this data in a quicker and more processable way rather than relying on other people&#x27;s ability to maintain their attention to be checking their mirrors and keep awareness of their surroundings all the time, so be it. I do it all the time while driving, I don&#x27;t trust others do the same.<p>So you know, you could also use that brain a bit more.')
