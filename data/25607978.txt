They know a lot of the work is unfulfilling. They stick around for long enough that their departure doesn’t look like they were fired and try to obscure it in something innocuous like, “I was looking for something more challenging” and the recruiter thinks,”wow, more challenging than Google?!? This candidate must be hot”. The amount of status these people enjoy in their careers after leaving is amazing. After that they’re captured. They’re never going to tell you the truth about what it’s like working for Google. They gain an enormous cache from having worked there.<p>The amount of respect I afford these people is inversely proportional to the amount of time it takes them to say where they worked or went to school. Went to MIT and don’t ever manage to bring it up in a conversation and I have to learn it from someone else?  Massive respect, but they usually mention it in the first 30 seconds.')
