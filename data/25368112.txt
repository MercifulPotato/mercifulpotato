Brands have to pay to go on promotion, and they have to pay to appear in the catalogue. I&#x27;ve heard placement fees for mailbox catalogue placements can be a significant bulk of revenue for some companies.<p>My wife recently started in a new company with retail products and was appalled at what goes on, but it&#x27;s normal. The supermarket wants to promote your product? Pay up. Per product. They choose which, not you. If you don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s a good chance your shelf space gets replaced by a competitor next time it&#x27;s under review. If you do, you&#x27;ll often lose money while it&#x27;s on sale. It&#x27;s a very predatory arrangement enabled by the duopoly here in AU.')
