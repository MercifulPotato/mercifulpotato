Those are bloody awful.<p>I&#x27;m a PhD student at Imperial College London. Last exams season was entirely replaced with &quot;timed open book coursework&quot;, carried out via Blackgoard and Wiseflow. I&#x27;m not sure about the privacy record of the orgs behind these two pieces of software, but there was no proctoring of any sort and we graduates were spared from invigilator duties, that we&#x27;d normally have to perform.<p>Indeed, the College relied on the students&#x27; honour to avoid cheating:<p><i>A reminder about cheating and collusion</i><p><i>Students who are identified to have colluded will face disciplinary action.</i><p><i>You must not confer with fellow students or any other individuals during the exam. We trust you. However, if there is a concern that you have not followed the code of conduct expected, the College has a range of options at its disposal. The College reserves its right to impose additional forms of assessment including individual student vivas, if required. These may also be used to assist the examiners and the Boards of Examiners in assuring that the assessment process has been conducted fairly and in accordance with the agreed marking schemes. You are reminded that if we become aware of proposed or evidenced actions for collusion that such allegations will be reported and investigated in accordance with the Collegeâ€™s Academic Misconduct Procedure.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperial.ac.uk&#x2F;electrical-engineering&#x2F;internal&#x2F;current-students-course-handbook&#x2F;examinations&#x2F;general-instructions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperial.ac.uk&#x2F;electrical-engineering&#x2F;internal&#x2F;c...</a><p>Right? &quot;We trust you&quot;.
