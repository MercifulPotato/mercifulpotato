Call it &quot;inward mobility&quot;. It is where your life becomes better, more organized, more healthy, within the bounds of, e.g. your energy expenditures or your draw on natural resources. There is an analogy with racing: in drag racing, you always want to go faster and faster, with no upper bound. But there is another form of racing, rally racing, which hinges on precision and control rather than raw speed.<p>My recent experience living in Germany gave me a real sense of what that&#x27;s like. There is a cultural affinity for &quot;progress means innovation aimed at ever more closely and efficiently adhering to a standard&quot;. So this means, for example, the beer in Germany is very consistent over decades, sometimes centuries, is cheaper than soda, and there isn&#x27;t much variety. (a similar story for Ireland&#x27;s Guiness, BTW). Or take the German knife maker WÃ¼sthof, which unusually for a large knife maker uses entirely one steel, one style of blade, across the line (okay there are exceptions but these are rare). They&#x27;ve fixed the larger values of a boundary condition, but still find room to innovate within that space. I can&#x27;t help but think that this is a healthier way to think about progress and growth, rather than the very American approach that progress always means <i>more</i>, but never just <i>better</i>.')
