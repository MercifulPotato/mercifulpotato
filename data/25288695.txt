As far as I can see, android phones are highly competitive with iphone on everything. The longest battery isn&#x27;t on an iphone, the best camera isn&#x27;t on an iphone, the latest screen tech isn&#x27;t on an iphone, etc. etc.<p>Coming to the M1 laptops, they beat comparable Windows laptops in every single metric. It&#x27;s literally just a matter of looking at the numbers and realizing how M1 has every Intel chip beat (in this category).<p>In fact this makes me wonder: if Apple chips are so far ahead, why are iphones not the fastest, best smartphones by a wide margin?')
