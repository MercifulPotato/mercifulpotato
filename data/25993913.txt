Item(by='jtxxwl2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612213410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25991935, text='&gt;It is not a question of &#x27;special effort&#x27; it is more of the question of why descendants of slaves were not viewed as part of the civilization, why there was such push against integration.<p>Well, why would you expect anything else?<p>If on the one hand they view the descendants of the slaves as being inherently inferior, then certainly they are not going to view them as part of their civilization or want them to integrate. This is an easy thing to think, given they had recently ruled over their ancestors.<p>If on the other hand they believe the other group is fundamentally equal to them, and only in a temporarily inferior position due to circumstances neither group controlled, consider that the dominant group had just used their power over the other group to brutally exploit them. They have only to ask themselves how they&#x27;d behave if someone had done that to them to think that it may not be in their interest to let the other group in to the club where its members will have some power over them.<p>That is where the &quot;special effort&quot; comes in to play. The dominant group must first be convinced that their former slaves are not fundamentally inferior to them. Then on top of that, they have to be convinced that, even though they treated their own group preferentially to the detriment of the other group, the other group will not treat itself preferentially to the dominant group&#x27;s detriment, or at least not badly enough to outweigh other concerns (or perhaps that they deserve such treatment).<p>In regard to South America and the Caribbean, while Europeans ruled those areas, they did not really colonize them in the same way that they colonized the US. European involvement in South America and the Caribbean was mostly limited to wealthy plantation owners, whereas the southern US had significant numbers of people not personally involved with slavery.')
