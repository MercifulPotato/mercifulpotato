I just got one crash to desktop over the whole playthrough and I suspect it was due to something else (updated packages while running the game). Incidentally, the game is great, esp. compared to the negative review; I&#x27;m still shocked by the discrepancy.<p>Same for Witcher 3, GTA V, No Man&#x27;s Sky ...<p>More recent games often still have issues. RDR2 is just getting playable, but it&#x27;s getting fixed faster. There&#x27;s also less and less annoyances: just a few months back alt-tabbing was very dodgy, now it&#x27;s extremely robust. Also multi-monitor support seems to work perfectly nowadays. I had some issues with controllers but I haven&#x27;t tried recently.')
