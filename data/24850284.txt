There are always going to be invariants that the application may wish to enforce which cannot be enforced in the database</i><p>As HN doesn&#x27;t show moderations, I will just say that this is exactly the point I would have made if I&#x27;d been replying first. Relational databases are good at enforcing the kinds of relations provided by basic set manipulations. If you try really hard, you can encode some more complicated constraints, but as the complexity increases it becomes unwieldy and eventually impractical to enforce everything at schema level.<p>Edit: Changed &quot;database level&quot; to &quot;schema level&quot; to clarify that I&#x27;m not talking about stored procedures here.')
