A static &quot;death day&quot; is great because you can internalize, and countdown towards it, but it loses the <i>distribution</i> behind life expectancy.  A single day is probability&#x27;s expected value, but there&#x27;s a huge range of days that could be your last - even today!<p>My idea is a daily (or weekly&#x2F;monthly&#x2F;etc) notification that re-computes a &quot;death day&quot; for you, on that recurring basis.  Each notification would include a day, and together, they&#x27;d form a distribution that faithfully represents the variance in days you&#x27;re likely to die.<p>For example: me; 28-year-old male.  I&#x27;d regularly get &quot;death days&quot; that are ~50 years out.  Occasionally, maybe they&#x27;d be 25, or 55 years away.  And very rarely, they&#x27;d be things like 10, or even 5 years away.  A perfect reminder to play hooky, or call up a friend, or tick off a bucket list item every once in a while!<p>Anyone interested in this?  I&#x27;m kind of fishing for an excuse to build it...')
