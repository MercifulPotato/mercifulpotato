The rioters who broke in were chanting things like &quot;Fight for Trump!&quot; and &quot;Find Mike Pence!&quot; presumably to kill him.  This of course shortly after Trump himself had tweeted that &quot;Mike Pence didn&#x27;t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution&quot; while he surely knew that rioters had broken into the building.  How the f*** can you say it&#x27;s hysterical to call that an attempted violent overthrow of the government?')
