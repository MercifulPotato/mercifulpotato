Can they just lay off please?<p>[Update: I guess I&#x27;m really reacting to all the negative commentary when this was posted last week <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25185842" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25185842</a>]<p>Personally, I think this would be a great device for my kid to learn programming on.  When I was a kid I would love to have had a Sinclair ZX81 with a built-in screen!<p>I like that it&#x27;s a different form-factor from everything else.  The more form-factors the better!  This would be great for a kid because it doesn&#x27;t have a bendy&#x2F;fragile screen and you could throw it in a backpack and not worry.<p>I wish it was more powerful but my main criticism is that I can&#x27;t get one for Christmas.')
