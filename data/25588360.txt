I didn&#x27;t choose the market or the product purely for the immediate economic opportunity. I was <i>also</i> optimizing for increasing my skill with the tech stack I saw (and still see) as most advantageous for a startup founder to have skill with. On top of that, I was optimizing for a third constraint of something that I could do with a maximum of two hours a day of keyboard time.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about the project, I just shared a full break-down today: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;questinglog.com&#x2F;2020-year-in-review&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;questinglog.com&#x2F;2020-year-in-review&#x2F;</a>')
