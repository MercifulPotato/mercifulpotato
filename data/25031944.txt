(See also death penalty support, recent violent protests in Oregon and Washington, etc.) Note that the areas with very high rates of legal gun ownership aren&#x27;t the hotspots of gun violence [0].  Switzerland and several other Eurpean countries have very high rates of gun ownership, but low rates of gun violence.  Certainly, fixing a sick culture is more difficult than reducing gun access, but I think long-term, we need to figure out how to be a more peaceful and forgiving society, or much of the gun violence will just shift to (granted, much less efficient) knife violence.  I think improving America&#x27;s culture of violence and revenge will also pay mental health dividends.  Sometimes you really need a crutch or a bandaid, but it&#x27;s important not to mistake it for an end-goal solution.<p>Do any of you have any insights into ways individuals can ensure they at least leave the culture less violent than they found it?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;gun-ownership-violence-statistics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;gun-ownership-violence...</a>')
