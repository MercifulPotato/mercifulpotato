Even amongst a collaboration, they need to carve out sections that are unquestionably theirs so they can defend a dissertation that is also theirs.<p>I am now at IBM Research. In my career here, I have experienced multiple working relationships where I feel we were able to accomplish far, far more than at least I know I could have achieved on my own. Maybe they didn&#x27;t need me, but I know for certain I needed them to be so productive.  That this kind of working relationship is disincentivized for graduate students is, to me, tragic.')
