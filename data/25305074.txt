Once data is out there, people sharing it is inevitable. The way to stop there being a video of yourself is to never let one be made in the first place, especially by someone you can&#x27;t trust. The only way out of that cold hard fact is a worldwide data control regime enforced on our personal computers, which we should all be against.<p>At least with Youtube&#x27;s censorship push, there&#x27;s an argument to be made that it&#x27;s not so much about the hosting, but the recommendation system giving extra attention to misleading videos. This article doesn&#x27;t even attempt to make that point, instead repeatedly deferring to innuendo that the mere act of hosting is itself bad. Whereas in reality that&#x27;s simply intractable, and pretending it isn&#x27;t will lead to nothing good (ie another &quot;war on drugs&quot;).<p>Certainly there are things Pornhub could do to <i>help</i>, like making it easier for people to find and report videos of themselves, or working with reputation management firms. But feigning as if there&#x27;s some magical solution that Pornhub can come up with to prevent every bad thing from happening (&quot;solve the problem&quot;) is not a way to have a constructive conversation.<p>Also the article skips dwelling on how most of the harm is actually being caused - <i>the bullying</i>. Like when yet another kid shoots up a school, the actual dynamic is brushed away as &quot;kids being kids&quot; and somehow uncontrollable, despite school administrators have great visibility into students&#x27; activities and a wide range of sanctions. Meanwhile we&#x27;re all told that we should give up our societal rights to fix the resulting mess.')
