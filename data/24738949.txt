I am and live among white first world people and I often hear the opinion that the problems of muslim immigrants both here and in their home country are caused by their bad character traits, either culturally or genetically.<p>To me this is bullshit. Most of these problems are caused by poverty. If you&#x27;re poor you don&#x27;t have good education, information, nutrition, health systems and all the like. And that causes all sorts of disadvantages people can&#x27;t imagine. It&#x27;s not character or genetics.&quot;<p>Too bad a simple A&#x2F;B testing will reveal your own belief to be wrong. There are many countries where poverty creates masses of people without &quot;good education, information, nutrition, health systems and all the like&quot;, yet is it consistently Muslims countries who create first-hand violent extremists (aka &quot;terrorists&quot;) and their supporters.<p>To further destroy your thesis, most of the 9&#x2F;11 terrorists were educated Saudis from middle-class to rich families.')
