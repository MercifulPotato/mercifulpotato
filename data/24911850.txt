When we speak and think, we use all kinds of metaphors that express judgements about the world, usually without realizing it.  In other words, the way we use language encodes concepts in a deep way.<p>To borrow an example from George Lakoff, we, in English, use war-metaphors to talk about arguments.  Of arguments and of wars you can say things like &quot;he&#x27;s marshalling his forces,&quot; &quot;they&#x27;re ceding their territory,&quot; or &quot;she&#x27;s girding her defenses&quot;.  In fact, almost anything you can say about a war you can also say about an argument.  In American politics, with regard to partisan squabbling and the filibuster, we talk about &quot;the nuclear option&quot;.  The fact that these metaphors make sense to us indicates a judgement, something like &quot;arguments are like wars&quot;.  That judgement shows up in billions of lines of English scraped from the internet and can be fed into a model, allowing GPT-3 to &quot;make that connection&quot; via purely statistical methods.<p>Yes, this is a bit like asking &quot;what a library believes&quot;.  But a lot of these metaphors show up in our languages and, in a way, they express judgements, which is something akin to a belief.  Does that mean a library has beliefs?  Is this all knowledge is?  I wouldn&#x27;t go that far.  But the argument is an interesting one and worth raising.')
