Trump rides into the sunset. (Starts a new show on Fox?) The Senate stays Republican. Republicans pick up a good number of seats in the House. The Senate says no no no to anything but reasonable governance for four years. The Supreme Court looks askance at ambitious executive orders. The New York Times editorial page and lots of Very Annoying People fume about the Senate &quot;resistance.&quot; Umm, they will have to pick another word.<p>&gt; More broadly, the big news of the election seems a clear rejection of the far-left agenda.<p>100% agree with this conclusion.<p>I think the Biden administration will have a lot of problems in the next four years and set a massive red carpet for a huge Republican victory in 2024. They will have to pick up an economic crisis post COVID-19 and struggle with the senate. Additionally Biden has been so long in politics that he&#x27;s not going to look at things with fresh eyes and question the system. He&#x27;s quickly going to fall back to status quo and alienate a lot of his reluctant supporters. Trump had 50% of the country hating him, but he also had 50% of the country absolutely loving him. It&#x27;s the hate for Trump which secured Biden a narrow margin, but let&#x27;s be absolutely clear, nobody voted for Biden because they liked him. In some ways the Biden administration will have less support, less enthusiasm and less success that the Trump administration before him, which is kind of ironic when you think about it.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s just my perspective as an outsider looking across the pond from Europe.')
