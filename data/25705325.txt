Because I&#x27;ve noticed it can be used to design very fast processors, yet abandons most decisions in ARM7 and Thumb.<p>I was just curious about how SIMD worked in RISC-V so I looked it upâ€¦ and apparently RISC-V doesn&#x27;t have SIMD, instead it brings back microcoded large vector operations from the 70s, and the RISC-V designers called SIMD bad and compared it to the opioid crisis because it means there are too many instruction opcodes?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigarch.org&#x2F;simd-instructions-considered-harmful&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigarch.org&#x2F;simd-instructions-considered-harmful...</a><p>So I&#x27;m now even less impressed and also slightly offended. This is not realistic, short vectors are important and easy to do in hardware.')
