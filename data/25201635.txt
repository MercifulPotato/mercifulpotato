Item(by='Spivak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606244042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201237, text='&gt; How many people know how to make a good argument or how to spot one?<p>Even if you could spot &quot;good&quot; arguments that really isn&#x27;t enough without knowing that it&#x27;s also made in good faith. If the person making an argument doesn&#x27;t actually believe what they&#x27;re saying, is arguing with a particular outcome, or is arguing with an ulterior motive like flame-bait then you also shouldn&#x27;t bother engaging them even if it&#x27;s well-formed.<p>I would take a bad argument made in good faith every time over the reverse. People who speak genuinely but are passionate, emotional, or aren&#x27;t the best at expressing themselves can have productive conversations. Someone who&#x27;s arguing to win isn&#x27;t worth your time.')
