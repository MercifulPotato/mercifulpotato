For a technical audience, they are amazingly unaware of &quot;Systems Thinking&quot;.</i><p>Technical audiences usually go with the &quot;technology, right or wrong&quot; angle (as nationalists go with &quot;my country, right or wrong&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s more about identity validation and peer group thinking than critical and systems thinking.
