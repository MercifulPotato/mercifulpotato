But I wanted to specify that it&#x27;s not risk sharing like your auto insurance is, or home insurance, or term life insurance.  Those are infrequent, random events for the most part.<p>Whereas, healthcare is a guaranteed expense, so the premiums are just prepaying for the coming expenses.  But today, you&#x27;re not paying for your healthcare expenses, but for the older, sicker person&#x27;s healthcare, just like FICA taxes are paying for healthcare for those 65 years and older.')
