I always wondered how thins would have played out, if the western allies would have invaded the western part of Germany when the Wehrmacht was still busy in Poland. Same way I wonder how the Pacific war would have developed had the Japanese destroyed the oil depots in Pearl Harbour or even launched an invasion. I guess it would just have prolonged the war and killed even more people, in case of Pearl Harbour.')
