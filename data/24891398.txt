I am not sure how easy it would be to rezone (some places have an industrial category that is separate from office&#x2F;residential) but being able to fulfill orders out of city-centres is obviously attractive (but debt and equity would go to zero then, you could probably maintain prices with coworking but warehouse space is going to be a 90%+ loss).')
