Today there are most certainly well funded startups paying 100k for top senior engineers and&#x2F;or managers, but that is in the top 10% of salaries in this field.<p>Beyond startups, there are 1. some smaller, but crazy profitable software companies (think dozens of M in annual revenue with less than 50 staff and a handful of owners) that will also pay this type of salary and 2. some larger companies (think Zalando).<p>Compared to US and esp Bay Area salaries (which ofc can be multiples of that) one needs to bear in mind massively cheaper costs of living (while often providing higher standards) - day care for kids for example is 100% free (as in tax funded) in Berlin.<p>That being said, the pandemic is certainly taking its toll as many companies have gone into a hiring freeze.<p>At the same time, the decline of SF and the remote work trend will likely mean an increase in intl salaries (due to Big Tech hiring remotely) and a decrease in SF salaries.')
