Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610985298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822183, text='&gt;I wonder what the sequence of events was where nobody said anything about putting shackles on kids that aren&#x27;t prisoners or being arrested.<p>I also wonder, because the default position is to not shackle kids obviously. Social workers really are good people who try their best in real hard situations (and dealing with &#x27;at-risk&#x27; foster kids is one of the hardest areas of social work). It may be the case that this bad solution came out of solving something, like kids running away, or physically hurting themselves, other kids, or social workers - during transport. It&#x27;s not totally fair to impugn motives, as others in this thread are, without at least understanding what it is they were trying to solve.<p>Again .. I&#x27;m not justifying or excusing this policy, but I do want to understand why this policy exists in context with realities on the ground encountered by good people doing really hard social work.')
