Item(by='Eldandan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611723896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25923113, text='I regularly transition from Thinkpad&#x2F;laptop and 60-75% standard boards to a 60% split Ultimate Hacking Keyboard, 40% ortholinear planck, and split planck (Let&#x27;s Split). The only thing that ever messed me up was using split spacebars, where one thumb maps to something besides space. I end up being confused when my less dominant thumb doesn&#x27;t activate the keypress on a regular spacebar. :\\ Hard to overcome the muscle memory, so I&#x27;ve sworn off of split spacebars unless I change all my boards to split space. Which is impossible for laptops.<p>Aside from that, transitioning takes no more than half a minute for it to feel natural again.')
