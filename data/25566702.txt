I’ve always wondered “to what end” do humans and economies compete. Everyone dies in the end. I’d rather not slave away my limited time in this universe thinking that my work in design systems is really doing anything other than automating parts of a designer&#x2F;developer’s job.<p>It seems stupid to toil. Humans should be smart enough to invent an economic system that provides for everyone, leaves none unhoused, and doesn’t force 40+ hour weeks on us.
