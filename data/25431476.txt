Every time a self-proclaimed expert on audio decides that the current most popular implementation is wrong, they just start writing (and leave incomplete) a different one.<p>This same jousting over technical windmills happens in other userspace elements of Linux. Linus, for better or worse, keeps a tight rein on what&#x27;s allowed in the kernel, but when it comes to audio, window management, display, UX, everything is a shitshow of mixed metaphors and dysfunctional interoperability.')
