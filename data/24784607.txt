For the most part (there&#x27;s that pesky word again!), it works quite well. And it really is beautiful--aesthetically, I quite like it.<p>But boy do I wish that bluetooth would work reliably. Since working at home full time, noise-cancelling headphones have gone from &#x27;nice to have&#x27; to &#x27;nearly essential&#x27;. It worked more or less fine for a while, then some update broke something and it stopped working. Now it&#x27;s working again, kind of, but connecting a pair of headphones causes most of the entire UI to stop responding for a full minute or two. Sigh.<p>And maybe the next time I update it will be fine again. Who knows? And that&#x27;s the problem: every update feels like Russian roulette. And this isn&#x27;t even a laptop. I use this thing for work; I do not have time to dick around all today troubleshooting obscure bluetooth problems.<p>If I&#x27;m going to continue to use it, I guess what I need to do is stop updating (or only update specific apps, like firefox) once I happen upon a relatively &#x27;stable&#x27; configuration. Security updates be damned.')
