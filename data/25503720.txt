Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608620372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25503648, text='&gt;  If you fly with a bike then youâ€™ll want a hard, padded case for it, like one of these[1].<p>Sure, but flying is very much an occasional thing; you have to semi-disassemble a bike to put it in a case like that, and generally reckon on having to do a shakedown ride after you&#x27;ve unpacked it (at least I do). Putting it in a box every time would not be practical.<p>&gt; I also keep my best bike (I, er, have several) in the house. i.e. a temperature controlled room.<p>That&#x27;s not unknown but not exactly normal; you must admit having several bikes is pretty extreme in itself. If you&#x27;re not on the ground floor then knocking the bike against a wall or doorframe on the way in or out is almost inevitable, whereas I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to do the same to a musical instrument. I suspect the majority of people who are using a bike as day-to-day transport would keep that bike in, at best, an unheated garage.')
