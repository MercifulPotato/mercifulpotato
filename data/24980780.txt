Semantically there is no difference, but in practice async functions are compiled differently than normal functions. what you are proposing in practice is to do a global CPS transform and possibly reconstruct back the original function when the continuation is not needed (i.e. it is always invoked in strict LIFO order). There are functional languages where this is the norm, but I don&#x27;t think this is appropriate for a system language like rust (it would greatly complicate interop with C for example).<p>My idea is to make the continuation explicit and CPS transform all and only the functions that have a continuation as parameter (and any generic function with a type that is a continuation or contains a continuation). Fall back to dynamic stacks if the continuation escapes.<p>It is always continuations all the way down.')
