I don&#x27;t like subscriptions and avoid them for the most part, and Medium is effectively a weird bundle of mostly crap I mostly don&#x27;t care about.<p>When something is worth it, a la carte works for me. It should cost more than as part of a bundle. (Although I&#x27;d need to need your tutorial rather badly to pay the price of a book for it.)')
