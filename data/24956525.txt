Many things have been corroborated.<p>Yes, Russia engaged in a hacking operation, and seemed to favor Trump over Hillary.  That&#x27;s hardly sensational.  None of the sensational claims alleging conspiracy or blackmail have been supported despite years of investigation, and at least one claim was ruled innacurate&#x2F;misleading in court[1].  One of the main sources was also identified as a potential national security risk [2]<p>&gt; 2. Buzzfeed isn&#x27;t the NYT. You confuse the two, I don&#x27;t know why.<p>All mainstream news outlets, including the NYT, considered the dossier worth reporting even without verification.  Let&#x27;s not forget that this fundamentally started as a political opposition research document.<p>That the &quot;lack of verification&quot; with regard to Hunter&#x27;s laptop would somehow be a justification for not reporting on it at all is a completely hypocritical stance, especially as additional news has come up (Hunter Biden former business partner Devin Archer agreeing to work with FBI, Tony Bobulinski working with the FBI, the verification of at least one email by a 3rd party security firm, etc.).<p>&gt; Lol. The origins of the data was a hack of Hunter Biden&#x27;s iCloud (photos) and a GRU hack of Burisma (emails), the laptop cover story is laughable, and the best you can muster is &quot;Irrelevant&quot;.<p>I explained why it was irrelevant.  If you have evidence that links that hack to the laptop hard drive contents, then I suggest you share them with the FBI.  Otherwise, your reading comprehension needs some serious improvement.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-07-08&#x2F;billionaire-allegation-in-steele-dossier-misleading-judge-says" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-07-08&#x2F;billionai...</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;the-news-media-s-steele-dossier-scandal-is-even-worse-than-you-thought&#x2F;ar-BB19qX4m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;the-news-media-s-ste...</a>')
