There&#x27;s no reason for third parties to give up what they view as lucrative personal data on you to have it stored elsewhere.  The status quo is profitable for them, and this is an unproven system with no market share - so they have a handy excuse not to cater for it.<p>2) PDS solutions don&#x27;t only aggregate your data, but congregate it - centrally - for a bad actor to later exploit should the software ever be compromised.<p>I think the ideal solution here is something along the lines of what Blur and Apple Private Relay are doing.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;d really like to see Apple expand the private relay service beyond Sign in With Apple so that I can use private relay addresses with third party services that haven&#x27;t already moved to support SIWA.  Given the private relay e-mail is bound to the user by Apple, they should be able to make this slick enough to allow you to sign-in to the same account later if that service moves to support SIWA down the road.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;d love them to expand to anonymization services.  I would be quite happy to have packages or mail from third parties arrive addressed to &quot;FAO: RELAY-AMAZON:GX43UJXKL56ASFHU&quot; rather than to my actual name such that I don&#x27;t need to give that information out.<p>With Apple&#x27;s (or even Google&#x27;s) clout, I could ultimately see either of them (if they wanted to do so) win over a lot of goodwill by pushing the private relay to a person&#x27;s full identity rather than just their e-mail.  They&#x27;ve shown before they can make moonshot disruptions work if they&#x27;re so motivated (e.g. Apple Pay).  Google is already doing this for phones with Google Voice.  I&#x27;d pay for that service.  I&#x27;d pay a <i>lot</i> for that, actually.')
