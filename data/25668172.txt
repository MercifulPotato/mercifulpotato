The spending in Georgia isn&#x27;t because of ... whoever the candidates are, I don&#x27;t know their names. It is to decide which party gets another sympathetic vote in decision making.<p>The institution of Congress is critical. But the specific people in it at any time are important because of <i>how they got there</i>&#x2F;<i>who supported them on the way in</i> and not because of who they are. They could be replaced and it wouldn&#x27;t be a big issue, technically speaking. Practically there&#x27;d be huge consequences for whoever was stupid enough to disrespect the US Congress.')
