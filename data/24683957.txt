I have no numbers, but having gone through these systems myself, it seems like a lot to maybe even most. It become like a conveyer belt, and parents who understand the long term ramifications of these programs try to get their children on as early as possible.<p>Here is an interesting page I found on the history of the GT program for Fairfax Country Public Schools at elementary and middle school level:\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcag.org&#x2F;gtfcps.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcag.org&#x2F;gtfcps.html</a><p>These are the names of some of the previous tests:<p>- Gifted Behaviors Rating Scale form<p>- Naglieri Non-Verbal Abilities Test<p>- OLSAT<p>Obviously we can&#x27;t go back in time, but it would be interesting to know what kids at the testing eligible age thoughts&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;understanding where around these tests.')
