I work in a video games studio and like 90% of people have the default windows logo on blue background wallpaper. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice wallpaper, but people have their custom figurines and personal trinkets on the desks, but won&#x27;t bother to change the wallpaper on their desktop.')
