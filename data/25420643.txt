I read the AstraZeneca&#x2F;Oxford vaccine study, which was as serious as it can be (even the errors in the procedures were discovered and honestly reported):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a><p>From all people who were tested in the study (a lot, order of 40000) around 2 percent were infected during the study. Remember that as the base infection rate during the study.<p>At the same time, around 370 were <i>PCR positive at the start</i> of the study. But during the study, of these 370, 3 were <i>reinfected.</i> It&#x27;s not far from 1% of those. Now, as the infection rate of those not positive at the start (which we can consider &quot;control&quot;) was around 2%, it seems that the chance to be reinfected could be as high as 50% during just the months the study was ongoing!<p>Please don&#x27;t consider the estimated numbers as too exact, I don&#x27;t believe there are much significant digits for conclusion, but I believe they represent the <i>right order of magnitude</i> when based on that many subjects and the randomness of the process, and the only conclusion that could follow is: <i>naturally infected could be only weakly protected from the reinfection</i> only months later. The quote from the study:<p>&quot;A small proportion of participants were seropositive at baseline (138 [1·3%] of 10 673 in the UK and 235 [2·3%] of 10 002 in Brazil). Three participants seropositive at baseline had subsequent NAAT-positive swabs. One participant had an asymptomatic infection 3 weeks after a first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Two other participants in the control group had symptomatic infections 8 weeks and 21 weeks after their baseline sample was taken.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s for me a kind-of proof that the <i>reinfections aren&#x27;t rare at all</i>. Even more interesting, 2 of 3 were symptomatic, and the reinfections happened quite soon.<p>The reason it&#x27;s not more known is only because most of reinfections just aren&#x27;t tracked in careful studies like this one. Initially, the cases of reinfections weren&#x27;t dismissed for lacking the &quot;definitive&quot; proof.  An sure, most of the tests are just PCR, but there were a few studies where the sequencing was performed (much rarer and more expensive and time consuming procedure) and where it was possible to prove that the detected virus in the reinfection didn&#x27;t have the same genetic fingerprint as the initial one.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;laninf&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS1473-3099(20)30764-7&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;laninf&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS1473-3...</a>')
