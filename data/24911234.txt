They also get plenty of other science observations, but the main point was sample return.<p>Apollo brought back 842lb of samples for something like $260 billion (inflation adjusted), that being $19,299,287.41&#x2F;oz.<p>Of course, science was basically a side-effect of Apollo, so you can&#x27;t really charge it all to sample collection.
