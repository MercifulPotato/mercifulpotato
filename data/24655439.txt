Depending on perspective, it might be rehabilitative, or it might be punitive, but either way, time served should equate to a clear record, no? If not, you&#x27;re either saying they need further punishment, or you don&#x27;t believe that they&#x27;ve been rehabilitated, in which case why were they let out?')
