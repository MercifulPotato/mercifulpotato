I really think we&#x27;re regressing in terms of tech and ux and am finding it less and less tolerable. In my day to day I&#x27;m dealing with go, k8s, elixir, js, vue, various deployment and monitoring solutions, etc, I don&#x27;t want to fight just to keep a baseline OS functionality uncluttered.')
