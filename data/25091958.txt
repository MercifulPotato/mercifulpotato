Item(by='jacobush', descendants=None, kids=[25093176], score=None, time=1605357605, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25090387, text='True superresolution is impossible, but a heck of a lot of resolution is hidden in video, without resorting to guesses and hallucination.<p>Tiny camera shakes on a static scene gives away more information about that scene, it&#x27;s effectively multisampling of the static scene. (If I have to hunch it, any regular video can &quot;easily&quot; be upscaled 50% without resorting to interpolation or hallucination.)<p>Our wetware image processing does the same - look at a movie shot at the regular 24fps where people walk around. Their faces look normal. But pause any given frame, and it&#x27;s likely a blur. (But our wetware image processing likely does hallucination too, so it&#x27;s maybe not a fair comparison.)')
