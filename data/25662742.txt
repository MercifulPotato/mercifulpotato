I feel the same way.<p>I vote in every election. There are problems with many elections, especially ones for US President. Those problems are baked into the system we&#x27;ve established as a nation. States run their own elections. States elect US Presidents and not citizens.<p>I don&#x27;t think states could coordinate a conspiracy to change citizen votes to steer elections one way or another. Too many moving parts, too many people. It is fair one state has one set of rules that differ from another? Yes. It is the way the USA is built.<p>It frustrates me to no end that a group of people say, &quot;The election had no issues&quot; just as it frustrates me when someone says, &quot;The election was stolen.&quot; Those thoughts are always perpetuated by those who lead political parties.')
