And join in on conversations promoting burning his book.<p>His crime? Writing a female character who goes on the run, has limited food, and trains in martial arts--which leads to her losing weight.<p>This was, apparently, fat-shaming and deeply sexist.<p>The authors involved in these threats and book-burning talk had literally no punishment. None. Just a bunch of new followers who gushed about what &quot;strong women&quot; they were. (As a woman, I can&#x27;t think of anything weaker than threatening to burn a book and harass someone, all for internet points.)<p>The thing is, Publishing Twitter is super safe if you&#x27;re on the far left. You can talk about harassing people, burning books, and purposely destroying careers. Zero consequences at all.<p>But if you&#x27;re so much as a hair right of center left? Forget it. Your career is gone.')
