It needs to be done at a fundamental level, preferably by governments in school.<p>Afaik, there&#x27;s still zero official classes&#x2F;courses&#x2F;lessons&#x2F;whatever in most schools that would teach you to not trust everything you read and triple check everything yourself before believing anything.<p>Plus, this is pretty prone to abuse. Individuals are inherently dangerous, and crowds even more so. Someone doesn&#x27;t like person X, so they &quot;fact check&quot; his tweets. Others see this coming from a &quot;reputable&quot; poster and jump on the bandwagon.<p>Seen it so many times it got old. Experimented with it myself. A post on Reddit (same content) that gets 8-12 fake upvotes in the first 30 minutes after being posted is infinitely more likely to start getting upvoted by hundreds of real users and get to the subreddit&#x27;s hot front page than a post that got 0-3 upvotes, for example.<p>I was interested in Reddit&#x27;s voting system and learned some interesting stuff. They&#x27;re really smart about it, you can&#x27;t just have multiple accounts and some proxies&#x2F;VPNs and go at it like in the good old days. Votes are going to be ignored unless you know what you&#x27;re doing. Probably not news for anyone in the industry, but I found it interesting.')
