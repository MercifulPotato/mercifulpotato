Tough on Crime, War on Drugs, and the prison-industrial complex are unwarranted and destructive.<p>But this presupposes that those things are unambiguously bad. &quot;Tough on Crime&quot;? The American public broadly agrees that crime is bad and should be punished. I agree with you that the War on Drugs is bad, but that&#x27;s not representative of policing as a whole. I understand the &quot;ACAB&quot; outlook, but you have to understand that this isn&#x27;t an objective moral position, it&#x27;s purely subjective.<p>&gt; State and local governments that don&#x27;t change party-wise are much worse, as their actions are even less accountable; there&#x27;s no reason to improve.<p>You&#x27;re conflating dictatorships where the people have no mechanism by which to enact change with democracies where the people enact policies you don&#x27;t like. As a software engineer at Palantir, you&#x27;re essentially selling weapons to democratically elected governments whose constituents broadly agree with and vote for policies you don&#x27;t like. That&#x27;s obviously not great, but it&#x27;s also not as obviously bad as the punchy &quot;selling weapons to dictators&quot;.<p>&gt; It used to be assumed we had domestic privacy; it&#x27;s Snowden&#x27;s revelations that let us know we don&#x27;t have such rights. Now we&#x27;ve found ourselves in violation of Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<p>Sure, and it&#x27;s been 10+ years since Snowden&#x27;s revelations. We&#x27;ve had 2 presidential elections and 2 mid-term elections since then to address the problem using the levers of our republican government. A far cry from &quot;dictatorships&quot;, and by no means is it obvious that it&#x27;s unethical to provide software for an elected government that has enacted policy you and I both don&#x27;t like.')
