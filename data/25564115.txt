One persons right to fly a noisy helicopter around using a smartphone is not worth 20+ peoples right to read, walk and enjoy nature.<p>I find a loud buzzing totally pulls me out of any reverie and makes me angry. I was watching the birds last week near a drone also and they were rerouting or turning away from the area it was flying in. Totally not worth it to disturb people, and even worse, what little wildlife still remains in the open space we have pushed them into.')
