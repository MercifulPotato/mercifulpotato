This can work fine albeit with some extra latency for simple use cases, but if you ever run any services on your home network that either rely on UPnP or port forwarding, it&#x27;ll fall apart.<p>The best-of-both-worlds solution here is to have the outer ISP-provided router put your own router into some kind of DMZ, or use a bridge mode if the ISP router provides it. This basically turns your ISP-provided router into a dumber modem, and leaves all NAT and routing to your own hardware.')
