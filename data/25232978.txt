Regardless of which is written on the death certificate, the amount of supposed deaths &#x27;caused&#x27; by covid even by minimal estimates should be significantly larger than the margin of error on death records we have. Total deaths per year ( including absolutely everything) &#x27;only&#x27; totals 3 million which means 200k covid deaths is already 7% of that.<p>the reported differences are interesting no matter how you cut it, either covid isn&#x27;t as bad, or it is bad and people aren&#x27;t dying of certain other causes. Alternatively the US really sucks at counting.')
