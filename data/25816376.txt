I use many extensions in Safari just like I use to in Chrome, my needs for customization are the same regardless the browser I use, but like many choose Safari for his performance, privacy ui, among other benefits. Find it very frustrating that many of the big products don&#x27;t have Safari extensions. Often when I email there tech support they give a reason why, and then I try to explain there are referring to how extensions worked before, rather than how Safari extensions work now. So imagine a lot of companies don&#x27;t know about the changes, or think they don&#x27;t need to because they don&#x27;t have enough people asking for them, but people probably did ask for them but were told it was not possible before, so they stopped asking.')
