They would say, &quot;given no interference from politicians the US Military would win&quot; and you might say &quot;yes but politicians always interfere, there&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;no interference&#x27;&quot;<p>Any of the situations you highlighted all have restrictions set by politicians, not military. For example full military might hasn&#x27;t been released in Afghanistan. The politicians restrict what the military is allowed to do there. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s good or bad. In my un-informed opinion we shouldn&#x27;t be there. But you can&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s the military losing there when the military is not allowed to actually use all its power and resources.')
