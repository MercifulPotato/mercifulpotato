Give yourself a promotion.<p>Even if it&#x27;s similar job at same salary, the point is to go through the process to get an offer in reasonable time.  When you get the offer, you can decline the offer, if you&#x27;re happy with current company.<p>I recommend everyone go through the job search process at least once a year or more.<p>Job search process takes skills, like everything else.  It&#x27;s much better to sharpen the interview loop skills while you&#x27;re currently employed. You can take the time to analyze areas for improvements and learn the patterns in job search, interview loop process.<p>Good luck.')
