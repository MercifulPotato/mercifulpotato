Who chooses you over the other options?<p>Because the disadvantage of yours is lock-in &#x2F; pricing &#x2F; up-skilling to a non-standard way. Same problems as many others - Bubble.io etc.<p>There must be some killer win you get from using this.<p>Bubble lets people who have never coded build a rough MVP, maybe get some orders, so I can see why people fork up the $ and struggle through that UI, because the alternative is a 4-5 figure fee from a freelance programmer.<p>But I don&#x27;t think Canonic avoids code as you still need to do the front end. (Maybe that&#x27;s it? You create a front end version of Canonic next?)<p>So I&#x27;m interested in who will buy this and why.')
