I asked about how the company deals with those, and the interviewer said they don&#x27;t do estimates because there&#x27;s never been a time where something productive came out of one, and I think it makes sense.<p>In my experience, when an estimate is spot on the world goes on as if nothing happened. When it&#x27;s incorrect, all hell breaks loose and it&#x27;s every man for himself. And at the end of the day, all of the blame ends up on the person who guessed wrong. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with that anymore.')
