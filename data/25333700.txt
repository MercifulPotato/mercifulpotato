In MA, that 100kWh will cost you $20. (That&#x27;s after a potentially $75K-100K installation cost for the geothermal wells and equipment vs $10K for a decent modcon boiler.)<p>So, pay an extra $50K-90K up-front and 33% more for your variable energy. (Of course, you get air-conditioning included above in most of the geothermal installs.)')
