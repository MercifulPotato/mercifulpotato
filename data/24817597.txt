It slows things down. I guess a more modern approach is to relax those constraints a bit and realise that some data can be expressed in different ways, and that duplication isn’t too much of a concern because storage is cheap. \nThat said, it’s not an excuse for reinventing the stack over an over. I think the thirst to reinvent has largely been driven by the shift from expensive proprietary solutions like Teradata and Oracle to open source ones. That’s a positive shift.')
