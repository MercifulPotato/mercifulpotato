In California, a ballot initiative cannot be repealed without the consent of voters. Therefore, the state legislature could not take action to change time policy unless voters approved Proposition 7. This applied to both permanent daylight savings time and permanent standard time.[1]<p>As I understand, Prop 7 was needed to undo Prop 12, which then gave the CA state legislature the power to go with DST all year around, which they have indicated they want to since 2016:<p>&gt;In 2016, the California State Legislature asked the President and Congress to pass an act that would allow California to adopt year-round DST.[2]<p>It seems that it&#x27;s the federal government preventing the states from doing what they want to do, hence my quip about states&#x27; rights.')
