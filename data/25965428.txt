The U.S stands at 1 in 750 people dead from covid, mostly elderly with comorbidities, a rate similar to many other countries.<p>That is 0.13% of the population. That&#x27;s not 1 in 10, or even 1 in 100. It&#x27;s not the young and healthy, either. A pretty small number. And if you are old and frail something is going to get you soon, anyways.<p>Per-capita just as many, perhaps several times more, people died of the 1968 Hong Kong flu.<p>New viruses happen, part of nature, people die, that&#x27;s how it goes, This isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as a lot of similar situations in the past.')
