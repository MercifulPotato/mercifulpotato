In every state there are laws that you must hold a license to perform certain tasks, so it&#x27;s not inconceivable that the government will say: &quot;This is too dangerous to let just anyone do, look what unlicensed, and untrained people did with GameStop. The government must require that only a professional licensed financial trader buy or sell stocks and securities.&quot;')
