Swedish is also easy compared to English and French, the other two languages I&#x27;ve learned after early childhood. The only thing that makes it hard is that you never really have use for it and you&#x27;re forced to learn it nevertheless here in Finland.<p>I&#x27;m happy to see people here on HN respect the difficulty of learning languages. Most foreigners that speak Finnish do it very poorly at first and even after decades they still sound like foreigners. But it shows huge respect to our small country for someone to make the effort, and we really appreciate it. I&#x27;m hoping other people see learning their own mother tongue the same way. Sure, most of us need English, but learning it <i>well</i> is still a huge task.')
