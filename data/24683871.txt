It is to create a legal entity that shields owners from liability.<p>True.  But the owners are the shareholders.  The bargain is if they limit their involvement to providing capital, their liability is limited to what they provided.<p>But the Slackers didn&#x27;t limit their involvement to just buying shares, they ran the place.  There are not just on the line for criminal activity, the banks could have made them personally responsible for money borrowed, companies made them responsible for NDA&#x27;s, governments hold them personally responsible for things they sign like tax submissions.')
