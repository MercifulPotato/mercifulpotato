I&#x27;m still young and naive, but it seems like we could avoid the whole legal morass of contractor vs hourly employee vs salaried employee who must be paid for extra hours worked vs &quot;real&quot; salaried employee, state constitutional amendments requiring 7&#x2F;8 supermajorities to overturn, having your health records privy to your employer, having to pay 2x (even accounting for employer contributions) for worse health coverage if you&#x27;re not employed by _somebody_, and all the other garbage in our current system (forgive the USA-centric view).')
