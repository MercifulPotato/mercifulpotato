The keys are printed on every check, the transactions aren&#x27;t reversible, the settlement times are practically untenable for business. I&#x27;ve sold and bought payroll services, charged my customers with ACH, paid vendors with ACH, read the gawdawful spec, and I haven&#x27;t much good to say about it, other than it mostly works, and enough people know it well enough.')
