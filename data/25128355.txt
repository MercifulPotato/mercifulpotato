Most were erected around 1900-20, when Jim Crow laws were being widely enacted, and in the 1950s and 60s, when the civil rights movement was ramping up. They were built as symbols of white supremacy to send a message.<p>I see no reason to keep those up.<p>It wasn&#x27;t just monuments that got built or change to oppose black civil rights. A similar thing happened with the Georgia state flag. It had long had a blue vertical stripe on the left and red&#x2F;white&#x2F;red horizontal stripes on the right. Then the left got what appears to be a Minuteman standing next to some columns that have banners that say &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Wisdom&quot;, and &quot;Moderation&quot;. That was in 1902.<p>In 1906 they added &quot;Georgia&quot; to that and 1799, and made the design of the columns more stylized and uglier. (This also changed the way &quot;Moderation&quot; line wrapped, from &quot;Moder&quot; &quot;ation&quot; to &quot;Mode&quot; &quot;ration&quot;, so you might mistake it for two words).<p>In 1920 that changed to a circular thing with &quot;State of Georgia&quot; and 1776 on the outside, and a simple blue and white set of columns with the Minuteman, and &quot;Moderation&quot; back to sensible line breaking. I think this matched or is similar to the state seal.<p>And then in 1956, with black people pushing harder for equal rights, Georgia replaced the right side of the flag, the part that had been three red&#x2F;white&#x2F;red horizontal stripes, was replaced with the Confederate battle flag. This was adopted amidst a slew of bills adopted at the same time designed to protect segregation and white supremacy. This was all in response to Brown v. Board of Education.<p>They partly got rid of that in 2001, going to a blue background with the columns&#x2F;Minuteman seal things, and a banner below that labeled &quot;Georgia&#x27;s History&quot;, which had images of five small flags in it: the original 13 colonies flag, three Georgia flags (ending with the one with the Confederate battle flag), and the current US flag. Finally in 2003 they adopted their current flag: 3 red&#x2F;white&#x2F;red stripes with a blue inset in the upper left containing a circle of 13 stars around the Minuteman&#x2F;Column thing, much more tastefully done than any of its past versions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;544266880&#x2F;confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;544266880&#x2F;confederate-statues...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-the-u-s-got-so-many-confederate-monuments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-the-u-s-got-so-many-confede...</a>')
