I majored in philosophy, still read philosophy (both ancient and modern academic), and have never encountered anyone saying that classification of things is a violent act.<p>It&#x27;s true there has always been a struggle, going back to ancient Greece and Thucydides, about whether politics should be about justice (or morality) or power.[0] Between what is right, and who has force. And some, like Chomsky (who some might call a radical), say that everyone living in a modern society is complicit in some way[1]. But I&#x27;ve never seen anyone say that believing in justice&#x2F;morality instead of power makes one complicit.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;realism-intl-relations&#x2F;#RootRealTrad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;realism-intl-relations&#x2F;#R...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chomsky.info&#x2F;200601__&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chomsky.info&#x2F;200601__&#x2F;</a>')
