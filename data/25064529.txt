Nuclear is about 70% utilisation on average, wind about 20%. Similar story with solar.<p>Nuclear plants tent to have a very long shelf life, wind not so much (to take into account in the cost comparison)<p>There is a lot of diversification in the demand, not all machines of a country are switched on at the same time, in fact a small fraction of the machines are consuming electricity at a given time. When you adopt a centralised grid with large sources of power, you benefit from this diversification. When you produce the electricity locally, you need to size it for the max local demand, and you need to do that everywhere. That means you end up installing a lot more capacity than you would need with a centralised network.<p>And the grid in most developped countries is already designed for a centralised supply, so if you switch to a completely different approach you need to invest in your grid.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to compare the cost per W produced.')
