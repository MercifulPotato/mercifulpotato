We don&#x27;t need to replace English with something &quot;new&quot; every couple of years, and writing instructions for machines is the same. The syntax of Java was &quot;almost perfect&quot; and is STILL <i>extremely</i> similar in TS&#x2F;JS so there was no need to &quot;burn it all down&quot; like Go and Rust did.<p>Why do you think JavaScript has the word &quot;Java&quot; right in it. lol. Must have been something in there that was good to this very day.')
