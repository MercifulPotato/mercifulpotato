I work on software that, among many other things, calculates durations between local times that have been recorded.  DST is a constant thorn in my side.<p>And no, I can&#x27;t &quot;just use UTC&quot;.  To be compliant, the software must accept input in local times.<p>If it&#x27;s possible to shift working hours (which it is), then what is the purpose of DST anyway.
