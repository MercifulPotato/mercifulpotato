That&#x27;s exactly their modus operandi.<p>They&#x27;re following the &quot;rules&quot; from &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;, remember.  Specifically, the &quot;Release early and often&quot; bit, for the purposes of this conversation.  Microsoft are considered &quot;good open source citizens&quot; because of the changes they&#x27;ve made to follow the written non-rules as well as the the unwritten rules.<p>If you&#x27;re going to fault Microsoft for following the rules, fault EVERYONE ELSE that does it as well.<p>I want people to realize that they crap on Microsoft hard for things that they gladly accept from other developers or other companies.  The double standards in the IT community are absolutely insane.')
