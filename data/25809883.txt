For theoretical reasons, the ratio of momentum to energy is fixed at 1&#x2F;c, which is 3.3E-6 N&#x2F;kW, that is very low compared to ion thrusters or chemical rockets.<p>Moreover it&#x27;s the same value that you get with a photon rocket, i.e a laser or a flashlight in the back of your rocket <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Photon_rocket" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Photon_rocket</a><p>So even in space, it is not very useful and you can replace it with a more simple and more efficient device.')
