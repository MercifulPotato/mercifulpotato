Item(by='mattdeboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605720882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137202, text='&gt; But some days I get so angry, I rage against the phone. I say the iPhone is evil. It’s stealing her childhood.<p>&gt; ...<p>&gt; The worst part is that our child has changed. She used to rush to our bed as soon as she woke, demanding cuddles and to “Talk Friends.” We played with puppets and stuffed animals in the morning, getting the “friends” to sing and act out scenes from plays like Robin Hood and Beauty and the Beast. We all got involved. Those days are gone. I understand she’s probably too big for “Talk Friends,” but it’s heartbreaking watching her race into our room each morning to grab her phone.<p>The problem is not the phone. The problem is making the child choose between attachment and authenticity. She doesn&#x27;t run to you anymore because you&#x27;re constantly fixated &amp; raging about the phone. Not because she prefers her phone to her parents. You&#x27;ve told her it&#x27;s not safe to be herself around you.')
