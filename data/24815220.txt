At the same time training on gaming gpus like 1080 ti or 2080 ti is widely popular, though they lack the ECC memory of the &quot;professional&quot; quadro cards or V100. I did think conventional DL wisdom said &quot;precision doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; and &quot;small errors don&#x27;t matter&quot; though.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this difference in quality perf in my own experiments tpu vs gaming gpu, but don&#x27;t know for sure what the cause is. I never did notice a difference between gaming gpu trained models and quadro trained modela.
