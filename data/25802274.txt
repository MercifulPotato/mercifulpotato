Then if you&#x27;re smart, you&#x27;ll have a layered architecture (which the 80% layer rests upon) that allows the other 20% to learn about how the sausage is made in order to do their complex tasks.<p>With this, you have a common tool that is at least 80% easily understandable with minimal time investment.<p>Failure to do this gives you unfriendly systems like CMake, Gradle, OpenSSL, Postfix, and Java&#x27;s time libraries.<p>U&#x2F;X applies to code as well.')
