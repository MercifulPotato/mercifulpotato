Sweden has a hidden tax system called &quot;arbetsgivaravgift&quot; which only the employer can see. It&#x27;s hidden and not labeled as a tax because it tricks people into believing you&#x27;re paying less taxes than you actually do.<p>So when you think you&#x27;re paying ~32% income tax, in reality it&#x27;s closer to 50%.')
