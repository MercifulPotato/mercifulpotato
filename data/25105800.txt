You are acting like I am saying something that I&#x27;m not saying.  Here is a simplified timeline that would meet the criteria I am talking about.<p>2020 - EV infrastructure works for a minority of drivers.<p>2030 - EV infrastructure works for the average driver.<p>2045 - EV infrastructure works for all drivers.<p>Also I was talking about conversion because it isn&#x27;t like the ICE infrastructure is going to persist in perpetuity.  That real estate can be converted over to public EV chargers as the ratio of cars on the road change.  Right now Tesla&#x27;s fastest chargers can do an 80% charge in less than 30 minutes.  If the industry is able to cut that in half over the next 20 years, recharging an EV isn&#x27;t really going to be any less practical than refueling an ICE vehicle.  We aren&#x27;t going to need a dedicated parking space with a dedicated charger for every car by 2030.')
