I&#x27;m actively looking for a high-level language to put on top of an enterprise product, but it has to either transpile to C or integrate well with a C standard library (unfortunately). It&#x27;s not a 100% requirement, as Rust still works because I can override the global allocator.<p>Right now I&#x27;m looking towards Nim, which has some pros and cons. I&#x27;m still not good enough to build complex APIs with it, but it&#x27;s really easy to integrate. Nim feels like Python for systems programming.')
