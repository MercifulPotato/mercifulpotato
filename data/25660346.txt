Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609956165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659036, text='&gt; Do you happen to know of a properly written (publicly available) spec? I&#x27;d love to see a good example.<p>As somebody that has written hundreds of specs and PRDs over the years, I think one of the counter-intuitive things about doing it well is that there is no such thing as a &quot;properly written spec&quot;. Or more accurately, &quot;properly written&quot; isn&#x27;t a single path.  You can&#x27;t really templatize this in a generic way.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d offer the following basic advice which will help to build good specs:<p>1. Create an outline first, enumerate the list of stakeholders and the sections&#x2F;topics that those stakeholders are most interested in addressing.  Use this outline as the basis for filling in the details.<p>2. Don&#x27;t write more than you have to.  Rather than being overly verbose, establish the context of what&#x2F;why&#x2F;when at the top of the document in a summary, and then focus only on the most relevant conclusory details in each section after.  The more shared domain knowledge the stakeholders have, the less you have to write.<p>3. A good spec results in a finished product&#x2F;feature&#x2F;widget.  Be clear about what you know, what you don&#x27;t know, and what you believe.  Leave room for things to be discovered during implementation.  Be concise.<p>Basically, don&#x27;t write more than is necessary to actually achieve what the output of the spec is trying to achieve given the team&#x2F;organizational context that the spec is going to be used in.  Be as concise as possible, eschewing verbosity when possible because shared knowledge already exists.  For this reason, &quot;properly written specs&quot; are very team&#x2F;organization&#x2F;project&#x2F;product&#x2F;person dependent.  There&#x27;s no universal format that works.')
