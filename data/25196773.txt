I design electronics professionally and I rarely do breadboard prototypes (and almost never using a solderless breadboard). This is because I can be reasonably confident about the behaviour of most circuits with perhaps a little bit of simulation using a SPICE model for some analogue parts. For complex digital logic (which is very rare to design using seperate ICs these days, you would use an FPGA) there is a multitude of simulation systems you can use as well to test your design (including some of the design tools for FPGAs).<p>PCBs can be made cheaply and on short notices these days (I can get 5-off a 4-layer PCB for $200 in 4 days, and that extends both cheaper if I can wait longer and shorter if I want to pay more), and solderless breadboards are atrocious for almost anything I&#x27;d want to prototype (the parasitic capacitances, inductances, and resistances are all really bad. sensitive analog circuits, high-speed digital, and power electronics all suffer badly from those).')
