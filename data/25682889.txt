Item(by='sirn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610096149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676978, text='Before USB 4, USB-C spec itself say &quot;see also USB 3.1&quot; for USB hubs and disallow passing through Alternate Modes (e.g. Thunderbolt&#x2F;DisplayPort) or Accessory Modes (e.g. audio dongle) which vastly limited the usability of USB-C port. USB 4 introduces a new discovery protocol with added support for passing through Alternate Mode in USB-C spec (as long as downstream is also USB 4).')
