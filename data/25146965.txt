Followed by 10 years of meandering work experience in Salesforce, analytics (mostly Excel&#x2F;VBA&#x2F;Python&#x2F;SQL stuff) and sales operations (mostly running reporting&#x2F;analytics&#x2F;projects to grow sales).<p>I have a keen interest in data science and would like to do an 1yr&#x2F;2yr online master&#x27;s degree to fill the big gaps I have in knowledge and also earn credibility (important to land interviews in India where I&#x27;m based). But I find that good Master&#x27;s program require a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in something more technical than accounting. Has anyone in this situation found any good solutions?<p>PS: Can&#x27;t afford the opportunity cost of a full-time in-person Master&#x27;s program.<p>PPS: Looking for a math&#x2F;stats&#x2F;programming heavy program, not one of those &quot;data science management&quot; ones.<p>Thanks in advance!')
