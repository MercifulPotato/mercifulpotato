Item(by='pfalcon', descendants=None, kids=[25486063], score=None, time=1608463720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25484049, text='&gt; if a city wanted to make automated cars a reality in their streets, there are tons of accommodations they could do: from radio beacons to official maps, standards on how to signal construction work, purposefully designed roads...<p>Sorry, but that sounds hilarious. If &quot;a city wanted&quot;, it&#x27;s still people who would need to ensure &quot;to signal construction work&quot;. And people don&#x27;t care. And for other stuff, people would need to pay for it with their taxes. I&#x27;m sorry, but as an outsider, I would say the roads (usual roads!) in the US are in &quot;perfect&quot; condition only in California. In other states, it&#x27;s the usual asphalt-with-cracks, which will turn into a hole when a heavy truck rides it thru the rainy&#x2F;snow season.<p>Heck, majority of the world has problems with trash on the streets, and cities can&#x27;t neither teach their people to not litter, nor clean up timely after them.')
