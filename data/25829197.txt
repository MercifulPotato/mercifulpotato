Something either meets the quality threshold or it doesn&#x27;t. And as the author found out, physicians do not spend their time researching medications. It&#x27;s not their job, they&#x27;re not trained in it, and most of them wouldn&#x27;t be particularly good at it.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure why you would expect a psychiatrist to do something she&#x27;s not trained to do to (<i>maybe</i>) increase an already acceptable metric some arbitrarily small amount higher.')
