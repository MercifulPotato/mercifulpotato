Exceptions exist but are rare. In practice the generous[TM] 30-day trial period is almost always worthless, and often a gateway to sustained net negative.<p>Add to that the constant barrage of dark patterny attempts to infest your calendar and the upsell pressure tactics. Every third-party integration is an additional liability for maintenance, and far too frequently an increase in attack surface. Time is your most precious asset and the sales people are trying to rob you of it.<p>To every sales person on the planet: if you want to sell me a service or product, then sell me NOTHING BUT the service or product. Make useful documentation accessible, and make additional features discoverable, with unambiguous pricing clearly in place where necessary. Then get out of my way.<p>With OSS product I can install and trial it as long as I need, without needing to give off my contact details or be added to your invasive CRM. If I need additional features that are only available under your more restrictive license offering, I will buy them when <i>I</i> have the need. Your sales quota or bonus thresholds do not factor in, and if you try make them my problem, I will look at migration options.')
