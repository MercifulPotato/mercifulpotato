I think sea-level rise is going to be a non-event: the worst models predict about 18 inches over a century, which is less than tidal variation in most places.<p>Changing weather and vegetation patterns is going to be a <i>big</i> event.  We&#x27;re going to see some previously fertile areas (Mesopotamia, Northern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa) suffer from decade-long droughts, while other previously uninhabitable areas (Canadian &amp; Russian taiga and the Sahara, for example) become fertile grasslands.  This will drive widespread migration, which has a tendency to destroy political stability and lead to mass wars.  Nature isn&#x27;t going to kill us; we&#x27;re going to kill each other because some of us are going to starve and others are going to get fabulously wealthy.')
