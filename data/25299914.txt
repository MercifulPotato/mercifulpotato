Code is only translated as it is discovered and when possible, and branch instructions are made to point to already translated and saved code (memoization).</i><p><i>Dynamic binary translation differs from simple emulation (eliminating the emulator&#x27;s main read-decode-execute loop—a major performance bottleneck), paying for this by large overhead during translation time. This overhead is hopefully amortized as translated code sequences are executed multiple times.</i><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosetta_(software)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosetta_(software)</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Binary_translation#Dynamic_binary_translation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Binary_translation#Dynamic_bin...</a>')
