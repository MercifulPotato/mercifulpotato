When I started programming, I basically just learned the bare minimum VI commands to get around. I didn&#x27;t see it as &quot;a religion&quot; or a relic from the past, but I saw a fairly steep learning curve that wasn&#x27;t a high priority for me to tackle at the time.<p>Years later, I did get into it. It&#x27;s been good for me in terms of efficiency, but much more importantly, it&#x27;s been good for my health. At the end of 2017, I had severe RSI and from working an extreme schedule on a startup and a poor ergonomic setup. My wrists were so injured that it hurt to even brush my teeth.<p>I got an ergonomic keyboard, and made a concerted attempt to use the mouse as little as possible (and balance that little bit between both hands). I made VIM my primary driver, regardless of what other editor I was using. Even on web pages, I attempted to use keyboard navigation where feasible, especially in email and similar apps.<p>As a result, I&#x27;ve no healed to where I do full-time weeks at the keyboard again and I will probably always be grateful to VIM (and Kinesis!)')
