A crude yet effective method is to overclock the RAM beyond a reasonable frequency and a handful of correctable errors should pop up in no time.<p>In case the OS&#x2F;BIOS does not support overclocking or fails report memory error properly, certain data pins of the dimm slot could be physically shorted with metal wire to add a persistent stuck bit. Without ECC the system will not boot. I&#x27;ve seen it done on multiple occasions but web search is drawing a blank for the moment. IIRC it was being discussed a lot when first gen Ryzen cpu came out and people were arguing left and right whether ECC support is present on motherboard X.<p>Finally some memtest software claims to be able to inject errors on a software level. I can&#x27;t vouch for them as I have very little experience but it would be very simple to find out.')
