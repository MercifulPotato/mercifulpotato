For example, I&#x27;d almost always rather listen to Murray Perahia&#x27;s Goldberg Variations than Gould&#x27;s.  I just love Perahia&#x27;s sense of musicality and the warmth of it all.  Gould&#x27;s younger Goldbergs are insanely virtuosic&#x2F;quicksilver but I find myself almost getting beat over the head by it all.<p>In either event, my point about Brendel was more just that he&#x27;s worth checking out in his own right and not just some dude who wrote a possibly crappy book.  And I still love his Schubert Impromptus even if his technique looks lame to more discerning eyes!')
