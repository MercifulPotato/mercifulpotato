There&#x27;s a ton of techniques to upscaling, and a lot are way better than a shitty bilinear filter. Temporal upscaling, for example, is also a thing, and is very good ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;A2A-rhCQCuY?t=605" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;A2A-rhCQCuY?t=605</a> ). Upscaling in general has been a huge area of technique improvements &amp; innovations thanks to the xbox one &amp; PS4 struggling so hard with 4k desires.<p>DLSS 2.0 is a great addition to that field, but it&#x27;s <i>far</i> from being the only good option here. AMD has also done some things in this area, too, like Radeon Boost which was the idea of dynamically reducing resolution in response to player inputs, with the idea being if you&#x27;re sitting still-ish you&#x27;re OK sacrificing FPS for better quality, but as soon as you start whipping about you want the FPS more. Game engines also do similar things, and combined with temporal upscaling &amp; antialiasing are quite compelling.')
