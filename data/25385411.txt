And regulations typically make that hard and expensive. Plus you would need to do some construction work, which also adds to the expense.<p>So strong hotel demand certainly does push up land value overall over time, but it happens much more slowly and to a lesser extent than with AirBnB.<p>AirBnB gives investors a way around hotel regulations and construction costs. You can buy an existing house and with very little friction or cost start generating revenue from tourism demand.')
