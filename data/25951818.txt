That&#x27;s not how people treat reviews (people will leave a positive review if they love the business but the app is crap), so it&#x27;s misleading to only enforce such an ideal here, with negative reviews.<p>2. In this case, the business effectively <i>is</i> the app, at least from the user&#x27;s perspective. The app wouldn&#x27;t let me even look at GME&#x2F;AMC today, much less buy it. That&#x27;s not what I want from a stock trading app, because it&#x27;s an annoying experience that leaves a sour taste in my mouth, so 1-star it is.')
