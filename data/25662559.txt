I think that everybody - regardless of their politics or candidates of choice - is frequently inundated with the <i>notion</i> that we&#x27;re very different.<p>But having visited 43 states in the past five years, and making it my business to talk politics and religion everywhere I have gone (especially in the aftermath of the 2016 election), I have repeatedly been surprised by the simple commonness of people&#x27;s hopes: for peace, justice, security, prosperity.<p>Most people with whom I spend my time seem to think that Trump voters are all just like Trump.  But I have not found that to be so whatsoever.  I have repeatedly been surprised and sometimes even confused by the reasonableness and sophistication of Trump supporters, especially in the South.<p>And rage at America&#x27;s institutions - including surely dreams of raiding the Capitol and wrecking havok - is surely not limited to one party of political view.  It&#x27;s not a tactic I favor, though I do certainly hope to see this silly building fade into the irrelevance of the failed state.<p>The incentives of social media algorithms are influential in the way we think about each other.<p>We are constantly shown Trump supporters who can&#x27;t form a coherent and fact-based narrative.  We&#x27;re shown &#x27;antifa&#x27; who seem to prefer roving destruction and mayhem rather than an equitable society.<p>But neither of these tropes reflect anything close to the reality of 2020 America.  We are a society of peaceful, educated, hopeful people.  Travel.  Ask.  You&#x27;ll see.')
