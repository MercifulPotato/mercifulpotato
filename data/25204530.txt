Apple has always advertised functionality and performance of their products, even when the case was (charitably) pretty shaky. They advertised their PowerPC Macs that way, up until the point they couldn&#x27;t, then advertised their Intel Macs that way. Now they&#x27;re advertising their ARM Macs that way. They proudly advertised their moves to 64-bit CPUs. They proudly advertised to consumers how cool it was that OS X was &quot;Unix certified.&quot; Repeat: <i>to consumers.</i><p>Yes, Apple is super conscious of design, occasionally to an obvious fault, from &quot;butterfly&quot; keyboards back through the G4 Cube. But they&#x27;ve absolutely always been interested in aiming for seriously high-end machines, from <i>all</i> of the Mac Pro incarnations all the way back to oldies like the Mac IIfx.<p>I hope other people make competitive silicon, too. I want Linux around and high-performing, and it&#x27;s still a bit of an open question what the future holds for development environments on ARM-based Macs. But it is just <i>so</i> wearying for people who are otherwise technically literate to still be trotting out &quot;Apple has never cared about anything but looks&quot; after <i>literally decades</i> of obvious counter-examples.')
