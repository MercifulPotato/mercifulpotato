We are de facto left only with IEEE 754, and there are even regarding that continuous attempts to implement less.<p>So what&#x27;s left is the wiggle room, but not only in JavaScript as the specification or specific interpreters, but in other languages too.<p>&quot;stdlib&quot; sounds good, but do they guarantee to never change any implementation of some math function?<p>I don&#x27;t agree what the author saw was really &quot;a glitch in the language itself.&quot; It&#x27;s directly allowed by the language to happen.')
