The problem is that I think almost nobody is using it, so it could come with a risk of introducing more bugs.<p>By the way, the example shown in the documentation page that you link to seems ridiculous:<p><pre><code>  void *slist = g_slist_alloc (); &#x2F;* void* gives up type-safety *&#x2F;\n  g_list_free (slist);            &#x2F;* corruption: sizeof (GSList) != sizeof (GList) *&#x2F;\n</code></pre>\nThis bug should actually be caught during compilation if we store the list in a GSList* typed variable instead of void*. You’d think: who does that?<p>Except that this is what you actually end up doing when using any kind of nested glib containers. Elements are always void*, so you have to cast them correctly. So for non-trivial applications, it’s very easy to make mistakes, since you lose the type checking support of the compiler.<p>C is already a tricky language. Removing the type checker makes it even worse.')
