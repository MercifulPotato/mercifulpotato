What is your current street address? Where do your parents live, and what is their phone number? How about your kids?<p>I’m asking rhetorically. All this info and more is available to anyone with a full name and photograph via people-finder sites like Spokeo and SocialCatfish, which is exactly what Facebook accounts with a “real name policy” expose to the world.
