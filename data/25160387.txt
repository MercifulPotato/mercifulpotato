I had the (mis)fortune of getting hit by a major hurricane so the house had to be gutted to the studs. I ended up doing it myself with a fastkick binary gun as I already had an 80 gallon compressor. Ended up costing me 7k to do right at 2000 sq.ft, at an average depth of 3 inches, including under the floor (we are on a pier system) and the ceiling. We put foam board up in the attic and shot the foam between the rafters to the foam board, so there is a little extra insulation there.')
