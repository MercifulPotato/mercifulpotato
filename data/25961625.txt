It strikes me as a high school term paper about socialism where someone got confused while they were copying-and-pasting from Wikipedia. Soviet Union was socialist? Mmm, I guess on some technicality, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they were the poster child (at least for posters produced in the U. S.) for communism.<p>And the only fleshed-out example is Venezuela? Not more positive examples like, say, UK or France that could be argued to have at least some socialist elements to their governance? Anyway, I&#x27;m arguing with something that probably came from a content farm somewhere, best get back to fixing that bug.')
