Jira, base amp and azure DevOps all support this.<p>The symptoms of poor communication or following a proces cannot be deslt with be changing from Slack to email.<p>People needs to be educated it seems as where communication must go.<p>Emails are not for work items under a sprint.

Slack is for &quot;hey, where is that vacation spreadsheet&quot; and not &quot;should this feature be with bootstrap or vanilla HTML?&quot;<p>The latter is work. It is discussed where work lives. Work does not live in Slack.<p>Good luck')
