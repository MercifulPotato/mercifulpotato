There was fairly decent broadband availability, etc. But just barely. Go back just another 5 years and it gets much harder.<p>&gt;but all online gives you is some time<p>And a lot more types of goods available. Again, 25 years ago, it would not have been practical for people to have wholesale pivoted a huge amount of shopping online. (And companies like B&amp;H Photo couldn&#x27;t have scaled.)<p>20 years is probably just about the cusp of it barely being possible.')
