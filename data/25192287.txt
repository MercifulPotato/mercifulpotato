Maybe someday I&#x27;ll be willing to invest the time to understand what&#x27;s going on, but the CLI and docs just aren&#x27;t good enough to go from &quot;I know nothing&quot; to &quot;ah, I can install the latest &lt;firefox,inkscape,chromium,etc.&gt;&quot;.\nIt really isn&#x27;t clear to me how to switch a running system&#x27;s package manager to either or even if either is fit to be the system&#x27;s main package manager.<p>I watched a video of a seasoned linux user trying to install nix and abandoning the procedure because of the lack of docs. I even downloaded a virtualbox image of NixOS and tried to update everything to the latest version: 30 minutes later only firefox was installed but it wasn&#x27;t in PATH thus couldn&#x27;t be executed. Never found out how to install the KDE desktop.<p>Guix was another beast that I tried installing as a non-root user (insisted on using `curl | bash`, which I loathe). It was never up to date and I couldn&#x27;t find the package I wanted to install (so fancy new chromium wrapper.. next-browser or something).<p>Maybe now things are better, but back then (1-2 years ago), neither were anywhere close to modern GUI distros.\nUntil they make it easy to use, it&#x27;s going to stay niche.')
