I&#x27;d agree that would be a major concern if on those trend lines post outbreak the 2020 deaths clearly dropped below the historical average.  Given the fact that the year isn&#x27;t over I&#x27;ll take FT&#x27;s analysis over that bar chart OP linked to.  If what you say is true it appears to be due to the fact that Sweden&#x27;s 2020 deaths were below average in February, based on those charts that seems unlikely though.  However +20% is an overestimate as a result.')
