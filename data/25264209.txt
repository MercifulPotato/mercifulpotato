No one is allowed to fail so nothing is discovered.<p>And exactly how is superconductivity so very little understood? It&#x27;s used in massive projects the world over from superconducting cables to maglev trains to numerous other things. And none of that has been figured out by ITER. ITER is the worst thing for fusion research in decades.')
