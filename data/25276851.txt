To the left of my user name, next to the minimize&#x2F;maximize buttons, I can switch (in my mind)... something. I guess tenant is the word, but in my mind that is the team.<p>I see now that what I&#x27;ve always thought of as &quot;channels&quot; is called Teams, no idea how I&#x27;ve overlooked that for over two years but there you go.<p>My point is in Discord I can be on a dozen different servers with different administrators and seamlessly go between them. Not so in Teams. I&#x27;m stuck to one tenant (team) at a time. Which sucks if you need to switch between them.')
