Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=[25890141, 25890090], score=None, time=1611471778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25889555, text='Sure but in those countries, is a $10 transaction fee an acceptable trade-off? It probably isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the thing. The fee is only palatable in countries that have banking infrastructure, and in ones that don&#x27;t it&#x27;s beyond extortionate. Like, monthly salary extortionate. Certainly when you factor in the $80 of electricity per transaction that&#x27;s currently being socialized across block reward. 7tx&#x2F;sec is enough for an average Costco or a big flea market, not a country. And once you move to Layer 2, the guarantees you&#x27;re pointing at no longer apply as an exchange can shut you off just as an unreliable bank can - and you can just as easily set up a bank as set up an exchange.<p>If this is about providing banking infrastructure to countries that don&#x27;t have it, the fees are not acceptable, and so Bitcoin is not a solution. If this is about evading taxes when running a business, I suspect having your business shut down is still in the cards.')
