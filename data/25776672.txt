Any younger than that, I often can only even tell you&#x27;re from New York City by word choice and slang, not accent. I suspect that&#x27;s similar to what&#x27;s going on in Paris, albeit I&#x27;m in absolutely no position to know.<p>(For context: I did not grow up in NYC, but my family was from there, and I lived there for quite awhile myself as well. It&#x27;s entirely possible someone who <i>did</i> grow up in NYC can do better than I can, but, at least to my ear, it gets very close to just standard American broadcast English the younger you go, so I doubt it.)')
