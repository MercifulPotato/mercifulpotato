Suppose that there is also a sizeable reward for winning proposals -- enough to make it worth-while to write good ones.<p>There are a number of benefits: (1) prevents scientists from being too attached to their own hypotheses (2) demands that the research plan be described well enough up front that any reasonably capable team should be able to understand it (3) rewards scientists for executing well on the proposals, even if the hypothesis turned out to be wrong.')
