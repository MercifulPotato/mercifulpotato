In practice, a feature may be deprecated if it is:<p>1. Legacy inherited from C that serves no modern purpose. The register keyword.<p>2. Features hardly anybody implemented. Exported templates is the only example I am aware of. Like falling off the edge of the map.<p>3. Features that proved to be a bad idea, like incrementing a bool.<p>4. Features that proved to be wholly inadequate, like codecvt for dealing with Unicode.<p>5. Features that are reasonably new in C++ but obviated by new stuff. You don&#x27;t need std::bind if you have lambdas.<p>This is my outsider&#x27;s perspective; please chime in if you have standards committee insight.')
