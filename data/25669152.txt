Urdu is part of the Hindustani dialect continuum that stretches across the North of the Indian subcontinent. Speaking three of these languages is like speaking Spanish, Italian and Portugese. Standards are different, vocabulary will differ quite a lot. The intelligibility you speak of is in part the product of 70 years of tv, radio and education though. Smoothing out of dialectal differences. Hindi is the same in North India. Not surprising since Urdu and Hindi are pretty much the same language bar the writing system and scientific&#x2F;technical&#x2F;legal&#x2F;formal vocabulary.')
