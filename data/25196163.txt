It is 65 lines long, and mostly boilerplate. And what isn&#x27;t boilerplate isn&#x27;t even particularly complicated code (which is a good thing) - it just adds a few common sense safety checks to the Buffer class.<p>&gt; Why not?<p>Nothing&#x27;s wrong with that. But if the author doesn&#x27;t do it, I won&#x27;t call him an ungrateful asshole and berate him on twitter.')
