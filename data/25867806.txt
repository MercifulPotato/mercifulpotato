Item(by='zamalek', descendants=None, kids=[25870644], score=None, time=1611284402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25864908, text='<i>I live not far from Capitol Hill in Seattle, so the worst was pretty close to me.</i><p>I grok free speech. You can&#x27;t outlaw some speech that is considered immoral because that speech may equate to the future moral high ground. Gay rights, as one example, would never have happened were there a moral gatekeeper on speech. <i>I deeply understand this.</i><p>There&#x27;s a difference. Firstly, much of what you attribute (or what was attributed to BLM by right-wing propaganda) was in fact the anarchist faction and their leader in Seattle (in addition to the police). The anarchist faction (and Nazis at other times) always cause a shitshow during Seattle protests, irrespective of the specific protest. CHAZ&#x2F;CHOP was truly bizarre, but it was <i>inherently peaceful.</i> People were growing cabbages. This story rings true across America in varying ways and, while there is no doubt that some BLM protesters were violent:<p>* BLM never committed sedition by <i>invading the federal capitol.</i><p>* BLM was protesting against the very perpetrators of the violence and casualties that occurred during the protests: the police and right-wing extremists.<p>* BLM attempted protest peacefully for the expansion of rights. MAGA violently rioted for the limitation of rights.<p>The violence during the BLM protests is proof of the BLM claims.<p>&gt; the tolerance for violence is quite a bit lower when it concern an ideology one does not agree with.<p>The police <i>literally</i> stood aside for the MAGA seditionists, but opened fire on peaceful BLM protestors due to the threat of a pink umbrella. Yes, this is very true, but likely not in the way you mean to suggest.<p>And racist speech is protected and has been protected by the American Supreme Court on multiple occasions (National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie). Racist violence <i>is not protected</i> and nor is BLM violence.')
