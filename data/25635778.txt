Item(by='Apocryphon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609785090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635709, text='&gt; The company can make it more or less painful and the good ones do a good job, but there&#x27;s no way around it.<p>Sure there is. There are corporate cultures that are needlessly toxic and abusive. Stack ranking at Microsoft was not necessary to their success. Uber&#x27;s culture of harassment and unethical behavior was not necessary to their success. Amazon&#x27;s burnout culture is not necessary to their success. AAA gaming death marches are not necessary to their success- or maybe it is to that industry, but they could at least pay overtime. Perhaps there are other companies that are better candidates for unionization than Google. But to pretend that every successful company&#x27;s excesses and dark underbellies can be justified by &quot;hard things are hard&quot; is to excuse abuses and unprofessionalism that go unchecked. Because HR systems are insufficient, workers organize.')
