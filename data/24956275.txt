I had a couple of questions:<p>&gt;&quot;The second layer of polysilicon (poly 2) is arranged in diagonal regions to implement the selection transistors.&quot;<p>Since the diagonal polysilicon covers two different capacitors how is each one selected independently? Does each one have separate metal wire connected to it?<p>Is the sense line really a bunch of different sense lines? Does each bit have its own sense? Is the sense line part of the metal wiring then?')
