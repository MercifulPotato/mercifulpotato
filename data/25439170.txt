It&#x27;s harder to justify Scott&#x27;s $38B ($1.5B per year of marriage) when comparing her to other partners or mothers. I could see taking a partner&#x27;s past (or projected) earning potential and compensating that amount. Let&#x27;s say Scott gave up what reasonably could have been a $500k &#x2F; year job, that would be $12.5M + 25 years compound interest in the divorce. The value she gave up for the sake of the partnership has been restored and the value Bezos created has been preserved. If there&#x27;s a divorce between two partners who are also business partners, then 50&#x2F;50 makes a lot more sense.')
