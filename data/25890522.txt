I’ve known people doing research on the evolution of grammar, vocabulary, literary style, etc. who use only small subsets of the Project Gutenberg data. I&#x27;m sure they would appreciate being able to search the entire corpus.<p>The corpus-search functions those researchers use include wildcards, exact-phrase specification with quotation marks, proximity searches, and Boolean search strings. When you have a chance, you might want to add a list of the syntax formats that currently work. (I tried using * as a wildcard in a phrase surrounded by quotation marks, and it didn’t seem to work.)<p>One small improvement you could make would be to widen the “Search terms” field so that longer search strings are visible.')
