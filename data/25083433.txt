Desktop oriented Linux distributions tend to take care of everything from application installation to updates with a single interface with minimal interruption to my work flow.  This is only sometimes the case with macOS and Windows.  Android, iOS, and ChromeOS are not realistic contenders in the application space for some users.<p>Cost of ownership is another factor.  Linux may not make sense for some businesses if they have to hire someone to manage their systems, but an end user who can handle often trivial tasks can usually support their own system and benefit from less downtime.  While paying for software is a good thing, it frequently adds many constraints on what can be done while modern business models can make licenses prohibitively expensive (e.g. subscription models or various forms of forced obsolescence).<p>Other reasons include: sometimes the desired software just works better under Linux since it was designed for Linux, a desire for privacy or a need to ensure confidentiality, compatibility with older hardware that is no longer supported by the vendor (but may be supported by open source developers).<p>Working with what&#x27;s presented simply means that you are unlikely to modify what is shipped by the vendor.  You can still add to it or benefit in other areas.')
