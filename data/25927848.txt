By then I&#x27;ve usually lost motivation&#x2F;focus and may work an hour or 2 more. I really get mileage out of the &quot;work always fills the time allotted for it&quot; law.<p>Half of me can&#x27;t wait to get back to an office where I&#x27;m with others which provides motivation&#x2F;pressure to work, but the other half does not want to deal with the commute.')
