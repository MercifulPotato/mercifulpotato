It&#x27;s just the penalty is a &#x27;death of a thousand cuts&#x27; that may be less noticeable than a proverbial broadsword to the face of paying for some extra insulation and proper house wrap upfront.<p>Just improving airtightness and mandating blower door tests in building codes would probably go a long way towards more efficient homes. Once you&#x27;re more airtight you then of course have to ventilate right: HRV&#x2F;ERV for refreshing of the air and stand alone <i>de</i>humidification units.')
