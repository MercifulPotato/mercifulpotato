It&#x27;s a platform to discover and share things you love - tech, media, apparel, etc.<p>It&#x27;s an exploration into what product discovery might look like given that Amazon is plagued by fake reviews and we&#x27;re constantly being bombarded by targeted advertising from FB, Google, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve always relied on trusted sources (e.g. Wirecutter) and word of mouth recommendations when it comes to discovering great things. This is an attempt to replicate that process on a larger scale.<p>Anyway, I would love to get your early feedback on the idea! It&#x27;s very early days - the product database is definitely incomplete, and tons of features are missing. :)')
