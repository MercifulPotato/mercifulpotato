You tell people &#x27;what have you been smoking&#x27; then when you are proven wrong, you still try to come up with excuses. I never even knew the CEO until I came across the last hacker news article on Brave&#x27;s dodgy behavior. Stop making assumptions about people on the internet.<p>Why should I research for you a topic which does not negate the shady practices that Brave has been at fault for? If you want to donate money using Brave go for it, the evidence of what Brave has done, and done so consistently on many fronts is out there. If you want to look into it, go for it, I am not your personal researcher, a lot has already been done for you.')
