I think QMK is a bit like Excel in that everybody has that subset of functionality they use. I like layers and the leader key.<p>Open source firmware. I have a last gen Advantage I can&#x27;t use because there&#x27;s a bug in the firmware that causes modifier keys to stick and there&#x27;s nobody left at Kinesis that remembers how to work on it. That will never happen with QMK.<p>Hot swappable switches.<p>Edit: I do miss the curve though. I&#x27;m using SA Profile keycaps [0] and while they&#x27;re nice it&#x27;s not quite the same.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;EZgGBdg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;EZgGBdg</a>')
