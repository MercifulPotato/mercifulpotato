By 1943, they had already done close to half the total killings (the number 6 million we agree on).<p>Check out the numbers in 1942 (this is just from one death camp, in 1941 they were doing the mass shootings pre-gas chambers):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advances.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;advances&#x2F;5&#x2F;1&#x2F;eaau7292&#x2F;F3.large.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advances.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;advances&#x2F;5&#x2F;1&#x2F;eaau729...</a><p>By the time they were done, I guess they said ‘Yeah, this is the plan’.<p>Goebbels also has a history of instigating and letting things ‘play out’, Kristallnacht being the prime example. Even so, this wouldn’t be the guy up top that would deliver a clear plan on extermination. Similarly, they found no proof that even Hitler delivered clear plans on extermination (his end goal was exile initially). You pretty much have to find the shitbags in the sub leadership in Poland that took it to a new level (Himmler). So, yeah, I wouldn’t call it a Freudian slip if it happened in 1943, it was just shitbags latching on to a plan that was well into motion by then (not absolving anyone here on any level, Hitler&#x2F;Goebbels set fertile ground for things to escalate organically). If anything, the death camps were planned to be closed (and were closed by 1944 by Nazis themselves) and erased from history to cover up.<p>Anyway, back to the point. I think China said ‘we need to do something about Muslim extremist, and anti nationalists’, and how that gets carried out is up to a lot of imagination, whether it be re-education camps, Hong Kong crackdown, or Zoom bombing. This is a country that will also work very hard to cover up all this bullshit when it’s all said and done.<p>I’m aware that this sounds like over-fitting, but I can’t help it, the pattern just fits in my eyes.')
