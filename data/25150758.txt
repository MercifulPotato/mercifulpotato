Stuff that doesn&#x27;t get any traction quickly drops off, but at least it gets a look vs. places like reddit where new content requires support from the subset of folks that look at &#x2F;new.<p>The thing I really like about forums is that you can have long-standing threads that collect a conversation in one place vs. repeating the same conversation over and over on places like reddit.  Build threads in particular, where  you can see someone take a remodel or build from ideation to planning to execution&#x2F;correction to completion are extremely rewarding and educational.  Those don&#x27;t exist on reddit, people have to build that off-site and just link to it.')
