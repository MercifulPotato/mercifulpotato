Item(by='cycomanic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605646824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128960, text='I received mine about 3 weeks ago. It was the same for me as you describe, got an email with  &quot;we are about to ship your device you will receive notification from DHL&quot; or something similar. Then it took another 2 weeks or so, and I received a notification directly from DHL that my device will arrive in 4 or 5 days (I think it came even faster like 2-3 days). Anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t be worried, it seems after that initial notification you are only notified once the tablet it&#x27;s already on its way.')
