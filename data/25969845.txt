Item(by='robenkleene', descendants=None, kids=[25970232], score=None, time=1612020701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969177, text='&gt; &gt; lack of commercial software like Adobe CS &#x2F; MS Office<p>&gt; Usually inconsequential for developers<p>I agree that most developers view it this way, but I find this perspective hard to understand. Why would a developer, whose craft is software, go out of there way to not understand and use the software most people use? Including of course their own coworkers? I understand that a lot of developers are content, and able to function, in a bubble of their own creating, but I would find that incredibly limiting, both from a productivity perspective, and in an understanding software as whole (and by extension the world) perspective.<p>&gt; I fully understand why people want to use Apple for their consuming needs.<p>You do qualify this as being only about developers a bit later, but statements like this seem fundamentally out of touch with creative work on computers (i.e., illustrating my point from the previous paragraph). Logic, Final Cut, Media Composer, Pro Tools, Cinema 4D, the Adobe Creative Suite, Max&#x2F;MSP, Reaktor are just a small sampling of important creative software that run on Mac but not Linux. Saying it&#x27;s about &quot;consuming&quot; is patently ridiculous.')
