Item(by='Volundr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603990176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932290, text='I&#x27;d agree with all of this, with the caveat that at lot of what your saying is both called out in the article and in a lot of advice around writing a code of conduct (example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adainitiative.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adainitiative.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;howto-design-a-code-of-...</a>), so it&#x27;s not even clear to me that this is a problem with the majority of the CoC organizations&#x2F;enforcement.<p>Even here where part of the problem in the vague requirement (&quot;be kind&quot;), the biggest problem is they didn&#x27;t follow their own processes of having an actual dialog. It&#x27;s a bit like if you walked into a US court and the Judge immediately says &quot;I talked to the victim and your clearly guilty&quot;, it&#x27;s not the process that&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s that the process wasn&#x27;t followed. Maybe like the court system there should be an appeals process (not sure what that might look like).')
