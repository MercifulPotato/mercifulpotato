You can then pass this information to a hiring committee that has a <i>lot</i> of experience in evaluating candidates. Having sat in on some hiring committee meetings I can see how little weight is given the algorithm <i>if</i> the candidate has a good reference or highly relevant experience.<p>The issue with the interview alternatives that most people suggest is that they would require your most senior engineers to spend a really really large portion of their day on hiring which can burn people out quickly.')
