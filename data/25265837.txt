I don&#x27;t know how we expect to get the general public to push for science.<p>Much of our society runs on pure momentum and very few people have the power to slightly shift the direction of that momentum.<p>One of the other large radio astronomy observatories in Greenback is also hurting for funding from what I understand. I&#x27;ve worked on a few collaborative research efforts utilizing the data and working with the observatory and the picture painted doesn&#x27;t look promising there either. That may have changed more recently given the state of Arecibo.')
