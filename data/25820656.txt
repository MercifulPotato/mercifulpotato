They all say &quot;this is not a respirator, does not protect against airborne bacteria&quot; (this is paraphrased, since I have just seen my local products).<p>Even my local national health institute says that masks only protect against droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking when in close proximity. Which I can grant you, but normal people shouldn&#x27;t be coughing or sneezing into other peoples faces anyway. Which only leaves talking, but I don&#x27;t see why grocery store is a place to socialize anyway.<p>IMO masks are only a thing because helpless people had the need to &quot;do something&quot; and masks are visible way of showing you are doing your part. Plus it didn&#x27;t help that right wing nut jobs started a war against masks.')
