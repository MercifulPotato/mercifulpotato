I tried many of them (YouCompleteMe, Deoplete, Coc.nvim) but none of them really worked properly.<p>For the moment I mostly code in Python and I settled with a very minimal setup:<p>1. Linting: python-mode. IMHO it provides very good linting out of the box<p>2. Completion: jedi-vim. Jedi for python is great. Even though with this minimal setup the completion is not asynchronous I still think it&#x27;s great.<p>It took me some time and a recent pruning to actually arrive at this minimal setup. I totally feel it with the author that finding the right set of plugins in Vim can be a bit overwhelming.')
