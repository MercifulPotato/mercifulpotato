Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606381327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218032, text='The title is &quot;Windows laptops&quot;, so it isn&#x27;t making an argument for or against FreeBSD, Linux, Haiku or other laptop OSes.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;Windows laptops&quot;, more directly those on Intel, but those on ARM are mentioned too. Here&#x27;s the relevant text:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Windows laptops won’t be able to come close to this kind of battery life without either switching to ARM chips or doubling their physical battery capacity. And even if Windows laptops switch to ARM chips, Windows 10 just isn’t very good on ARM architecture.&quot;&quot;&quot; The last clause links to another article in the same site reviewing the Microsoft Surface Pro X, with a 3GHz SQ1 ARM-based CPU.<p>Now, it&#x27;s possible that Windows-on-AMD laptops are not screwed, as they aren&#x27;t mentioned. But that&#x27;s a rather minor objection compared to your, IMO, misdirected broadside.')
