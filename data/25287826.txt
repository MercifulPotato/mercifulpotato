This is a terrible fallacy (albeit very commmon, even Vaclav Smil fell into it in his &quot;Oil&quot; book). The world currently consumes more coal than it ever did. Wood consumption is also record high. We simply stacked up energy sources. Check this page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy</a><p>So far, fossil fuels still represent about 85% of our energy consumption, and about 99% for transportation.<p>We had a world 100% on renewable, back in the 18th century, but we were 600 millions and lived 35 years. OTOH we have no credible way to replace 85% of our energy by renewables in the next 10 years (if we want to keep climate change at reasonable levels).')
