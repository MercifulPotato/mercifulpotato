I can mentally translate between the two without thinking about it, as no doubt can you, but the clarity could be useful to others (including tired me after a long day!).<p>Yes it wastes a bit of processing time and memory, but if what you are doing is going to significantly benefit from that small saving is the shell the right place to be doing it anyway?')
