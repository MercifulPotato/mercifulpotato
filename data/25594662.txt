Through lies, constant harassing phone calls, and intimidation, they got him to &quot;invest&quot; his life&#x27;s savings. They even sent locksmith to change the locks on his house, and they called his new phone number the day after he changed to it. By the end he was so stressed out he couldn&#x27;t sleep and was having all kinds of physical issues. Died just a few days ago.<p>We can&#x27;t start catching&#x2F;blocking scammers and robocallers soon enough. The telcos can get us in touch with people from other continents, but they can&#x27;t spare the time to stop or trace the calls? Their &quot;solution&quot; for my grandma&#x27;s friend was to tell him not to have a phone for a few weeks. LOL.')
