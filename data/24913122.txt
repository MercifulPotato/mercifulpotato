Yet a cat and a human also are just complex machines. Maybe being a sufficiently complex machine is all that is needed to have sensations.<p>And if we could imagine for example that an ant or a fly actually experiences things, if it too has some sort of degree of what we as humans have when we see or hear things, maybe there actually already are machines that &quot;see&quot; and &quot;experience&quot; things.<p>The difference might just be that we as humans have the extra layer of meta observation that allows us to reason about our experience in the context of the world and turn us into an active participant in that experience while an ant or a neural network are mostly just passive observers even though they too make decisions and process information.')
