A lot of fish is eaten in Norway, sure but the Norwegian economy is such that local production has very little to do with what people choose to eat.<p>The only place in Norway Polar bears live is Svalbard, far North of the mainland. Most Norwegians have never visited because it&#x27;s far away (a 1h 40m flight North from Troms√∏ in Northern Norway - similar to how long it takes to fly South to Central Europe from Oslo) and way too cold and miserable.<p>Seal is something few people eat very often. A huge proportion of the population will never ever have tasted it. Like whale, it&#x27;s uncommon these days.')
