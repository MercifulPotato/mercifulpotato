Thus your argument is inherently flawed.<p>Further the belief in a singular deity is hardly the only religious practice.  Religion isn’t some unified framework that needs to be apposed based on hard evidence, it’s a patchwork of different beliefs with specific geographic origins.  Which is enough to say there is no supreme being that wishes to be worshiped therefore any religious view of God, god, or gods, with that desire must be false.')
