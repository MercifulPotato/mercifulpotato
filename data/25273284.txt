If someone wished me happy birthday I would be glad.<p>On the other side, however, I&#x27;ve already sent countless happy birthdays, merry christmases, and happy new years. Every time I do it I have this gut feeling of inauthenticity. I think to myself, &quot;do I really care about these people&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m just basically trying to figure out if this is my personal issue or if anyone else feel the same way. Thanks for the response!')
