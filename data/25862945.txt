Item(by='rosmax_1337', descendants=None, kids=[25863031], score=None, time=1611257000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862755, text='You shouldn&#x27;t compare a small and niche community like HN to a website like Twitter.<p>Twitter is the web equivalent of a public square, where everyone gets an opportunity at a speakers corner, HN is the web equivalent of a club house, or something private like that. There are laws governing public spaces all around the world, like town squares, where people are guaranteed rights to speak. Laws like these need to be adapted to fit the internet as well, asap IMO.<p>As much as you might like to think that the Town square analogy is incorret, because the protocol HTTPS is the real Town square, and Twitter is really just another club house. (except very big) I also disagree with that, because of the nature of social media and platform monopoly. There will ever really only be one &quot;youtube&quot;, one &quot;facebook&quot; and one &quot;twitter&quot;, certainly nowadays when these social media platforms have grown to such an extent, covering the entire globe, let alone nations! This is because _the power of a social media platform lies in it being social_ i.e., the place where you find other people.<p>The platforms on top, stay on top.')
