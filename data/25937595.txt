In the 90s or 00&#x27;s, there was only 1-2 consensus views pushed by media.<p>Obviously its going to be a bumpy ride as the whole of society suddenly has to learn to cope with so many views, learn the critical thinking it takes to grapple with false information etc. but in the long run we will be much much better off for it. This is merely what society wide growth looks like - its not a straight line up. Pulling the plug on that is deeply, deeply wrong no matter how scary it seems.')
