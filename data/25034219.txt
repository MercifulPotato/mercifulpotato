A slave in antiquity or at any time prior to the general formal global abolition of the practice in the 19th century was literal property, with no more rights than a farm animal. Their owner could kill them, rape them, beat them or work them to death and so forth as they pleased, with no legal recourse for these human beings classed as property. Let&#x27;s not insult either problems of modern life or the horrors of real slavery by equating the two just to be fashionably negative about modern capitalism..')
