And then some malware hits and spreads like wildfire and the same people who were so adamant on disabling it are now complaining that Apple isn&#x27;t doing enough to protect them and woowee Macs are just as insecure as Windows.<p>Speaking of Windows, they also moved to a &quot;we know what&#x27;s best for you&quot; model with Windows 10.<p>Definitely a &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t&quot; situation.<p>I understand why &quot;power users&quot; feel frustrated but also understand the company&#x27;s POV. A story like &quot;Macs are invulnerable to this latest ransomware attack&quot; looks pretty good to investors; the random complaints of nerds and power users go mostly unnoticed.<p>I bet $100 this latest scandal will not affect Apple&#x27;s bottom line nor will anyone care within a month - there&#x27;ll be other reasons to be outraged over on Twitter.')
