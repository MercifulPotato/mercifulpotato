Even if one is not religious (I&#x27;m not), they might appreciate the cultural aspects of it.  Furthermore, the Call for Images[1] clearly says this in the postscript:<p><i>&quot;QEMU Advent Calendar is a secular calendar (not religious). The idea is to create a fun experience for the QEMU community which can be shared with everyone. You don’t need to celebrate Christmas or another religious festival to participate!&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qemu.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;qemu-advent-announce&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qemu.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;qemu-advent-announce&#x2F;</a>')
