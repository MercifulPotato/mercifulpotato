With ext4, as a side effect of the filesystem structure, all pending data and metadata for all file descriptors will be flushed instead. This creates a lot of I&#x2F;O traffic that is unneeded to satisfy any given fsync() or fdatasync() call<p>Does it mean that, under ext4, a call to fsync is essentially the same as a call to sync(2)?')
