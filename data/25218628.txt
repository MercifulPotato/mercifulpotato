It&#x27;s way inferior to existing solutions provided by AWS and Azure. Most of its current growth seems to be largely fueled by independent developers testing out something on a cool looking interface, rather than actual enterprise or mid-stage startup type customers. Even more so, extremely shit support for migration to GCP compared to Azure or AWS. Considering Google&#x27;s penchant for killing services, I don&#x27;t think it will last beyond 5 years.')
