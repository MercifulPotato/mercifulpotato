I read all those texts explaining why password managers are better, yet I am still afraid. I keep thinking in attack vectors such as someone compromising the Play Store and submitting a malicious app or other similar stuff.<p>I even have a Bitwarden account and have some passwords stored on it.<p>I also considered &quot;offline&quot; managers like KeepassXC, but synchronization gets way worse, and there&#x27;s also the issue about trusting someone else with your mobile apps.<p>I will probably end up convincing myself and keep using Bitwarden more at some point, but I will also probably do some kind of password peppering&#x2F;salting along with it.<p>Am I really the only one here?')
