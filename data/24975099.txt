For me, &quot;degoogling&quot; was (and still is) a long process. I literally went service by service, testing a new solution online for a while, and when satisfied, I switched. Obviously, I can&#x27;t reproduce the way everything was integrated to work together, but my other options are still comparable and functional. I feel I&#x27;ve taken back control of my data and how I manage it.<p>Another aspect is that I have much less trust in any online services - free or not, open source or not. I&#x27;m more sensitive of where my data is hosted (politics and privacy), who owns the service, and their reputation. I now have a plan B for those solutions I&#x27;ve switched to, just in case.<p>For things like backups, passwords, file storage, calendar, I use different systems on a Raspberry Pi that I can access online. When picking an online service, I made an effort to read the EUA and the privacy policy to find out how my data would be used and if&#x2F;how I would be tracked. In the end, it&#x27;s very possible to move away from Google and it&#x27;s working for me, but this will always be an ongoing issue, since companies, like people, will &quot;adjust&quot; their ethics to fit their needs.')
