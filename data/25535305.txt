But let&#x27;s not be quick to call them stingy if they don&#x27;t.<p>Take a $200,000 Bay Area salary, and the taxes paid on it. All numbers crude, my point remains w&#x2F;o exact amounts:<p><pre><code>    8% social security&#x2F;medicare\n    9% state income tax\n   25% federal income tax\n   ---\n   42% that&#x27;s just in direct taxes\n</code></pre>\nand further:<p><pre><code>   8% sales tax\n   direct property tax if own house\n   indirect property tax if renting\n   gas tax\n   income tax on stock options\n</code></pre>\nThe list is almost endless.<p>A better question is: where the fuck does all the money already being paid go to?')
