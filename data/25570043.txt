What are the downsides of them? When these particles finally migrate into the troposphere they quickly fall to Earth at relatively low velocity due to the very high drag.<p>I&#x27;m all against polluting the earth, but non-reactive aluminum particles in the quantities that we are talking about are such a non-issue in comparison to anything else.')
