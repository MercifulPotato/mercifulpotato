(And in many of places asking locals meets with either utter bemusement or a commission-paying introduction to a standard tourist activity)<p>AirBNB aren&#x27;t the first people to try this, but they&#x27;re pretty well placed brand-wise to sell the &#x27;real local experience curated by ordinary local people&#x27; image. And yes, in practice it&#x27;ll leverage that to sell standard tourist activities and some customers will be delighted, just like they use AirBNB to find ideally situated self-catering holiday apartments run as businesses rather than airbeds in suburban spare rooms')
