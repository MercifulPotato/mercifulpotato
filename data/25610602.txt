Both Hindu and Buddhist scriptures venerate the 5 parts of a cow for religious purposes. That aside traditional cultures the world over - China, Indian, Africa (Nigeria) use the urine (and feces) of various animals as primordial pharmaceutical factories since they lacked the machinery of modern chemistry and drug synthesis. Materia Medica, catalog of plants and animal matter, of ancient medical systems like Ayurveda and TCM contained detailed qualities of the therapeutic properties of the urine of various animals.<p>Even modern medicine has derived drugs like Urokinase from <i>human</i> urine (disgusting) and Premarin from pregnant mare&#x27;s urine. Urokinase is now made from renal cells cultured in bioreactors but Premarin is still made from mare&#x27;s urine. Peta is not a fan [2].
