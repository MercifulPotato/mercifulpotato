As a person in a loving relationship, I&#x27;m not sure why you use an analogy that suggests love is unattainable or should be.<p>What I understand is that love is an emotional experience that feels great, and some people will never experience it naturally, just like some people have physical or mental conditions and can&#x27;t experience health naturally (speaking from experience). I would rather have surgery and be able to experience a normal life if I couldn&#x27;t do so naturally, and if I was unable to find love naturally, I would also rather have an AI that can effect the same experience in me.')
