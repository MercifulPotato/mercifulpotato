It’s not about size and color in itself, it’s just that, generally speaking, size tends to be less specific than color in subgrouping a noun.\nThis is also how we learn though trust: if I find the sentence and I trust who wrote that, I assume and therefore learn that Great Dragons are probably a breed of dragons.')
