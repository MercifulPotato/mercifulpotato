They care about:<p>- Is the first party experience uncompromised? (I.e. you must escape their protections explicitly to bypass them without scrutiny)<p>- Are you commercializing your unauthorized usage? (I.e. hackintosh okay, hackintosh for sale not okay)<p>They have a few other, less predictable, principles when it comes to lower profile software like WebKit, but if you account for those you’re very unlikely to cross their legal team. macOS is free (dollars), and not because they expect to make up the dollars of investment in hardware sales, but because they correctly realized selling an OS isn’t a profit generator anymore. Even Microsoft has realized that.<p>As long as no one is making money on this I seriously solve Apple will care one way or another.')
