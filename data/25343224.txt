The CEO was always grumbling about the pace of development, citing the example of programmers who added Gantt charts to it in two days, and why was I so much slower at “simpler” features.<p>Fast forward a couple of months, and we had a customer complain about the Gantt charts being off. I had a closer look at the thing, and it turned out that the bars on the chart had been drawn using the Math.random() function. They came out different each time you refreshed the page and were in no way related to the real thing.')
