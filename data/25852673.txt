Who wouldn’t want to increase the amount of things they could enjoy by 2x or 3x or <i>9x</i>? I watched Battlefield Earth recently and it was a blast! One of my favorite shows is How I Met Your Mother (which is &quot;crap&quot; if you define &quot;crap&quot; as &quot;less than the 90th percentile in that medium&quot;...it&#x27;s prolly a 70 or 80th percentile show).<p>Why be an elite who turns their nose up at things when you can enjoy both the things the elites like AND the things they sneer at? Sign me up for the trash!')
