There was a reddit post some years back that I saved as a text file along with the original poster&#x27;s name, I think it might be a good analogue to this post.<p><i>As originally posted by a1988eli on Reddit, as a reply to a question about the lives of wealthy people:</i><p>I can answer this one. For some reason, I attract these people into my life. I don&#x27;t do anything super extraordinary. I am not famous. But I count many peoplewith ultra high net wealth among my close friends and I have spent more time than even I can believe with 8 different billionaires. This is not just meet-and-greet time. This is small group and even one-to-one time. I dated the daughter of one billionaire several decades ago. So I have gotten a peek into this life.<p>Let&#x27;s get one thing out of the way. There are gradations of rich. I see four major breaking points:<p>Worth $10mm-$30mm liquid (exclusive of value of primary residence). At this level, your needs are met. You can live very comfortably at a 4-star&#x2F;5-star level. You can book a $2000 suite for a special occassion. You can fly first class internationally (sometimes). You have a very nice house, you can afford any healthcare you need, no emergency financial situation can destroy your life. But you are not &quot;rich&quot; in the way that money doesn&#x27;t matter. You still have to be prudent and careful with most decisions unless you are on the upper end of this scale, where you truly are becoming insulated from personal financial stress. (Business stress exists at all levels). The banking world still doesn&#x27;t classify you as &#x27;ultra high net worth&#x27;<p>Net worth of $30mm-$100mm<p>At this point, you start playing with the big boys. You can fly private (though you normally charter a flight or own a jet fractionally through Net Jets or the like), You stay at 5 star hotels, you have multiple residences, you vacation in prime time (you rent a ski-in, ski-out villa in Aspen for Christmas week or go to Monaco for the grand Prix, or Canne for the Film Festival--for what its worth, rent on these places can run $5k-20k+ per NIGHT.), you run or have a ontrolling interest in a big company, you socialize with Conressmen, Senators and community leaders, and you are an extremely well respected member in any community outside the world&#x27;s great cities. (In Beverly Hills, you are a minor player at $80 million. Unless you really throw your weight around and pay out the nose, you might not get a table at the city&#x27;s hottest restaurant). You can buy any car you want. You have personal assistants and are starting to have &#x27;people&#x27; that others have to talk to to get to you. You can travel ANYWHERE in any style. You can buy pretty much anything that normal people think of as &#x27;rich people stuff&#x27;<p>$100mm-$1billion<p>I know its a wide range, but life doesn&#x27;t change much when you go from being worth $200mm-$900mm. At this point, you have a private jet, multiple residences with staff, elite cars at each residence, ownership or significant control over a business&#x2F;entity that most of the public has heard of, if its your thing, you can socialize with movie stars&#x2F;politicians&#x2F;rock stars&#x2F;corporate elite&#x2F;aristocracy. You might not get invite to every party, but you can go pretty much everywhere you want. You definitely have &#x27;people&#x27; and staff. The world is full of &#x27;yes men&#x27;. Your ability to buy things becomes an art. One of your vacation home may be a 5 bedroom villa on acreage in Cabo, but that&#x27;s not impressive. You own a private island? Starting to be cool, but it depends on the island. You just had dinner with Senator X and Governor Y at your home? Cool. But your billionaire friend just had dinner with the President. You have a new Ferrari? Your friend thinks their handling sucks and has a classic, only-five-exist-in-the-world-type of car. Did I mention women? Because at this level, they are all over the place. Every event, most parties. The polo club. Ultra-hot, world class, smart women. Power and money are an aphrodisiac and you have it in spades. Anything thing you want from women at this point you will find a willing and beautiful partner. You might not emotionally connect, but damn, she&#x27;s hot. One thing that gets rare at this level? friends and family that love you for who you are. They exist, but it is pretty damn hard to know which ones they are.')
