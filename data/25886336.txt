To get an accurate prediction, you need to input all of the relevant parts of the system. For example, when solving the Schrodinger equation for a hydrogen atom, people input the properties of the electron and proton. If you want to compute the properties of a benzene molecule, you input information about all of the 6 nuclei and 42 electrons. If you want to compute the wave function of a mole of benzene, you would have to input the properties of all ~10^23 atoms composing it. This has no physical meaning per se - this is just the nature of the formalism.<p>Depending on the exact system, you may or may not have separate components of the wave function which correspond to the different components of the system which you are modelling - such as a component indicating the position of the electron and a component for the position of the nucleus&#x2F;proton for the Hydrogen atom.<p>Also, if you were to model an electron launched towards a benzene molecule, the wave function of the system would show different values for the 1 electron that was launched vs the 42 electrons which were part of the original system.<p>The 42 electrons are not distinguishable simply because we don&#x27;t normally choose to input any way of differentiating them, because we don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful. You could in principle describe the system such that you get a particular prediction for each of the 42 different electrons - though we don&#x27;t know any property that electrons have that we could use to actually measure and confirm.<p>&gt; In that wave function it means there&#x27;s no longer 42 actual electrons that even exist.<p>The 42 electrons absolutely exist as part of the wave function - otherwise, the charge of the system would be wrong. The wave function in fact predicts positions and velocities and spins for 42 electrons, and you could in principle do a measurement where you would identify the positions for all 42 of them, with probabilities that you can compare to the wave function predictions.')
