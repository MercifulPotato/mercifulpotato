I recently built TileFlip, which is a playground where you code a rule that applies to every tile and try to make a visualization (inspired by tixy.land!). I’d love to get feedback from the community. If you’re interested in how I built this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vbhaip&#x2F;TileFlip" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vbhaip&#x2F;TileFlip</a>. If you create anything cool, please share it in the comments, because I’d love to check it out!')
