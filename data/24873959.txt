Anyone I’ve casually talked to about it is dismissive and doesn’t really understand what it&#x27;s even trying to be. If anybody has heard anything from a user&#x27;s perspective that is in favor of this, I would love to hear that argument. Otherwise I can only assume that this was a typical Google move where product people internally pushed for a rebrand to advance their own careers, at the expense of the user experience.')
