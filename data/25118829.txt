We launched recently (and got paid customers on day 1, no mailing list, no large # of followers, no marketing spend) in a relatively established market niche and didn&#x27;t run into the problems of finding customers, because customers were already looking for that solution and liked what they saw. We also needed to build out the whole product before the first revenue dollar.<p>I think strategies differ depending on:<p>- How new the market is for that particular product<p>- How big of a risk is it to adopt your product vs alternatives<p>- How polished it looks (inverse relationship to how many solutions already exist)<p>In some cases, you may need a much more polished MVP to get people to bring out their credit cards. If your product is the only one of its kind (and is in high demand), the UI is less important in v1.')
