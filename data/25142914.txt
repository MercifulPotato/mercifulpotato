I think any regulation pushed onto Apple to open up the App Store will actually affect the home console market, too.<p>I&#x27;m just struggling to figure out why the PERCEPTION is very different between iOS and the home console market. It feels like many iPhone users do not believe their smartphone can be substituted with one from another manufacturer. Those same users also complain that they&#x27;re locked into the App Store. (I think there&#x27;s a few people in the comments here that have done exactly that.)<p>At the same time, the majority of mobile app revenue is coming from iOS, which is pushing app developers to the platform, even though they dislike the terms of the App Store.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is here, but an ecosystem with a large number of members who are unhappy with the status quo doesn&#x27;t seem very sustainable.')
