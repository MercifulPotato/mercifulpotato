Digital Ocean seems reasonable in the sense that they don&#x27;t access individual droplets based on their own FAQ ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalocean.com&#x2F;trust&#x2F;faq&#x2F; ) with exception of legal requirements.<p>I get it is a little like trying to control the weather ( I mean she could do w&#x2F;e she wants with the pics after she accesses them anyway ), but I am hoping honor system prevails.<p>I am not sure how common use case that is, but since those are my kid&#x27;s pics, I don&#x27;t want them floating around willy-nilly. If you have a better solution, let me know what you think. I will admit that I am not too keen on trying to run my own server from home ( my ISP made it a little difficult ).')
