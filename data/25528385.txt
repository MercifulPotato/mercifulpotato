Every time you sleep is when the skill learned during the day is actually &quot;saved&quot; and increased.<p>Trying to do everything perfect at once from the start is impossible. Only once something gets into your muscle memory you can focus on other things. At first you might not be able to find the correct key and have to constantly look at the keyboard, but once you are over that you can now focus on coordination, rhythm or other stuff.<p>Learning and getting better is just the process of constantly embedding something in your muscle memory so you can consciously focus on something else.')
