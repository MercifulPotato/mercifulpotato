Item(by='roveo', descendants=None, kids=[24993409], score=None, time=1604521303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992614, text='I tried Dynalist and moved back to Workflowy literally a couple of days ago. The main problem for me was that you can&#x27;t link-share an arbitrary bullet and it&#x27;s children â€” only the whole document. So if I need to share a link, I have to create a new document just for this purpose. The one-document model of Workflowy just seems more logical and simple. Although the free version of Dynalist is more complete&#x2F;usable, so if you don&#x27;t really care about sharing, it&#x27;s better (for example, no limitation for created nodes per day).<p>And obviously they are both missing vim bindings, which I would LOVE to see.')
