Although that does beg the question of why they are not, but that&#x27;s not really the point IMO.<p>But the Qantas Flight 32 <i>is the point</i>, this is exactly what this story is about. Confidence in an aircraft. Qantas Flight 32 was an Airbus A-380, which is exactly what you would expect to hear anytime you heard about serious accidents or plane crash; the name &quot;Airbus&quot;. Boeing used to be the safe over engineered plane, while Airbus was a French&#x2F;German&#x2F;Spanish hybrid where the jokes about French cars, carried over to the planes, which led to joke slogans like this:<p>&quot;Take a chance with Air France&quot;<p>Boeing was synonymous with safety; but now they seem insistent on destroying their own legacy with that MAX&#x2F;8 plane.')
