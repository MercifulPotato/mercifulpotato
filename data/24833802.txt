My thought process was that a single dot would come across as serious or passive-aggressive (there&#x27;s a discussion about this phenomenon somewhere in this thread) and ellipses would similarly be rude. Two dots somehow seemed like a nice way to come across as more friendly, and&#x2F;or indicate a tiny pause between sentences.<p>I used to do this in the times when we were separately charged for every text with our cellular service. I&#x27;d try to fit as many sentences as possible to each sent message. With the rise of internet based texting, it became unnecessary to use sentence separators, because I could just separate them by sending multiple messages (and not use any punctuation at the end of each sentence, which is the current accepted &quot;friendly&quot; way of communication).')
