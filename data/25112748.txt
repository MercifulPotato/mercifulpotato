The charge to the United States, which has already committed about $2.5 billion to help develop Modernaâ€™s vaccine and buy doses, comes out to about $24.80 a shot<p>Yes, they&#x27;re expecting to profit to some degree, but those charges don&#x27;t look to be particularly out of line for a newer vaccine from a quick skim of price data.<p>------------<p>I can&#x27;t see how any developed country would choose to pass on it at that cost if available to them while others are still under development&#x2F;not available in sufficient supply.<p>The economic damage this is causing is massive and anything that gets you past this even slightly faster is more than worth that price.<p>You could vaccinate the whole UK population for $2.3bn (in medication costs). The pandemic is causing vastly more economic damage than that to the UK.<p>Through only August, COVID has cost just the UK <i>government</i> (to say nothing of other economic damage) over $277bn (@current exchange rates). The vaccine could cost half, it could cost 5x as much, but it would still be absurd to do anything other than pay it and get it out to as much of your population as you can if it&#x27;s available to distribute and other vaccines aren&#x27;t.<p>Even if you&#x27;ve got something else in the works, if buying what you can of this gets you &quot;reopened&#x2F;normal&quot; a month or two earlier than not, it&#x27;s still an obvious economic win for any developed country.<p>-----------------<p>Source:<p>Vaccine pricing - Table 6 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.euro.who.int&#x2F;__data&#x2F;assets&#x2F;pdf_file&#x2F;0009&#x2F;284832&#x2F;Review-vaccine-price-data.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.euro.who.int&#x2F;__data&#x2F;assets&#x2F;pdf_file&#x2F;0009&#x2F;284832&#x2F;...</a><p>Moderna pricing - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;health&#x2F;Covid-moderna-vaccine.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;health&#x2F;Covid-moderna-vacc...</a><p>Economic cost - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business-52663523" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;business-52663523</a>')
