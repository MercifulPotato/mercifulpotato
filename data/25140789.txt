Meaning the market can exacerbate faulty decision heuristics. Behavioral economics is full of examples of this that classical economics simply labels as &quot;anomalies&quot;. I tend to think the socialization aspect is an admonition that markets don&#x27;t always work best when humans are at their most emotional&#x2F;least rational.<p>Most people excluding the most ardent anarcho-capitalists recognize there are times when a completely free market doesn&#x27;t serve the best interest of society (e.g., healthcare, monopolies). Sometimes I think people get it inverted and think society serves the market and not the other way around.')
