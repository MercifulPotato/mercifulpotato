Doesn&#x27;t this defeat the purpose of a tip?<p>It&#x27;s a great question, and there&#x27;s no simple answer that will satisfy anyone.  Suffice it to say that I have my own interpretation.  Take it for what you will:<p>1.  DD (and other gig economy) apps, have redefined the concept of a tip to subsidize the low wages paid to gig workers.<p>2. When gig economy workers see the tip in advance of their gig, it acts as an incentive to complete the task.  For example, the higher the tip, the farther a DD driver will go, the more items they will deliver, and the better service they (should) provide.<p>3. In this particular case, the DD customer can still rate the driver after the delivery is complete.  If their rating drops below a certain level, or if they receive a contract violation three times in 100 orders, they will face deactivation from the platform.<p>4. Currently, Lyft and Uber both delay tips to drivers depending on different circumstances.  Tips could be delayed anywhere from minutes to hours to days, and this tends to de-incentivize drivers and could lead to diminished quality of service.  DD, on the other hand, has found a strategy that both incentivizes drivers and promotes increased customer and driver satisfaction.')
