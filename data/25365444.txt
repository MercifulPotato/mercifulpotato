They gained power as a faction in the democratic party around 1992 with the argument that after Reagan changed politics in the US and after losing the presidency for three elections, they argued that the democratic party needed to shift heavily to the right to chase what Americans were looking for.  Clinton got for instance got elected on a platform to &quot;end the welfare system a we know it&quot;, and gun control (which at the time was a right wing policy because scary minorities were open carrying.  Reagan actually passed the law against open carrying, the Mulford Act, stating at the time that there was &quot;no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons&quot;).  The explicit goal here was courting center right moderates.<p>Since then the Democratic Party has continued tracking to the right, with Newt Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s 1994&#x2F;94 HEART Act being slightly edited and passed as Obamacare.<p>This isn&#x27;t a &quot;terrifying perspective&quot;, but literally public statements and accepted political science.')
