They were priced for neither market.<p>I looked very seriously at Unix machines around the time NeXT came out, having been converted to that religion in college.  NeXT started at around US$6500, and that was with the optical disk only.  The equivalent-ish Sun box (Sun 3&#x2F;80) started at around US$15k with disk as I recall and went up in price really fast if you wanted more memory&#x2F;disk&#x2F;etc.  About the cost of a new Honda Accord at the time.  And the Sparcstations were out at much higher performance (and price...I seem to recall around US$22k for a usable config).<p>On the other hand, you could get a nicely decked out 386&#x2F;33 for maybe half the cost of the NeXT, or a 486 for a grand or  so more.  And it ran tons of software, even if it was garbage.  Even Unix.')
