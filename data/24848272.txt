Writing something you can be proud of requires first asking yourself, &quot;What original thoughts do I have to contribute to some subject?&quot; I&#x27;m satisfied I did that. At the very least, I tried.<p>But the process of writing from that starting point was <i>excruciating.</i> I had to stop. I was punching above my weight, and it was exhausting.<p>The experience left me with a new sense of respect for people who do a good job of it, and do so on a regular basis. Writing isn&#x27;t easy.<p>Or, perhaps as Hemingway said, &quot;Writing is easy. You just open up a vein and bleed.&quot;')
