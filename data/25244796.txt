You move on to another game.<p>There are of course some legitimate case for refund. Example I bought a package that has a Value, or Attack &#x2F; Def Number of 100. The gaming company decide it was too over power and changed it to 80 without compensation. Now of course as a buyer I feel cheated because I bought it with the value of it being 100. And in case of App Store you can immediately ask for refund.<p>Most developers are now aware of this problem so their solution was to inflate their next package to similar level to the Over Power Package, the problem with that is it devalue the current unit economics too much and player will refund and quit.<p>Basically &quot;In Game Economics&quot; ( especially mobile gaming ) is not a well understand problem. ( And they dont seems to care since most mobile games has a very short life span ) Apart from very big companies like EA which has Data Scientist running and monitoring, most gaming company just goes by the flow. It is a bit like giving Games designers the job of Central Bank and they just keeping print money. Sometimes the balance is right, sometimes it is wrong and they destroyed the whole game.')
