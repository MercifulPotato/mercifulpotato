Tooling is on point, you get everything you need, standard formatting (which helps to keep all code bases in the wild consistent), and cross compile.<p>One of the things that might make it even better are generics, but I haven&#x27;t really missed them so far. In conclusion, I don&#x27;t think I will switch to anything else soon.')
