My workstation isn&#x27;t a particularly pleasant experience and it&#x27;s _much_ beefier than this machine. My partner uses MS teams on a beater of a windows laptop with at most 4GB of ram and it performs substantially better.<p>I&#x27;ve made multiple support complaints to slack about their memory usage, there&#x27;s been times where it&#x27;s been using Gigabytes of memory on my workstation, and I&#x27;ve actually had to kill slack to compile on more than one occasion.')
