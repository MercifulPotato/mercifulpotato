I do not think the proper response to such a comment is to attack them for sharing their experiences and tell them to &quot;screw [themselves]&quot;.<p>If I were to take a minute to share my own feelings I&#x27;d say that the responses to that comment have proven its point. I am glad that they were able to openly share their experiences and I do not feel the need to censor them or attempt to censor them with personal attacks. I would say that the people making personal attacks are making it easier to empathize with the parent comment and are making themselves look rather foolish.<p>Try to take a moment to put yourselves in their shoes. Tell me that if you were blinded by the medical system you would continue to trust it.')
