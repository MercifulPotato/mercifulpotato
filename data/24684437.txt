Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601870355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684357, text='&gt; Anti-poaching agreements are non-competes, just between firms rather than a firm and their employees.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything about non-poaching agreements in a cursory look at Wikipedia&#x27;s article non Non-competes[1].<p>&gt; No, that&#x27;s not all they mean. The most trivial anti-poaching agreement might restrain itself that way, but anti-poaching agreements can and regularly have included agreements not to employ workers from the other firm, not merely to avoid certain active recruitment&#x2F;solicitation steps.<p>Yes, you&#x27;re right. Thanks for the clarification. I guess what I should have said is the specific anti-poaching agreement that bonestamp2 mentioned was only about active recruitment. But still even with this broader definition of anti-poaching, they&#x27;re not as bad as non-competes. A non-compete would prevent the founding of Intel (by former Fairchild Semiconductor employees), but a broad anti-poaching agreement would not prevent the founding of Intel.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-compete_clause" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-compete_clause</a>')
