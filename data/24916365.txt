I&#x27;ve submitted screenshots and details to Uber support, nothing has changed.<p>Now I send a text to each driver, watch the map like a hawk and call them if it looks like they&#x27;re going the wrong way. Works most of the time.<p>When it doesn&#x27;t, I get refunds, Uber can keep eating those costs until they fix their routing.<p>I&#x27;ve also started using their competitors more often, and bypassing these apps entirely and ordering directly from restaurants that employ their own drivers.')
