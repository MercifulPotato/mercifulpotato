We can do this today, albeit a little slow.</i><p>An argument can be made for this being a better use of spectrum.<p>For a 500M file:<p>* if you download it at 10M&#x2F;s, it will take 50s to receive, where you are using radio spectrum;<p>* if you download it at 50M&#x2F;s, it will take 10s to receive.<p>By downloading it faster you can stop using radio spectrum sooner, which allows other people to use it. And other people&#x27;s greater download speeds allows your phone to send&#x2F;receive traffic sooner as well.<p>Operating a radio also uses up a lot of battery, so the sooner your device can reduce power, the longer your battery will last.')
