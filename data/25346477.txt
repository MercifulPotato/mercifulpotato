Sennheiser had $916mm in 2019 revenues. But consider that Apple is estimated to have close to $18b in total AirPods revenues in 2020. And my point isn&#x27;t that they &quot;must know nothing about audio,&quot; it is that they do not have some kind of monopoly on audio engineering. There is absolutely no reason why a company like Apple can&#x27;t hire the very best people and give them insane amounts of resources to produce a better product. Also, it&#x27;s important to remember that Sennheiser has dozens of products (I count 26 over-ear headphones alone on their website) and must spread R&amp;D resources much thinner. Apple focuses all their energy and spend into just a couple of key products.')
