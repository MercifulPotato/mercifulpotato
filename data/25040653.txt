Now people know the reviews are fake, and Amazon&#x27;s reputation WRT finding good products and believing you&#x27;ll get an authentic product is edging towards the gutter.  I know I&#x27;m very careful of what I&#x27;m buying from whom on Amazon now.  Combined with them not always being the cheapest for a long time now, and there&#x27;s less and less reason for me to give them first consideration.')
