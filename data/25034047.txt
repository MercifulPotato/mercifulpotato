You buy the headset, you can&#x27;t use it until you register and sign in with FaceBook.<p>If you have an existing Oculus account, however, it is still valid for use until January 2023.<p>I&#x27;ve filed an FTC complaint, because we built an AR&#x2F;VR research lab and invested heavily in Oculus, and it&#x27;s not going to be usable in two years because our organizational policies prohibit registering Facebook accounts on behalf of the organization. If this had been a requirement prior to our buy-in to Oculus, we would have chosen a different platform.<p>Jailbreaks are in the works to bypass the Facebook requirement but aren&#x27;t yet public. This will likely lead to permanent account bans, since like with Wii, the ability to sideload largely is used to run apps customers did not purchase from their store.')
