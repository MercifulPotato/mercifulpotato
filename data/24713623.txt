Not sure how real, or valid, but something of an indictment.<p>&gt; - Tesla&#x27;s false promises on Autopilot and Full Self Driving is a disgrace. They are at-least 20 years away from anything resembling close to L4, but still somehow siphon $8k from buyers with a false promise<p>Yeah, at this point it&#x27;s almost Kickstarter-esque (for better, and worse).')
