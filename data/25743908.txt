This is this how the internet works now, and it applies to liberal bubbles too. Maybe it&#x27;s my rose-tinted glasses, but I don&#x27;t remember the internet being this bad before social media. You could chat on a forum (that was neither hard left not hard right) and play the devil&#x27;s advocate if you wished. People forget that the first person they should debate honestly is <i>themselves</i>. Online discussion was a great way to have conversations as the devil&#x27;s advocate. It was a great way to explore a subject. As long as you argued in good faith, used logic and conceded points when they were fairly won, you could have a long (and possibly fruitless) discussion without getting blocked, banned, threatened or called a Nazi.<p>Nowadays, liberal isn&#x27;t &quot;how you act&quot; or &quot;what your values are&quot;, is an identity. People identify as liberal: kind, right and &quot;definitely not nazis&quot;. If you disagree with them, then you <i>must</i> be evil, right?<p>I&#x27;ve given up trying to explore contentious issues online. It&#x27;s impossible to take a different view on a hot topic without getting blocked and reported. You don&#x27;t even have to take a polar opposite view or get snarky. Sometimes you only have to ask a valid question (now known as a dog-whistle). It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;ve got science or logic to back it up.<p>Someone said it on HN yesterday - the old words are failing us. I no longer recognise this thing that they call &quot;liberal&quot; today.  I see it as &quot;woke&quot; - a cult, with dogma, heresies and grand inquisitors.')
