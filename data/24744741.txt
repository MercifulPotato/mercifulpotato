That software wasn&#x27;t available yet when I started so I just got the Cam Link.<p>Thanks for sharing the software setup! It&#x27;d be nice to not have to carry the Cam Link if I want to use this on the go, so I might try setting it up when I get some time. Right now the Cam Link is working very well; it&#x27;s totally plug-n-play and the quality is top notch.<p>Will try to remember to come back and share here if I do try the software setup.')
