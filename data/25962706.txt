Get yourself setup with decent office equipment when able (second hand office furniture stores can be REAL cheap).  A reasonably fast, very reliable internet connection is a must.<p>As for pluses - it gets easier to find remote jobs all the time, salaries&#x2F;rates are real good. Can&#x27;t beat the commute :-)')
