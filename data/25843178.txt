He&#x27;s actually a great guy and a hell of an entrepreneur. Without trying to take any credit for his release my team was involved in the process of raising awareness of his incarceration for the last year and got deeply involved in bringing his cannabis brand to the California market. We&#x27;ve been early-celebrating all week about his pending release.<p>I&#x27;ll also add that his crime was trafficking 37 tons. He wasn&#x27;t the seller or buyer.')
