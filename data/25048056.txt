But...<p>&gt; Also from a theoritical point of view: it&#x27;s a completely different communication channel, so if someone has somehow taken over the first channel (via some malware running on the email client&#x2F;computer), then they still need to take over second channel.<p>...is a very good point. Although, (without any data to back up this claim), I would think most users with a compromised device have a fully compromised device.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; Hoping for security by obscurity (i.e. the 2nd email is now a &quot;secret&quot;) isn&#x27;t great.<p>To clarify, that&#x27;s not exactly the point. If the attacker discovers the value for the phone number or 2nd email (through a data breach), then it becomes targeted, which brings us back to the security of SMS vs email (the parent article).')
