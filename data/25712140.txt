As the platform owner, and absent additional guidance from courts or Congress, private companies have no choice but to make decisions about what can be done with their private property. No company that is not a &quot;common carrier&quot; is obligated to let their infrastructure be used for a specific purpose. If you don&#x27;t like the choices they make, the root cause isn&#x27;t with the companies, it&#x27;s with the laws themselves.<p>There is a sort of slider here between speech &amp; property. If you dislike companies controlling their platforms as they see fit &amp; want the slider to move in favor of free speech, it moves against freedoms of private property.')
