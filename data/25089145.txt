And if you care about a responsive desktop, the trackpad is mostly irrelevant because you&#x27;ll be using a tiling setup which relies on a keyboard and simple mouse&#x2F;trackpad usage.<p>&gt; build quality<p>A computer that throttles at max frequency does not have good build quality.\nA computer with a keyboard that falls apart with specks of dust does not have good build quality.<p>Macs have great screens and are slim, but they&#x27;re far from the only ones with those qualities.<p>&gt; stability<p>Except this is a meme. macOS stability is an absolute gamble like all other OSes, it will depend on your configuration macOS will behave or not, as is the case for both Windows and Linux. And macOS releases are known to be stability shitshows, Catalina being a big example and now Big Sur not being able to <i>start applications</i> because an Apple server is unresponsive.')
