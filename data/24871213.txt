Take it to the bank and take it to Helmut Norpoth aka the Primary Model (primarymodel.com). Hasnt been updated since March but the author (@primarymodel16) recently tweeted that the decision still stands: Trump is getting re-elected.<p>Also, the last person ANYONE should be listening to is 538&#x2F;Nate Silver. People need to remember that before he was in politics, he used to be in sports betting but because his &quot;models&quot; were so terrible, he got pushed out of the industry. Nothings changed and he is still as wrong as ever.<p>If HN wants some high quality punditry, look at People&#x27;s Pundit and their shows, Barnes Law (20 year election better wbo has never failed to make a profit in a cycle), and Cotto Gotfried. Stay away from the Nate Silvers and the Nate Cohns, terrible data and terrible forecasts.')
