First tax avoidance is at base a fixed cost.  It&#x27;s the price of a really tax lawyer (or at the extreme a couple of US Senators).  If that fixed price is less then your tax bill only idiot pays the tax bill.<p>The second reason is that I don&#x27;t believe people view money fractionally - I think they look at it absolutely.  For me am million dollars is a lot of money.  For Bill Gates though a million dollars is ... a lot of money.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that he&#x27;s a billionaire he&#x27;s still not going to throw around a million dollars the same way I&#x27;d throw around the same fraction of my wealth that a million is to him.  He still recognizes the absolute value of that money and he can still see it&#x27;s potential to make things happen in the world just as I can see what a hundred dollars (or whatever my fractional equivalent is) can do in the world.')
