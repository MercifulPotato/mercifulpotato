Anyway, what I want to say is this:<p>Growing up in the 90s, witnessing 9&#x2F;11 and the ensuing cultural “snap back,” I think both of you are right. I think what we really had going on before 9&#x2F;11 was that the country had a very cavalier, devil may care attitude. For some sections of society, that enabled a more carefree lifestyle; for others, we literally didn’t care if they destroyed each other. I think that devil may care attitude disappeared after 9&#x2F;11 and especially during the ensuing wars.<p>Where we’re at culturally now would probably require an entire essay to explain. I do think an argument could be made that something similar happened in the late 2000s and early 2010s, where one segment of society let its hair down and was able to exhale, while a totally different class of people were marginalized.<p>We’re at or near another cultural “snap back” now, I think. What that’ll look like, I have no idea.')
