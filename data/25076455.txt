And fail-open OSCP revocation check is also fine-ish, although it would annoy me if it&#x27;s making it slower to launch apps on the regular. The problem here is a bug, not one of design. But most of this thread is assuming Apple was doing something different than this. Of course, how often a company produces fairly catastrophic bugs is also on them).')
