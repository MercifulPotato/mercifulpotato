The answer is: it depends of a lot of factor: oxygen and temperature, as said in the article, but also:<p>- age of the wine (old one <i>usually</i> doesn&#x27;t remain good after one day)<p>- type of wine (red or white, varieties of grapes): tanic wines last longer.<p>- how good of a year it was (it mostly affect how well the wine will age, but also how long it can stay open)<p>Also oxygen have a big effect on wine, but it&#x27;s not always a bad one: most Bordeaux (especially young ones) are better after having been exposed to oxygen around one hour before drinking (in a decanter), and sometimes they even get better by the next day!')
