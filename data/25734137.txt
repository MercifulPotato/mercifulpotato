Payroll software is generally happy to split deposits, so this isn&#x27;t a real barrier to entry.<p>The real barrier is who wants to bother switching banks? It&#x27;s new UI to learn, new passwords, new apps, new cards, new exposure to security flaws, etc etc etc. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s any different in US vs EU.')
