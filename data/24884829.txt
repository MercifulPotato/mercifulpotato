Basically all apps on ios &#x2F; android (modulo some positive exceptions) are out to grab my attention all the time, and the OSs make it quite hard to really control that. \nI guess that would be more sustainable than trying to disconnect entirely.<p>Besides this, the link here is actually the OS, so this is actually OT.')
