Order total is $100.\n- A $10 coupon code reduces the order to $90.\n- The order is completed and shipped. Later on the customer wants to return and get a refund on one of the items. How much do you refund?<p>The answer is that you need to prorate (distribute) the $10 discount proportionally over the 5 items, so that when refunding, this order-wide discount is taken into account.<p>After extensive research (much of which I wrote up here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vendure-ecommerce&#x2F;vendure&#x2F;issues&#x2F;573" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vendure-ecommerce&#x2F;vendure&#x2F;issues&#x2F;573</a>), I was rather surprised to find that the majority of well-known OSS e-commerce frameworks don&#x27;t handle this properly.<p>On top of the things mentioned there are a whole host of other major topics of concern, e.g.<p>* stock control &amp; tracking<p>* fulfillment &amp; shipping integration<p>* payment integration<p>* promotions<p>* account management (email verification, password resets etc)<p>* product images &#x2F; asset management<p>* multiple sales channel, multi-currency, multi-language support<p>For those interested, my project is approaching v1.0 so I&#x27;ve just about got a handle on all of the above. Phew!')
