One bit in each byte gone to have the most common instructions take one byte instead of four. I can imagine that allowing much denser code overall.<p>Or it could be one bit out of every pair of bytes, to support 2-, 4-, and 6-byte instructions. I don&#x27;t know much about ARM Thumb-2, except that it does 2- or 4-byte instructions, so clearly someone thought this much was a good idea.<p>Instruction encodings are below my usual abstraction layer; I&#x27;m just speculating...')
