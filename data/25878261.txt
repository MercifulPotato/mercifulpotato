About one or two years ago I was fooling around with DNS queries out of boredom and I did a simple nslookup on a domain I knew would be NX (it was a .ss address), lo and behold it returned an IP and the responding DNS server was not what I use, tried another domain I knew would be non-existent... Same IP, browsed to it and I got a Spectrum &quot;search&quot; (it literally showed results for related sites I had been browsing) page.<p>The real problem with this is that I never use the ISP supplied DNS servers. I double checked everything to ensure something in the network chain didn&#x27;t default to the ISP DNS, turned out either Spectrum was either hijacking every DNS query but passing valid replies or running DPI and hijacking certain queries. I reported all this to EFF but never heard back. I switched to DNSCrypt to mitigate.')
