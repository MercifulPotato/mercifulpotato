In the past, I hardly gave it a second thought—it never occurred to me that I could kill or harm someone by being careless (e.g. riding the metro to&#x2F;from the climbing gym during flu season and indiscriminately spreading germs). Masks, giving people space, combining shopping trips, biking or driving, etc.—all are super easy ways to reduce potential harm to myself or others, so I’m more than happy to do these things as necessary going forward. There is no sense of fear or guilt, since I know I’ve done what I can reasonably do.<p>In that sense, I think comparing COVID-19 to the flu is helpful.')
