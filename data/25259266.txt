They&#x27;ve literally got products with HBM2 in it.<p>Note: LPDDR4x RAM is typically called &quot;Low Power&quot; RAM, in fact, that&#x27;s exactly what LPDDR4x is for. Its designed to be a low-power consumption ram for extended battery life.<p>It takes a special level of marketing (ie: misleading &#x2F; misdirection) to buy two chips of &quot;low power&quot; RAM, and try to sell it as &quot;high bandwidth RAM&quot;.')
