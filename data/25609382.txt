But this is rarely the case, even in new construction on a vacant lot.<p>Land isn&#x27;t uniform, lots have shapes, roads already exist, utilities have to be connected, local construction requirements vary, existing structures have to be accounted for.  You&#x27;re likely not going to save money by forcing everyone to use the same 5 designs because that will just shift inefficiencies elsewhere -- where they&#x27;re even more expensive.  Unnecessarily moving earth or buying more property to fit the 5 mandatory designs is going to be way more expensive than simply building the structure to fit existing limitations.')
