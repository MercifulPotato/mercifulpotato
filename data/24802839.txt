And repealing it would harm them.<p>&gt; The right to speech does not mean that you are also immune from libel laws.<p>Correct. And if we were discussing writing section 230, that would be valid. But we aren&#x27;t. We&#x27;re discussing changing established law. And if the reason to change the law is to restrict civil liberties that at protected by the first amendment, you encounter a constitutional problem.<p>Much as some laws are unconstitutional to enforce, I simply argue that some are unconstitutional to ignore.<p>If you want to imagine the negative impacts of such a change, a forum on baking could no longer remove content that was not related to baking without being liable for content posted by users.<p>As far as I know, the owner of a physical bulletin board isn&#x27;t responsible if I post a libelous poster on it.
