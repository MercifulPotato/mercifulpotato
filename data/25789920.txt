They simply refused to admit that an upsell was a advertisement and that disrupting my workflow on my paid, professional account for an ad was wrong.<p>The other interesting thing about that conversation, they could not understand how a sole proprietor would see no benefit from collaboration tools and kept making up bizarre scenarios where I could use them.<p>I actually asked them if they were a product manager or a salesperson at one point.<p>To Dropbox&#x27;s credit,  that product manager didn&#x27;t try to retain me,  they were genuinely trying to figure out why I had quit; they just couldn&#x27;t grok the reason.')
