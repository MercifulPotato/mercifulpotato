The story was poorly written. The combat is lack luster. The environment is expansive but hollow. What&#x27;s left?<p>Maybe you felt differently, but for me Act 1 was insultingly rushed. The fact that the terrible corny VR tutorial (in the future you can learn to fight in the blink of an eye sitting in a car, not missing a beat... well that&#x27;s great for V but for the player, you just ruined the pacing of the rising action. I missed the beat. The Brain Dances are similar) is followed by a montage of events that could have taught you game mechanics while actually letting you start to care about your partner instead of having it drilled into you over the next hour that the guy who just robbed you while you stole a car, getting you arrested in the process is your bestie ... truly awful<p>Act 2 is just as painfully rough. The dialog choices still don&#x27;t really matter, there are two choices in all those hours that change things meaningfully down the line (save a certain person and get close to a certain person) a lot of the writing is just cringe worthy (&quot;Ghost Off!&quot; and Keanu Reeves referring to his impressive c--- is not something anyone has ever asked for, and he doesn&#x27;t pull it off)<p>Act 3 is one of the first places where dialog decisions matter... except the game is already pretty much over. It&#x27;s like a choose your own ending instead of a choose your own adventure, and there&#x27;s clearly a canonical choice the game guides you towards, every other ending is half fleshed out, the same way every beginning but Nomad is barely implemented...<p>-<p>Now all that being said, to me if a game has such uninspiring combat and such a hollow environment, and lets down it&#x27;s promises of focusing on customization, and has such an awful bloated UI, and has such a bloated corpse of a skill tree...<p>It&#x27;s a bad game. Story or no story, it doesn&#x27;t save that.<p>I have books I read where I want a great story that&#x27;s not interactive and well written.<p>If the story is interactive, <i>the interaction should add something</i>. Having to slog through a poorly made game for a story in a game of this scale is pretty inexcusable...<p>There are some middling games as far as gameplay depth and smoothness goes that have get carried by their story, but it needs to be a truly exceptional story, and usually there&#x27;s a good reason why they couldn&#x27;t do more with the game play. Games like Hellblade where all their budget went into story telling and the team just wasn&#x27;t big enough to have some incredibly complex gameplay on top of the intricate storytelling and animation and deep lore... they&#x27;re able to justify it to some degree. But CP2077 was an almost decade long journey with the kind of resources the Hellblade team wouldn&#x27;t have in their sweetest dreams. And it&#x27;s all squandered on what was clearly a lack of direction and focus.')
