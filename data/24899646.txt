There&#x27;s kind of an over-sized &quot;Severless&quot; sort of thing going on, with &quot;event-oriented&quot; being a headliner or Dapr.<p>Imo though there&#x27;s kind of an uncaptured spirit, still. Dapr is trying to set forth a toolkit for building a in a more &quot;cloud-native&quot; fashion. Key to this is that state is now mediated&#x2F;held, when possible, by Dapr, rather than something applications reach out to data-sources for. Dapr is really there to present a uniform interface for your workload to run on, with it sending you events, you using Dapr to get what you need to compute&#x2F;process those events, and you emitting more events out. Where-as microservices just talk to having a small unit size, a sea of services, Dapr also builds a regular computing environment that provides the things those micro &amp; femto services might need too. The hope being that this is easier to operationalize, that the cloud operator can better manage &amp; provide these resources, than a classic microservice app.')
