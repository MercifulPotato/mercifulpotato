Item(by='std_badalloc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605266846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078685, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t DRM... Completely fucking pointless?<p>&gt; All it does is infringe on our rights to be able to do what we want on our own devices.<p>No, but this is exactly the point of DRM and the legal protections around circumventing it. It never was about copyright protection. Copyright infringement was already illegal before the DMCA, and the introduction of DRM didn&#x27;t make a dent in the amount of copyright infringement.<p>The point of making DRM circumvention illegal is for me to be able to sell you a bunch of bits, but ensure that I don&#x27;t have any commercial competition in regards to how you use those bits. You can&#x27;t legally make a device that plays DVDs without the blessing of a cartel known as DVD FLLC. You can&#x27;t legally make a device that plays music from iTunes without the blessing of Apple. Etc. It&#x27;s about retaining monopolistic control over media distribution and use, by forbidding certain forms of competition in the market.<p>Getting a law passed that forbids market competition (in many countries! not just the US) under the guise of being about copyright protection, is one of the greatest cons I&#x27;ve ever heard of, but that is what has happened.')
