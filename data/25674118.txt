I know how to read a room, but the point is that the mere fact of the double-standard is offputting.<p>&gt;Reddit is a collection of many little kingdoms. Some of them have kings that just don&#x27;t like you, for whatever reason. That&#x27;s their prerogative and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it, except maybe creating a rival subreddit that potentially becomes more popular.<p>Ultimately I don&#x27;t disagree, I&#x27;m just pointing out how this viewpoint-based moderation creates a bad experience for a lot of people that will lead to their turning to alternatives, and that the scale to which this is happening probably is not just Reddit &quot;working as intended.&quot; And it&#x27;s not like you can just casually jump from say a hobby subreddit that bans all Trump supporters on sight to a right-wing version of the subreddit that offers a remotely-similar experience. My point is a lot weaker than you&#x27;re acting like it is, which is telling. &quot;Moderators don&#x27;t act like this, but if they do it&#x27;s your fault, and if it&#x27;s not your fault then you need to accept that this is how Reddit works.&quot; Do I though?<p>Interestingly, Reddit has stepped in when moderators have tried to get too forceful with eliminationism - for example, there have been attempts to create shared user blacklists across subreddits but these have largely been quashed by admins.')
