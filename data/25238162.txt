The sealant forms an airtight-seal for the can, protecting your jams for literally years even at room temperature.<p>---------<p>For &quot;normies&quot; who don&#x27;t can, use the grey plastic &quot;Ball Leakproof Lid&quot;, which has numerous superior properties for non-canners. In particular: plastic does NOT rust, they&#x27;re more eminently reusable.<p>With that being said: cheap one-time-use bands + lids are good for dry goods and non-sealing purposes. If you simply put your cans in the refrigerator, they&#x27;re sufficient to be reused (as long as they don&#x27;t rust).')
