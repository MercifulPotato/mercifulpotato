It&#x27;s a city I&#x27;ve lived in for many years and I think I can honestly say it&#x27;s one of the great cities in the world.  Safe, clean, and gorgeous.  The language is really hard to learn, even if you know German, and almost impossible to sound like a local.  It&#x27;s also almost impossible to make friends except for expats here and there.  So you&#x27;re always an outsider in a town where they really don&#x27;t care for outsiders.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s lovely.<p>Someone else said it well: spend several months checking out any potential candidate location.  Talk to expats.  You&#x27;ll get a really good idea of what it&#x27;s like to live there.')
