You could be made to believe basically anything the same way Trump supporters believe a communist overtake of the US is imminent.<p>Furthermore the support these stories got from intelligence agencies point to very serious problems that do indeed influence democracy in a very bad way, far worse than Putin can imagine in his dreams. Of course it might put a smile on his face, that much is understood.<p>True that the zeitgeist has influence, but it is mainly driven by western companies, not by the Russian government. Aside from the language barrier you cannot name one talking point this alleged Russian propaganda contained.<p>You do understand the implication if you decry any opposition to EU integration as Russian interference? Because any political discourse stops right there with you.<p>No, there was honest dissatisfaction with the EU in Britain. That might be wrong or not, but the Russian thing just made people reinforce their views, because that actually makes sense now.<p>Russians, seriously...<p>Brazil is another story here, although I think the facts have to be checked.')
