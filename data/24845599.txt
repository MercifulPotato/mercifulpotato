She once got bit by a dog and called me to come and help. She was in too much shock to be able to explain where she was, and I&#x27;m absolutely terrible with directions so I was unable to locate her.<p>Thankfully, she managed to calm down and resolve the situation as it was only a small bite, but if the situation was worse and I would have been too late to find her. We thought that we can&#x27;t let this situation happen again, so we now share each other&#x27;s location just in case anything like that happens again.<p>It&#x27;s also great knowing how far away she is so I can start dinner and have it ready for when she steps in the door.')
