Some campaigns pay by impression served and some pay by conversion. It depends on what the advertiser is trying to accomplish. Pepsi might pay per impression because their goal is brand awareness. Local Pizza joint might pay per click b&#x2F;c they want to drive business off the web. AFKArena wants to pay by conversion because their ultimate goal is to get app installs.<p>Ads of all of these types generally compete for the same slot in an auction.<p>So yes, a user who has adblock is worth less than a user who doesn&#x27;t have adblock but also doesn&#x27;t click ads.')
