But in this regard, those armoured vehicles are only a small part of the problem.  Their dark uniforms should be replaced with light uniforms.  Replace black and dark blue uniforms with baby blue, white or &#x27;day-glo&#x27; neons.  Do the same to their guns (white plastic &#x27;furniture&#x27; where possible), cars, and armoured vehicles.  It doesn&#x27;t particularly bother me that they own armored vehicles (given the armed nature of the American public), but those vehicles should be repainted to look uncool to the sort of person who fetishizes military hardware and edgy &#x27;punisher&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;tacticool&#x27; aesthetics.<p>Basically, make the cops look less like the US Marines and more like UN peacekeepers (specifically their white vehicles.)')
