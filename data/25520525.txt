That query is a function that defines the call to Django. Eventually I&#x27;m passing parameters to the component to drive it&#x27;s behaviour.<p>I&#x27;d simply suggest you to go learn some react, it is difficult and it takes time, but it will allow you to see more solutions to problems that you might be handling in the &quot;industrial&quot; way (eg: writing 10 templates and having some jquery mixxed in the html)<p>I&#x27;ve been working with django and react for a while now, and i&#x27;m now used to 100% coverage without much hassle and very good productivity (dare I cite my boss :) )')
