I know that when I guessed &quot;hleb&quot; (like Russian) for bread in Split I was told that that was <i>a</i> word for it but would mark me as an inland Croatian speaker. I can&#x27;t remember the actual bread word they used, but Wiktionary leads me to believe it might have been &quot;kruh.&quot; Hopefully Cunningham can help me out here.')
