Then, the other 99% of the project is just waiting for the packages to rebuild and get sync&#x27;d on all of the mirrors that they could just will into existence with their minds.<p>Really, though, let&#x27;s be honest here: If they weren&#x27;t spending so much time writing up press releases and commenting on issues on GitHub, they probably could&#x27;ve already basically been done, the new package repositories could&#x27;ve been published and mirrored, and half of the CentOS 8 boxes out there could&#x27;ve already been migrated over.<p>&lt;sigh&gt;<p>--<p><i>EDIT:</i> To be clear, I am <i>not</i> serious. I thought the question I was replying to was completely f##king absurd but chose to respond with sarcasm (it seemed less likely to result in a warning from @dang than my initial reply).')
