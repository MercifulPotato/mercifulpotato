Item(by='zzo38computer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606803673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262009, text='I think it is necessary to work to start to actually make a new browser engine from the start, rather than being based on an existing one (except possibly some of the code from NetSurf). I wrote a list of how to make a better web browser (among other things, half of JavaScript DOM APIs are not implemented or are implemented differently, many core features (including some of the definitions of HTML and of the core protocols) are actually included extensions, and extensions would be commonly written in C for efficiency). Some things might not be compatible, but I don&#x27;t care. I want full control as a user, and I want it for assuming the user has read the documentation and knows how to do it, rather than being stupid and trying to protect the user from themself, better is to allowing you to &quot;have enough ropes to hang yourself and also a few more just in case&quot; like the UNIX philosophy is. (People who don&#x27;t like that can continue to use the browsers they have.)<p>I can post the list I have later once I have written a bit more.')
