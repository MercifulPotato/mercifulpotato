The &#x27;rote memorization&#x27; can be pushed as well but that&#x27;s not the goal here, the goal is to learn to read notes fast enough that you can actually play the music. (See attached video).<p>As for improvisation and playing songs by ear: improv requires some knowledge about how music is structured, I have some ideas on showing what the underlying structure is but these have not yet been implemented, we are for now concentrating on accuracy of the rendering of the score (which is still plenty of work) and fingering.<p>Playing by ear is mostly to have a good association between the keys and the sounds they make, this gets harder with chords. As with everything, practice makes perfect and doing this frequently seems to help me quite a bit by picking out songs by ear. So even if it isn&#x27;t a direct goal of any of the modes of operation of the software it does seem to be a side effect. We will add an &#x27;ear training&#x27; module at some point.')
