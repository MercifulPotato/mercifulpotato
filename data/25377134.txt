It gives them easy recognisability, after all trade shows are all about marketing. They give them away too (but not the same quality as the ones they wear).<p>That giddy thing is also a tradeshow thing, some companies really pump their employees that work at these things, but they&#x27;re not normally like that :)<p>Only if you know someone well enough you can get real info. The real communication at these tradeshows is not done in the booths but in back rooms and coffee corners. The front booths are just marketing with some low level PR staff.')
