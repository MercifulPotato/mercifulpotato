They keep track of things.</i><p>You can do the same to a pointer in languages that have them, either directly (e.g. in C) or through some &quot;unsafe&quot; construct (e.g. in Rust, C#, Go).<p>&gt;<i>I don&#x27;t see why anyone wouldn&#x27;t copy values by default... it is the only sane way to do things.</i><p>When resources are ample, yes. Not the case historically, or in many use cases today.<p>And not all values make sense to copy.<p>But also in Rust, we&#x27;re talking in the context of C performance needs, memory models, and concepts, and Rust expands and makes those safe.')
