Actual motivations can be enslaving other beings, ruling &#x2F; mining an extra planet or just wanting to watch the universe burn. Motivations are already present because there are millions of motivations that map on to the same result - destruction of another group of living things. I&#x27;m pointing out that it&#x27;s easy to find public justification as well.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to do this unilaterally. China or any other country could also unilaterally decide to destroy another planet. And same possibility on the other side.')
