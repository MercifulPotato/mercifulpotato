Also they are problematic and lead to a lot of hurt even when someone is recognizing the problem and working on it. Something that gets lost frequently in the dialog is the value, a seemingly critical value, that these people contribute to society even if it&#x27;s at a great cost. A lot of times, especially in our current world climate as conversations about this topic grow, we otherize people who suffer from these conditions. IMO, that is dangerous. It creates a stigma and decreases the likelihood for a person with these conditions to allow themselves to see it for what it is and let it fester into constant malignant destruction of themselves and anyone near them. I personally steer clear of people with NPD&#x2F;BPD. I was raised by someone with NPD and as such I can be kind of a magnet and ill equipped to set boundaries. My point is, people should educate themselves on the conditions and set boundaries and do their best not to enable, but those that can should encourage sufferers to acknowledge and integrate their disorder to reduce harm and utilize their unique minds in a way that takes other lives into account. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy does wonders. I realize it&#x27;s almost being a human sacrifice to help someone with NPD or BPD transition thought patterns. I don&#x27;t wish it on anyone... but someone&#x27;s gotta do the work, this part of humanity isn&#x27;t going to go away.')
