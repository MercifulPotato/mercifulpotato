Regardless of the rules, everyone has their own personal reasons for downvoting a post.  With a single bit, there&#x27;s no way to discover the hidden rules that people use to express their reaction to a post.<p>Labeling the downvote buttons (e.g. &quot;makes me feel sad|bad|mad&quot;) has been suggested in the past, but we all know that the expressed semantics of the buttons will be ignored by the community.<p>Suppose, however, that HN adds one additional unlabeled downvote button.<p>Faced with two unlabelled downvote buttons, would you click both? When would you click one but not the other?  Would one turn into the quality downvote while the other turned into the feelings downvote?')
