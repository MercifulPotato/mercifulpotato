Before Anki, I tended to collapse centuries of history into ‘the distant past,’ which made it hard to appreciate how events related to each other, or distinguish between events separated by years and events separated by decades or centuries. I discovered, by using Anki for an exam, that it’s relatively easy for me to remember 4-digit numbers, and relatively difficult for me to remember sequences of events. So, memorising the years of events has been a great way for me to learn more history. Arbitrary dates with no understanding of the context are harder to remember, so the cards that come up the most are the topics to read more about (or delete, if they really are useless factoids). It’s a bit like using the number line as a memory palace.')
