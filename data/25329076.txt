Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25330358], score=None, time=1607311922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25328767, text='&gt; you criticise that Trump is exercising his constitutionally granted right to sue when in his opinion he has been wronged<p>Having actually <i>read</i> some of those suits, I would say you could make a case that Giuliani should be disbarred. These suits are cases where the Trump campaign usually has no standing, the claims are often not even proper allegations, the remedies sought are <i>literally</i> unprecedented, and often even the timing is improper (basically, challenging election procedures after the election can only be done in exceptional circumstances). You may have a right to sue people, but you do not have a right to harass people through lawsuits, and the suits in question are closer to the latter.<p>(Side note: you don&#x27;t have a constitutionally-granted right to sue people. You do have one to sue the government, though.)')
