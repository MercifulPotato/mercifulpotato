No all.<p>You do understand that everyone gets social security as money if they need. The problems happen if they are unable to use that money to pay the rent. And yes indeed the main reason is some sort of intoxicant use, as they rather get more stuff than use the money for rent.<p>Legal debts are also not a reason not to pay rent, as one is protected from repaying them when it&#x27;s about essentials. So that doesn&#x27;t count either. As long as you&#x27;re able to push the pay button in your online bank you use the default system. Only when that&#x27;s not possible do you fall into the provided housing system. And not surprisingly drug use is a major reason for not pushing that pay button but rather taking the money and using it elsewhere. Does that honestly surprise you? What else could it even be?<p>That&#x27;s why we have the second option with food stamps and provided housing. It&#x27;s not perfect as people elsewhere have stated the obvious &quot;Hey want to buy 20e foodstamp for 10e?&quot;. But still they get it.')
