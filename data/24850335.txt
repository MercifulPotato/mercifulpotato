I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re looking forward to WebTransport+QUIC as well, I know I am. I&#x27;m already doing some little tweaks to our WebSocket RPC and bulk transfer layers to resemble WebTransport so it&#x27;s an easy drop-in when the QUIC transport becomes available, or when there&#x27;s a reasonable implementation of WebTransport+HTTP&#x2F;3 (the other middle ground).<p>Maybe I can publish the virtual “WebSocketTransport” thing once I&#x27;m satisfied with it.')
