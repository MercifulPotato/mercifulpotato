In the Bay Area, let&#x27;s say you are a junior at a FAANG and are getting $150k&#x2F;year. This works out to $8k&#x2F;mo after taxes. So the difference between a FAANG and Helsinki is more like 3x. Maybe, 4X if you account for bonuses&#x2F;options. But it&#x27;s not 10x.<p>Obviously, 3-4X is still a lot. If it&#x27;s a choice between Helsinki and SF, SF wins hands down.<p>Problem is that most of the engineers working in the US are not working for a FAANG company in the Bay Area. If you look at what engineers are getting paid in places like Houston or Atlanta, you will find that juniors start at $60k&#x2F;year, which is $4k&#x2F;mo after taxes. That&#x27;s very close to the reported $3k&#x2F;mo rate for Helsinki.<p>There is this weird trend I noticed on HN. Whenever the subject of money comes up, people start casually quoting Bay Area numbers like they are representative of the industry as a whole. I don&#x27;t think they are.')
