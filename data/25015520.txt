The premise of my question is more around the fact that with REST, which database queries you&#x27;ll run are fairly static and are known by the backend based on what APIs they expose. Therefore it&#x27;s easy (ish) to make sure said queries are indexed properly.<p>With GraphQL, I&#x27;m asking about how clients _could_ write arbitrary requests, that since the backend doesn&#x27;t know about them ahead of time, can&#x27;t optimize for with indexes.')
