I like American style pizza and I like cheese. I also like Italian style pizza and often find it has more interesting flavours, but that doesn&#x27;t make American style pizza bad or anything. Just different. A good American style pizza is better than a bad Italian style too, obviously.<p>My main point though was that the idea of cheese-less pizza really doesn&#x27;t seem strange to me, once you look outside of the American cheese-focused pizzas and that&#x27;s the only reason I brought up the differences really.')
