It is very high-cost, the private sector is not small at all, and it isn&#x27;t only used by the wealthy. Again, German doctors are kind of notorious.<p>The reason why people don&#x27;t mention NL is because it doesn&#x27;t fit anyone&#x27;s narrative. In the US, they have a mixed public&#x2F;private system with a large private sector so their solution is: someone else should pay for my healthcare. Mixed systems are less attractive because, to a large extent, that is what the US has already (the US is exceptional because of the administration&#x2F;ancillary costs in their system, not the structure). I agree though, NL is very good. The results are pretty average but it is very well optimised overall. I am from the UK, and healthcare is unbelivably bad because it is so ideological...that is definitely the wrong road.')
