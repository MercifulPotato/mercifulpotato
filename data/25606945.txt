Being an early retail employee in the Bay Area, we had very close ties to Cupertino. I worked when Steve was still alive.<p>* Retail management in my store ruled by fear. I heard from other stores across the US this was the same as well.\n* Promotions were handed out to those who kissed ass the hardest. Even if they were unqualified or cheated on promotion exams, if they brown nosed enough they got promoted. \n* The goal for every retail employee was to eventually make it to Cupertino and work for the corporate side of things. Either Genius support or logistics in Elk Grove. \n* Those who I knew who made it to Cupertino shared similar experience to the author’s post.<p>Apple comes off as a happy family friendly company, when in reality behind the scenes it’s a rule by fear culture.')
