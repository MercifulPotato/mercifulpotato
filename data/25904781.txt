It made me irrationally angry. One, that I have to deal with even more mental pollution in my daily life. And two, that the person who created this business model realized that pump-goers are quite literally a captive audience and that&#x27;s the best way to force someone to watch an ad.<p>I complained to the manager and I&#x27;ve never been back. Sadly, part of me knows it&#x27;s just a matter of time before other gas stations gets these new machines.')
