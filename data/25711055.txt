But are very good quality. About $300-$400.  I would stick to 4 wheel kind, 110 mm wheel size. The blades with the small wheels don&#x27;t go as fast. They are more for street or hockey playing. The 3 wheel rollerblades can have larger wheels but are less stable, and harder to learn on and to stop.<p>Best place to learn is on flat bike trails. You will get some pain in your feet the first time you go out. This is normal. It will totally go away.<p>If you use them a lot like I do, eventually your wheels will wear out. The harder rated wheels last longer. Better bearings will let you glide longer and its more enjoyable. \nOccasionally oiling the bearings and flipping the wheels will help them last.<p>Since the lockdowns, inline skates are hard to get locally and even online. Possibly more demand, and manufacturing issues.')
