I don&#x27;t like assigning myself future financial tasks, and I don&#x27;t like dealing with recurring payments[1].<p>As a result, I&#x27;ve stopped using a bunch of things that went sub-only. There are more I&#x27;ll be dropping.<p>And this has moved a lot of things I did on my phone elsewhere. This, combined with the fact that the Iphone X (I have no need to upgrade it) is a bit too big, and the Screentime thing tells me I use it an average of 17 minutes a day, which is going to mainly be 2FA and texting with family.<p>I mean, I kinda welcome this - I don&#x27;t like phone dependency. And I expect I&#x27;m not the median case. But Apple&#x27;s strategy has backfired with me.<p>[1] I realize this is not strictly rational, and I have paid more for one-time-purchase software that I used once than a sub would have been. It doesn&#x27;t matter.')
