Item(by='saghm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610253695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708887, text='&gt; The PhD speaker, who’s worked in pesticide research his entire career, explained that around here American Foul Brood wiped out &gt; 95% of hives in many areas over the span of a decade (70s or 80s?) — and he said there’s no reason to believe that the “wild” bees fared any differently. In fact, he believes we still have wild bees because of natural swarming behavior — meaning our wild bees are heavily linked with the commercially managed hives.<p>Not trying to discount this, as I know basically nothing about pesticides or bees, but doesn&#x27;t this seem a little circular? The conclusion that the bees in the wild are heavily linked with our bees is based on the assumption that they were fairly similar in the first place, i.e. &quot;there&#x27;s no reason to believe the wild bees faired any differently&quot;. In other words, &quot;the wild bees are doing about the same now because they did about the same before&quot;, but without any strong evidence that they did about the same in the first place. I assume I&#x27;m missing something?')
