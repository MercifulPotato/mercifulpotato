And they seem to really enjoy using it, almost like it has a kind of...<i>reverence</i> to it, for them.<p>But if you ever talk about <i>how</i> they use it (like, <i>the context</i> they are using it in, and various details related to that), everyone seems to start acting....weird.  Like, the passion and interest that was just there 5 seconds ago, kind of vanishes into thin air.  <i>There one moment, gone the next</i>.  Kind of like cherry blossoms in the spring, or that first crush you have as a teenager (no Mom, <i>it&#x27;s love</i>, you just don&#x27;t get it!!!) - so fleeting.<p>Oh well, it&#x27;s probably nothing...&quot;just my mind playing tricks on me!&quot; lol')
