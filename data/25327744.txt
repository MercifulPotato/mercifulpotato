Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25327854], score=None, time=1607297781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327671, text='&gt; &quot;docker-compose up&quot; is failing half the time out-of-the-box because the web server starts before the database.<p>Most web frameworks will retry until it can connect or give up after a specified timeout time. Basically handle it at the app layer where you have the most control.<p>But you still run into situations where you need to wait for docker-compose up -d to be &quot;really&quot; up before doing certain things (such as exec&#x27;ing into your main container to run tests or migrations).<p>For that I wrote a simple Bash script at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;wait-until" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;wait-until</a>. IMO a problem like this can&#x27;t really be solved at the Docker Compose level. But without such a script you can easily end up with failing CI tests because there&#x27;s a multi-second but varied amount of delay on upping a database for the first time. That script has become a part of all of my CI &#x2F; deployment pipelines.')
