He speaks to all the people there not specifically to thous who broke laws. And he called for peace, law and order and to go home. But somehow you came to the conclusion that &quot;he said he loved the people who stormed the Capitol with rifles today&quot; Cant you see how biased that is? You just picked the &lt;0.001% of protestors that apparently stormed the capitol with rifles.\nWhy not pick the &gt;90% while people just pretend that he only addresses them and thus only love white people so he must be racist right? You can make up any shit you want with such a retarded non-logic way of interpreting what he clearly said to all the people there.')
