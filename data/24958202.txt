That&#x27;s... a lot.<p>Aside from overstating operational readiness, you also upped the W88 yield from it&#x27;s actual 455KT and, while most sources do reported that 4-5 warheads per missile is typical, you assumed all in the fleet or W88s, while they seem to be a mix of W88 and 90KT W76.<p>So it&#x27;s a lot less ready to go than you&#x27;ve estimated here.<p>But, OTOH, it&#x27;s still a lot.')
