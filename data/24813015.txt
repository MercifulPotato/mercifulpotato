Sorry, I did preface it &quot;As unethical as it sounds&quot;.<p>Your comment seems to be &quot;cancelling&quot; mine purely on emotional basis despite of prefacing my intentions. God forbid, if I had purely stated it with no warnings.<p>I agree, it is pretty shitty to thing to say that older people are not as valuable to the society as the young. There is objectivity and truth to it, although it might be unpleasant. I am afraid that this is what&#x27;s going on in the world today - objectivity takes a backseat, emotional and knee-jerk &quot;cancel&quot; culture prevails. It deeply bothers me.')
