With a tiny amount of work you can even avoid the garbage collector and get pretty much every advantage C had with a more minimalist, general, and expressive language) but it&#x27;s very popular and has most &quot;normal&quot; things that c lacks. Arguably these aren&#x27;t thins you should be doing on a &quot;micro controller&quot; (IMO you&#x27;re generally best off sticking to state machines and avoiding dynamic memory allocation.)')
