Let’s say for the sake of argument that all those things came true — business models changed, financial interests separated, etc — but from the users’ point of view, everything works exactly as it does today. Success?<p><i>&gt; I think the actual escape hatch would be enabling users to filter content collaboratively</i><p>This exists today — shared block lists, etc — and it’s insufficient. There’s a reason that when Twitter announced that they would suspend the accounts of people hoping for Donald Trump to die of COVID, the response from people who often receive death threats was “you mean you could have been doing this the whole time?!”<p><i>&gt; I assume (without having checked) that filtering spam would still be allowed even under platform rules.</i><p>What is spam? “I made $X from my couch”? Repeated links to my blog? Trolling conservative communities with liberal posts?<p>The problem with carving out exceptions to your ban on moderation is that it moves your complaint from “all censorship is bad” to “censorship of speech I don’t like is bad”.')
