Consenting essentially allows them to use other tracking technologies beyond cookies such as IP addresses or browser fingerprinting.<p>This is also why the GDPR requires consent forms instead of relying on browser cookie settings, as it covers the <i>intent</i> of tracking itself as opposed to any technical means by which it is achieved (and this is why functional cookies such as for logging in or shopping carts donâ€™t actually need consent at all).')
