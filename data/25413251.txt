I installed it and agreed to let him play it before I realized the sheer number of ads and psychological manipulation in it. Want a power up? Watch this ad. Want to continue? Watch this other ad. Seriously f-ck these game companies that prey on mental weakness, especially those of children, for a quick buck. I have had numerous arguments with my son, so he&#x27;s very aware of the ads and that they&#x27;re trying to trick him, but not all parents will even know what&#x27;s going on with these games. And he still falls for them. How can he not?<p>For the record, I would&#x27;ve been more than happy to pay Outfit7, the racket behind this game, a sum of money to just play the game without ads. That&#x27;s entirely reasonable to just allow me to buy the game. But nope. I haven&#x27;t seen that option.<p>Apple Arcade, which is the antidote and claims to not have any ads or in-app purchases, is like a cigarette company selling nicotine patches to get you off your smoking addiction. Every time Apple claims to give a sh-t about addiction, you can see how manipulative and scammy the top 100 games are on the App Store.  Curation, my ass.<p>How are more Apple employees not put off by this stuff?')
