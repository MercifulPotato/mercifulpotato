Item(by='lrossi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611446205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25887075, text='&gt; While most probably aren’t going to awol for a day at a time I know a LOT of people that now spend working hours doing leisure things<p>Oh, the horror!<p>&gt; people are shifting work hours to ones more of convenience (again anecdotal)<p>They have no shame!<p>&gt; But even some of my direct reports will slack significantly more if they think I’m not online. Responses that are normally in minutes take hours etc.I have to now probe for updates etc.<p>This all sounds very familiar. Let me give you another perspective on this.<p>It’s very stressful and disruptive to be pinged 20+ times a day. While some of those are people asking for my help, which I gladly do, a good chunk are managers and seniors asking for “updates” or checking in just to see “how it’s going”. Like we didn’t have a standup 4 hours ago. Sometimes it’s colleagues asked by the manager to check on others, so that it doesn’t look like they’re too annoying. I know because it’s obvious and I got asked to do the same many times.<p>The answer is that it’s going great, thank you very much. At least it was until you interrupted me for the nth time today and now I will have to waste time trying to remember what the hell I was doing in that debugging session. Actually no, a timer expired, so now I will have to restart the whole thing from scratch.<p>So yes, I sometimes stop answering the chat, or close it altogether. Because I want us to hit the deadline and ship on time, since I care about the team’s results instead of seeing how busy my subordinates are and feeling important for nagging people all day long.<p>A micromanager hurts the company by reducing productivity and team morale. Your subordinates are not “doing leisurely things” during working hours. They are probably brushing up their CV and doing leetcode to find another job.')
