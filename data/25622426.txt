Personally, I like to group people into three categories : understand, accept and agree.<p>The agree group is the one that you need to get 100% on board. Typically, this is the group that provides you resources (time, money and employees). The accept group is the one that doesn&#x27;t need to agree but needs to accept the decisions taken. That is, they need to accept the structure in place to make decisions and understand that they are important. The accept group typically are people who are fence sitters and close watchers. They like what they see but do not have to necessarily agree with everything. Finally, the understand group is the ones who do not agree or accept but just understand what&#x27;s going on. Typically, these people can influence projects outside the working sphere but as long as they understand it; they would not be difficult.')
