Unicode characters don&#x27;t display and show as boxes. Input methods don&#x27;t work. Lots of hardware doesn&#x27;t work. There&#x27;s no obvious way to configure all the things you can usually configure in Windows. GPU accelerations don&#x27;t work properly in things like Adobe&#x27;s products.<p>It has come very far but only if you judge it by the fact that everyone is doing work for it for free.')
