Signal&#x27;s claim to fame is that it can deal with the case of an offline client and still offer forward secrecy. In Signal&#x27;s case that means a server based infrastructure to store cryptographic state that the decentralized OTR gets along without. On top of that, Signal&#x27;s per message forward secrecy (OTR is per session) adds even more complexity.')
