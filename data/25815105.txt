Another comparison might be that that&#x27;s about how much electricity it takes to smelt 4kg of aluminum. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meaningful to think in terms of &quot;waste&quot; wrt energy consumption any more than gold mining is &quot;waste&quot;. Most of the energy generating capacity would not have been turned on if it wasn&#x27;t going to be used for mining bitcoin.<p>The only useful framing is in terms of externalities, but it turns out the cheapest forms of energy generation (underutilised hydro and solar in china) tend to be zero carbon. Using energy isn&#x27;t bad, emitting carbon is bad.')
