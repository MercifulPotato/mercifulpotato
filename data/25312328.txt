It doesn&#x27;t take long for that kind of growth to go from a trivial issue to catastrophic one, and it&#x27;s the exact kind of risk you have ethicists in a field to call out while it still is trivial so that some of the energy of people doing technical development gets directed to mitigate the risk of it ever reaching the catastrophic stage.')
