A job isn&#x27;t a person. You should love your friends and family. A job is what you do for money. Like a trick, michael.<p>I would love to know when the idea of &quot;loving your job&quot; came into the culture. It feels so manufactured like &quot;I (heart)&#x2F;love NY&quot;. Similar to &quot;productivity&quot; today. &quot;Have you been productive today&quot;? When did &quot;productivity&quot; sneak into the culture.<p>Edit: The replies indicate what I am talking about. People are so conditioned into thinking that you should &quot;love&quot; your job that they get defensive when you point out that a job isn&#x27;t something that you should &quot;love&quot;. You can enjoy your job, you can get fulfillment from your job, but a job isn&#x27;t a person. It isn&#x27;t something that you should &quot;love&quot;. Words matter. I don&#x27;t like how love has been hijacked into a meaningless term now. I love my job, my hobby, my football team, etc. Someone wrote they spent decades with a job they loved. If you did, then you wasted your life. Do other countries&#x2F;languages also &quot;love their job&quot; or is this an american thing? It&#x27;s such a strange thing to &quot;love&quot;. Strangely enough, only on hacker news would you people so religious defend their love of their job.')
