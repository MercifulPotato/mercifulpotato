Turn off your cell phone, wifi router at night and consider Faraday caging the room. The EMF signals disrupt the bodies healing processes and lead to autoimmune disorder type responses.<p>I had an RSI injury that seemed to be at its worst every morning and wasn&#x27;t getting much better with time.
