For example if you want to program microcontrollers with a modern language and 0 overhead over C then Nim is a great language to learn. Or if you want to write a web front-end and back-end in the same language that compiles to JS and C respectively then Nim is yet again a great language. Or if you just want to get into programming with macros to boost your productivity or make nice patterns in your code, then Nim is a great language. Or if you are just curious as to what else that is out there, then Nim is a great language.')
