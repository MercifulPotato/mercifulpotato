They need to make the budget. There&#x27;s not an indeterminate amount of money available so it needs to level out among all the employees.<p>And yes, achieving &quot;Significantly exceeds expectations&quot; implies some level of walking on water, and is the top 1-2% of the company. This isn&#x27;t the same as school grades where anything less than an A means you&#x27;re doing something wrong.<p>Annual reviews are some of the worst time to get pay raises because of these constraints. Finding ways to get &quot;out of cycle&quot; raises&#x2F;promotions is much better.')
