In the course of the plot, he committed enough crimes that he will be put in a supermax prison for the rest of his life.<p>Is it more ethical to keep this person in a solitary confinement--allowed out of his cell only one hour a day--for the next forty years or <i>give him the option</i> of taking a pill that will make him stop wanting to murder people in the name of his ideology and instead put him on parole until it&#x27;s clear the pill worked?<p>I&#x27;d argue offering the pill is far more humane than life in solitary confinement.<p>A tool like this obviously should not be used to &quot;reform&quot; people who are socially different (e.g. Alan Turing); the scenario I propose here is only applicable to people whose violent politics make them too dangerous to let out of prison.')
