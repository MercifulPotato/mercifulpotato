Item(by='kaba0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606158697, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190428, text='As you can see in this thread, resizing in gnome on wayland looks like this ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;kaS9nVr.mp4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;kaS9nVr.mp4</a> ), which compared to MacOS ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;EAPzmKC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;EAPzmKC</a> ) is lightyears behind in terms of smoothness (as reported in the same thread, wayland-comparable performance is observed on windows as well). What I can think of as a difference is that Wayland sends resize requests on each mouse-move event, while MacOS MAY do some sort of clever hack. Maybe they try to predict mouse movement and only ask for a subset of all sizes of the window from the application? Is anyone familiar with what happens here, in depth?')
