There&#x27;s no articles about how the extremely noisy and uncertain constrains from astronomy are more worth to gamble on that than the much cleaner direct detections from accelerators.<p>And there&#x27;s <i>certainly</i> no arguments about how we should stop giving so much money to the exoplanet researchers and their instruments instead of making satellites to measure the cosmic radio background. (There&#x27;s not even a little post about how SpaceX will hamper radio astronomy by making sure there&#x27;s no radio quiet place left on earth).')
