Meeting rooms would also have permanently installed PCs and you wouldn&#x27;t have to fidget with the projector connections&#x2F;settings, you just log on and are good to go.<p>On top of that, none of those systems would be my personal property and I wouldn&#x27;t take them home with me, or bother installing&#x2F;updating software. Other people would be paid full time to make sure everything works and I have access to all the files and software I need (and <i>only</i> those I need). Sounds crazy, right?<p>I&#x27;m eager to hear your recommended redesign.')
