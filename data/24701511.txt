From what we can tell, customers almost never have surprise bursts of traffic, but it&#x27;s something they think about a lot. It&#x27;s pretty easy to just say &quot;you&#x27;re not responsible for expenses associated with abuse or attacks or other nasty surprises&quot;.<p>The purpose of a metered service is to give people access to tools and features that would be prohibitively expensive otherwise. The trade off is that the expense also grows incrementally.')
