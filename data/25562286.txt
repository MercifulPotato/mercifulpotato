Wages dropped in the late 70s and in the 80s, then went up in the 90s, spent the 00s mostly flat, and rose a little in the 10s. It took 50 years (until 2019) for them to go back up to the 1968 high. So &quot;we&#x27;ve made no progress since 1970&quot; economic quotes are mostly true, but &quot;we&#x27;ve made no progress since 199x&quot; economic quotes are mostly false.')
