Similar heat can be found everywhere at surface, especially in Alberta which has a heavy industrial base. Harnessing the heat from industrial sources is exactly the same as a geothermal plant: only the source of heat is different.<p>For example, I scoped a project on a natural gas pipeline compressor station. It used a RB211 gas turbine to drive the compressor. Capturing the waste heat from the exhaust stack of that engine gave us 7MW of net generation, at a cost of $30 million, and much lower operating expenses to boot.<p>58% of the energy we generate each year is lost, much of it (upwards of 20%) as industrial waste heat. That&#x27;s terajoules of electrical generation potential globally, just from the easily captured stuff.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly like geothermal energy, because you have counterparty risk in that the cement factory (or whatever) might close. But the tech is identical to geothermal, and there&#x27;s no exploration risk or digging expense.')
