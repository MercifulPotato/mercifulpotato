The biggest negative is when the person speaking is also the type who takes <i>forever</i> to get to their point. I&#x27;d say the counter requirement here is that you _need_ to cap speaking times somehow, and the cap needs to be short (say 30s).<p>Not sure how to let that tie into getting around complex issues, though the idea of other team members having to yield their time to the speaker to continue is probably relevant (I mean let&#x27;s face it: international diplomacy formalities exist for a reason, to solve problems with significantly higher stakes).')
