That applies to the time limit for prosecution, not the time limit for executing asset seizure that was declared forfeit. It is always forfeit, you don&#x27;t get to protect your ill-gotten gains if you manage (or someone receiving them manages) to hide them long enough. They still have a seizure order on them if, presumably the FBI, can figure out how to get them.')
