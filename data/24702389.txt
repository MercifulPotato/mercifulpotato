It&#x27;s really strange how it almost never comes up in discussions about drug prices. I&#x27;ve had an open question for about as long as I&#x27;ve known about off patent insulin.<p>People often say that expensive insulin leads to &quot;deaths&quot;. How accurate is this statement? It&#x27;s hard to get a straight answer because the word &quot;death&quot; is so politicized and its meaning can be stretched extremely far. I&#x27;m not trying to make a statement either way about what the price of insulin should be, just trying to quantify how much &quot;death&quot; it causes.')
