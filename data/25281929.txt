I use the VIP feature of Samsung&#x27;s email client, which seems to be unique to that specific client, since I haven&#x27;t been able to find another with it.<p>Maybe not quite as simple to set up, but you should be able to get something similar on most clients with a folder and a filter. I&#x27;ve done this for some of my important&#x2F;urgent folders, with K9-Mail set to only show notifications from those folders (notification class).')
