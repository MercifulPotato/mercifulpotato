If anything, they shift power to the patients because now the decisions can be checked and questioned at many levels. An algorithm will not send you away because it is to tired too take your complaints seriously.<p>So, using algorithmic decision making should be as bias free as possible, but there is no way that across the board they will be more biased than humans are now. If people care about marginalized communities, they should push with everything they got for, not oppose, ML decision making.')
