Flynn pled guilty when threatened with the prospect of his son being charged and railroaded as well. Once he retained new legal council, he withdrew his guilty plea. The DoJ dropped the prosecution after exculpatory evidence came out that was being withheld by the FBI. Judge Sullivan decided to keep the case going instead of throwing it out- and eventually Trump pardoned Flynn.<p>Micheal Flynn was being charged for lying to FBI investigators about sanctions, when the transcripts of the calls were finally released by the FBI, it turns out he didn&#x27;t even bring up sanctions with Kisylak at all. The FBI also withheld the original 302 from the interview with Flynn, and Peter Strzok, who was later fired for bias, had re-written the second 302 that was used to imply that Flynn had lied to investigators.<p>What&#x27;s not proven, but suspected, is that the entire call to Kislyak was orchestrated by the Obama admin. Expelling the Russian diplomats&#x2F;spies when Flynn was already under surveillance prompted the calls between Kislyak and Flynn. Flynn was in a foreign country when this happened, and given his place in the upcoming administration as well as his role under Obama&#x27;s admin, it was a near guarantee that he would be in contact with Kislyak. He called Kislyak on an unsecured line while in a foreign country. Flynn would have known absolutely that the call was being surveilled, but he didn&#x27;t believe he was doing anything untoward. What he didn&#x27;t know was that the FBI would use this as a point to attack him. Comey even jokes about how sending agents to interview a WH staff member alone without legal counsel would never have been acceptable, but that Trump&#x27;s young and inexperienced administration didn&#x27;t realize it in time.<p>But that&#x27;s all conjecture. What is not conjecture is fact that Flynn did not lie to the FBI, and should not have been charged as such.')
