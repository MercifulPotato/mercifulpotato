Item(by='emteycz', descendants=None, kids=[25553266], score=None, time=1609086260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551684, text='&gt; I am not sure where in the 47 pages you are reading that<p>From the document: &quot;An added benefit of the increase in electronic payments is the reduction of shadow economy. Each year trillions of Euro flow in the shadow market unregulated and untaxed, leading to long term deficits. Traceability of electronic payments is much better than with cash, leading to more information on the flow of money. This information can be used to reduce tax evasion and make regulation easier, in turn reducing the shadow economy&quot;<p>&gt; It should also be said that this report is not made by the european union, but for the european union by a 3rd party that got paid to make research for them.<p>Signature right on the front page: &quot;Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies Directorate-General for Internal Policies.&quot;<p>This &quot;third-party document&quot; shit is a really embarrassing excuse. Can&#x27;t the EU apologists think of something better?<p>Maybe someone external cooperated on that document - but it&#x27;s still a document by the EU and for the EU just like any other, authored and published by a department of the Directorate-General for Internal Policies of the EU. I am sure they wouldn&#x27;t have signed and published it if they disagreed with the content (or at least would have said so). You wouldn&#x27;t try to claim that a law&#x2F;regulation written by an external lawyer and published by the EU is actually not an EU document, right? Because there is a lot of that, e.g. the GDPR.<p>From the document: &quot;The study lays out predictions for digital services in the next one to ten years and provides recommendations for action for the European Parliament in preparation for the Digital Services Act. <i>This document was provided by the Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies at the request of the committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</i>&quot;<p>Anyways, this document is one of many, it&#x27;s just the first I had a link to. The same points (and other, even more concerning ones) are made in many more.<p>&gt; &quot;such as democratic values, data protection, data accessibility, transparency and user friendliness.&quot;<p>Sure, just like the encryption backdoors are for the children, for the democracy and especially for transparency. Take these democratic values with you, I am not interested. The EU is really efficient in showing us why is democracy wrong.')
