They&#x27;re great. 4k monitor, gigabit ethernet, a number of USB-3 devices, and power-delivery for my Macbook. They are decidedly not cheap, but I wasted a lot of money on plain USB-C hubs (not Thuderbolt 3 which uses the same port but is not the same) that are now effectively trash.<p>I&#x27;ve got one at all of the &quot;workstations&quot; in the house. Tired of working in the bedroom? Unplug one cable and move to the office that has an identical setup and everything works and is easy.')
