But there are other perspectives:<p>Open source has done a ton of good. It massively accelerated technological advancements and made software development more accessible, democratic and efficient, because people depend and build on common, collaborative technologies.<p>A lot of programmers are not in for the business. I want a decent life and not worry about money, but I don&#x27;t ask for much, especially not in the material sense. The reason I love programming is because of programming itself. It is a fascinating and rewarding craft. In a perfect world, I would be focusing purely on solving problems and make the solutions available for as many people as possible.')
