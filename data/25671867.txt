A serial line even a short one can absolutely suffer from interference.<p>You already made it relatively fail-safe with the heartbeat&#x2F;watchdog but please consider upgrading your design to use comms with a differential signal, anything like CAN or even RS-485 in that Rpi&#x2F;STM32 link would be a significant improvement.')
