They&#x27;re  called &quot;Ads by Google&quot; on the first page of Google search results depending on the search query.<p>DNS-over-HTTPS can actually be useful.  I can do bulk DNS lookups from DOH servers using HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining, retrieving thousands of names at a time over a single TCP connection.  I can look up every name for every HN item in one go, store this data in zone file served by a localhost DNS server and generally never have to use remote DNS when browsing HN.  This makes for fast browsing with a text-only browser.<p>The issue I am surprised more people are not raising is the decision of Google to encourage Golang developers to use a &quot;built-in&quot; DNS resolver in their applications rather than relying the system resolver and submitting to traditional user controls like resolv.conf, nsswitch.conf and HOSTS.  Regardless of the motivation behind this choice, IMO it tips the scales toward developers instead of (non-Windows) users in terms of ease of control over DNS lookups, not to mention the privacy issue (shared by DOH) of enabling a third party DNS provider to segregate lookups by device.')
