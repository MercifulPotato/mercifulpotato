But there is much, much more to safety than deallocating memory.</i><p>Yes, but that&#x27;s the main allure of Rust. As for the rest (e.g. resource releasing, avoiding concurency issues, avoding not-exhastive mathces, injection, etc.), other languages have their own ways as well, including Java.<p>If those are your main concerns (and not also top-speed) I don&#x27;t think Rust is worth the extra cost (learning slope, slow compilation times, single implementation, fewer libs and developer tools, etc).')
