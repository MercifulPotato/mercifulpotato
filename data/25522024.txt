Besides a handful of things, people try to apply blockchain to problems that aren&#x27;t real.  JWT is using cryptography to solve a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist, which is that storing and retrieving user sessions on the server is burdensome, even though it&#x27;s one of the least expensive computations you can make on a server.  In fact, unlike blockchain, I can&#x27;t think of any real world scenarios where a JWT is superior to cookie auth over HTTPS.  It just sounds really awesome until you realize that, no matter what, you&#x27;re going to need to keep and fetch <i>some</i> information about the user on the server, and that it&#x27;s really not helpful at all to offload user data into a client side token.  As someone who used to be enthusiastic about JWT, I kind of wish it would die in a fire.  Cookie auth is much easier to implement without the need for a 3rd party library and is also more secure.')
