Some people in this thread are recommending commercial TVs, which involves paying near-OLED prices for a TV that&#x27;s probably not much better than the Sceptre (and might actually be worse, if my experience in hotels is any indication). Do the LGs have ads and tracking, or are they completely &quot;unobtrusive&quot; smart TVs?<p>&gt; the best you can get is a second-hand Pioneer or Panasonic plasma display<p>Indeed, this is what I did. It&#x27;s 1080p of course but at the size of most plasmas and average sitting distance, 1080p is all you need. (More worried about the lack of HDR.)<p>The main issue I&#x27;ve had is that the &quot;backlight&quot; (not really a backlight) seems to be significantly brighter for two &quot;bars&quot; on the left and right of the screen about 2-3 inches wide, giving films a odd &quot;banding&quot; look. Also, the black levels are much higher than I originally expected. I&#x27;ve read that Panasonic sets artificially raise the black level over time to prolong the expected life of the TV and that there&#x27;s a way take the TV apart and reset this internal clock, but I haven&#x27;t tried that and it seems risky. (I recall plasma sets being advertised as having &quot;infinite contrast&quot;, but having seen some OLED TVs in person, I can 100% confirm there&#x27;s a difference.)')
