Previous models had the engine inside. Subsequent models had the engine entirely in front. But the generation I have split the difference with a short, downward sloping hood.<p>For this reason and many more - ever since Tesla announced their SUV, I have wished that someone in the EV space would consider this era of van when building anything meant to appeal to overlanding. Despite the many many issues, the design has excellent approach and departure angles, extremely good utility, has the same footprint of a full sized truck, and (for many reasons) has been a favorite for aftermarket conversion for a long time (see Sportsmobile or any of dozens of RV builders). Professional conversion companies and hobbyist like myself spend a lot of time building electrical systems into these vans to make them into better campers. Unlike your average truck owner (farmer, rancher, contractor, etc), the entire van-building niche would embrace a solid EV alternative.')
