It&#x27;s the fastest way to get a scalable service up and online. A powerful infrastructure abstraction built with the AWS CDK.<p>As long as you&#x27;re logged in to AWS, you can deploy your functions and infrastructure with a single &quot;npm run deploy&quot;.<p>Each function you add get&#x27;s its own HTTP API route and SQS Queue, giving you multiple ways to send events into the Lambda function for processing.<p>More things are coming. I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy this simple programming and deployment model as much as I have.<p>PS: This is NOT a library, SDK, or a product. It is a GitHub starter template project that you can clone&#x2F;fork, with ZERO configuration.<p>I deploy stuff to the cloud all day, and find myself spending hours just writing the initial IaC (infrastructure as code) config and getting everything wired up correctly. This template gets me going pretty fast with a running API, sending requests to my functions. I can also send work to my functions (or between functions) asynchronously with a queue. All with just a single-command to deploy everything.<p>Needless to say, this saves me countless hours.<p>I hope it is useful for you all as well. I always get so much value out of HN, and am wanting to give back. Free forever + open source. Concerns&#x2F;suggestions are welcomed!<p>Enjoy and thanks for reading.')
