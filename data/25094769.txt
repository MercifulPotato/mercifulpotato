There are five domesticated species of capsicum pepper.  Of those, C. baccatum is from the South American Andes, as is C. pubescens.  The origins of C. chinese are a bit unclear, but this species is known to be very diverse in the Amazon.  C. frutescens I&#x27;m not sure about, but C. Annuums  came from southern North America or northern South America.  There are also another 20 or so wild species, which are found throughout this region.<p>Basically, these sort of peppers were native throughout  southern North America, Central America, and much of South America.  Furthermore consumption of these peppers likely predated their cultivation by thousands of years.')
