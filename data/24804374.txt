I went into this field for similar reasons to you (I did not enjoy traditional SWE internships but liked coding and math). My current position is more of a generalist role where I spend equal time:\n- Building dashboards and doing simple analysis (mostly SQL)\n- Building data pipelines and other data services (mostly python)\n- Doing deep analyses and building data products (i.e. recommendation engines) using machine learning.\nI also spend more time interacting with various others in the company and get more involved in the business side of things than most traditional software engineers.')
