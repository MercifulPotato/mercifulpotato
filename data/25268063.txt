It is based on my experience developing GUIs in the web stack (pre-react days), Qt&#x2F;GTK+, and Qt&#x27;s QML, in an attempt to tie together the best of those technologies and rethink the worst.<p>My experience is primarily in C++ (C++17, C++14, C++11). Also comfortable working with straight C (C89, C90, C99, C11), although less experience with <i>The C Way™.</i> I have working knowledge of Python, and have piddled around in Common Lisp but nothing non-trivial unfortunately.')
