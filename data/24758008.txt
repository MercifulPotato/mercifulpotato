Lockdowns and &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; orders were a reasonable response in March when we had no idea what we were dealing with and had to preserve the integrity of the hospital system.  But they were never going to be sustainable for more than a few weeks.<p>The next step, closing &quot;non-essential&quot; business and limiting gatherings, is a logical progression, and is something that can be tweaked and tightened&#x2F;loosened as the data indicate.<p>Then we have masks, social distancing, and frequent hygiene.  This should continue indefinitely, at least until a vaccine has been widely distributed.  I&#x27;m shocked by the opposition to this.')
