I&#x27;d say that calling it a simple yet rewarding lifestyle makes it sound a lot less difficult than it is, it comes off as dismissive. Having gotten a taste of both worlds, I can tell you working as a software developer is a lot more simple and, at times, more rewarding.<p>Many people are in a situation where they can&#x27;t make the choice to exclusively do care work, due to financial constraints, and much of the care work is done by women who also work for money alongside of it.
