I&#x27;m not familiar with Durianrider.<p>I can say this with confidence - the bike industry isn&#x27;t built on a scam. There are scammers within it (like any other industry) but the established brands are not scamming you with their higher priced offerings. They may be wrong about some of the benefits they believe they are offering, but it&#x27;s not a scam.<p>It sounds mostly like your cost-value threshold has changed. And that&#x27;s fine. But that â‚¬80 pair of shorts - if it comes from a reputable brand - actually does offer some benefits and advancements that a few consumers find valuable. When I read a comment like yours it sounds like someone lamenting that people purchase high-end GPUs. Sure, nobody <i>needs</i> 4k graphics at 120 fps, but there&#x27;s a market for it anyway.')
