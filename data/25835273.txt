A law that requires all members of an ethnic or political minority to be arrested should be resisted no matter how &quot;democratic&quot; it is.  (I&#x27;m not saying a voluntary boycott of Parler is <i>equivalent</i> to that, just that &quot;living in a democracy&quot; isn&#x27;t, by itself, a complete justification).<p>&gt; the trouble we&#x27;re going through now is a direct result of allowing hate-filled people to form bubbles<p>If the problem is online bubbles forming, then maybe you should be objecting to Parler blocking criticism of right-wing views on its platform (in other words, suppression of speech is the cause of the problem, not the solution).  However, to be against Parler banning left-wing hate-filled accounts but not Twitter banning right-wing hate-filled accounts raises the original concern that the person deciding which speech to ban might have political biases.<p>&gt; Conservatives seem to just not get democracy, and as a result see the Government as something distinct from themselves.<p>To be fair, in many countries (particularly the US) the electoral system (not to mention lobbying) causes quite deliberate divergence between what the majority of the people want and what the majority of politicians want.  Also, to steelman the view which you assign to &quot;Conservatives&quot;, it&#x27;s worth considering that societies should care not just about democracy but about liberty as well, since &quot;we can pass this law&quot; doesn&#x27;t always mean &quot;we should pass this law&quot;.<p>&gt; If you live in a democracy, you don&#x27;t fear your government<p>What a wonderful world that would be.  As explained, not every democracy is as representative as you might hope, and not every person even in a perfectly representative democracy can feel safe from their government.<p>&gt; if not immediately, then in four years time at most.<p>The Nazi party actually lost seats in the November 1932 German federal election, which was considered free and fair, but just two months later the party had seized power.  Also, if we&#x27;re making international comparisons, UK general elections only occur every five years.<p>Finally, to give a recent example of how &quot;silence&quot; is used in political discourse, let me give this example:<p>&gt; High-profile barrister says 10th arrest warrant for Duterte critic showed the Philippines was trying to silence Ressa<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;19&#x2F;amal-clooney-decries-legal-charade-after-journalist-maria-ressa-charged-again-with-libel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;19&#x2F;amal-clooney-d...</a>')
