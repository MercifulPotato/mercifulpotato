Go for a wood run, rent the truck for an hour, buy enough to make it worth it, and return it.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen though, wood isn&#x27;t cheap to have delivered. They can cut it for you in the store, but obviously a prius still isn&#x27;t best to ship it in.<p>Maybe find a friend with a truck or light trailer that you can borrow every couple of months?')
