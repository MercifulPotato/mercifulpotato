Then everybody plays the same thing again but this time hearing what others played during the first round.<p>This can be repeated as many times as wanted. On 3rd time you will hear what others played during the 2nd round and that is presumably better played than what they played the first time when they only heard the click-track.<p>Thus you can &quot;jam&quot; with the other musicians the way they were last time around.')
