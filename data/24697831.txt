There is an understandable media narrative to portray mostly severe cases (again, understandable from some sort of public health perspective) but that also adds to psychological add-on effects one might face with this disease.<p>I&#x27;m in no way part of the just-the-flu crew, but feel that the OMG-COVID crew hasn&#x27;t necessarily thought the above aspects through either.')
