This can be quite a bit of money for hedge fund managers&#x2F;owners. I&#x27;ve read that some of them live outside NYC to avoid the tax but need to hire a full time person to document and make sure they are not counted as a NYC resident by the city. You can only spend so many nights in NYC and not be counted as a resident, show proof of you being somewhere else, etc.<p>Income taxes has so many bad consequences. It would be great to ban it and replace it with land value taxes.')
