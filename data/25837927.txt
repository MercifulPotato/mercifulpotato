I&#x27;ve been using Serverless Framework for a project and have not been too satisfied with the experience. Could you explain the integration with that framework a little more? I see the two options for services with Seed are the Serverless Framework or Serverless Stack (which I have no experience with, but looks like a compelling alternative). Is Seed just compatible with existing Serverless Framework yml configurations, or does it integrate with your Serverless Framework account somehow? I see you offer an integration with Serverless Pro, which confused me as this appeared (to me) to be a full replacement for Serverless Framework.')
