Twitter has plenty of their own notices as well, spawning several memes already[0][1].<p>Dick Costolo, the former CEO of Twitter, made a post about &quot;lining up and shooting&quot; people. AOC recently tweeted about &quot;making lists&quot; of opposition supporters, which was amplified by many others. There were 3 years of unfounded accusations of foreign involvement in the 2016 election, amongst many other titillating rumours, gossip, and slander against an elected official and his family and cabinet members.<p>None of those were flagged by social media companies the way Trump and others are being flagged now. Whatever pretzel-like justifications one may come up with for the obvious double-standard, the average person no longer believes in neutrality of media or of any of the major tech platforms.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tysmith12206&#x2F;status&#x2F;1326669493817516034" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tysmith12206&#x2F;status&#x2F;1326669493817516034</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.ifunny.co&#x2F;images&#x2F;f9cf7b18c206377f293432986acf677d78afb9e0803c458404b409b3d292e49c_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.ifunny.co&#x2F;images&#x2F;f9cf7b18c206377f293432986acf677...</a>')
