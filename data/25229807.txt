A two-bedroom 500-600 sqft apt would be considered just fine for most families with 1 or two kids (esp. if those kids are same gender or while they&#x27;re small). Anything above that gets you into upper-middle class or above. Alternatively, a 4-member family with two minimum incomes could get by with 400sqft (it&#x27;d be cramped but wouldn&#x27;t be considered outrageously small).<p>The difference is also that these are almost exclusively in an apartment building, where your neighbours help insulate you from the elements, resulting in lower heating&#x2F;cooling costs.<p>I&#x27;m amazed whenever I read an article mentioning home sizes in the States (or in this case Canada) and have to double-check whether my sqft&lt;-&gt;m2 conversion is okay because I can&#x27;t believe how much more room is considered &quot;normal&quot; over there.<p>Tiny homes wouldn&#x27;t solve the housing crises, but looking across the pond, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;d still be a boon for low-wage earners. I know I&#x27;d rather be in my own 200sqft than have to pay off huge mortgage or rent a 600sqft of &quot;wasted&quot; space.<p>Even if I prefer or have to rent, smaller units would be cheaper, while still more expensive per sqft, in theory netting the landlord more profit for the same apt. complex. Sounds like a win&#x2F;win, what am I missing?')
