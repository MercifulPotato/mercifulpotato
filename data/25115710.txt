My doctor only seemed to care whether or not I&#x27;ve ever had a full-on attack, but I think it&#x27;s plausible that there could be negative effects short of that. My wrist pain went away when I modified my diet, which I was advised to do anyway.<p>I&#x27;m sure I made other changes to my life during that period of time so I can&#x27;t say for certain that it wasn&#x27;t some other change that caused the pain to go away. I also know that wrist pain can go away on its own without any intervention. I wanted to leave this comment here in case it helps others; I would have been very grateful if simply modifying my diet would have helped me as I tried many things during that period of time.<p>I&#x27;d also be interested in getting feedback from those more knowledgeable as I don&#x27;t have much of a medical background. I did find a study - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4101606&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4101606&#x2F;</a> which may support what I&#x27;m saying, but I might be completely wrong.')
