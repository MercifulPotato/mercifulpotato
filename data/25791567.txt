From what I understand the only way is search for the app in settings, open the &quot;Photos&quot; permission and click on &quot;Edit Selected Photos&quot;. Is there an easier way I missed? I guess I can&#x27;t expect a simple click from within the app itself while selecting photos, as it&#x27;s not aware it&#x27;s seeing a limited selection.')
