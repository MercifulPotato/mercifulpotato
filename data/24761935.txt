(see the other discussions re: connection pooling above).<p>The reason a lot of folks are skeptical is that in practice there don’t seem to be a lot of great examples of stateful services using a “pure” serverless lambda pattern but with arbitrary dependencies that actually do scale smoothly and don’t break in annoying ways such that you end up building something <i>more</i> complicated than just using App Engine or Heroku...')
