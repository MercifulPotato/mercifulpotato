The people the author is comparing themself to prefer the suburbs. The usage argument is a secondary rationalization. I never use my spare bedroom. I barely drive my car. I don&#x27;t make much use of my yard (or do much maintenance on it). The thing I value most is not living in a city. The car is a necessity (and cost me a whopping $1500), the house is cheap ($900&#x2F;mo) and comes with more rooms than I need. The yard doesn&#x27;t actually require any maintenance. At least I don&#x27;t have to live in a city.')
