I chose to move to Chicago rather than New York after college because 1. cost of living 2. people.<p>The midwest is nice. New York city folks are not. I&#x27;ve worked at two companies where I managed or worked heavily with our New York office and hated it both times.<p>I realize not every New Yorker is an asshole and not everyone can leave the city on a whim but if its good for your health its worth considering.')
