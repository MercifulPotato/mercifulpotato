You need to pour a fair bit of effort into getting on an Olympiad team. Whether you get a PhD is more a question of economics, IMO. If you&#x27;re showing that much promise there will be many other temptations, and bear in mind it&#x27;s not just rich countries that have math kids, there&#x27;s plenty of olympiad kids who need to get out and make money when they&#x27;ve done their degrees.<p>The kind of work you do in a PhD is also quite different. A math contest is a few questions with definite answers and a time limit.')
