The core functionality is all there, but there are still some key questions that need to be answered around ease-of-use and game balance (not an easy proposition when players get to create their own cards!)<p>You can check it out in its current form here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.wordbots.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.wordbots.io&#x2F;</a> .\nThe code is hosted at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wordbots" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wordbots</a> .')
