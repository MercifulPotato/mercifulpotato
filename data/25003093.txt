Sharing source code, or binaries, that are &quot;primarily designed&quot; to circumvent copyrighted works arguably violates 1201. It is not a defense to assert that no one ever used what was shared.<p>An MP3 patent, such as 6,009,399, covers methods and apparatuses for encoding a digitised audio signal.  Writing source code that uses a claimed method is arguably not infringment but as soon as anyone besides the patent owner or her licensees compiles the source code and tests the binary, then there is a much stronger argument that infringment has occurred.')
