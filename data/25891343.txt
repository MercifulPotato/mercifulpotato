Item(by='vishnugupta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611489550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890228, text='I don&#x27;t think lumping together university&#x2F;college education with professional setup will yield useful results. Everything about them are vastly different. Situations in life, demography, support system, primary goals, to name a few.<p>Just to pick on one aspect; tools. Remote work tools are geared towards many-to-many collaborative activities. Whereas remote learning is primarily a one-to-many activity. Of course you have supporting TAs but still, it&#x27;s about a very small set of people dispensing information&#x2F;learning to a very large group students.<p>At the campus, the physical presence naturally fosters a whole range of interactions besides classroom learning, as you rightly pointed out. Replicating that is just impossible online.<p>Professional activities, however, is comparatively easier to replicate online, going by the evidence of how companies were able to go full remote just with a few day&#x27;s notice. Uber, for instance, went full with just one day&#x27;s notice. I was expecting a massive productivity drop. To my surprise, my team (I was a manager there) actually began shipping more features during full remote. Sure, it took ~2 weeks for us to find a rhythm but that&#x27;s to be expected.<p>All this to say, I completely agree with you w.r.t. online education. It&#x27;s been a shitshow. Education is so much more than just learning. But please don&#x27;t extend that argument to the professional life. From what I&#x27;ve seen, remote work is here to stay, at least I hope it does. People in India have been working from their home towns instead of being stuck in expensive and shitty urban jungles. It&#x27;ll spur the much needed growth of tier-2&#x2F;3 cities in India.')
