Do you call almond milk &quot;almond-flavoured water&quot;?<p>There&#x27;s a reason people use existing &quot;technically incorrect&quot; product names to refer to replacement products like this. It&#x27;s so people who are used to consuming the original products see the replacement as a replacement, on level footing with the original.<p>Almost no one is going to replace dairy milk with soy bean-flavoured water, and chicken patties with chicken-flavoured burgers. The latter sound like dodgy knock-offs and people don&#x27;t want to put that kind of thing in their bodies.<p>Also, &quot;chicken-flavored burger&quot; isn&#x27;t really accurate to what this is. It may be lab-grown, but it&#x27;s still meat. A &quot;chicken-flavored burger&quot; sounds like a vegetarian patty with chicken-like seasoning and flavours.')
