Item(by='makomk', descendants=None, kids=[25975026], score=None, time=1611959377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961137, text='Including similar language in their agreement would probably have made the EU&#x27;s already terrible case even worse anyway, since it would almost certainly have only covered AstraZeneca&#x27;s non-UK European facilities, and the whole problem seems to be that those can&#x27;t produce nearly enough vaccine to cover EU demand. Note that the current clause about the initial supply of doses only covers manufacturing them <i>within the EU</i>; the part about the EU including the UK explicitly does not apply to that clause. (Indeed, the only mention of UK manufacturing seems to be exempting it from a clause <i>banning</i> the use of non-EU manufacturing sites.)')
