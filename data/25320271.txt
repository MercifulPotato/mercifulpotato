Unless the token is sender constrained (via MTLS, DPOP or something similar), <i>anyone</i> who gets it can use it to access whatever resources it grants permission to.<p>While losing a client secret to an attacker is obviously worse, because it allows for repeated grant requests, losing an access token can be bad too.<p>So, be aware of both things when you are running in a client like a browser or mobile application which can&#x27;t be trusted to keep a secret. You can try to minimize the risk by using a HttpOnly cookie for the browser or secure storage (keychain, etc) on a mobile app, as well as keeping your token lifetimes short.<p>Disclosure: I work for an IDaaS provider.')
