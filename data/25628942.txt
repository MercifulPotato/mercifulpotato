There is NOTHING you need to do with Docker to build an MVP.... ever. Unless you’re building Docker and that’s already built.<p>Same with CI&#x2F;CD. If you have CI&#x2F;CD then you wasted time and money on something utterly unnecessary for an MVP.<p>And you’d have to work really really hard to convince me that ANY testing is required at all for your MVP.  NO TESTING ... just code.<p>When building an MVP stop flouncing around with your professional software development. Build the fucking thing and get it launched. Every singe dollar you waste on CICD Docker and testing sends you closer to the clock running out and failure.')
