Once done however, you&#x27;ll be left with a great operating system experience that you can just leave as-is.<p>I&#x27;ve kept one or another secondary Linux system on hand for most of the past 10 years; usually a VM or a dual-boot, usually Ubuntu (occasionally Fedora). What I&#x27;ve found is that each time I install an update - or more likely, install a new tool - there&#x27;s a chance it will be blocked by something or cause a problem with something else, and I&#x27;ll have to debug it for an hour or two before I can get back to what I was doing. So most of the time if I want to focus on a project I&#x27;ll just end up using a MacBook, or if I really want to use my desktop machine I&#x27;ll begrudgingly use Windows. I only use my Linux install when I really absolutely need to be on Linux (or when I really need to be on my desktop but also in a Unix environment). What I would like is for using Linux to be pleasant enough that I might reach for it as a default for some things. Thus far, that hasn&#x27;t been the case.<p>&gt; One last comment, there will always be certain things in the Linux ecosystem that will never work the same way as other OSes (the XFCE &quot;panels&quot; bar comes to mind), and no amount of tweaking will leave you completely satisfied<p>I&#x27;m not too worried about fine-tuning the user experience. I&#x27;m pretty flexible when it comes to that stuff. I just need things to work, consistently and without babysitting.')
