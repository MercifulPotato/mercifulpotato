The first is to join forces and act as one. The problem with this is that to do so one must give away some of their freedom (because they need to act as one).\nThe other option is to climb the ladder and become richer and therefore stronger. And that is why social mobility matters.<p>Wealth and power are intrinsically linked. You could try to just mind your own business and live your simple life, but it is not up to you. It is up to those stronger than you to let you live your simple life. Maybe you get lucky and maybe not.')
