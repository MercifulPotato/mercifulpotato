Labor intensiveness in mining insights from a dataset is worth way more than labor intensiveness in manual labelling.<p>I think we are lazily giving up our intellectual power to models hoping that they will just discover patterns by magic, where it is actually very worth to go through the data science process starting with labelling because we actually learn as humans. The thesis is that this will also make our DL models better in the long run. We would never have come up with cool algorithms if we just always outsourced this work to models.')
