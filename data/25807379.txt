Sorry to be late to the party. AMA.<p>Follow mnm! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnmnotmail" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mnmnotmail</a><p>To address some comments...<p>The protocol[1] has two layers, altho that&#x27;s not emphasized in the draft. The outer layer covers posting messages for recipients. The inner layer describes message contents, and isn&#x27;t enforced by the server (see protocol #7 Post &#x2F;&#x2F;datahead segment). You can do special-purpose apps with the outer layer without supporting the inner if you don&#x27;t send messages to normal clients.<p>EDIT: The protocol will see many more revisions (some already planned), and real-world use, before it&#x27;s proposed to a standards body.<p>This isn&#x27;t a drop-in&#x2F;swap-out replacement for email. It&#x27;s a (far) better way of doing electronic correspondence. It will take some years to build the community and infrastructure necessary for TMTP to widely supplant SMTP. It&#x27;s been suggested recently that I draft an architecture doc for TMTP[2], which will also discuss infrastructure.<p>Part of that infrastructure involves &quot;marketplace&quot; sites which verify members&#x27; real-life identities and let people make contact with folks outside their normal circles (e.g. work, school, community, hobbies&#x2F;interests). Most professional organizations would run marketplace sites for their members.<p>I gather that the IETF has (repeatedly) stated that it is not interested in adjusting SMTP to solve &quot;the spam problem&quot;. [3]<p>Re end-to-end encryption, that can be considered for the inner layer protocol. I don&#x27;t rule it out, but it&#x27;s not a priority at present.<p>If successful, &quot;mnm&quot; won&#x27;t be the only implementation of TMTP. Maybe some other client will have a better name. (OTOH, Slack did well, and that&#x27;s a pretty terrible name for a workplace tool ;-)<p>EDIT2: SMTP and related protocols have no effective defense against phishing. A large fraction of phishing attempts originate at authenticated domains, like Gmail.<p>---<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;networkimprov&#x2F;mnm&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Protocol.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;networkimprov&#x2F;mnm&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Protocol.md</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;networkimprov&#x2F;mnm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;networkimprov&#x2F;mnm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rhyolite.com&#x2F;anti-spam&#x2F;you-might-be.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rhyolite.com&#x2F;anti-spam&#x2F;you-might-be.html</a>')
