Agree “I’m making a $15mm investment I need you to cover my up to $100k in legal fees. If you can’t do that, deal off.” Has always sounded funny to me.<p>But if you need money it’s just one of those things you have to do.<p>I think what should happen is the whole syndicate should share in total legal fees pro-rata or something. That way the lead isn’t wearing all the legal fees.<p>Also think this is based some in the standard practice of banks passing through their legal fees to those they lend to.')
