The internet&#x27;s obsession with calling out this fallacy has sucked all the formal nuance out of its rhetorical usage.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t apply here, because the grandparent comment is not trying to refute PG&#x27;s argument, it&#x27;s mounting an entirely orthogonal one. So yes, I do agree it&#x27;s not directly discussing the content. But that&#x27;s also pretty characteristic of most HN threads.<p>People on HN usually talk about the ideas they have which are evoked by the article. They do not as a rule engage in formal refutation or advocation of the article&#x27;s core thesis, unless it&#x27;s very technical in nature.')
