Unlimited listens but with the twist of having a built in recommendation system based on user votes and reviews. While building I was beyond sure Amazon would be offering to buy me out within a year. The thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours I poured into the project seemed like an obviously good use of time and money.<p>My wife hated it. She wanted me to get a real job and after three years she moved out, to a new city so she could follow a job, a year later she asked for a divorce, I kept working on the project while looking for work. Now, two years later I&#x27;ve had to admit it was a failure and I threw away an absurd amount of time and money. Along the way positive feedback kept me going and I thought if I kept improving something would stick, it never did. But hey I learned a lot about PHP and the subtle are of SEO on my path to failure! My take away, don&#x27;t follow your dream, don&#x27;t do what you love, don&#x27;t build the products you want to see.')
