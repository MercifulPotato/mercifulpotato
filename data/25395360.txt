Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607745304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25394950, text='Well, Taibbi hasn&#x27;t mentioned Section 230; I see only two other comments mentioning it.  Also, I skimmed an article that says most people don&#x27;t understand Section 230 (or the context around itâ€”it provides immunity for certain things, and therefore you have to understand &quot;immunity from what?&quot;), so I would hesitate to say too much about it.  It&#x27;s entirely likely that there are some prominent partisans who claim to be in favor of free speech but don&#x27;t have a principled stance on the subject (e.g. think flag-burning should be illegal), or who are as ignorant as I am on section 230 <i>and</i> less averse to recklessly advocating for political measures they don&#x27;t understand.<p>At any rate, as I doubt you&#x27;ll be surprised to hear, I am also not in favor of business owners getting raided by the FBI because users uploaded illegal content.  That sounds like a mechanism for crushing small websites who can&#x27;t afford their own legal department, thereby protecting large websites against competition.')
