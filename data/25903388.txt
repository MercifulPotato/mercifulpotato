I suppose this reflects the underlying costs. Because of this move by Mastercard I can see Stripe and others change this soonish with the lower fee applying only to UK cards (for customers based in the UK). And then we&#x27;ll also have to see if the government keeps the cap for domestic transactions or decide to &quot;cut red tape&quot; and remove all restrictions.')
