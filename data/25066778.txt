Either physical or internal.<p>Original v1 Intel portable pro machines had a nasty kernel panic when connecting to Cisco APs in 2006. Since startups were starting to adopt Apple, this caused problems where I worked.<p>New keyboard key mechanisms a few years ago that Apple had to switch to something that wasn’t prone to fail as often.<p>I’m sure these first few v1 of Apple devices adopting M1 will have limitations that are dealbreakers for existing customers. I recommend holding out for M2 (or whatever their numbering scheme is) before they determine fixes for what customers want. Besides, I expect a ton of hardware gotchas will be posted on Twitter and blogs after these M1 devices hit consumer and business hands. Then there’s something new to talk about with Apple.')
