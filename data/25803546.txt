The issue ended up being a router power cycle which occurred at the same time every single day. It took several days to diagnose. First, during an outage I tried to login to my router. Just because the internet was down the local area network should have been up. I couldn’t access the admin panel for several minutes. Next, I started observing the lighting patterns on the router. I came to realize that it appeared to be restating itself for no good reason. In the end my internet provider replaced the router which fixed the problem. Tech support was pretty stumped. A few people on the internet complained about the same issue with the Fios router model I had (don’t remember which one it was). Good luck! Let us know what the problem was if you figure it out.')
