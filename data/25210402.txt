If the number of Electoral College votes each state got were proportional to that state&#x27;s cumulative per capita COVID infection rates, the result would have been 329 Trump, 209 Biden.<p>However, if we go by cumulative per capita COVID deaths, then the result would have been 228 Trump, 310 Biden.<p>Why the big swing? I think it is because the big early outbreaks that swept through retirement and nursing homes before we got better at treating it were in big urban areas. By the time it got big in rural areas, we&#x27;d gotten a lot better at dealing with it.<p>It would be interesting to do a similar calculation, but using say the rates over say the last three months instead of cumulative from the start. If someone wants to do that one, a good place to get the COVID data is here [1]. They have links to download the data for all the graphs as CSV files.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;91-divoc.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;covid-visualization&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;91-divoc.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;covid-visualization&#x2F;</a>')
