None of these are examples of exercising of freedoms that don&#x27;t affect the freedom of others.<p>Take for example the freedom to move about freely in nature without having to worry about property lines. This most definitely affects the property rights of others and their freedom to do as they wish with their property. I&#x27;m not saying that your freedom of movement shouldn&#x27;t out rank their property rights and the freedom to do as they will with their own property but it certainly impacts their freedoms.')
