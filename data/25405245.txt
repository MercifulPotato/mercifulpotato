The term &quot;vandalism&quot; has its origins on how the Vandals tribe attacked, invaded and sacked Rome, and it refers to violence which results in widespread property damage.<p>You&#x27;d be hard pressed to describe 5th century barbarian invasion with words other than violence.<p>And by the way, car crashes are also described as violent even when no harm comes to anyone involved.')
