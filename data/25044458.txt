It&#x27;s almost always easier to for example use for example the state monad than writing it with mutation. This is probably quite subjective and it depends what you are used to.<p>For me, I make an exception for tests. E.g. when I mock my key-value database with an in-memory map, I choose a mutable map. But I know that some people prefer FP style even  for tests.')
