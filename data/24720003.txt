Circa 2020, some mainstream positions in a west coast city that is politically 85% leftwing:<p>* Cannabis already legalized. Driving kids to school past huge &quot;Amazing Cannabis&quot; posters all over the city.<p>* De facto policy to not interfere with the ever growing mass of homeless addicts in the streets.<p>Next steps:<p>* Legalize all drugs.<p>* State sponsored &quot;safe&quot; injection sites.<p>* Abolish the police.<p>The only stretch is &quot;in schools&quot;. There is a palpable sense of a loss of any and all moral barriers. Worse, erst shunned behaviors must be promoted, if only to spite the other side. In the wake of sexual liberation we got free condom dispensers in schools. Not much of a stretch to imagine that drug liberation, the next Chesterton fence to tear down, will bring free drug dispensers. Teach abstinence? Pshaw, that&#x27;ll never work. Addiction therapy? That&#x27;s evil, man.')
