You can grow an apple seed, too, though that apple seed isn&#x27;t likely to grow the same apple. You might get something out of an onion, though it is hard to grow a garden full of them without some work gathering seeds and so on.<p>You an patent certain types of apples, though, and the trees (though not so much what comes from seeds): Eating apples are generally clones. Getting a nice, sweet apple is a lucky thing - Johnny appleseed was realistically spreading cider apples and&#x2F;or what we would call a crabapple now. In addition, many purchased apple trees are grafted onto different roots to make them more robust.<p>Similar thing with cinnamon. I&#x27;ve never seen <i>fresh</i> cinnamon bark for sale in a spice isle, just like I&#x27;ve never seen an apple branch for sale. Nor rootstock that wasn&#x27;t an edible plant. Cinnamon bark is, at best, sold dried - and depending on the variety, it isn&#x27;t even the entire bark, but just the inner layer. This isn&#x27;t really what folks use to cultivate cinnamon, by the way [1], and i&#x27;m guessing that a lot of cinnamon patents are more geared towards extracting oils and drying&#x2F;harvest methods.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cinnamon#Cultivation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cinnamon#Cultivation</a>')
