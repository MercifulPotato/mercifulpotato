Software development is nothing but a huge heap of trade-offs based on limitation of all kinds. Money, time, quality, re usability, maintainability, and many more. I&#x27;m ready to bet there is no other job out there that is as complex and bound by so many parameters than software development. Maybe hardware development but I put them into the same category personally.<p>&gt;No pesky laws of physics.<p>Try low level programming or high performance software. Your worldview will change very quickly. Not everything is fluffy javascript ;)<p>&gt;No enforced values by one or another interest group.<p>I&#x27;m at a loss of words. Software is what makes the modern world move. You literally cannot avoid interest groups that want to influence you once you have a popular software that is used by millions.<p>Sure you can write some hobby projects and avoid all of the above mentioned, but once you do something with impact that is used extensively to help people (something everyone should strive for!), all of those issues WILL come to haunt you. No exception!')
