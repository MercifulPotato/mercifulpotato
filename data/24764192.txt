Knowing <i>where</i> the noise signal has been disruptive turns out to not change that capacity. (Although, again there is a 2nd order effect - if you can tell where and how the noise had been disruptive, you can considerably simplify the design of the transmitter and the receiver - but not increase the capacity).<p>It&#x27;s the difference between accidental and inherent complexity. I&#x27;m not saying that people&#x27;s inattention is inherent -- it <i>can</i> be changed; however, given a level of inattention which is likely the inherent cause of accidents, high visibility clothing will possibly change the distribution of accidents over road kinds and time-of-day, but not their overall numbers.')
