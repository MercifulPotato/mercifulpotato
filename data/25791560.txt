Also agree with the pitch that the currently popular approach of simply moving everything to the client has made tooling incredibly complex (although it&#x27;s getting better). It&#x27;s great to see new tools like this being built.<p>Moving everything to the server instead also closes the gap, but the obvious problem is that this introduces a lot of latency for UI interactions. Ajax page loads&#x2F;Turbolinks works so well because it actually makes things faster with almost zero effort. Introducing a similar method for every UI interaction though is a different matter, and I don&#x27;t see how the latency won&#x27;t be noticeable.<p>For instance, The TodoMVC example&#x27;s server seems to be far enough way from my location that creating a task has noticeable lag. Sure it&#x27;s just an example, but without introducing some client-side&#x2F;optimistic rendering, that&#x27;s going to be hard to avoid (and that would defeat the purpose of having all your logic in one place, on the server). Not sure how this is addressed here?')
