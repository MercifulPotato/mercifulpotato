Item(by='marckohlbrugge', descendants=None, kids=[25379541], score=None, time=1607634750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25377696, text='BetaList ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betalist.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betalist.com</a> ) turned 10 years old today. For the majority of time it was run by just me, generating $100k&#x2F;year in revenue on average (earlier years less, later years more). I’ve now delegated all the daily operations to a contractor who spends a few hours a day to keep things going. So technically it’s two people right now, but less than half a FTE total.')
