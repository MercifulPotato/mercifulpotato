But it&#x27;s interesting that tools like Hasura &amp; Prisma, which do exactly this, have attracted criticism for precisely that reason: coupling of the view model to the persistence model. Each approach is a tradeoff. Coupling the two is extremely efficient, but I don&#x27;t think database-driven-design is often a great way of modelling complex domains.')
