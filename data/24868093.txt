You certainly have to hit less captchas with VPNs than with Tor ...<p>There are also quite a few VPN&#x2F;VPS providers accepting Monero that can be used and paid for &quot;anonymously&quot; for adding more layers.<p>If you live in a large city with a decent view on places offering free legal public wifi, you could also buy a long range Wifi Directionnal Antenna and USB Wifi adapter to add such layer while remaining at home and avoid having to move to such places. Mac address randomization is trivial and integrated in most OSes now. Again it&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s an added &quot;convenient&quot; layer not requiring physical moving.')
