Not all attempts had a sound basis and I don’t defend them.  I do say the good of the total if 20th century experimental surgeries far outweighs the bad.  Importantly, we are able to learn from our mistakes quickly.  It took centuries to stop using the breaking wheel.  It took less than a lifetime to stop lobotomies.<p>I’m struggling to understand your point though.  Do doctors still practice lobotomies and refuse to wash hands, or have they cast aside their tribalism and make decisions based on science?')
