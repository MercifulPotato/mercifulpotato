The Belfast agreement (ending the troubles so far) was signed in 1998.<p>&gt;requires very strong support from a very sizeable minority (e.g South Africa, Northern Ireland)<p>Please see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demography_of_Northern_Ireland" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demography_of_Northern_Ireland</a>.<p>You will note that Northern Ireland has a plurality of Protestants (48%) compared to a sizable Catholic community (45%). The <i>majority</i> of people in Northern Ireland do not support a united Ireland <i>up to this point</i>. At some point in the future that may change and a referendum for reunification may be held (if the Irish government agrees). And, note, it is not at all for sure that the Irish government <i>would</i> agree because Northern Ireland is a cats cradle of trouble and problem - demographically, economically, politically and in terms of civil order. I think only with very significant backing from the EU could Ireland contemplate taking it on.<p>Currently the UK (read England, because the Welsh and Scots are also net recipients of significant monies from England) subsidizes every subject in Northern Ireland to the tune of $7k per year, if that is &quot;crapping all over Ireland&quot; frankly I&#x27;d like a bag of that shit please.<p>And frankly there is peace in Ireland now because the IRA lost, it lost support in it&#x27;s communities and it lost interest in freedom fighting because one element of it realized that a political solution had been available for at least 10 years, and one element realised it was far more interested in trading drugs and protection.<p>Anyway : please do some research and reading and don&#x27;t use straight falsehoods to support an otherwise reasonable argument. Perhaps traveling to Ireland would be a good start.')
