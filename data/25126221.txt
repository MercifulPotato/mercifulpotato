Equivalently, a principal homogeneous space for a group G is a non-empty set X on which G acts freely and transitively (meaning that, for any x, y in X, there exists a unique g in G such that x·g = y, where · denotes the (right) action of G on X). An analogous definition holds in other categories, where, for example, </i><p>Really, all you have to do is read the article carefully and follow the links to unknown terminology if you can&#x27;t immediately intuit its meaning.
