As you increase your radius (length of the wind turbine rotor) it grows exponentially due to it being squared.<p>The consistency of the wind offshore, plus the higher speeds, is what is driving offshore due to the Velocity of the wind contributing to the power output being cubed.<p>Also see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmpa.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;Swept-Area-Provided-by-Kid-Wind-PDF.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmpa.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;Swept-Area-Provi...</a><p>Some turbines do not use a gearbox, so replace that with the efficiencies of magnetic gearboxes also called &quot;direct drive&quot; turbines.<p>There are some other advantages to wind power as well compared to gas power, such as being able to respond more quickly to grid power dynamics such as voltage droop and frequency response.<p>Regardless even if some of the power is being thrown away because the grid doesn&#x27;t need it, the fuel is at zero cost. It does bring up interesting maintenance and other questions. As far as I understand, you can have the wind turbine locked to prevent spinning and do that for say 50% of the wind park. So that should prevent the excessive wear and tear on the electrical components, and minimize things like loads on the foundation and structure itself.')
