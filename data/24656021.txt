This meant, in turn, that there were only a limited number of orientations that they could render for the ship, in this case intervals of 5 degrees.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is a mistake, but it&#x27;s strange to talk of pixels, because this game uses a vector monitor, not a bitmapped display. There are no pixels really. The 5 degree rotational step may have been due to some other limitation, perhaps of integer arithmetic, or limited storage space for a pre-calculated look up table, or using an 8 bit variable?')
