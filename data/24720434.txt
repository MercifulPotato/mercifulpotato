One day I received an email from Microsoft saying that they were disabling MSN (I&#x27;m telling this from memory, forgive me if I&#x27;m saying anything super wrong).<p>Fast forward to me being in college and studying a little bit of pentest. As I recall I was trying to see how much information a could gather from a person by their facebook page (as a non friend). If you try to login using their ID (or username) you could find pieces of cellphone number and emails. So I tried this with a profile from some girl I had a crush back in the day and discovered that shed used MSN as email.<p>Eventually I tried to log in her email on MSN and found out it has been disabled for a while. So I tried to recreate the email account with me as the owner and for my surprise it worked. I then went back to facebook and recover &quot;my&quot; password. With the email and password, facebook didn&#x27;t let me login because of my location. But I knew where this girl lives, so I found a proxy server [1] and bam, I was in.<p>Not going to lie, I did look at some of her messages and pictures, but felt very bad after and decided to tell facebook and microsoft about it. This was facebook&#x27;s response [2]. After a day or two of getting no answers from both companies (before I got the answer from facebook), I told the story to about 2 or 3 tech reporters. They told me they wrote to microsoft asking for a comment, but never got any answer. A week later I tried to recreate another &quot;dead&quot; account on hotmail and I couldn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t remember exactly what they did, but I just couldn&#x27;t create the email, so I figure they has fixed it.<p>1 - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;free-proxy.cz&#x2F;en&#x2F;proxylist&#x2F;country&#x2F;BR&#x2F;all&#x2F;ping&#x2F;all" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;free-proxy.cz&#x2F;en&#x2F;proxylist&#x2F;country&#x2F;BR&#x2F;all&#x2F;ping&#x2F;all</a>\n2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;kFMlO6d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;kFMlO6d</a>')
