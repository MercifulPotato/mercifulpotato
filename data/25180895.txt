The iPad is versatile and hard to beat. I&#x27;m curious what app people use to read PDFs? Goodreader seems really dated, so I just use the Apple Books app currently. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t allow you to have more than one paper&#x2F;book open at once.<p>Also, I know the OP said they don&#x27;t like printing papers out, but if you do, get a Brother laser printer. Text and graphics are much clearer on a laser printer vs. an inkjet.<p>I bought a higher-end (Epson EcoTank ET-2750) inkjet to replace a 10 year old Brother laser printer (OfficeDepot display model to boot) I got on sale. The laser printer was better in every way â€“ I should have just replaced some parts and kept it going.')
