Phase 1 can fail because of lack of immune response OR safety concerns. Phase 2 and 3 trials are also about safety, and both of them somewhat often fail because of safety issues.<p>A vaccine can make a disease worse by priming the immune system to overreact and attack the entire body when a single cell is infected.<p>The more we know about a vaccine the more confident we are.  The flu vaccine is changed every year without long safety studies: we have learned enough about how people response to the flu vaccines in use to not need them anymore. When the same process is used to make a non-flu vaccine though we still have to start over because there isn&#x27;t any way to be sure.<p>You are quickly getting beyond my area of knowledge though. I didn&#x27;t answer all of your questions because I don&#x27;t know.')
