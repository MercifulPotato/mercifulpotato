I know dozens of outstanding mathematicians and physicists who are very well known in their respective fields and reside at less-than-well-known institutions. (Often, because their family is from there and they took the chance to go back.)<p>Generally speaking, in Central and Western Europe it doesn&#x27;t matter which institution a researcher is from. They&#x27;re all good and those at top-tier institutions are only marginally better at best.')
