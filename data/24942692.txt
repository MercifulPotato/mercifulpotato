I had the same problem with an Hitachi embedded processor. Except our application was hard real-time (controlling the fuel injector of a Ford 150 that was modified to run on natural gas).<p>We ended-up splitting the division code over multiple loops of the core system so that it would not exceed the allotted time when the engine was running at maximum RPM. It meant that the value that required division would only update at something like 1&#x2F;6th of the data acquisition speed of all other values, but hey, it worked.<p>Maybe I still have the source code on some floppy disk somewhere...<p>Edit: I remembered wrong, it was a GMC truck: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sae.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;technical-papers&#x2F;content&#x2F;922387&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sae.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;technical-papers&#x2F;content&#x2F;92...</a><p>Edit #2: found a picture of our truck: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;live.staticflickr.com&#x2F;8487&#x2F;8186513796_bd60fd3fd2_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;live.staticflickr.com&#x2F;8487&#x2F;8186513796_bd60fd3fd2_b.j...</a>')
