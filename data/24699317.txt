How do you improve it?<p>I&#x27;m an outside consultant and I&#x27;m often called to fix stuff that other outside consultants built. Pretty much 100% of the time, I am there because somebody was lacking in attention to detail. Whether it is a misplaced semicolon or a 100mbit interface in a virtual switch or some doodad doing a TCP handshake in the wrong order, I think over half of the &#x27;edge cases&#x27; that make it to me are because somebody did not cross their Is and dot their Ts.<p>I think that good attention to detail is essential not just in programming or systems, but every technical profession.')
