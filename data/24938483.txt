But you don’t need it, you just <i>want</i> it.<p>Blaming global money is the easy thing to do, but I don’t think there’s compelling data that supports this. Sure, it has had an effect, but Canadians themselves hold a large share of responsibility for the market today. This is why the empty homes and foreign buyers haven’t really done anything — they are just populist measures. If you really want to have an impact, fight local speculation too.<p>Regarding the middle class wealth accumulation, Canada is in for a world of hurt when the bubble bursts. A shocking proportion (1&#x2F;3) of Canadians nearing retirement have no assets outside their primary residence, and their <i>plan</i> is to use reverse mortgages or downsizing to fund their retirement. This is because so many Canadians live at the edge of what they can afford, commonly known as “house poor”, which is the phenomenon driving a lot of local prices.<p>What is happening now is a massive intergenerational transfer of wealth from the younger generation to the older generation. When the bubble deflates, everyone who sold their house is making bank, and young people who were desperate to have a piece of dirt are the ones who will be holding the bag.<p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t own a house if you need it and can afford it, but the idea of a home as a “wealth generation” device will not age well in Canada.')
