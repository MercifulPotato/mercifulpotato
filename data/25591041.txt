Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=[25591171], score=None, time=1609406540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25588870, text='&gt; There&#x27;s also the option to reduce speed as much as possible, aka break hard, that a computer can do a) earlier than a human would b) much harder than a human would.<p>a) A computer can initiate braking a small fraction of a second faster than a human, which is great but not such a huge difference in braking distance.<p>b) A computer cannot brake any harder than a human, certainly not &quot;much harder&quot;. The max deceleration rate is traction-limited, which any remotely modern car (last ~25 years) can easily sustain with an untrained driver thanks to modern ABS.<p>(As a side hobby I instruct in car control and accident avoidance clinics. Blindly braking hard is not often the best answer.)')
