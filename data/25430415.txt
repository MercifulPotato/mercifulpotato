Proton had been out but I didnt need to change. Then I started getting BSODs far too often. Reinstalling windows didnt fix the bsods. Didnt seem to be hardware. I decided screw it and go linux. Never had any crashing after that. I had to give up a couple games that still didnt work with proton.<p>Then I had a daughter and LOL time for gaming? LOL')
