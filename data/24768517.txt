Or, more quantitatively, the Joyo Kanji has 364 simplified characters out of 2,136 (~17%) [1] while the mainland China simplified probably about 2,000 out of 7,000 common characters (~28%) [2]. This divergence is not the biggest deal, but still big enough to refute the claim that Japanese is easier to learn because it&#x27;s &quot;non-simplified&quot; (there may be other valid reasons though).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shinjitai#Simplifications_in_J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_Kanji_and_Jinmeiy%C5%8D_Kanji" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shinjitai#Simplifications_in_J...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Simplified_Chinese_characters#Method_of_simplification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Simplified_Chinese_characters#...</a>')
