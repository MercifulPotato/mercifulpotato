However, compared to tmux it also lacks the capability to be used via ssh. At the end of the day there are not really comparable but yeah, I prefer to work with tmux+nvim on a *nix environment through ssh, all wrapped in a typical window manager such as Windows which handles stuff like hidpi, meta window management, device management etc. The good thing is that I am not stuck with Windows. You can give me any meta&#x2F;desktop OS&#x2F;window management such as any Linux wm or macos as long as I have tmux and nvim, my productivity will stay the same.<p>FWIW, while automatic tiling with i3 is super impressive, it&#x27;s overrated. In the beginning you believe that this really boosts your productivity but you get quickly annoyed. If tmux is set-up right, so not just this seamless navigation but also creating and resizing of panes in a similar fashion with intuitive binds you wouldn&#x27;t want any automatic tiling anymore. With my binds I am able to open and resize dozen of panes faster than I ever could with i3. And as a bonus tmux&#x27; config is just simple some remapping but never a rabbit hole to get basic things working.')
