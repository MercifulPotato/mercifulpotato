You could be shut down tomorrow with no recourse. So you still have to do all your own backups and continuity of operations planning across different providers or in-house. To me this really calls into question the entire value proposition, since if you want to be safe you need to have the ability to redeploy your entire business on another provider at a moment&#x27;s notice.')
