Given that the semantics of at-most-once and at-least-once apply to processing and delivery, I personally don’t think the goalposts should move on exactly once.<p>Systems claiming exactly-once lull developers into not planning for multiple deliveries on the subscriber, or the need to do multiple publishes, both of which can still happen.')
