Some of them are giving patients 30 or more lozenges at a time, with the expectation that they&#x27;ll use them once or twice a week.<p>Of course, some patients take multiple doses at once. Browsing subreddits on the topic shows plenty of stories of people escalating their doses or asking for strategies to convince their doctors to prescribe more.<p>Unfortunately, I think it&#x27;s going to get worse before it gets better. Too many unscrupulous doctors are realizing the profit potential for dispensing Ketamine prescriptions in exchange for $300, 20-minute telehealth visits.')
