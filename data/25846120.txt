One where the caller is forced to address it by the compiler, and one that is transparent to the caller, but can be caught and addressed by anyone in the call stack (probably the top level)?<p>And one could convert one type of failure to the other. So if you call a library function and it returns the force-you-to-address kind of error, we could determine that we can&#x27;t actually handle it at the call site, and just convert it to the invisible kind and let it keep going up.<p>The force-you-to-address it kind is enforced by the compiler. The compiler forces you to <i>check</i> if the function fails. A &quot;checked failure&quot;? &quot;Checked error&quot;? Hmm.')
