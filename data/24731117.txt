You can visit as a nonimmigrant according to the same visa requirements and procedures as someone else from your own country.<p>If you want to become a citizen again, you will first have to find a way to get an immigrant visa or come on a dual-intent route like H1-B. Then live here for five years and apply to naturalize same as anyone else. The good news is even if you moved to a country like China or India with extra wait times for visas, it won&#x27;t affect you since you were not born there.<p>There are a few statues that disqualify renouncees from certain benefits such as owning a gun, IDK if you can ever get those back.')
