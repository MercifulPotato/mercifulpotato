Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=[24974099], score=None, time=1604345352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971278, text='My experience - from doing devops consulting and moving clients off AWS every chance I get - is that it&#x27;s bad business for devops consultants to move clients off AWS in terms of short term billable hours, because clients spent more money on me when they&#x27;re on AWS. If I was after maximising billable hours in the short term, then I&#x27;d recommend AWS all the time...<p>As such a lot of devops consultants certainly have all the wrong incentives to recommend it, and these days most of them also lack experience of how to price out alternatives.<p>E.g. a typical beginners mistake is to think you&#x27;d price out a one-to-one match of servers between AWS and an alternative, but one of the benefits of picking other options is that you&#x27;re able to look at your app and design a setup that fits  your needs better. Network latency matters. Ability to add enough RAM to fit your database working set in RAM if at all possible matters. And so on. With AWS this is often <i>possible</i> but often at the cost of scaling out <i>other things too</i> that you don&#x27;t need.<p>And most developers won&#x27;t <i>do it</i> if you don&#x27;t give them budget responsibility and make them justify the cost and then <i>cut their budget</i>.<p>Development teams used to AWS tends to spin up instance after instance instead of actually measuring and figuring out why they&#x27;re running into limits to keep costs down. Giving dev teams control over infra without having someone with extensive operations experience is an absolute disaster if you want to manage costs.<p>I work for a VC now. When I evaluate the tech teams of people who apply to us, it&#x27;s perfectly fine if they use AWS, but it&#x27;s a <i>massive red flag to me</i> if they don&#x27;t understand the costs and the costs of alternatives. Usually the ones who do know they&#x27;re paying for speed and convenience, and have thoughts on how to cut costs by moving parts or all of their services off AWS as they scale, <i>or</i> they have a rationale for why their hosting is never going to be a big part of their overall cost base.<p>The only case where AWS is cost effective is if you get big enough to negotiate <i>really</i> hefty discounts. It&#x27;s possible - I&#x27;ve heard examples.<p>But if you&#x27;re paying AWS list prices, chances are sooner or later you&#x27;ll come across  a competitor that isn&#x27;t.')
