Before doing so, I tracked all informations I could about my surgeon.<p>Everyone had good comments, good healing, very impressive track record, etc.<p>Everyone but one patient. She complained on how her surgery was rushed, how quick she was out of the operating theater, how she is scarred from it, etc.<p>At first, I thought she was lying. Why was she such an outlier?<p>I asked her for more details. It turns out her surgery was in the afternoon of the last friday before the Christmas holidays.<p>After knowing this, I made sure to schedule in during the middle of the week aways from holidays. My surgery went well.<p>I am glad to finally have statistics on this gut feeling I had. 23% is a LOT, and the 30% for the holidays is even worst. I had made a mental note to avoid those days, now it&#x27;s become a rule.')
