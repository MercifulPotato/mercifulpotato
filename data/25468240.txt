I wish something like this had been available back in the late 90s when I was getting my CS degree from Oregon State.  I pulled it off in a couple years by taking a heavy load and working through summers, I&#x27;d have been ecstatic to find a fully self-paced program.<p>I also think the idea of capping it off with OMSCS is a great idea.  I did that myself but 20 years later.  And mostly just for entertainment rather than boosting my career.')
