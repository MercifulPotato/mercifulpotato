It may be true but it isn&#x27;t fair, and to me, the proper response is to have an absolute zero tolerance policy on this sort of thing. If you are harassing women or really anybody at your workplace you should be fired, and the employer should make it extremely clear that that is their policy. I don&#x27;t think you should exclude someone from the hiring pool because they have a background in the job they want to do.')
