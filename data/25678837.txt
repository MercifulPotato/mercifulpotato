There are many devices with hardware decoders that work great for watching a TV show, but if you&#x27;re using video for interactive assets as games do, you probably have latency targets to hit, you might want seek-through performance, you may want transparencies, and so on. And RAD has long had a lock on really supporting the platforms game devs are using, so if you use their stack instead of bodging together a video solution, you&#x27;re saving time overall.')
