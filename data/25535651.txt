When someone unsubscribes from your mailing list, delete their email address from your database.  Don&#x27;t retain it marked &quot;inactive&quot; or &quot;unsubscribed&quot; so that you can accidentally or on purpose start emailing them again later.  Really delete it, so that you no longer have it and CAN&#x27;T make that error.')
