We know sitting on your desk for long periods isn&#x27;t good.<p>Most people in developed countries and emerging developing countries are increasingly not doing any physically repetitive tasks. Those are automated and for a good reason, eg - RSI.<p>School architecture needs complete reform. Teaching guidelines significant changes. It may not be for making kids more creative but incorporating what we already have in our daily life outside of school.<p>Eg - I don&#x27;t sit on my computer desk continuously for longer than 45 mins without taking a small walk.')
