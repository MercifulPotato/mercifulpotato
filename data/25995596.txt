If Person A borrows a share from Person C, they can sell that one share only. To sell more without borrowing additional shares would be naked shorting, which is prohibited.<p>You might be asking instead about the following scenario, though, where a single share is borrowed and sold short multiple times:<p>Person A borrows from Person C and sells to Person B<p>Person D borrows from Person B and sells it to Person E<p>Well, the covering of the shorts doesn&#x27;t have to happen in an atomic transaction; there are thousands to millions of trades of a single ticker every day. Just as a single share can create a chain of multiple shorts (borrows and sales), a single share can cover multiple shorts too through a chain of trades.')
