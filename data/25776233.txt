As such, I don&#x27;t just want to know the <i>net</i> negative effect, I also want to know the distribution. AFAIK weed can agitate certain mental conditions - the average joe can enjoy weed, just the expense of a minority losing their mind. I might not find that acceptable.<p>There&#x27;s also an argument that society should seek to decrease chemical over-indulgence in general, including alcohol, and maybe fat&#x2F;sugar too; legalising another drug just increases the battlefront perimeter.')
