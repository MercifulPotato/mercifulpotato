Although it&#x27;s disappointing to see this skepticism as the top and longest lived comment.</i><p><i>Under Methods:</i><p><i>Photocatalytic reactions</i><p><i>Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in an overhead-irradiation-type glass vessel connected to a closed gas circulation system. Prior to each reaction, all air was evacuated from the reaction system and filled with Ar (about 1 kPa unless otherwise noted). The suspension was subsequently irradiated using a Xe lamp (300 W, full arc). Evolved gases accumulated in the closed gas circulation system were analysed by gas chromatography (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co., thermal conductivity detector, Ar carrier gas, molecular sieve 5 Ã… column). The STH efficiency was measured under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM1.5G, 9 cm2 illuminated area, solar simulator HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Co.). The STH efficiency was determined according to the following equation</i><p><i>We can clearly see it is 1 atmosphere, and reasonably assume it&#x27;s &quot;ambient temperature&quot; plus 300 W Xe lamp irradiation. And it mentions nothing about &quot;sunlight&quot; but we can get consider the light spectra from the lamp.</i><p>It&#x27;s still very good, I grant you that. But i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as excellent as the original.<p>The reasons are i think it&#x27;s important to point out what good comments should do and to point out the damage done by laziness of making authoritative sounding comments that don&#x27;t accurately reflect and in fact misrepresent the subject of their commentary, and to accurately locate the comment in its proper context in this case and accurately describe what the comment is doing which is showing contempt.<p>I think these extra bits of information add to the accurate description of such types of comments, help people see the reasons why such comments are unhelpful to readers, are unworthy of their subject, and have no place on a serious forum. So i think the original is better suited to accomplish these various purposes than you edits.')
