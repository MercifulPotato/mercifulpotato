Group A attends school in person Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning. Then the rest of the week is online. Group B does the opposite. This seems like a good idea, not only for safety, but for balancing in person interaction and socialization with the flexibility of remote learning. I’m unsure if the classes are taught with both the in person and remote students “together” but that would be even better. It would also allow students that need to go to school full time in person or full time remote a robust infrastructure to do so, instead of an afterthought (like remote has been up until this year, if an option at all).')
