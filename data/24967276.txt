If they were to suddenly decide that all FastMail accounts should go to spam tomorrow, any users of FastMail would be SoLâ€”they would be unable to communicate with a huge majority of the internet.<p>They could decide to randomly throw every 5th email that is not a gmail into spam and blame it on other providers having low reliability. Make it random enough to gently encourage you to get a gmail account again.<p>These are extreme examples, but Google could easily do these kinds of things and there is nothing any of us could do whether we use Gmail or not; it will affect us because they control so much.')
