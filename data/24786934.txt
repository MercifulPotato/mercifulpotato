Specialization gone, most people were just doing subsistence agriculture.  Literacy plummeted to almost no one outside a very very few people in monasteries.<p>This whole religious adherence to party aligned mythology about everyday things (say, vaccines) is pervasive in the western world, and it is not some surface defect, it’s a rot that goes through to the core.<p>But things have been pretty nice as long as almost everybody has been alive so the belief that everything will continue to be fine is about all that holds things together.<p>People don’t appreciate how precarious civilization is.')
