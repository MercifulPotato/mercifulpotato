With modern tech employees, that adds up really, really fast. You need to spend it wisely.&quot;<p>This is so often missed I can&#x27;t believe it! My old boss had a weekly 1-2 hour &quot;all hands&quot; with about 10 people. Costing us 10-20 hours of work a week, basically a full employee&#x27;s worth. I can&#x27;t believe how horrible most bosses are about wasting their employee&#x27;s time. Do they just not teach this in MBA programs or something?')
