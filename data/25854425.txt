It&#x27;s a pretty critical piece in the &quot;new&quot; &#x27;as a service&#x27; world, helping folks use complex systems that they don&#x27;t control, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve been heavy in the data space, and get to do some fascinating work with folks, helping design data models, implement analysis, and other things in a wide variety of verticals. It&#x27;s support, so sometimes there&#x27;s some more tedious things too - there&#x27;s no avoiding that. :)<p>But, and perhaps I&#x27;m biased, it&#x27;s still a great career path, even if it&#x27;s not as flash as &quot;code all the time&quot; work.')
