A trivial example is C++ classes with private methods. Some people do a hack that when compiling for testing converts all private methods&#x2F;attributes to public. This way it&#x27;s easy to test private methods individually. Please don&#x27;t do this.<p>Unit testing C++ is not as easy as in some other languages. The language is fairly rigid. Some people make heavy use of friend classes to assist with testing, but this can be overdone (indeed, many C++ developers are against <i>any</i> use of friend).')
