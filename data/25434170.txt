(Public censorship schemes that incorporate movie ratings, and thus delegate to movie raters the role of public censor, are common.)<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not going to argue that censoring broadcast is ideal or valid, but I&#x27;m certainly less sympathetic to the plight of massive media companies than I am to millions of private citizens.<p>Censorship by a third party equally impacts the rights of the parties on both sides of a potential transaction; broadcast media censorship restricts the freedom of both massive media companies <i>and</i> millions of private citizens.')
