If they&#x27;d just focused on making a more performant, typed-Scheme (or improving one of the existing ones), that would be much more interesting for me.<p>I took a dip in to Julia recently, and found it to be a mishmash of Lisp, Haskell, Matlab and Fortran ideas, wrapped in Python-like syntax.<p>I guess that can be appealing for people coming from those worlds, and for those for whom speed trumps everything else.<p>For me the loss of a Lispy syntax and the price of working with a relatively immature language wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.  I&#x27;d just rather use something with reasonable performance that&#x27;s more Lispy.')
