Juniper is a library, not a framework. As such it is agnostic to how you want to solve N+1. You get a lookahead and can do what you want...dataloader (like Facebook), eager loading all data up front (like Rails), generating efficient SQL on the fly (like prisma).<p>There are projects and examples to do all three but we don&#x27;t want to assume one solution is right for all domains.<p>We take this to the extreme...Juniper doesn&#x27;t even require a web server and isn&#x27;t tied to a particular serialization format! Of course, we provide optional integrations with popular web frameworks using json but the key is they are optional.')
