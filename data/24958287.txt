Web has the advantage of already catering to literally every layout &amp; style use case (grid, multiple columns, floats, inline elements, etc. etc. etc.). But Flutter has the advantage of being designed from scratch so it can avoid all the idiotic mistakes the CSS made (e.g. box-sizing, the insane difficulty of centering things, etc.).<p>I don&#x27;t think it will take too long for the niceness of a sane design to outweigh the lack of features.<p>The only thing I&#x27;m not convinced about is that Flutter-web will ever be viable for most web pages (i.e. non-app ones).
