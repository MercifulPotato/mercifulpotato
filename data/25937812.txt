Ever since I tried it, I get insanely tired after a meal.  I had bouts of hypoglycemia as a kid, but that resolved until after trying IF.  Now my blood sugar regulation seems wonky. My fatigue is worse since then as well.  I&#x27;ve checked my glucose levels when the fatigue hits and they&#x27;re fine(&lt;120mg&#x2F;dL).  IF didn&#x27;t have an effect on my weight either.')
