When is the last time you’ve turned on the news and seen a balanced view given on Russia-U.S. relations?  In the last three years the New York Times hasn’t reported a single positive story on Russia or written an unbiased one that would present a counterviewpoint.  If we jump back two decades ago the American people were lead to believe that weapons of mass destruction were present in Afghanistan and Iraq and it was the cornerstone of the war initiative there.  The U.S. ended up violating not only international law and the sovereignty of the nations of Iraq and Afghanistan but killing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of innocent people there on a baseless claim.  Today we see the same propaganda being used against countries like Iran, Russia and China.  Countries in attempt to defend themselves from U.S. aggression are building nuclear arsenals and the world has become a much more dangerous place to live in as a result.  In my opinion this all goes back to freedom of the press, or lack of it.')
