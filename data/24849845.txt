Later estimates kept dropping, and are now at 0.39%.<p>Most viruses do not make the host sick, and the longer it&#x27;s been in humans, the more likely it is that this is so.  If the mortality rate is dropping (the article&#x27;s assertion), but the WHO says none of the existing treatments has been shown to work, then the simplest explanation is that the virus has evolved in that direction.  Given that the virus is very new in humans, there&#x27;s nothing surprising about that.')
