But no one is incentivized to do take action unilaterally.&quot;</i><p>This is something that needs to be fixed in future WiFi specifications and enforced via device certification. You&#x27;re lucky if a typical WiFi base station operator understands how to set channels, let alone adjust TX power levels.<p>People expect to be able to plug in a base station and have it &quot;just work&quot;, so coordinating with other nearby stations to optimize spectrum usage, minimize TX power, etc is something that needs to be automatic.')
