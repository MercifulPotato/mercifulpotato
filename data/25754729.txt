At first glance it has features I don&#x27;t need like adblocking (I use a DNS blocker on my router) and tabs, but it&#x27;s promising. I&#x27;ll give it another try, thanks.<p>I&#x27;ve also tried a few of these libwebkitgtk wrappers like qutebrowser, dwb, lariza, uzbl, etc. but they all had some drawbacks compared to surf.<p>And I can&#x27;t say I trust the Palemoon or Waterfox developers to maintain a Firefox fork. It&#x27;s a gargantuan job, which is why I prefer the relative simplicity of the WebKit wrappers. Ideally I&#x27;d like to switch to a simpler rendering engine as well, but sadly the modern web is built with WebKit compatibility in mind.')
