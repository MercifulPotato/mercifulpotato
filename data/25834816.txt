The latter would even be easier to implement - just slap a duty on <i>sales</i> as with alcohol and tobacco.<p>(Actually, that would be great, the defining characteristic would presumably be the presence of a tuner (or network in today&#x27;s age?), so it would create a market for television-like panels without tuners or consequently without being &#x27;smart&#x27;, I&#x27;d hope.)')
