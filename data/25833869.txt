Try to refrain from recommending &quot;patterns&quot; as something like &quot;building blocks&quot;. Go code design works better without &quot;patterns&quot;. Thinking and refactoring are encouraged.<p>Let&#x27;s say, here&#x27;s an <i>example</i>, explaining why the different components compose into good&#x2F;bad design, performance, whatever. Sometimes&#x2F;usually full idiomatic code makes sense, other times not. What&#x27;s idiomatic might change too.<p>There might be very valid or invalid reasons companies use internal patterns. They all tend to turn sour after commoditization. If a stable library fully encapsulates a separable need, might be good to use it.')
