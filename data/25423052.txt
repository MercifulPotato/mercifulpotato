Criticism is great as it allows mistakes and issues get resolved. I feel like the statement:<p>&gt;how dare you criticize our designers. This makes them feel unsafe at work<p>is absurd. No wonder google lags behind a large majority of tech companies in their design approach and UI. One of the reasons why Apple has skyrocketed past google in market cap(2.01T vs 1.19T) is they put the user first, make beautiful designs that are functional and hold their value well and have excellent customer service. Google has always held customer service and help as &quot;beneath them&quot;, its in their DNA and I don&#x27;t see that ever changing.')
