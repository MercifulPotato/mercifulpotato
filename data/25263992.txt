Almost, as boring as asking why people get stuck in traffic, when effectively there is only one highway in the region connecting two important points.<p>In this particular case, the incentives are as follows. Initially, facebook set up the game so that the condition of every agent, as well as the global equilibrium improved if people used facebook. Later on, facebook changed things around, so that the global equilibrium became suboptimal.')
