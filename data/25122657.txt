But the reason I made the comment is that like 90% of the post is “we need desktop apps and Swing sucks and let’s not use Electron” so I think regardless of what it says in the middle it really seems like it’s selling “use this to make your desktop app” rather than “this is a general-purpose graphics library”.')
