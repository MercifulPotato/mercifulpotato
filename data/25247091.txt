I remember really great third party Twitter clients as well, but there is only so much you can do if you are not a first party app. You are not going to be intimated of internal API changes. Limits can be imposed on your apps by the API provider. If I remember correctly there wasn&#x27;t a good Youtube first party client for a while as well.<p>&gt; But I really do miss some of the apps I had on my Lumia 920<p>Was it Lumia 920 itself that had the best camera of that gen?  It just feels sad that the Lumia family doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.<p>&gt; Now however, apps are made with their own design and not made for the OS they run on.<p>While great for third party devs, this really sucks. Everything felt as a part of the OS with the really fresh UI.<p>I didn&#x27;t end up publishing an app but really loved the developer tooling as well, it was very easy to write apps at that time compared to other platforms. Also, for gaming with things like XNA framework for games which a lot of indie devs were familiar with it would have been a great platform.')
