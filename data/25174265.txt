So I went for a more reasonable number that allows for fast loading everywhere but also some complexity. Another point raised was that not only the size should matter but also the amount of content. 200kb of pure text are probably more valuable than a single word shown with a 200kb webfont.<p>The page analysis and insertion are (semi-)automated. As currently visible on 1MB.club, the manual process is just not feasable. The pages are downloaded and analysed with Phantomas. They are also rechecked after a week.')
