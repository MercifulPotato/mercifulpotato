Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Google censoring one&#x27;s viewpoint at some point effectively become the equivalent of government censorship in its all-encompassing nature.<p>Forget computers. What if in 1950 every newspaper, every book publisher, every typewriter manufacturer, every mimeograph machine maker refuses to do business with you? Yes, you can still buy pen and paper, and no one is stopping you from putting up a modern 95 Theses on your front door.

But at some scale, Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Google are public forums as much as Hyde Park or Times Square, and those running those sites have the moral obligation to let the spirit of the First Amendment govern their actions as they moderate.')
