I do not recall the amount of RAM I had on my 486DX50 but whatever version of office it had at the time ran just fine. JavaScript was not even born by then.

I know it first hand as I was developing native and web and in browser applications since 94 even before JavaScript (I used Netscape&#x27;s server push functionality for that). When Java was released and until it matured to decent enough JIT it was the same slow resource hog (again know it first hand).')
