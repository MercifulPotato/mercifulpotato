Trying to learn C++ and Java before, having to type everything was an impedement. On python, you find out that types still matter when you try to add a string to an integer, for example. The moment the type matters to you is when you need to dig into those details. I&#x27;m not sure I would have the career I do if it hadn&#x27;t been around to be the one language that fit my 16-year old brain.')
