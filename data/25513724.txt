Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608690101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507493, text='&gt; It does take a little time to adjust to the honor code, but among all the things learned at WP, this one stuck with me the most. I (and many of my friends) came to literally hate lying&#x2F;cheating, and to disdain those who do. But there’s another route that is taken too — the opposite, where some cadets become very good at lying&#x2F;cheating.<p>Honest question: Don&#x27;t you think that is systemic within the Military itself and is one of the trademarks of its so called <i>culture</i>? Which is why the State will go the lengths it will when things are leaked and given how Assange and Snowden are treated when they prove Intelligence agencies lied (supposedly crimes punishable with long term sentences) to Congress and the US Citizens?<p>I come from a military family and the hypocrisy is suffocating, any time you even suggest what it really is (Empire) its like the scars from the kool-aid levels of indoctrination re-open and they leap to extremes about fictional forms of &#x27;terrorism&#x27; to rationalize their existence with even more lies.<p>I stopped talking about illegal interventionism by Imperial decree that violates the US Constitution (and their supposed sacred oath) long ago, as every conflict since WWII has not been declared by Congress. And most are Intelleence Agency led conflicts, that now last decades with no end in sigh based on lies to make private contractors incredibly wealthy. Let alone that that their is no (intentionally so) provision in the US Constitution for a standing Army (and defined limitations of conflicts) but only a domestic Navy to protect trade routes from pirates and states nothing about protecting &#x27;freedom&#x27; abroad all while the US systematically becomes more an more of a surveillance-police State with ever more eroded Civil Rights and Liberties that are only rivaled in scope by the CCP, which is now he US&#x27; supposed Enemy #1 after all the pro-China rhetoric from the Obama&#x2F;Biden administration years prior to now?<p>You say you hate lies, and talk about principals but how do you contend with this very blatant contradiction that is clear to anyone who cares enough to pay attention within it and not want to hurl yourself out of a building? In my lifetime alone, the US went from a place where people took massive risks just to have a chance to be to a place where its own Citizen&#x27;s will pay an exhorbarnt amount of money if they have it to leave because of this Imperial interventionism and the degrading quality of Life due to an over-inflated currency to finance these Corporate-led headlong excursions that lead no where but death and misery have made it not worth it.')
