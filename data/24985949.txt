I tend to prefer the command line for that kind of thing. Includes occasionally rsync-ing or scp-ing stuff to and from servers, and modding a few games I have on Android (Beamdog&#x27;s Enhanced Edition mobile ports of old CRPGs).<p>Secondary: Study programming - I am a self-taught programmer, and before the pandemic I would study a lot on public transit, in coffee shops, while waiting for people etc. This actually used to be the primary use case before I started working as a professional programmer and was also using breaks to study.
