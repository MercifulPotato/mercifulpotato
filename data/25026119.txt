And whoever didn&#x27;t show up, you&#x27;d have a decent chance of getting the vote in if you could approximate their signature.<p>In practice this doesn&#x27;t happen, I just assume because it&#x27;s easy to detect, it&#x27;s a felony that comes with a prison sentence (and a lot of people would be looking for you) and because it actually creates a lot of problems for whichever candidate receives the votes.<p>I think an alternate scenario, where ballots are sent to a lot of people with the voter&#x27;s name and address information &quot;helpfully&quot; prepopulated on the form, incorrectly, is perhaps slightly more of a threat. In this case people are at risk of casting a ballot that will be rejected and their board of elections might or might not notify them there&#x27;s a problem. Sending prepopulated ballots is illegal where I live because an organization trying to be helpful in this way could <i>inadvertently</i> disenfranchise people by mistake with a bad list, but there&#x27;s the other risk as well.<p>Again, easy to detect and a crime, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been a problem here.')
