Usually this means bigger caches or wider memory buses.<p>You can decode more instructions at the same time. In theory there is no limit to how many instructions you can decode at once.<p>Those decoded instructions end up in a buffer and execution units can process them if there are no data dependencies. You can add as many execution units as you like if there is enough work for them.<p>You can avoid performance destroying events like pipeline stalls by predicting the execution flow of instructions. Better branch prediction means less performance is lost.<p>None of these have anything to do with clock speed.')
