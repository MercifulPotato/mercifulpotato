And I use bluetooth headphones every day. The existence of either doesn&#x27;t make the other useless.<p>And I have used bluetooth headphones for over a decade, I find it hilarious that when apple suddenly had a offering that it suddenly became obsolete with cords.<p>It is impossible to overstate how much bluetooth sucks for temporary connections. I dare you, pair your device in my car. Or to play that song on a shared speaker setup. Just a quickie, see how well you do. Might work, might not. The outcome isn&#x27;t decided by you alone or what device you are pairing with - <i>guaranteed</i>.<p>The environmental impact alone should give one pause. As the batteries will go out and make the heaphones next to useless. Tech-savvy ones might replace them but that is hardly the norm. Yet my corded headphones are over a decade old sounds better than what apple is offering at a fraction of the price.<p>They do not have active noise cancellation though - and that is a killer feature! For some situations... Not in my home, where I use them. Because I have the option to do so.')
