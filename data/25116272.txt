They <i>did</i> have a product: Hotmail had the service built out, Eventbrite had the service built out, and there was a Dropbox before you could refer your friends to it. There are examples of what the author is claiming, but most are gimmicky Kickstarter-style (and often derivative) products.<p>I mean, think about Dropbox or Slack or Instagram: how could you possibly sell (or even validate the idea of) those products without actually giving some sort of demo? Without people actually <i>using</i> that thing? It might work for something like the product in the post (people understand what &quot;video chat&quot; is), but I don&#x27;t really see it working for any kind of particularly novel or value-generating product.<p>Followup: grabbed a coffee, and this post got a bit of attention. To be clear, I think that an MVP should be just that: a <i>minimum</i> viable product. By <i>definition</i>, you shouldn&#x27;t be able to go leaner. I also think that sometimes people conflate &quot;fake it &#x27;til you make it&quot; with PG&#x27;s &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; -- these two are <i>not</i> the same.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tommorkes.com&#x2F;lean-launch-how-to-sell-an-idea-before-you-build-it&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tommorkes.com&#x2F;lean-launch-how-to-sell-an-idea-before...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;sell-your-product-before-it-exists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;sell-your-product-before-it-exists</a>')
