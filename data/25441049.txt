Those are the devil (joking, sorta). My favorite tiling window managers in order of preference would probably be exwm (emacs wm) -&gt; stumpwm -&gt; ratpoison -&gt; i3.<p>These are manual tiling wms. So in exwm I can chose how to position and resize my windows any way I want. For example I can hit C-x 3 to split my screen in half vertically then C-x 2 to split one of the vertical splits horizontally. Now I have<p><pre><code>  +----------+-----------+\n  |          |           |\n  |          |           |\n  |          +-----------+\n  |          |           |\n  |          |           |\n  +----------+-----------+\n</code></pre>\nI can resize the vertical and horizontal splits, add or remove splits and cycle between the splits and the windows they display with regular emacs commands. The only thing you can&#x27;t do is have windows overlap so you can only see part of their contents. i3 comes last in my preferences because it adds a bit more friction to this with it&#x27;s concept of containers.<p>It seems to me like that covers 99% of use cases. I don&#x27;t see very much value in being able to only see some of a window when it is being overlapped. Especially when if I need to see only a few lines of a window it would only be a few keystrokes away. Maybe C-o 2 C-x 3 C-x - C-x b <i>window title</i> which looks crazy but if you are a heavy emacs user with ace-window and ivy mode it&#x27;s very natural.')
