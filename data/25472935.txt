That&#x27;s why I specifically called out the Intel Core CPU, not the Celeron. The Celeron N2840 is a &quot;Bay Trail&quot; Atom core, which nobody would willingly purchase. The state of the art CPU from that generation of Chromebooks was the 4th gen Core i3, a &quot;Haswell&quot; part that was more than twice as quick as that Celeron.')
