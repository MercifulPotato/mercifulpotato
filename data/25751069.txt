Item(by='ballenf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610475700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750373, text='&gt; humans have a hard time comprehending large numbers ... the difference between no one dying and one person dying is quite large, but the difference between the 100th and 101st death is far less impactful.<p>I think this data illustrates the exact opposite of what the researchers claim: people are actually pretty good at intuiting danger. A new danger that&#x27;s never been seen is worthy of attention in a way that the 101st death is not.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of studies about the ways humans fail at assessing risk, I just think the above is not one of them.<p>Also, news is just one type of item on everyone&#x27;s data feed that&#x27;s mixed with fake IG posts, fake news and dishonest ads. That approach makes as much sense as buying your groceries at the sewage treatment plant.')
