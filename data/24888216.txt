While it has some drawback (as any language) i find myself most productive when i&#x27;m writing in go.<p>Just this week i wrote an entire toolchain for developing with an embed device, that now i can distribute to anyone that need to work on that project.<p>Before go i used nodejs&#x2F;python due to the large ecosystem of library, but go nowadays has a similar ecosystem and allow me to build static executable without any dependency. That is super useful since i work with different OS (ubuntu, fedora, windows and macos). Also even sloppy&#x2F;draft code is really fast and i don&#x27;t need to start optimizing and profiling from the start like in python (i often process large dataset).<p>Lastly the language is very simple and my colleague who ,didn&#x27;t even know go, learned in a week and, most importantly, is able to navigate my large codebase without much help (that for me is the biggest advantage of go)')
