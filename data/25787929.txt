Holding certain views does not cancel out privileges one has, nor transform one from privileged to victim. This is especially true in privileges that one has less control over, such as physical and intellectual attributes, place of birth, wealth and opportunities like education and socialization, etc.<p>One may also act on those views believing they are helping society, while consensus in society views those actions as detrimental. A recent example of this is the rioters and insurrectionists at the Capitol believed they were doing something to help society, whereas society judged their actions otherwise.<p>A possible solution to this conundrum is to focus one&#x27;s participation on areas that are broadly agreed upon to be beneficial to society, so as to avoid accidentally becoming part of the problem, or simply minimize blowback from a disapproving environment.<p>This is a solution that is intentionally sidestepping any particular ethical framework, which may guide one&#x27;s actions toward different tradeoffs.<p>Another thing worth considering is not all participation in society need be political at all, nor attached to your real name, nor known to your employer. Those are conditions you&#x27;ve attached to your response that were not part of mine.')
