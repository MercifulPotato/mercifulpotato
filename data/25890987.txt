You really have to make an extraordinary effort, which I don&#x27;t experience back home and therefore I can&#x27;t be surprised to see it translates in these obesity statistics. To place that all on personal agency seems not very productive to me, back home there are efforts made that make easy and default options meet a minimum level of healthiness. I don&#x27;t see why Americans can&#x27;t do the same, and why you would want to count on billions of individual choices if you can solve with a (health) program. This kind of thinking made us into programmers, right?')
