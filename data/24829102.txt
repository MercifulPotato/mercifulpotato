It is legally complex to set these up in a fair way, but when you do everyone has incentive to ensure the long term health of the farm. It then becomes easy to tell the landlord he should invest in X - because the yields will go up over the long term. Likewise landlords have incentive to follow the latest research and push the tenant to adopt what makes sense. (sometimes this means you agree to watch an experiment done elsewhere- if it isn&#x27;t a good idea for your area someone else takes the loss)')
