Only technocrats and elites want more nuclear energy. Its not the will of the voting public. This is a defeat for the environment and democracy.<p>You could put all the nuclear waste the US has <i>ever</i> produced on one football field stacked 3 stories high.<p>Roughly 83,000 metric tons.<p>Meanwhile we produce over 50 million tons of electronic waste that is full of nasty heavy metals that can, and do, leech into the environment causing wide spread destruction, because instead of storing them in some sort of containment vessel we just dump them on whatever country will take a pittance payment.<p>Nuclear waste storage is a NIMBY problem, in terms of environmental pollutants you could probably find hog farms that churn out more waste.')
