I use Fedora, and do a clean install of Fedora every new release.  That&#x27;s often.  I try Wayland every time. And every time, I&#x27;m implementing several work arounds because things don&#x27;t work, and when I hit 5 work arounds (the magic number), I disable Wayland with a script I wrote, that kills it at multiple levels, it doesn&#x27;t even rear it&#x27;s ugly head in the gdm. Then it&#x27;s back to Xorg, and no more work arounds, everything works.  I support several thousand servers.  I only have so much time to dick around in Wayland.')
