That strategy worked for quite a while, but lately I&#x27;ve been frustrated by myself and all my coworkers getting hit with the keyboard issue, and one of them had a swollen battery. Lots of random crashes.<p>I&#x27;ve been slowly switching back to using a Lenovo ThinkCentre running Linux (which requires a lot less fiddling these days) and I&#x27;m really starting to like it. I just get shit done again. Oh, and I can install any software I want without having to go into settings to allow it...<p>Even on Mac I ran a Windows VM for some things, I now do that same thing on my Linux machine.')
