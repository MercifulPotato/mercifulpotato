Because their 10 nm process is still not really working, and they were working on multiple releases assuming the process would be there when the design was, they&#x27;re in a bad place.<p>From public statements, it seems like they&#x27;ve thought 10 nm was going to work soon for the whole time since 2018 that it&#x27;s been in limited production. And they haven&#x27;t really done substantial design work on the 14 nm processors (there&#x27;s some releases, but it&#x27;s mostly smashing more cores on there, and less architectural changes; afaik, coffe lake and comet lake don&#x27;t have much in the way of ipc gains vs kaby lake). Also, they clearly need a new naming person.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that they killed their atom for phones program wheb they did. Right around the time Microsoft announced continuum for windows mobile 10, which would have been much cooler if it was running on an x86 chip (and if Microsoft didn&#x27;t do a terrible job with Windows mobile 10 in general).')
