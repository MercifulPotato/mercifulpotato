He&#x27;s been the head of operations, making business decisions like closing down factories and outsourcing production, since his days at IBM. He is a supply chain wonk, which is why he got an MBA (supply chain management is a core part of business school teachings). This is also easily available information. Cook has been &quot;focused on business and profits&quot; for decades, and yet you act like he is an example of a great &quot;engineer&quot; in charge.')
