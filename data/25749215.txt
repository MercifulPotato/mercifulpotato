Again, instead of linking to pop-sci articles, and a JSTOR publication which does not actually bear on the present discussion, please consult an actual university library and go through the manuscript sources of editions of Greek and Latin writers to see how little a role the Muslim world has played in transmission of classical authors.<p>While you might be very proud that the Muslim world preserved (a very few) Greek and Latin sources that were also held by the Christian world, that is irrelevant to the discussion launched by the OP.')
