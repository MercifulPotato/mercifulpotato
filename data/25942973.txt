It seems like a community might allow the use of slurs as insults while also discouraging insults in general. In different words, &quot;Please be nice to each other. We don&#x27;t ban for the use of any particular words, but we do ban for disparaging others.&quot;<p>I could easily imagine a policy like this in, say, a linguistics forum, where it&#x27;s totally allowed to discuss the usage of slurs, as long as they&#x27;re not directed <i>at</i> someone.')
