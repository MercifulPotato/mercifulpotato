I really want to know how &quot;diversity&#x27; will help someone build a software company say a CRM app. How does a skin color&#x2F;race help with that? If ideas of a different race matter, why should they be employees and not found through user testing&#x2F;customer feedback? Coinbase, Google, keep it rolling.. No fully remote company has to go through this bullshit.')
