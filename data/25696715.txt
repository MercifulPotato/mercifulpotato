Perhaps you can think of a country that has advanced cyber capabilities, strong control over local platforms, and resentment of US global influence.<p>This MO of triggering national self-destruction becomes more obvious the more examples you see, such as the spreading of misinformation about 5G or vaccines&#x2F;masks, in order to radicalize citizens into destroying their own communications infrastructure and overwhelm their health services.')
