In fact, it&#x27;s barely grown at all. The type of job that has filled the gap is &quot;administrative&#x2F;clerical.&quot;<p>This observation has led David Graeber to propose that perhaps Keynes was essentially right, and that the only reason we don&#x27;t have the shorter work week is basically that we refuse to let it happen. We would rather continue &quot;working&quot; whatever number of hours was customary in our culture (40 hours a week in the US, less in Europe, many more in Asia) and if there&#x27;s not enough to actually <i>do</i> (there isn&#x27;t) we have a small number of people do the work for 40 hours and the rest are just managers and administrators sitting around in a redundant meeting or staring at a screen waiting for the next redundant meeting.')
