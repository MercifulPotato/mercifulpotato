Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25963375], score=None, time=1611953828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959545, text='The specific case of “White men are so fragile and the mere presence of a Black person challenges every single thing in them” isn&#x27;t the greatest cause for a deletion and a ban (albeit temporary). Far worse things are said all the time without a peep. It seems like a case for a warning rather than a block.<p>I don&#x27;t expect consistency. There&#x27;s just too much to do. And for all I know the user already had at least one warning, in which case a (temporary) ban isn&#x27;t unreasonable. It would shift the burden of proof to say that they&#x27;re going after that kind of racism and not other kinds.<p>I&#x27;ll note that I have said similar things myself. It obviously doesn&#x27;t apply to every single white male (I am one myself), but I&#x27;ve seen it happen so much that I&#x27;ve said the same hyperbole. And if they wanted to warn me, then worse when I continued, I&#x27;d accept that -- as long as I had reason to think that they were also applying at least roughly similar standards to other people.')
