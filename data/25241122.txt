IIRC they said the biggest issue they hear about with the current system are that it&#x27;s optional, which means that the compiler doesn&#x27;t really do any optimizations based on knowing types ahead of time. In the future, there will be a setting to enforce static typing throughout a project, allowing the compiler to perform better optimizations because it knows that the type of a variable will never change.')
