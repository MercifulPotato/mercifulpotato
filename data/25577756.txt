Even if the attack worked just 10% of the time, that&#x27;s like a free 10% rebate credit card for the attacker.<p>(and more generally, only a couple nodes matter at all for this purpose-- the set of nodes that could mine the next block)<p>Plus bch hashrate is so low the attacker can mine the next block themselves with rented hashrate, because the mining pays next to break even, renting the hashrate isn&#x27;t a significant loss in the expectation.')
