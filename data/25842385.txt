First, why is Babbage&#x27;s work on the Analytical Engine included? No computer scientist I know cares about such things, except perhaps as a historical curiosity. Do all modern architects need to read up on the Pyramids? No. Second, I am skeptical that there are papers that <i>all</i> computer scientists need to read. Does a computer vision expert need to go read a paper on computational complexity? Does a roboticist need to understand lambda calculus? This list is pretentious and silly, IMHO.')
