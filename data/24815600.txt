Then, I just give each service their own, unique email address without any configuration. Any spam or unusual mail is then easily-identified. Plus, it makes for easier searching, sorting and tagging. A good, secure, backed-up email &amp; webmail setup is necessary to make it work.<p>For anything I don&#x27;t care about and want better anonymity, I&#x27;m fine with using random, public disposable email addresses.')
