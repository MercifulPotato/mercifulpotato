Slack has ~12-13 mil DAUs, right? I assume at peak time of day, maybe 2-3 million actively using the product at the same time? If that’s a fair assumption, that’s roughly 1 MySQL query per second, per active customer - seems like a fair bit? I wonder if they do polling (instead of websockets)?<p>At my work we have roughly 1 order of magnitude fewer DAUs, but roughly 2 orders of magnitude fewer QPS. And we also have chat areas of the product.')
