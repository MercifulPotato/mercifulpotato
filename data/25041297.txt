For example there are many companies in London making excellent vegan alternatives (e.g. I AM NUT OKAY, Honestly Tasty, Kinda Co, Mouse&#x27;s Favourite), many of which offer something with pizza-melty mozzarella-like effect. Local pizza delivery places offer the vegan options too. There&#x27;s even some with blue mould for that real funky cheesy flavour! It&#x27;s expensive right now but the product is there.')
