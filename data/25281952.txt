Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606944874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25281207, text='&gt;for stating simple statistics<p>No you&#x27;re deliberately calling out numbers that blows things out of proportion. 9&#x2F;11 was deliberately used because it was a tragedy. Why didn&#x27;t you compare COVID to car accidents which is the bigger more comparable number? Because you want to raise emotions. Don&#x27;t pretend.<p>You&#x27;re not a doomsday prophet but you are definitely manipulating the situation towards your own skewed perspective, you were dialing it up to 11, you&#x27;re just back pedaling now.<p>If you indeed had something unbiased to say you would not have brought 9&#x2F;11 out of nowhere to say that covid is like a bunch of 9&#x2F;11s happening back to back because so is the flu so is car accidents. You have an agenda and you are promoting it with biased numbers.<p>&gt; Well, I find it strange that people are easily triggered by reality, so much so that they want to drown it out, ignore it and think that those who are not content with the status quo should be &quot;hit with a belt in the ass and told to stand in the corner&quot;, like the comment I replied to said.<p>Triggered by reality? Nobody is triggered here. We&#x27;re saying calm down. You&#x27;re the one that&#x27;s bringing up 9&#x2F;11 trying to trigger everyone.<p>Nobody is saying be content with the status quo, what we&#x27;re saying is that don&#x27;t push the panic button, we are not in a 9&#x2F;11 panic situation... humanity is more at peace then ever before and the numbers show it when you look at the overall timeline of human existence.<p>I am saying that much of it should be drowned out though. All the news you&#x27;ve been inundated with 2 months ago is already outdated. You&#x27;re loaded with an over dramatization of problems that humanity basically deals with on a normal basis and becomes useless and outdated within a week let alone a month.')
