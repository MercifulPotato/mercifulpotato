It is shown (and we have real world examples) that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing spoilers, which I think is most peoples&#x27; number one draw to the system. It also doesn&#x27;t scale very well and becomes less transparent as it does so. That&#x27;s why I personally reject the push for ordinal systems and push for cardinal. This may seem absurd, but we&#x27;ve had IRV in the US in the past and we reverted back to plurality. So there&#x27;s historical precedence for this position as well.')
