A lot of inequality is bad.<p>If you let inequality grow, due to the way capital begets capital and wealth concentrates you end up with increasing inequality till a few people (let’s call them kings) own 99% of the wealth, and the rest of the people (perhaps we could call them serfs or dead souls) live hand to mouth on very low income.<p>This is why we have progressive taxes, but those don’t work so well because you can entirely avoid income tax if you have enough capital.<p>IMO we should tax income a bit less and capital a bit more.')
