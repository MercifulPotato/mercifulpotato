These people really do need anonymity to protect themselves.<p>And no amount of laws can protect someone from a hate mob attacking them, that doesn&#x27;t care about the consequences.  One of the only ways for many of these people to protect themselves, is to be anonymous.<p>&gt; Some people should not be able to avoid the consequences of their speech.<p>I have given pretty good examples where people absolutely should be given immunity from consequences.  Specifically people should be immune from consequences if they are engaging in government criticism.<p>The examples that I gave are great reasons as for why anonymity is important for people.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s possible with enough tech savviness<p>Actually, it is possible with basically no amount of tech savviness.  All you have to do is click the create new account button, on twitter, and you have just been given a pretty large amount of anonymity.<p>In order to have your twitter account de-anonymized, the government has to take pretty extreme actions, such as court orders.<p>Even if a certain anonymous situation is not 100% foolproof, it is still important that it is available, as it can help most people, most of the time.<p>It turns out, that simply being able to create an anonymous twitter account, is pretty anonymous, most of the time, for most people.<p>Also, the original point that I was countering was this &quot;pseudo-anonymous political discourse on open mainstream mass-broadcast social media&quot;.<p>So I am talking about specifically why anonymity, in the form of having the ability to do what people do now, which is create anonymous twitter accounts, and engage in political discourse.')
