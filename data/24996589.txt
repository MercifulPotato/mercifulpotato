Item(by='CogitoCogito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604565561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24991209, text='[Opinionated wall of text...I don&#x27;t really mean this as an attack on you, but I figured I&#x27;d add the disclaimer after noticing how long it got :) ]<p>Honestly if a law has such variable support that both it and its complement could have majority support at any time, then why should either version have any precedence? This _is_ an example of unstable system. Passing A then ~A or passing ~A then A could have extremely varied outcomes just given random statistical variation.<p>Besides you saying &quot;it gets hard to get things done&quot; doesn&#x27;t really square with the fact that the vast majority of things in most electoral systems don&#x27;t jump back and forth even though there isn&#x27;t any hurdle like this to keep it from happening. So it must not happen for other other reasons like being seen as someone who&#x27;s just quickly flipping an old law or just throwing up votes and then counter votes just isn&#x27;t very popular.<p>In fact, in this case the 7&#x2F;8ths does _not_ apply to another proposition as the GP explained to me. So in fact there is nothing holding back another proposition next time saying the exact opposite (and it only needs the same support as this time) except the historical realization that it passed with enormous support and is backed by powerful interests.<p>This system _is_ stable because I misunderstood it and because the requirements to repeal are the same as to pass. If it weren&#x27;t that way it really would be unstable and frankly undemocratic.')
