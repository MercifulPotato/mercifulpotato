Seriously.<p>There is this trend in the Python community of blurring the line between a plain string and a formatting operation on that string, but there is a fundamental difference between the two. Instead of trying to ignore that difference, the language should make the difference explicit. &quot;Explicit is better than implicit&quot; is one of the things I like so much about Python. Please don&#x27;t throw that away.<p>There is and should be a clear and fundamental difference between a plain string and a string formatting operation. The plain string is clearly the more fundamental of the two, so it should be the default.<p>And then there&#x27;s the whole issue of breaking code with such a change.<p>Again, please don&#x27;t do it. Don&#x27;t change the language in such a fundamental way.')
