People took it as a hint to switch modes.  And eye-tracking rent seekers, already in low-volume high-cost exploitation mode, weren&#x27;t then incentivized to support exploration.<p>Gaming had dollars, and so became a dominating focus.  But it also had challenging constraints, which further pruned exploration.  Do you want higher resolution, to allow text and programming in VR?  Well, a panel existed, but gaming standards of immersion and such were too GPU intensive for the market at that resolution, so ... feel free to diy it yourself. In an environment where diy was no longer a supported thing.  Programmers - a niche market.<p>Facebook et al, even Chinese OEMs, aren&#x27;t interested in niche, or in making &quot;commodity&quot; hardware.  Consumer platforms, and lock-in, and unicorn dreams.  Even while that further cripples exploration.<p>Nreal light AR glasses are a laptop-comparable 1080p 3D screen at 2 meters.  As with their dev kit, consumer availability is now first in China, SK, and Japan, then later in Europe, and eventually in the US.  So asia now, and maybe US late next year.  And the glasses are developed on linux, but you can&#x27;t have that - no unicorns there.<p>Here&#x27;s this amazing tech, and instead of an exploratory ferment, we wait for a few large companies to navigate patent thickets, to eventually meet the severe constraints of creating mass-market consumer devices.  And then we&#x27;ll dig in to exploring.')
