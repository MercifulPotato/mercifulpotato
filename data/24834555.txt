GPU rendering of cinema quality scenes by itself is not that new. V-Ray GPU was around in 2013 and already had an impressive showreel back then: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RYPFY5OUzdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RYPFY5OUzdk</a><p>I&#x27;d count Octane and Redshift as the next big contenders, who together with V-Ray switching from perpetual to subscription pricing, took over the market. Here&#x27;s an example of a Redshift render from 2016: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=to8yh83jlXg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=to8yh83jlXg</a><p>Lately, Pixar has been handing out Renderman GPU betas, which has already been used in the new jungle book movie: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tiWr5aqDeck?t=171" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tiWr5aqDeck?t=171</a><p>Along with this development, the price has gone down. From $1200 per V-Ray license, to $600 per Redshift license and now it seems like the previously prohibitively expensive Pixar renderer will soon be offered for $500.<p>And recently, people have been using Houdini ($6000 per seat) to export their scenes as USD (free open file format) so that they can use Blender 2.81 for rendering (also free).  But the conversion to get things into Blender is work. This renderer can use the Disney production data directly, which is very convenient if you want to drop it in at the last minute for cost saving.<p>GPU rendering has gone from novelty in 2013 to established in 2016 to become the new default in 2018&#x2F;2019. And this released as open source to me implies that the commercial renderer market will soon be dead. It looks &quot;good enough&quot; for advertisements and archviz, which is where the money is made.')
