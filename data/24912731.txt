The leverage from the combination of engineering and the sciences we have in building computation and presentation systems has IMO not be used fully by a long way. Maybe we will go faster until we can elevate technology one level higher, but I don&#x27;t see it coming just yet, where these so-called &quot;no code platforms&quot; could become the new microcode. This is complimentary to my observation that a huge mass of people have not yet overcome and probably will never overcome the stage of technology consumption as apposed to creation in their lifetimes.<p>And can it really be called no-code if new technology could be encoded reliably at scale in that one higher level of technology?')
