Which means a certain level of education because it would be a shame to print on paper some piece of utter bullshit, and some money to print and distribute it. Also, there was a certain threshold of audience too because by far not everyone could read - and thus utter bullshit was unlikely to pass. And just shouting in the corner won&#x27;t agitate too many people.<p>In 1922, that changed with mass propagation of the radio - and Mussolini reaped all benefits of it - it is entirely unsurprising that totalitarianism was first born in Italy which wasn&#x27;t such a prepared ground for it as defeated and destroyed Germany or Russia - it happened simply because commercial radio, being invented by Guglielmo Marconi, first became a thing there.<p>Now, Facebook and Twitter let bullshit make another bold step.<p>Same thing can be said about right of free movement: when it took a lot of time and money to travel on a sailing boat, it was OK - now it is entirely different thing - so right of free movement no longer exists.<p>I&#x27;ll go on to say that probably, all human rights are subject to that rule: they are a benefit for everyone only as long as few are practically able to exercise them.')
