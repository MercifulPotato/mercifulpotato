The earliest transactions of Bitcoins were each news items in the community and the each new vendor that accepted it as payment was put forth as proof of Bitcoin&#x27;s traction.<p>Also comparing it to Apple stock is misleading. Stock represents an ownership stake in the assets of a real-world entity. Bitcoin only has value to the extent that it is collectively agreed to have value; a trait shared with currencies (and commodities with little&#x2F;no utility such as gold, cowrie shells, etc.)')
