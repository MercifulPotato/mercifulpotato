If you go to a car dealer and look at new cars, most of them are hybrid now in some shape. Even the Corolla is now a hybrid car.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not about signalling green hipness anymore. For hybrids it&#x27;s just economics. You fill your tank half as often, that&#x27;s it. Not sexy, but wallet.<p>It will be similar with electric. Once you just conveniently charge at home, you don&#x27;t need this periodic stop at a gas station anymore. And people will go on with their lives, eventually accepting it as the new norm, without thinking about it.')
