You counted as having a language with a spec, even if there was no implementation, but an implementation without a spec was a &quot;toy&quot;<p>Not to my recollection. I don’t recall anyone at uni discussing a C standard until 1989, and even by 2000 few compilers were fully compliant with that C89 spec.<p>There were so many incompatible dialects of FORTRAN 77 that most code had to be modified at least a bit for a new compiler or hardware platform.<p>All of the BASIC and Pascal variants were incompatible with each other. They were defined by “what this implementation does” and not a formal specification.')
