Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607470712, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351914, text='I agree with you in principle -- the &quot;web sites should never do things like choose their own typefaces, line lengths and line spacing&quot; crowd always makes me sigh.<p><i>However.</i><p>We&#x27;re not talking about web sites here, we&#x27;re talking about README files. They should be absolutely readable and understandable if you&#x27;re displaying them in a console -- that&#x27;s arguably one of the underlying tenets of Markdown as it was originally conceived (e.g., that its source be as easily readable as a plain text email or Usenet message is). I like that GitHub renders Markdown documents, but a lot of time when you&#x27;re mucking around with source, you&#x27;re looking at, well, the plain document.<p>I think this is a fun hack to demonstrate how you can do ridiculous things in technically-still-Markdown documents, but it&#x27;s unequivocally not something anyone should actually do in their Markdown documents. :)')
