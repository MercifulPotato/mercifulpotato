Its name is basically a direct analogy, and doesn&#x27;t imply any wrongdoing or illegality, as far as I can see.<p>&gt; <i>I also would not buy your product if it were called alcohol poisoning. I love alcohol. Iâ€™m drinking a beer right now (happy New Years everyone). But naming a computer program after it sounds like an odd thing to do. And more to your point would also be a violation of the same rule Apple is using in this case.</i><p>What about an application that assists in force-quitting other programs? One might call that &quot;Scotch&quot;, since that&#x27;s what it does (&quot;It &#x27;scotches&#x27; other processes, you see...&quot;), and the application might have a cutesy whiskey glass as its icon.  Would that run afoul of your sensibilities?')
