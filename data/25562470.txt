We could assume roughly 89.5% of population is covered by the NHS since it&#x27;s given by default. If you cannot afford private insurance, you will only have NHS.<p>In my opinion, I believe having a public option will slowly eliminate private insurance or at least reduce the types of services available. Additionally I think it&#x27;s dangerous for the government to set that sort of precedent.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;international-health-policy-center&#x2F;countries&#x2F;england" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;international-health-policy...</a>')
