Matt Levine&#x27;s column today gave a &quot;traditional four part test&quot; for manipulation:<p>(1) That the accused had the ability to influence market prices; (2) that the accused specifically intended to create or effect a price or price trend that does not reflect legitimate forces of supply and demand; (3) that artificial prices existed; and (4) that the accused caused the artificial prices.<p>No individual on WSB can possibly be doing all four things, can they? Unless there is some private conspiracy among a small number of people.')
