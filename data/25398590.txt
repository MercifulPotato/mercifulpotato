Bit of a mismatch there but I don&#x27;t doubt some salty Americans to get upset about me pointing out the plain truth. Spoiler: You are far from omnipotent. Sorry guys.<p>Hopefully your women and men in the hotseat can focus on what is important and narrow down what to save and what to trash. I&#x27;m sure they have that in the bag being the best, the brightest and best compensated software engineers in the country.<p>Ignoring that, asymmetrical handshakes for the underlying symmetrical keys, yeah sure, completely at risk from a quantum computer that can actually perform, that&#x27;s a massive threat for anyone wanting to keep their credit card  number and dick pics safe.<p>Anything symmetrical in nature is likely fine for a very long time and will not be touched by &lt;QUANTUM SUPREMACY&gt;. As dangerous as it is to bet against the future, the engineering challenges involved with quantum computing are looking very much like fusion energy, it&#x27;s a great if they can do it, but fair chance they won&#x27;t get there long after we are all dead.<p>A neverending stream of scary soundbytes that leads to perpetual funding for groups of people who are proven to be failures is very much guaranteed though :)')
