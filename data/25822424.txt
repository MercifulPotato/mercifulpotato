The tech firms could be more transparent about the rules they apply and which ones are violated. The ambiguity is indeed solvable, but considering the state of the world, it seems like a low moral priority to me.<p>&gt;We at $bigname law firm aren&#x27;t corporate, it&#x27;s just if we hire poc our employees will walk out. -someone before the civil rights era.<p>That&#x27;s disingenuous. Your comparsions fails in five ways:<p>1. Its not about who gets hired, its about who is served as a customer<p>2. The violated rules of these firms are also defined as criminal behavior by law in all of the western world, so to &#x27;serve the customer&#x27; you are talking about being an accessory in a crime. Even if public prosecutors don&#x27;t make a habit of prosecuting companies when they are simply the platform, companies have an obligation to their shareholders to not take unnecessary risks.<p>3. None of this has anything to do with traditional or conservative values. Both the far-left and far-right have been creating a lot of propaganda suggesting that traditional values include racism, sexism, sedation, anti-semitism, etc.<p>4. The employees walking out is a realistic problem, because there is barely any supply of death cult members with the intellectual and educational background required to perform the job. I&#x27;m sure lots of people work at these tech companies that have traditional values, like a small government and low taxes, or a more family centric focus on life. But at this point those people are referred to as &#x27;traitors&#x27; by the same so called conservative media<p>5. People&#x27;s skin color isn&#x27;t a choice. They are born with it. Your views on the other hand are a choice. There is accountability and liability. You can be an anti-semitic person and post a video about how to cook an egg without it being removed from youtube. You just can&#x27;t express anti-semitic views on somebody else&#x27;s platform. Not complicated nor an issue.')
