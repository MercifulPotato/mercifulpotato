The other is to protect the subjects. I also don&#x27;t recall saying that IRB review was some sort of &quot;panacea&quot;. Please don&#x27;t present clearly false claims like that.<p>Any real IRB board would see that this research clearly contains potential harmful outcomes to participants as a result of making public examples of them for the researcher&#x27;s amusement. No ethical researcher &quot;publishes&quot; results without some attempt to shield the identities of the subjects. Sure, sometimes they screw that up, but revealing the identities of &quot;researched stooges&quot; seems to have been the primary intent here.<p>I must obtain IRB approval to conduct any research, even show people simple web&#x2F;social content. Sometimes it is fast tracked for sure, but EVERYTHING that involves human subjects goes through IRB review at every institute&#x2F;university I have ever worked with.')
