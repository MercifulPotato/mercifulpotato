Hence it being awkward that someone apologized for misgendering isn&#x27;t unreasonable at all. Advocating that no-one should even do that would be unreasonable. But just presenting &quot;this happened, this is how it made me feel&quot; is a very natural thing.<p>From such a presentation general rules cannot always be derived. That is not the point of such a presentation. The point is for someone who is having feelings to have those feelings heard and recognized. Maybe that can lead to a bit more understanding for people who were never in such situations.<p>It seems like a waste of time to make these meetings all-hands company wide. But don&#x27;t dismiss these activists just because they pushed for an all hands meeting. It wasn&#x27;t a good thing to push for, but people get things wrong sometimes. Having been wrong is not the same as always being wrong.')
