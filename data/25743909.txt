There&#x27;s a reason we&#x27;re a lower cost.<p>1. We have a lower standard of education<p>2. We have a higher cost of technology (relative to average income)<p>3. We have a lower need for the luxury market where most technology resides<p>You can also look at the proportion of field leaders. Are more from the developed nations or the developing ones?<p>The developed nations had a headstart on technology, do you think the developing ones have overcome that, despite most of us going backwards in terms of access to education and the wealth gap?<p>Don&#x27;t take it personally, I&#x27;m not trying to tell you that you&#x27;re a bad developer. What I&#x27;m saying is we have to work harder to uplift our country&#x27;s fields and not fall into the trap of &quot;well I&#x27;m the biggest fish in this tiny pond so therefore I&#x27;m an equally big fish in the ocean&quot;.
