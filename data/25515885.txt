It would hurt to think you&#x27;re deleting a remote reference and accidentally deleting a local branch.<p>What&#x27;s the point of the Master throwing himself off the railing when the novice runs `git -h branch`?<p>I&#x27;m running it and git responds &quot;unknown option: -h&quot; then displays a short version of the help menu. Maybe it is a joke on showing the short help menu even when using incorrect syntax?')
