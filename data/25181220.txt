And most people don&#x27;t realize that quality bikes are worth their price, vs. the Huffy at Walmart, but that&#x27;s all they can afford.<p>So yeah, why manage one business destined to fail on its own when you can try to be a social hub? Look at Capital One with their &quot;bank coffee shops&quot;. Look at how breweries have differentiated themselves. Bike shops are niche, like book shops are now, and will have to really offer a top-notch service and pricing experience to compete.')
