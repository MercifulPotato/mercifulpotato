For example, one system I am familiar with the ballot itself is not special, <i>the envelope</i> is (it has signatures from the poll workers, which is also problematic because they can potentially surreptitiously  mark the envelope in a special way to associate the vote to a specific person), which makes it unnecessary for poll workers to ever be in contact with the ballots themselves.<p>Overall, my qualms are minimal and am more concerned about the use of computers for the vote than anything else in the process.')
