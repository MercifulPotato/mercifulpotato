And the actual outcomes fell into these confidence intervals.<p>&gt; Other types of &quot;errors&quot; -- election results that repeatedly fall outside the confidence interval, or are consistently on only one side of the mean -- only arise when the poll is flawed for some reason.<p>Or the model was inaccurate. Perhaps the priors were too specific. Perhaps the data was missing, misrecorded, not tabulated properly, who knows. Again, the results fell within the CI of most models, the problem was simply that the result fell too close to the mean for most statisticians&#x27; comfort.')
