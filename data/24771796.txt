It states that there are four ways of perceiving, and four ways of judging... extraverted&#x2F;introverted sensing&#x2F;intuition and extraverted&#x2F;introverted thinking&#x2F;feeling.<p>Each personality type has four cognitive functions associated with it: primary, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior. You will have both an extraverted and introverted perceiving function as well as an extraverted and introverted judging function. Your primary cognitive function will match your introversion&#x2F;extraversion trait, and then will flip back and forth between introversion&#x2F;extraversion for the rest of your functions.<p>Since there are only 8 cognitive functions, and each personality type has 4, it&#x27;s not surprising that they will often share cognitive functions - it also means that types can behave more similarly than one would expect based on their indicators.')
