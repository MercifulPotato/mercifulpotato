This is a change in how the relevant market is defined.<p>Second, that any prevention of competition in after markets should be illegal, not just prevention of competition in after markets that consumers weren&#x27;t aware of when they bought the device.<p>Consumer harm here is trivial. That want to use an app, they cannot, that is harm.<p>(Ianal either, but spent a lot of time reading about this sort of issue)')
