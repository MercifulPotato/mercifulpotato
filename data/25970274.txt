However, I don&#x27;t use a lot of apps from the AppStore, so I dont&#x27; know if that was a contributing factor. I&#x27;m also not one to close and launch apps regularly. Terminal, Browser, TextMate are open 100% of the time. I usually have Photoshop and&#x2F;or Illustrator open in the background as well. Don&#x27;t be a quitter, you don&#x27;t have to be a starter.<p>&gt;And don&#x27;t get me started on the completly stupid difference between ctrl+c and cmd+c. One (the standard for everything except macos) is used in terminal and the other in every other app.<p>The Mac has had the Cmd key sincd the very first days of Apple. In fact, it was originally two separate keys: open-apple, closed-apple. It was around well before Linux was a glint in Linus&#x27; eye.')
