What purpose does that serve? Is that not meaningless semantics?<p>It forces people to recognize the extreme rightward shift in politics, and therefore the idea that appealing &quot;to the center&quot; is in fact an appeal to regress further to the right. This is something those on the right vehemently want to avoid admitting, since it prevents them from painting themselves as victims.')
