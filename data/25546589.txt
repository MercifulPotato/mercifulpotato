There&#x27;s no feedback loop that would prevent them from hunting their prey into extinction. If they over-hunt birds one season and can&#x27;t catch enough the next, their owners will simply supplement the difference.<p>It&#x27;s not even clear to me that birds are a primary food source for domesticated outdoor cats. They might be hunting them just for sport.')
