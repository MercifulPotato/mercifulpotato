Actually, there&#x27;s an unusual amount of it this year because of the opportunity to convert a bunch of newly bankrupt hotels into housing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hcd.ca.gov&#x2F;grants-funding&#x2F;active-funding&#x2F;homekey.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hcd.ca.gov&#x2F;grants-funding&#x2F;active-funding&#x2F;homekey...</a>).<p>Besides that, the left-NIMBY alliance means there&#x27;s noone to directly oppose public housing. The left supports it because they actually want it, and the NIMBYs pretend to be leftists and like using &quot;this should be public housing&quot; as their excuse for why nothing else should ever happen - presumably they don&#x27;t expect public housing to actually appear, but they run low on excuses if it does.<p>Not much new construction of it happens in SF though, because construction costs in are very high, and there&#x27;s not much land zoned to allow apartments because they don&#x27;t want new housing of any kind, public or not.<p>&gt; The end result will be that the &quot;compromise&quot; will be no new public housing and simply zoning relaxations at most, with continued increase in rents.<p>SF&#x27;s main problem is most of it is zoned for single-family houses despite being a city, so that would be great actually.')
