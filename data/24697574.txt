Item(by='eptcyka', descendants=None, kids=[24697789], score=None, time=1601991806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697463, text='&gt;Every baby step away from industrialization is a step towards sustainability.<p>I don&#x27;t think that industrialization, the act of exploiting the scale of a demand for a specific item to produce it en masse is inherently unsustainable. In fact, I&#x27;d counter such an argument with the following hyperbole - every baby step away from industrialization is one more unfed baby. Efficient food production is what keeps a lot of people, of all sorts mind you, able to eat. Quite literally. Obviously, the food industry is notorious for it&#x27;s wasteful practices, and that just means that there&#x27;s room to grow. I sincerely wish you to read about the absurdities of food shortages in the USSR and re-evaluate your opinion on industrial food production.<p>And speaking of sustainability, what does this term even mean in this context?')
