Like, &quot;nobody ever is going to do this?&quot; I don&#x27;t believe in absolutes like that. For sure, we&#x27;ll make the trip possible technically. You have to agree that we can make the trip, right?<p>So, what would it take for anybody (out of the billions of people on earth) to make that journey? Even it would mean certain death? Not much, is my guess. I think going down in history as the first human on Mars would be enough for at least 1 person. What about governments? To forever be known as the first nation on Mars. I can think of a few government who would &#x27;force&#x27; people to do it... Dying in a dessert vs. dying on another planet, a true patriot would do it, right?. Or how is it different from living on a submarine, for example.<p>What if you were a social media influencer. Imagine the engagement and followers of posting from Mars.<p>There&#x27;s so much profit to be made, somebody will make the journey, live in a sphere for a few years and maybe come back.')
