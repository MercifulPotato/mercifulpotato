Item(by='Grumbledour', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610635710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776755, text='I think a big part of the problem is that there is so much gendered language in german. So there are no progammers, there are male programmers (Programmierer) and female programmers (Programmiererin), which leads to both forms or short forms being used (Programmierer&#x2F;in) in these postings to be inclusive. But I don&#x27;t even know if there is an accepted neutral form of the word if you wanted to address someone non-binary.<p>So, while the whole (m&#x2F;w&#x2F;d) thing is kind of silly, it on the other hand makes it clear, that whatever gendered form you use, you don&#x27;t actually care about gender.<p>I really hope we can someday find acceptable neutral forms for these words. It would make many things much easier in german.')
