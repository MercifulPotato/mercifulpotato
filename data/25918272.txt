Item(by='opheliate', descendants=None, kids=[25918452], score=None, time=1611680713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916681, text='This is definitely interesting, but I feel it&#x27;s already somewhat lacking in terms of transparency, which is obviously fundamental to the success of a worker co-op.<p>From FAQ 3, the event is &quot;free&quot;, but on closer inspection, when trying to RSVP, the free tickets are actually all gone, and you&#x27;re required to make a &quot;contribution&quot; of at least $5 to get a ticket. That&#x27;s totally cool, I accept that if there were an infinite number of free tickets it wouldn&#x27;t be manageable, but I can&#x27;t find any information at all on how many free tickets there were, or how many are available at each tier. (In the nicest possible way of saying this) I haven&#x27;t heard of you before, and I have no reason to think that the lack of free tickets at this point isn&#x27;t artificial scarcity to try to coerce me into paying for access to this &quot;free&quot; event. I&#x27;d like to think that&#x27;s not the case, but without a clearer picture of the scale, it&#x27;s a bitter pill to swallow, and doesn&#x27;t instil confidence as to the future direction of the project.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m missing something obvious, I&#x27;d be delighted to be wrong here.')
