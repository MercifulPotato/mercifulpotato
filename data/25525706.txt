A few years ago, you used the &quot;hyper&quot; crate, which was a convenient wrapper around the &quot;http&quot; crate. Now, you&#x27;re supposed to use &quot;reqwest&quot;, which is a convenient wrapper around the &quot;hyper&quot; crate.<p>&quot;Reqwest&quot; uses the Tokio machinery, even for a blocking request.\nIf you turn on &quot;Trace&quot; level logging, you can watch it start up a thread pool and go through a 35-step process, using all the async and futures machinery, to do one synchronous request. Log messages include &quot;handshake complete, spawning background dispatcher task&quot; and &quot;signaled close for runtime thread (ThreadId(2))&quot;<p>This seems excessive.')
