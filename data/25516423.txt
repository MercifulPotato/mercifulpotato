Why make the common, important case worse for the sake of the uncommon case?<p>In any language you have to make a tradeoff between concision and explicitness. With type inference you could write code whose text is just as explicit as you&#x27;d do in an untyped language, and use the types solely to provide more detail. Or you could put no more detail than in an untyped language, but move some of that detail into types and make your code more concise. Most people find a point somewhere in the middle, and end up with code that&#x27;s both more concise and more explicit (when you look at the types); of course that means the code is more &quot;magic&quot; if you&#x27;re looking solely at the text.')
