How do you square those two?<p>Also Reddit has been on the receiving end of this reporting before.  That has often resulted in incremental improvements as the worst offending subreddits are banned (there used to be an &#x2F;r&#x2F;jailbait for example), but their model often doesn&#x27;t kill that content or the demand for it and can result in that same content being dispersed among smaller and more niche communities that are able to glide under the radar.  Reddit has still thrived throughout all that controversy so I don&#x27;t think it is as big an existential threat as you claim.')
