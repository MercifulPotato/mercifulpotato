How is that equal <i>or</i> equitable? All states have some combination of rural, urban, and all the shades of gray in-between. Texas has Austin, Massachusetts is over half rural, NY is a <i>Blue</i> state that&#x27;s mostly <i>Red</i> by area. Why should someone&#x27;s vote have no weight because of where they live? I&#x27;m not saying that a popular vote would be perfect, I&#x27;m just saying that the Electoral College is absurd.')
