Stock consolidation and 180 day lock up period creates a big risk for when employees sell. Lots of them probably have tens of thousands of shares, exercised them very cheaply, and will want to offload them. I&#x27;m not going to touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. I do wish I could short this stock but options aren&#x27;t available for it yet.')
