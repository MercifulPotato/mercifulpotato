I was previously thinking of adding customers and other end users to the plan, but it already gets far too expensive.  None of these users would be developers; it would primarily be so they could download sources, read and comment on issues, and generally observe what was going on.<p>The one-size-fits-all fixed-tier subscription makes no sense from the point of view of an end user.  I would love to have users&#x2F;projects with differing access levels.  Likewise, GitLab is too bloated; I might want one or two features from the higher tiers but I can&#x27;t justify paying for them.  Why not let people pay for the features they actually need selectively?<p>I&#x27;ve also not been too impressed by the inflexibility of GitLab&#x27;s billing practices.  Not only is it fixed annual subscription, if you don&#x27;t pay by auto-renewal you have to renew the subscription on a specific week.  You can&#x27;t even pay them in advance!  I was effectively forced into the auto-renewal due to not being around on that specific week, and in the following year when I was winding up the company and finalising the accounts, I got a surprise bill due to that coerced auto-renewal.  I was not happy with that.  They really need to get their billing system sorted out.')
