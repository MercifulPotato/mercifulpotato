There&#x27;s evidence that the virus was in Italy in December 2019: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;27&#x2F;2&#x2F;20-4632_article" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;27&#x2F;2&#x2F;20-4632_article</a> Obviously it would be a bit of a leap to link that to the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases, a BSL4 facility.<p>It is an entirely possible theory, but it cannot and will not become the consensus view of scientists without some real evidence. The consensus view among virologists is that the virus originated in bats, where it either spread to humans directly or through an intermediate host.<p>A painstaking effort to identify the source is underway:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-03165-9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-03165-9</a>')
