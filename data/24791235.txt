Multiple Taiwanese doctors were working in Wuhan at that time. Taiwan&#x27;s very early and very small outbreak was from people evacuated from Wuhan. The CDC warnings weren&#x27;t about what was seen in the Covid positive evacuees in Taiwan. The warnings were based on direct experience in Wuhan and they <i>did</i> suggest human-to-human transmission.<p>There was no hard proof, but there was a great deal of circumstantial evidence. Yes, it&#x27;s possible Taiwan&#x27;s CDC was overly suspicious due to memories of how SARS was covered up in 2003. However, given the way epidemics spread, the wiser course is to take circumstantial evidence of transmission very seriously.')
