While it was often wildly inaccurate compared to what we were &quot;seeing&quot; in sonar in real-time, it was fascinating trying to predict what we would and would not hear.<p>We definitely picked up MODUs (Mobile Offshore Drilling Units) form thousands of km away.<p>Also, there are many older submarines still out at sea, and many of them don&#x27;t use sound dampening tech (i.e. rubber grommets) on their noisy gear (pumps).  Pretty loud too.')
