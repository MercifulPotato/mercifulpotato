It&#x27;s an in-place upgrade and just requires a quick command to make it work. Further, InfluxDB 2.0 also has the API for InfluxDB 1.x. We&#x27;ve been putting out InfluxDB 1.x releases while we&#x27;ve been developing 2.0. One of the reasons we waited so long to finalize GA for 2.0 was because we had to make sure there was a clean migration path and there is.<p>For our cloud 1 customers, they&#x27;ll be able to upgrade to our cloud 2 offering, but in the meantime, their existing installations get the same 24x7 coverage and service we&#x27;ve been providing for years.<p>As for how this will be deployed, it will be a seamless transition for our cloud customers when we do so. Data, monitoring and analytics companies replace their backend data planes multiple times over the course of their lifetime.<p>For our Enterprise customers, we&#x27;ll provide an upgrade path, but not until this product is mature enough to ship an on-premise binary that won&#x27;t get a chance to get upgraded but for a few times a year.<p>The only difference here is that we&#x27;re doing it as open source. They always do theirs behind closed doors. I&#x27;m sure most of our users and many of our customers prefer our open source approach.')
