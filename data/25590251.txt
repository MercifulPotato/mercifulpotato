All life-critical, engineered systems incorporate a safety margin.<p>To win buy-in from the population at large, you sure as heck better have overwhelming statistics.  Marginal just won&#x27;t cut it.<p>When you&#x27;re talking about taking control away from the driver, all you need is one accident a human would have prevented to create political backlash and deteriorate trust in the system.  Just because several other unvoiced lives may have been saved doesn&#x27;t offer consolation to the victims or deem the loss acceptable.  I think of it as analogous to the legal doctrine that convicting one innocent is worse than letting 10 guilty individuals go free.<p>I&#x27;m always skeptical when developers claim a computer can do a better job than a human, as I&#x27;ve encountered so many edge cases the programming just never adequately accounted for.  It will take time and a great deal of experience running these platforms in the wild until they become truly resilient.  I would be quite pissed off to find the severed limb I suffered in a crash was due to programming not sufficiently distinguishing e.g. road paint from water streaks.<p>And the metric you choose to define &quot;safer&quot; will never be perfect.  Extra buffer helps offset any bias or gaps in your methodology and capture more of the long tail of &quot;one-offs&quot; never accounted for in version 1.<p>I&#x27;m a big believer that driverless vehicles will provide huge improvements to our quality of life, I just feel there&#x27;s a lot of misrepresentation taking place out there today as to how far along these systems are.')
