Item(by='buzzert', descendants=None, kids=[25862004], score=None, time=1611251464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25861185, text='&gt; The real Satoshi (assuming they&#x27;re one individual as CSW is essentially implying) took care to maintain their anonymity, and is almost certainly aware that they would be the target of intelligence agencies around the world, in addition to your more run-of-the-mill &quot;let&#x27;s kidnap this guy and force him to transfer his enormous wealth to us&quot; criminals. So releasing his identity publicly would be just painting a massive target on his back.<p>This would be the Hollywood interpretation of his motivation to remain anonymous. Personally, I think it’s because he really wanted the work to speak for itself, and not have the entire project tied to one particular individual with thousands of newspapers trying to figure out what motivated him.<p>Remember The Social Network movie? When they tried to make it look like Facebook was created just so Zuckerberg could get back at his ex-girlfriend? It’s stuff like that he was trying to avoid.')
