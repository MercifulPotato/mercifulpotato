During the work day I&#x27;ll check if I see it ping, or have Teams up on a laptop and next to me where I&#x27;m doing something else in the house (usually cooking lunch or dishes).<p>If it&#x27;s after hours I tend not to pay much attention to my phone, maybe glance at it when I have to look at it for something anyway. My boss knows to call me if there&#x27;s an emergency after hours.<p>And that happens because we&#x27;re now a tiny department within a large corporation that supports multiple call centers, and there&#x27;s periodically network issues we have to help diagnose and fix or we risk breaking our contracts with our clients.<p>It&#x27;s been a challenge at times, I&#x27;ve spent some long nights trying to get the right people from other departments on the call to fix the problems, since I don&#x27;t have full access to everything in our data center (corporate likes to keep things siloed), but when that happens I just do my best to give myself the time back over the next couple of weeks during the work days. On balance I&#x27;m probably still only working 40 hour weeks (maybe even less some weeks).<p>We&#x27;ve been full remote for two and a half years though. We&#x27;ve been doing this since before the pandemic started.')
