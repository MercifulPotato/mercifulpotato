I&#x27;m a very young software engineer at 23 in a country where most engineers you will find are 26 and above I got my first full time developer job when I was 19 fresh out of high school.<p>Most people consider me as smart but I&#x27;m not given the opportunity to use my skills. In late 2019 I had decided to resign my current job because I found it too toxic, I had been diagnosed with bipolar and things had been very hard before I had decided to go and see a therapist who when immediately saw me referred me to a psychiatrist and I&#x27;ve been on medication since then.<p>My manager convinced me to stay and offered me a small increase in salary and promised me that my voice will be heard. He also convinced me to take a contract that involved completing an app that I had been working on. he made a lot of promises to me. As soon as I accepted his new offer and rejoined the company, he changed again, I&#x27;m still faced with the issues I used face previously and as someone with bipolar, I get stressed easily and the company does not make it any easy for me. Last week I just decided to send my manager a notification about my planned exit next year. He&#x27;s trying to convince me to continue staying... So I&#x27;m just wondering why s would someone want you to stay in a company without giving you the opportunity for growth? For me it feels like they just want to use me to do the hard work and then &quot;The right people will take the credit&quot;, considering I don&#x27;t have a university degree.<p>Are other young engineers who are talented face similar issues in other companies? Despite my age, I&#x27;ve been working with computers longer than most people around me. So I do know a lot and can easily do any task. A lot of people are just usually concerned with how do I know what I know? Most of the time people don&#x27;t listen to me and when things go wrong or something is very technical they always want me to be the one to do that but I get no credit. Maybe I&#x27;m the problem. Is there something about me that makes it hard to be acceptable to these people?')
