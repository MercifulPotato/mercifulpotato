The vast majority fo the wealth of billionaires is tied up in the businesses they control, and that&#x27;s fine. That money is doing useful work. We don&#x27;t want to take it away from people who have proven they are effective leaders and managers and hand it over to bureaucrats. Let the people who built the businesses and created the wealth manage it. Tax them yes, that&#x27;s fine, but at a proportionate level.<p>The feedback loop in Capitalism is to direct capital towards people who discover more efficient way to provide goods and services, or provide better goods and services, to help them scale up, or give people with a proven track record more resources to devote to new enterprises. This is exactly what we want.<p>There are three main issues with this picture.<p>The first is rent seeking behaviour, where simply having capital enables growing more capital without productive activity. This is what we need to tax punitively. Capital that is not being used productively is dead weight on the economy.<p>Secondly, monopolistic behaviour is closely related to rent seeking, it&#x27;s using market power to extract rents or exert unfair influence.<p>Finally inheritance is a problem because it&#x27;s un-earned wealth. There&#x27;s no reason to expect that those inheriting wealth are likely to manage it effectively. Inheritance taxes should be high, without being overly punitive after all one of the main incentives to work hard and accumulate wealth is to provide for the next generation. You want to allow successful business owners and investors to benefit their families without facilitating excess waste of resources.')
