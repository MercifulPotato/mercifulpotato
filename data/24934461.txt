Some of us knew it was a non story at the time, but it was impossible to compete with the front page of the NYT and 24 hour news networks. Literally everyone was focused on the god damn emails, very little on the policy proposals of each candidate. This had an impact on the election and it’s safe to say with hindsight, that it was a non story and shouldn’t have been covered. Perhaps Glenn Greenwald would call not covering it “suppression” and “censorship” but it was also the right thing to do.')
