I&#x27;m sort-of trying to break down the mental walls we put between these categories. I&#x27;m saying these are the normal beliefs people have had since forever.<p>Likewise, taboos against divorce are ubiquitous. That&#x27;s like the whole point of marriage. You might not ban divorce outright, but it&#x27;s supposed to be the exception.<p>Heteronormativity (which you mentioned) varies more across cultures, but even here I think 2020 leftish culture is now an outlier. Yes, the conservative American culture it was born in reaction against was, in global terms, not among the most tolerant. But while a larger degree of toleration (e.g. via various &quot;third gender&quot; concepts) exists elsewhere, I think this is done in more of a pluralistic&#x2F;subculture way than by really changing prevailing dominant norms. More of a &quot;oh yeah, some people are different, which is ok, they&#x27;re called _______.&quot; There&#x27;s also more &quot;you&#x27;re probably going to form a heterosexual marriage and have kids, but maybe you also had a same-sex lover (especially when you were younger)&quot;, like the ancient Greeks. Like, Zeus took male lovers but was married to Hera and seems pretty culturally &quot;straight&quot;. I&#x27;m saying there may be more tolerance but it still fits into a traditional and somewhat heteronormative framework.<p>Back on the ancestors&#x2F;descendants thing -- I find the conflict between leftish and conservative-Christian values funny, because it was Christianity (and monotheism more generally) that did a lot of the work of reducing emphasis on family, lineage, and kin. You could call this the transition from &quot;these are my people&quot; to &quot;we are all children of God&quot;. Now we have a leftish monotheism-without-God.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to explain what I&#x27;m trying to get across. It&#x27;s like -- most of the world, and most of history, is conservative&#x2F;traditional in a way that The Culture (in the Ian Banks sense) isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s focused on kinship and rooted in biological interest. And even when those cultures seem &quot;more tolerant&quot; it&#x27;s still within some traditional framework that keeps an emphasis on the heterosexual reproductive union.<p>All of which is to widen the frame and make us reconsider what is &quot;extreme&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m also saying that this word &quot;modern&quot; just, with a sweep of the hand, dismisses the traditional beliefs of ... basically anyone who immigrates to America. It&#x27;s a cultural erasure. Which I think many people will come to regret.<p>[1] &quot;western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic&quot; -- a term from psychology')
