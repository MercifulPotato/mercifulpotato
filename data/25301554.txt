I&#x27;m a bit confused about the data&#x2F;graph that shows their main conclusion, anyone know why:<p>They use a 7-day rolling average and general consensus is that covid has a 3-14 day incubation period. Combining these two would indicate that the mask&#x27;s effect should be gradually becoming stronger starting ~4days after introducing and reaching peak effect after 21 days in the graph. The graphs show a strong effect after 4 days and remain constant after that. Does that undermine the conclusion or am I seeing this wrong?<p>They use a linear regression while infection is an exponential process in my understanding, doesn&#x27;t this undermine the regression?')
