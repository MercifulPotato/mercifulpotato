This is not about &quot;bargaining&quot;.<p>This is a case of <i>people</i> demanding and advocating for their rights. There is no principled reason to ask while doing so they should &quot;bargain away&quot; those rights.<p>Sure, opponents of same-sex marriage may disagree.<p>There are some schools of thought that try to separate, shame, or exclude others based on some criteria, whether it be sexual orientation, educational background, or socioeconomic status.<p>I see a pattern around intolerance. People that have exclusionary beliefs don&#x27;t have a good track record  -- here&#x27;s what I mean -- these belief systems do not survive contact with reality, unless the person with that belief system digs in their feet and refuses to engage with real people. For example, it may be &quot;easy&quot; for someone to be homophobic if that is how they were raised, but this belief system is unlikely to survive if the person has a gay son <i>and</i> they are open to talking with their son and learning about the issue.')
