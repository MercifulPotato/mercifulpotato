YouTube should be <i>allowed</i> to do everything they have the right to do.  They have the right to stop providing all free services (unless they have contractual obligations).  They have the right to ban all creators whose names start with &quot;K&quot;.  They have the right to add a 10-second delay to all page loads.  They have the right to put Goatse on their homepage.<p>However, if they do any of the above things, the rest of us have the right to be disappointed, to think YouTube sucks, and to tell everyone else about it.<p>So, if they demonstrate that they have no respect for the principle of freedom of speech, we have the right to call them cowardly, un-American, probably unfair in their implementation, counterproductive even assuming their goals, etc.')
