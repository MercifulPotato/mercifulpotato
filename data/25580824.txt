If training data had a lot of black faces, it would work just as well.<p>But could it be that for darker faces, camera sensors don&#x27;t pick enough details because the darker faces don&#x27;t reflect as much visible light?<p>I&#x27;m sure Apple&#x27;s face id for example doesn&#x27;t have this problem because they don&#x27;t use visible light.')
