Still though, some websites get around this and force this &quot;feature&quot; on the browser, making their website hard to scroll. When I see such behavior, I just quit the website. On a 60Hz monitor (i.e. most monitors), smooth scrolling feels like playing a video game at 10 FPS. Not to mention the additional CPU load caused by it.<p>I just cannot see any value in smooth scrolling, and yet, many devs are doing it. Is there a reason for that?')
