Undercutting by other European nations? The GDP per capita of the EU (37kâ‚¬) is barely below the GDP per capita of the UK ($44k). Even the typical &quot;boogeyman&quot; countries like Poland have a GDP per capita of $33k. The UK also has a massive &quot;geographic advantage&quot; when it comes to avoiding refugees. The vast majority of refugees do not arrive in the UK first which means the UK can often send them back to Italy or Greece. Seriously, this is just a textbook example of places with little immigration having more xenophobia simply because of lack of experience. People are scared of the unknown and that&#x27;s all there is.<p>If I was worried about economic undercutting I would be worried about China and other Asian countries because they not only have the advantage in numbers, China is nowadays the go to place for manufacturing even for high quality products. The key aspect is that the quality control is managed by first world economies. For some reason the Chinese are really terrible at creating medium&#x2F;premium quality brands.')
