You&#x27;ll probably have far more detractors than supporters. Be very selective. People will unpleasantly surprise you unfortunately. Most people are disability skeptics.<p>If you have to go to HR to get accommodations, you should get a different job. In my experience, when a manager won&#x27;t make accomodations without that, they won&#x27;t do it with it or they&#x27;ll hold it against you. My manager at Intuit just said &quot;no&quot; to <i>every single request</i> my doctor had written down. HR&#x27;s response was to just shrug their shoulders and say they have no authority. The next company just laid me off for having too many doctor&#x27;s appointments.<p>The best thing you can do to improve your work-life with a chronic illness&#x2F;disability is to find a great manager. The company that laided me off only did it after my manager changed away from the person I actually interviewed with. Remote work is generally easier to keep your illness from being noticeable to as many people.<p>And while it is illegal for your workplace to do all sorts of things, they will still do it. Suing a current&#x2F;former employer is a nuclear option that will likely hurt you far more than it could ever help you. They can always get retribution every time a future employer calls to confirm previous employment.<p>It&#x27;s been 5 years now, and I still feel guilty about not suing Intuit over my entire experience there. Not because I needed the attention, money, drama, etc. Just because I know they continued doing it to more people like me after I left.<p>As a more practical matter, I&#x27;ve found it really important to be smart about when I change&#x2F;add&#x2F;remove my prescriptions. If you take enough drugs, there will be bad side-effects, and you don&#x27;t want to have it happen on the day of your annual review (speaking from experience), big presentation, etc.')
