Right now, typical savings accounts are higher friction than checking accounts with no meaningful interest, while high-yield savings accounts are even higher friction (because typically not offered by banks with the same broad range of consumer services people look to for checking accounts) but with barely-meaningful interest. Savings accounts almost never make sense.<p>If you need the lack of friction of a demand deposit account, you probably want it all in checking, and for actual savings where you don&#x27;t need frictionless access, you probably want it invested somewhere with returns better than a savings account.')
