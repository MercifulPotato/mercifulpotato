I have some doubts about investment into ML without the hype (at least for legacy big corps) but probably their hype-driven ML efforts are&#x2F;were misguided by poor incentives. But I agree again that companies that invest in ML from a grassroots&#x2F;first principles way should run circles around the legacy ones. \nI think the „boring“ part you mention might be what I refer to as ML&#x2F;AI winter.\nBut then again do you think there is much space left in the ML toolbox apart from neural networks? I think at least for e.g. computer vision we can agree that neural nets ate all the cake, right?')
