Pay the price you pay for an iPhone and this generally is no longer an issue.  On the off chance there is something bundled, you can disable system installed apps, which removes them visually from everything except for deep within the settings app.<p>* The only time I&#x27;ve encountered what I would consider &quot;nonsense&quot; is on shared testing devices.  Sometimes they have all sorts of strange apps installed that cause the phones to behave strangely.  I&#x27;ve never ran into this myself on an actual device used by someone.  However I also don&#x27;t install a bunch of random apps.  And neither does anyone in my family it seems (at least that I&#x27;m aware of--and I&#x27;m the go to for technical issues within my extended family).  So my opinion here is limited.  I&#x27;d also add that Apple&#x27;s rules create &quot;nonsense&quot; in some peoples opinions (app developers for one, but also iPhone owners who can&#x27;t install what they want, or can&#x27;t pay the way they want to pay).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I also interact with iPhone(s) on a daily basis (for testing software primarily).')
