Electricity &gt; movement &gt; heat. To go down the chain is almost free, to go up the chain you have to spend quite a lot.<p>You can do a lot of things with electricity: you can heat things, but also move them around and run your TV, all without any loss. With heat you can just... heat things. So you can&#x27;t call this an &quot;iron battery&quot;, because you don&#x27;t get electricity out of it, just heat. Maybe call it a &quot;heat battery&quot; or &quot;high performance heat pad&quot;.<p>Also note the efficiency numbers: &quot;High-efficiency electrolysis of iron oxide can store as much as 80 percent of your input energy in the iron fuel&quot; is the efficiency of the process itself. &quot;Using this kind of cyclical process to generate electricity could approach a theoretical efficiency around 40 percent&quot; is because you need to climb the ladder to low entropy again (probably by using the equivalent of a steam engine to run a generator).')
