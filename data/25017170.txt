Like how putting parental advisory warnings made a cd&#x2F;album even more desirable. Or how a banned books list is a form of advertising and draws more interest to the banned books.<p>And lets not forget the streisand effect. How many people are now actually going to trump&#x27;s twitter just to view the &quot;bad tweets&quot; now?<p>Everyone here understands the streisand effect&#x2F;etc here but fail to see how it also applies to trump. Trump is literally using hate&#x2F;opposition as a form of free advertising. He is using hate&#x2F;opposition to drive traffic to his twitter account. It&#x27;s unbelievable when you think about it.')
