It&#x27;s pretty complete.<p>Having a platform independent IR in AsmJit is not planned. AsmJit is more about control and ISA completeness. IR could of course be implemented on top of AsmJit, but it seems nobody really needed that so far - users that need complex IR can use LLVM and users that want something really simple can use SLJIT. AsmJit is just in a different category and it has a lot of useful features considering its size.')
