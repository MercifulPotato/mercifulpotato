I agree with you that an aggressor is more likely to initiate a strike if they believe they have a very high chance of a successful strike (where &quot;success&quot; is defined as destroying the target) and a very low chance of retaliation. However, the scenario we&#x27;re debating is one in which Russia has its own interceptors so the risk of a successful first strike (US striking Russia) is about the same as the likelihood Russia succeeds in retaliating.<p>If both nations have lots and lots of interceptors relative to the ICMB cap (assuming for the moment that both countries adhere to the ICMB cap), then the odds of any country initiating a successful strike (first or second) becomes relatively and equally low. At that point, it&#x27;s more effective to pursue conventional (i.e. non-nuclear) warfare, and even if a country does initiate a desperate nuclear strike, it&#x27;s less concerning because the odds of a catastrophic loss of life are significantly reduced.<p>Would you argue that we would be better off if we fought conventional wars without body armor of any kind? Or would you argue that this is somehow different than the interceptor question? If so, how is it different (degree vs kind and why)?<p>(By the way, I don&#x27;t see a US president--barring perhaps the current one who doesn&#x27;t seem concerned with his own best interest much less that of his country--accepting a 75% chance of the destruction of US cities in order to stop a Russian advance)')
