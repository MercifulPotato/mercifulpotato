It’s so interesting how the people I work with take advantage of this on a personal level as well. They leave the interests on their debt and leave and extra income on other avenues (stock market, real estate, etc). Another interesting idea is that tax is (relatively) low. So it’s smarter to invest in a Roth IRA rather than a 401K to take advantage of the tax rate.')
