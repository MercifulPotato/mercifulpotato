Life expectancy is only diminished by a few years for obesity. Much less than smoking.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;obesity-cuts-life-span-dramatically-studies-find&#x2F;article1009609&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;obesity-cuts-life-span-...</a><p>&gt;For example, a 20-year-old white male who, at age 20, weighs 200 pounds (90 kilograms), can expect to live one year less than if he weighed 185 pounds (83 kilograms). At 250 pounds (113 kilograms), his life expectancy falls by three years, and at 300 pounds (135 kilograms) by seven years.<p>250-pound person is not small by any stretch yet a 3-year reduction of life expectancy is just 3.7% reduction of an 80-year lifespan. I would not consider a 4% reduction to be much.<p>It only becomes dramatic if we&#x27;re talking BMIs above 45.<p>Obesity is a spectrum. Belly fat is obesity but so is being so overweight that you cannot move. We cannot just lump it all together.')
