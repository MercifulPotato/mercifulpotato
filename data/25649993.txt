It&#x27;s still an early alpha, but some members of our community have already found it very helpful. We&#x27;ve taken inspiration from online dating sites for some of the mechanics, but of course adapted the questions to expose the factors that we&#x27;ve found are most useful in a co-founder search.<p>If you&#x27;d like to give the service a try, create a profile on startupschool.org (it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you choose the &quot;active founder&quot; or &quot;future founder&quot; track for this purpose) and then visit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startupschool.org&#x2F;cofounder_matching_profile" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startupschool.org&#x2F;cofounder_matching_profile</a><p>Feel free to check it out! If you have any user feedback, you can let me know directly at kyle@ycombinator.com')
