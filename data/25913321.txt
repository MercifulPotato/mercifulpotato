I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;speaking free&quot; is a useful concept. I think it&#x27;s more useful to discuss controls on public vs private speech.<p>I believe that two consenting &quot;nazis&quot; should be able to speak privately on e2e platforms, mainly because this is the same mechanism that will let consenting marxists, christians, muslims, satanists, pro-life advocates, pro choice advocates... escape mainstream outrage.<p>I realise this is a security risk, in the same way that not having microphones everywhere in public spaces is a security risk.<p>Child exploitation and plotting terrorist acts are the &quot;biggest hills to die on&quot; in this space, but investigators have always had &quot;targeted&quot; means to deal with these without resorting to mass surveillance. I believe existing powers are adequate to investigate these crimes.<p>I&#x27;m also generally ok with mainstream censorship of broadcast or social media. Public speech is a different animal.')
