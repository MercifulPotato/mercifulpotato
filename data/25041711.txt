It&#x27;s not illegal. I just don&#x27;t like it and voted accordingly. I believe that type of person has a certain mindset. Entirely subjective.<p>The Iraq war proponents I think speaks for itself. Not interested in boots on the ground in Syria.<p>Second amendment rights, progressive taxation changes, not a fan. Who knows what other types of affirmative actions or different treatments based on race are planned in an effort to achieve this or that. Hints are: maybe. Don&#x27;t care for it. I don&#x27;t believe that works. Subjective, but since you asked. I actually believe Biden&#x2F;Harris do have a better healthcare plan then Trump who obviously has none.<p>As for the last part, there is pretty clear evidence at least &quot;some&quot; fraud occurred. Every election of this size has that.<p>Statistically I find the entire thing a bit suspicious. Gains in house but not Trump? Unlikely. Differences between similar ethnic groups in swing states and not swing state big cities? Possible. Suspicious. The 11&#x27;th hour timing and stop count? Suspicious. This kind of thing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;APhilosophae&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325593635996512257" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;APhilosophae&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325593635996512257</a>? Suspicious. None of this is proof. We will see what the courts say and what is able to be proved. Just... suspicious.<p>These big rust belt cities have had a lot of fraud. People have been indicted. A bunch. Philly? Detroit? I don&#x27;t think I need citations on this. So I&#x27;m supposed to believe after the past 4 years of shrill hatred and weekly allegations from the left now they don&#x27;t just this one time?<p>I hope my point is clear. It&#x27;s not Trump that undermines the process. It&#x27;s the way that it went down. He is supposed to just go along with what he thinks is fraudulent? Ignore possible threats to the democratic process?<p>I hope my point on that is clear anyway, that&#x27;s how I feel about that.')
