There are discussions to introduce complete Indian controlled app stores for the market as a response to Google and Apple tax. Wonder whether this would help for the monopolists to change the behavior.<p>Losing India means Google won&#x27;t have access to 36% of the world population in general. Not to mention that this would lead to similar behavior by other countries.')
