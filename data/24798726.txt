It was for a CTO job and I was asked to prepare and present a presentation on &quot;how to launch a product&quot; - I think I had 30 minutes to prepare and 30 minutes to give the presentation to their management team. This went really well.<p>Then the CEO wanted a quick chat and asked me a simple technical question - and I <i>could not do it</i>. My brain simply froze and he clearly thought I was an idiot or some marketeer pretending to be technical. The reverse being far closer to the truth!<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve interviewed a lot of people over the years and would never had believed this could happen until it happened to me.')
