Item(by='JoeCamel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605770340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144910, text='&gt; Why start calling things 2-vectors, when you could call them 2-forms and people would know what you were talking about?<p>There is more to 2-forms. Also, to be precise, they are functions from a vector space to the scalar field (usually reals). Sure, they form a (dual) vector space but I think it would be more confusing to call GA elements k-forms.')
