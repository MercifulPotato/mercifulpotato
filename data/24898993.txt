It was latency and error handling.<p>At the start of my morning commute, I would say, &quot;Ok Google, navigate to work&quot;.<p>Often, this would fail because I was in the network limbo area outside my house, where my phone struggles to transition from home WiFi to data.<p>Worst of all: The failure would be horribly slow. I would have to drive for another 30s before my phone realized, yes, we are really out of WiFi range now. And the voice command wouldn&#x27;t be auto-retried. I would have to tell my phone again. It didn&#x27;t remember.<p>I added one-touch &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Work&quot; Google Maps widgets to my home screen and never looked back.<p>As an engineer, I realize why this is a tricky problem. As a consumer, I want it to &quot;just work&quot;.')
