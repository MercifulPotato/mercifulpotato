Item(by='Someone', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609602731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613318, text='Capitals can be very much eccentric in a state (the distance from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Helena, Montana is (eyeballing) about three times that to Denver, Colorado, for example, but I would say Wyoming borders Montana about as much as it borders Colorado)<p>Average distance of all pairs of points in the two states (hm, maybe not. That could behave weirdly for states that aren’t very ‘compact’) or geometric mean of the fraction of a state’s border shared with the neighboring state would be fairer. Or maybe, the geometric mean of the fraction of the area of State S is closest to state T and the fraction of the area of state T that is closest to S?<p>Alternatively, make the states clusters, add all cities on highways as vertices, and use highways stretches between cities as edges.')
