Banks hold and invest money in more secure ways, hedge funds usually pursue more aggressive strategies in order to hopefully get returns that are uncorrelated with the greater market.<p>Second, the narrative that Reddit drove the short squeeze is mostly a lie that has been repeated over and over again both because it&#x27;s cute and because people want to believe they have significant power. In reality, many institutions also saw this coming, and when they saw the WallStreetBets subreddit getting ready to pump (yes they watch Reddit), they also piled on. They&#x27;ve mostly done it quietly so as to not disturb the convenient narrative that this is a David vs Goliath story, but really this was driven by big money. It&#x27;s just a nice side effect that a lot of early retail investors have made a lot of money as well.<p>And yes, it is absolutely true that the end result of this will be retail investors getting slaughtered. Especially because of all the hype on WallStreetBets and elsewhere, there is a LOT of dumb money in the market who have no exit plan, and their lunch will get eaten when the large institutions exit at the top and trigger a GME free fall.')
