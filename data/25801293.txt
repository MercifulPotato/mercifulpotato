Perhaps you can just reward good behavior?<p>So based on what you said, why would I just not message a coworker?: “Hey Dan thanks for pushing that bug fix so fast!” Personal acknowledgment and appreciation goes a long way. I’m not sure this score board really adds much more to that dynamic.<p>Another thing I’m thinking is...this is a “vitamin” idea, not a “pain killer” idea. Meaning it’s not solving a pain point so you have an uphill battle to convince folks to even spend billable engineering hours to try it out.<p>Sales advice: Seek to understand, respond less. Try to ask calibrated questions to learn why someone came to their conclusion&#x2F;objection, over responding directly to it. This is where you learn the stuff that helps you iterate. I know it’s hard, it probably feels like you have to “defend” because it’s an “attack on you”— but it’s not.<p>Actually.. this same advice applies to people leadership too.<p>Also...it helps to thank people for their feedback. They took time out of their lives to help. :-)')
