And Debian (or maybe Devuan) Linux (then installing something like LXDE or XFCE) isn&#x27;t perfect, but it <i>is</i> very easy to install and manage, IMO, and they have a great track record of stability (compared to others anyway), due to how to they manage security, freedom, and overall stability (for example, what you learn is likely to last a long time w&#x2F;o having to relearn, relatively few bad surprises, excellent documentation, etc.  I like OpenBSD, but if I couldn&#x27;t, next would probably be Debian or Devuan for more reasons I have posted on HN at other times.  Further opinions&#x2F;links on these at my web site...)<p>Edit: I installed Debian for my wife and a number of other locals.  It was easy.  I recommend adding the package that installs automatic updates (as root:  aptitude install unattended-upgrades), and setting &quot;umask 0007&quot; in the default profile, and learning a little, can recommend some other things.  BUT: my wife (a public school special ed teacher) doesn&#x27;t know about those things and doesn&#x27;t have to.  People can use it without &quot;learning linux&quot; or having more than 5 min or general orientation, just like they used Windows XP, to do all their browsing, whatever, thousands of free apps available, and then one can grow from there, at one&#x27;s own pace!  :)')
