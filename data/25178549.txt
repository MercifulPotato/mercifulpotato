I learned Swedish, though I am not proficient; I am passable. I became a cognitive scientist after 40, after being a lawyer for most of my career (new skills: reading&#x2F;writing scientific papers, designing experiments, statistical analysis that I hadn&#x27;t done in 20 years, etc). I learned how to bake (bread, mostly), though I knew pretty well how to cook in general since I was young, so this maybe wasn&#x27;t too difficult.')
