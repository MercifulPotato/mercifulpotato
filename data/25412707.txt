I came across it maybe a year or two ago and I love how it lines up with my thinking. I rely on search as well but over and over I come back to the basic issue that search only offers up things you know to search for. A category system like this one resolves some of the anxiety that comes along with trying to establish a universal category system, while also organizing things to support future exploration and discovery.<p>One thing that stuck with me when I wanted to experiment with this system is the fear of exhausting the top level namespace: the system as described blocks the first number into areas of ten. I remember feeling like it would be pretty normal to need more subcategories in some areas than others and worrying about running out.<p>On reflection I think that&#x27;s probably more of an academic problem, and that if I took the dive things would work out. I would be curious about whether there are any suggestions around for how to handle it if you&#x27;re running short on areas to assign.')
