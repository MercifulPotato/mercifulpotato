By only letting their libraries use these special instructions Apple retains the freedom to radically change how this hardware works later. They could remove or add AMX instructions.<p>Depends on whether these instructions can be executed with unprivileged user-land code.  Once the genie is out of the bottle, backward compatibility means imitating the old instruction set.  Since a recompile is often cheap enough (and esp. if coprocessor calls can be remapped at the bitcode compilation time), this should be a non-issue.')
