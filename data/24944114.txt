Item(by='coder543', descendants=None, kids=[24944304], score=None, time=1604076380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943926, text='Because a lot of your comments in this thread are &quot;missing the point&quot; or (unintentionally) misleading at best, and it&#x27;s easier for people to use a downvote to make those comments less prominent in the discussion than to go through the trouble of trying to explain why the comments are missing the point or unintentionally misleading.<p>But, a lot of people have gone through the effort to leave explanations in this case. Isn&#x27;t that good enough?<p>For one unaddressed example:<p>&gt; You can still use standard kernel-provided synchronization objects (mutex&#x2F;events&#x2F;semaphores) in your &quot;lock-free applications&quot;, as long as you provide timeouts to blocking wait() calls, and handle abandoned objects gracefully.<p>This might be technically true, but atomics provide significant performance benefits compared to using a mutex with a timeout, and I don&#x27;t think of &quot;lock free&quot; as relying on busy loops as you seem to think in your comments. I&#x27;m sure a busy loop makes sense in very specific algorithms, and mutexes themselves often use a limited amount of busy waiting to avoid context switches. You can simulate atomics with mutexes, but that&#x27;s not the point. Lock free is hard to do correctly. Mutexes create the possibility of a deadlock, which is incompatible with being lock-free, so you have to avoid all the footguns of lock-free <i>and</i> the footgun of using mutexes.<p>So, yes, you can use standard sync objects... but that doesn&#x27;t make anything better in this case. It misses the point. &quot;Technically correct&quot; isn&#x27;t always good enough to get an upvote.<p>If you don&#x27;t agree, that&#x27;s fine... but this is completely uncalled for and against the community guidelines:<p>&gt; This community has truly deteriorated over the years.<p>No one is obligated to upvote things they consider incorrect, and downvotes are perfectly suitable for this purpose under HN guidelines.')
