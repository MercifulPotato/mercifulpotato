Apple would do well to swiftly terminate their relationship and get in front with PR statements of their own and further acts to minimize blowback.  Then, when the head of security has his day in court, Apple will be vindicated.  Then, and only then, is it the head of security.  Until that point it’s entirely Apple (and why companies make such a big deal about anti-bribery training)<p>FWIW, it would be just as bad of a look if instead the head of security’s wife was engaged in this scheme at her own workplace.  And Apple would be 100% correct to still terminate their relationship for fear of bad press')
