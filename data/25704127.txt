These platforms aren&#x27;t even close to the only communication tool they can use why should one tool be forced to suffer them. My life is certainly better without seeing Trump&#x27;s asinine and sometimes dangerous commentary on Twitter if I want it I&#x27;ll go check my NewsNation app.<p>This right here is part of the problem. It&#x27;s the government they can post commentary on a us.gov twitter clone or blog or whatever. I don&#x27;t even agree that outside of government funds we should provide special treatment for our elected officials. We certainly have the resources to establish any communication tool they could possibly conceive of outside of private business.')
