I also talked to real people affected by the blast and claim they saw Jets as well. I would have loved it if the vid had tackled this and debunked it completely. I&#x27;m not claiming otherwise.<p>There was definitely military&#x2F;gov negligence and I even call kit suicidal levels of incompetence.<p>However, they never talk about the original owners of the ammonium nitrate to begin with. I remember it being said that it was a ship that was sinking so it had to be emptied at the port for temporary storage. I&#x27;m asking why did the original owner of 2 TONS of it never came to get it back?<p>I don&#x27;t think what I&#x27;m asking merits these kinds of answers.')
