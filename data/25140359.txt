I&#x27;ve interviewed probably 5-6 LS folks and over 10 folks from a large program in NYC (you can guess which one) and every time the program has given them an incredibly oversold sense of skill level.  They were unequivocally not prepared for the job they were interviewing for but were adamant that they were.  I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re given interview coaching where they&#x27;re coached to guide the interviewer towards things that are positive for them (projects they did in the program for example) and away from things that they&#x27;re not prepared for (such as questions actually relevant to the position).  I had one candidate straight up tell me that they were more senior than our senior developers because they spent a year or whatever &quot;living and breathing this stuff everyday, all day&quot; whereas our senior devs wasted their time at college and probably have the same amount of &quot;real practical experience&quot; as this program grad did even though they&#x27;d been working there for 3-5 years.  Maybe that&#x27;s gotten better over the past couple of years since I&#x27;ve interviewed regularly, but for a while it was a huge problem where they were ill prepared and then had this massive entitlement about it.  I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s how the programs were sold to them: finish it and you&#x27;ll waltz into a six figure job.<p>That&#x27;s not universal in these bootcamps&#x2F;programs, though.  I&#x27;ve interviewed a few Turing School folks that are awesome.  I&#x27;ve interviewed folks from several smaller programs from all over whose names escape me (a Seattle-based one, one in the midwest...can&#x27;t remember others) that have been fantastic.<p>I just _wish_ all of these programs were great at preparing folks and self-filtering on the backside, but unfortunately, I think many of them take their money (or hold out their hand when&#x2F;if they get hired), pass the people through no matter what, and fill their heads with the idea that they&#x27;re now prepared and deserve a job.')
