And even then only if they&#x27;re signed by the same user.<p>1. You can only execute binaries together if they&#x27;re signed by the same key.\n2. Each person has to have a unique signing key.\n3. If a user wants to execute a pre-existing software, and something compiled by themselves, both need to be signed by the same key.\n4. This means you need to re-package and sign every single program you&#x27;d ever want to use together with your own code again, in new packages, and submit it all to Google Play.<p>This means every Termux user that would want to ever run gcc would have to<p>(a) submit every single hello world they write to the play store to try it. And every single run requires a full app update, and\n(b) additionally repackage and submit <i>all</i> linux packages, signed with their own key, to the Play Store.<p>This means to even compile and run Hello World, you need to submit several hundredthousand packages to the Play Store, wait for approval, and download them all.<p>Yet at the same time, Google Chrome can use WebAPK and auto-generate APKs on the fly with custom code and install them on the device without going through the Play Store.<p>The alternative of course is not being able to use a phone as general purpose computing device, but considering Google advertised Android as exactly that, that&#x27;s getting close to fraud on Google&#x27;s part, removing functionality after a sale.')
