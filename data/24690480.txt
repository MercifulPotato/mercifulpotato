Item(by='price', descendants=None, kids=[24690672], score=None, time=1601922354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24688550, text='&gt; There are studies that school districts that dropped sports have better academic outcomes: [link]<p>I don&#x27;t see such a study described in that article. After not finding it, I searched for &quot;study&quot;, &quot;studies&quot;, and &quot;research&quot;, and still didn&#x27;t. Can you perhaps quote a key sentence from the bit you&#x27;re thinking of?<p>There is a story about one district that dropped football (not all sports), under severe budgetary pressure. Seems like the right choice. I should add some context that may not be obvious outside the US: that district is a small town in Texas, and Texas and especially its small towns are where high-school football is a really especially big deal. (My dad grew up in a small town in Texas.) In the rest of the country it&#x27;s generally not so extreme as it was in that town.')
