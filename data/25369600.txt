They receive public grants, sure, but they have a profitable launch business with the Falcon 9. Their requirement is that they can sustain themselves, not that they can keep their own internal project from being cancelled by directive of the US government.<p>On some level what the public (and really, it&#x27;s space nerds like us) think doesn&#x27;t really matter.
