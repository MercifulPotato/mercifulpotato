The most popular functional languages are substantially faster than the most popular imperative languages.<p>Haskell or OCaml both smoke the top 3 imperative languages: Python, Java, JavaScript.<p>The &quot;conceit&quot; is trading the conceptual model most people learn in high school&#x2F;trade programming classes for correctness, with little to no bearing on performance.<p>&gt; Rust is, as far as I&#x27;m aware, the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions.<p>This is definitely not the case. You can deploy zero-overhead functional concepts in C++ using template programming, constexprs, etc. Also, &quot;zero-overhead&quot; compared to what? Plenty of functional language have abstractions that can reasonably be described as zero-overhead, like newtypes in Haskell or functorial modules in OCaml. You can even translate the non-monomorphically-recursive subset of Haskell to pure hardware, which is pretty much the definition of &quot;zero overhead&quot;.<p>This article reads more like a regurgitation of taglines than original thinking.')
