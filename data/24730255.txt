That&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s being litigated.<p><i>Two inventors build the exact same thing</i><p>Patents don&#x27;t cover APIs, by the nature of their form as a patent typically must make a narrow list of claims. To patent the Java API would presumably require making the entire specification a set of claims, which the PTO wouldn&#x27;t accept.<p>You could argue APIs should be patentable but not copyrightable. That&#x27;d be weird though. Copyright is clearly the better fit, if you want APIs to be protected works.<p><i>Clean room designs are the status quo in the hardware world. There is zero fragility. It&#x27;s done all the time.</i><p>No. The hardware world is the exact opposite of what you claim. ARM sells ISA licenses exactly because in the hardware world the Oracle side won out a long time ago: if you want to implement the ARM instruction set you need to pay ARM for the privilege. And if you want to use ARM&#x27;s implementation you need to pay them even more. AMD can only make Intel-compatible chips because they have an architecture license for complex historical reasons, and so on.')
