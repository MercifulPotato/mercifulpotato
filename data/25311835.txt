As a rough estimate I&#x27;d place it closer to the top 10% of the US. The 1% threshold is around $500k, whereas the 10% threshold is around $100k, which is pretty luxurious most places in the US (confounded by the fact that higher CoL areas have higher incomes).<p>On the other end of the spectrum, 50-70% of US families were living paycheck to paycheck even before covid, so I&#x27;d be moderately surprised if the top 25% could afford whatever they wanted at the supermarket.')
