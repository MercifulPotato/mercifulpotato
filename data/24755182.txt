That&#x27;s literally what is is. We can obfuscate this by replacing the words &quot;encroachment on free speech&quot; with &quot;heavy-handedness&quot; to get the sentence above. But really what is says if we remove the obfuscation is:<p>&gt; This encroachment on free speech isn&#x27;t an encroachment on free speech<p>That makes no sense.<p>Again, it may be a good idea, but censorship with a good reason remains censorship, or as you put it, an encroachment on free speech.')
