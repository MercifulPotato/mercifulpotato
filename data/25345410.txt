It had a bad SRAM chip or something which would result in all of the payloads having a stuck bit every 8 bytes. However, the FCS was calculated _after_ that, so it was still a valid frame.<p>My guess is AT&amp;T has some hardware that&#x27;s recalculating the checksums after the frame has already been corrupted.')
