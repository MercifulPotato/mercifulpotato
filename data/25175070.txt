Reading and playing are expected to happen in real time, and the physical &#x2F; mental skill to do those things is typically developed when people are fairly young. It&#x27;s not impossible, but learning a new kind of instrument or a new notation system gets exponentially more difficult with age.<p>With either instruments or notation, introducing something &quot;better&quot; requires people to make a serious commitment to starting practically from scratch and sucking for a long, long time, before being able to do anything productive. It&#x27;s not fear, it&#x27;s reality of knowing the limits of our brains and our bodies.<p>If you&#x27;re a composer or arranger, you have to write in a standard notation in order for anybody to play your stuff. Developing a new notation system to the point of finding out if it&#x27;s actually workable for reading sophisticated music in a performance setting would be a staggering undertaking. Likewise for an experimental keyboard layout. One reason why pianists like the crooked layout is that it provides visual and tactile guidance as to where things are. You can find your way around the keyboard, drunk and blindfolded. The fact that each key has its own personality becomes a feature, not a bug, in the hands of a good player.<p>But despite these challenges, there is extensive exploration of novel instrument layouts and designs, often conducted in an academic setting. Music is not as static as one might think. A pianist at the University of Wisconsin has developed a piano with a smaller keyboard.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madison.com&#x2F;wsj&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;music&#x2F;a-smaller-piano-for-bigger-artistry&#x2F;article_38b80090-be0f-5050-9862-32c3c36c6930.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madison.com&#x2F;wsj&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;music&#x2F;a-smaller-piano-...</a>')
