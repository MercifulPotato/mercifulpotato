At least not unless EU negotiators screwed up the contract. Otherwise AZ could simply just over-promise and then leave the EU high and dry.<p>I mean, it is a pretty clear omission in the agreement given that this was probably the #1 question from the EU going in. These agreements are specifically structured so that there is no down side for underperforming on delivery, because it is a high risk activity and no company would agree to harsh penalties.<p>The agreement is very clear about what happens if the EU commission enters contracts that limit capacity but silent on AZ agreements. Section 6.2 Capacity limitations:<p>&gt;In the event AZ&#x27;s ability to fulfil obligations under this agreement is impeded by a competing agreement entered into by or or on behalf of the commision, AZ shall promptly inform the commission. While AZ shall continue to use Best Reasonable Efforts to engage with its own CMOs and supplies to utilize the capacity and&#x2F;or components, the commision will assist in finding a mutually acceptable solution for the agreement and the competing agreement. To the extent AstraZeneca&#x27;s performance under this agreement is impeded by any such competing agreements, AstraZeneca shall not be deemed in breach of this agreement as a result if any such delay due to the aforementioned competing agreement(s)<p>Similarly, &quot;Best Reasonable Effort&quot; is clearly defined in Section 1.9 as industry standard for vaccine delivery:<p>(1) in the case of AZ, the activity as and degree of effort that a company of similar size with a similarly sized infrastructure and similar resources as AZ would undertake or use in the development and manufacture of a Vaccine at the relevant stage of development or commercialization having regard to the urgent need for a Vaccine to end the global pandemic...<p>This is really more about dedicating the appropriate resources to the task opposed to allocation. IF someone wanted to stretch it to make it about contract priority, I don&#x27;t think voiding contracts and shipping supply based on population is industry standard.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;ip_21_302" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;ip_21_...</a>')
