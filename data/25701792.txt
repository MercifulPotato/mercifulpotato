The problem is moral: they want to <i>force women to be pregnant against their will</i>. What is there to discuss? What would it benefit <i>women who don’t want to be forced to be pregnant against their will</i> for me to consider it more? Who would it convince? Who is going “oh maybe I don’t want to force women to be pregnant against their will, but this guy is certain about it so I’m gonna have to go ahead and force them after all”?')
