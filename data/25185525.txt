Mental Harrasment on Instagram [Urgent]', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='A guy on Instagram by the username https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;_c_l_i_f_f&#x2F; has been harassing me by accusing me of things I never did. I blocked the guy, but now I am absolutely terrified of what could happen next. To sound tough, I told the guy &quot;I have insulted a lot of people, you wouldn&#x27;t be the first or the last.&quot; He also said a girl, which I have absolutely no knowledge of, asked him to approach me and he&#x27;s getting paid for it. Is there anyone on HN who can help me?')
