The problem was that spammers would be able to flood the network with crap so to counter that it was added that proof of work must be completed to have your message forwarded on. The problem with this is it means you could not send a message from a mobile device because the PoW required was too high.<p>Also a method to reduce the amount of traffic required was called streams. Instead of reviving all messages, you would be able to know what stream the receiver is on and then the receiver would just listen to all messages on stream 5. This scales up infinitely since you can just balance the network so all streams have hundreds of thousands of users on them.')
