The up side is once you get used to your tool, you can do really cool things and navigate&#x2F;change code in higher level ways. But the massive downside (in my experience), is convincing coworkers to adopt a Lisp is practically impossible. The language itself being so foreign, and when they ask about the parentheses bringing up a tool they need to learn on top of the language is a double whammy.')
