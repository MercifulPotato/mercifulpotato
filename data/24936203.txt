Item(by='neilparikh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604007180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930148, text='&gt; Conventional market theory assumes that supply will rise to meet demand<p>The supply of land (in the economic sense) is fixed, and will never increase.<p>&gt; How do homeless people maintain wealthy people?<p>It&#x27;s not homeless people that maintain land wealth, but rather those without land. Land only has any value at all because it commands a rent (in excess of its holding costs), and that is only the case because there are people who don&#x27;t own in land (in areas they&#x27;d like to be), and thus have to pay rents to those with land.<p>The &quot;increasing supply by increasing density&quot; route will reduce costs on units, but it will leave the portion of wealth owned by the landed class untouched.')
