E.g. Gitweb and WebGitNet are not analogous to &quot;github.com&quot;.<p>Most devs are not interested in self-hosting a git repo so looking at a list of web frontends for git isn&#x27;t solving the problem.<p><i>&gt;, without the community&#x2F;social aspect of github.</i><p>There are at least 3 categories of social interactions on github:<p>+ Issues<p>- PRs<p>+ Discussions<p>... and for the repo of this particular thread, the developer is still using +Issues and +Discussions.  He just wants to opt out of PRs for the reasons stated in README.md.')
