And I&#x27;ve just learned this lesson with a $60 bill from Nintendo repair after the port went pop and couldn&#x27;t charge the device. I only have reputable chargers in the house from Apple and one from Anker aside from the Nintendo&#x27;s own.<p>All my apple kit works fine off the Apple chargers, but I do have an external hard drive that has mixed Thunderbolt 3&#x2F;USB 3.1 ports, which are absolutely not the same.<p>I love the port, but the standard just hasn&#x27;t caught up and when a company like Nintendo flouts it anyway, you have a big problem.')
