Failing your duty to inform is very close to fraud and in many cases crosses right over into fraud. This can get you in very hot water depending on the jurisdiction and the willingness of the counterparty to sue. Typically such cases are settled out of court, the settlements are usually not small and could easily cost you control of the company.<p>Most parties are aware of this and will do their very best to avoid going down that road, the few idiots that don&#x27;t usually end up in a bad way though some may get lucky.')
