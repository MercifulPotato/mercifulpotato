The British failed. The USSR failed. The US failed once already, and will fail again. We can fail after killing 600K and spending $3T. Or we can fail after killing 1.5M and spending $6T. But we _will_ fail regardless. It is not possible to win an unconventional land war with people who are fighting for their own land.<p>All these &quot;robots&quot; are basically technological masturbation: great for milking the taxpayer and nothing else. They do not change the situation on the ground, especially when you&#x27;re fighting with a bunch of semi-literate dudes with Kalashnikovs who are not afraid to die.')
