I take advantage of 3PL companies in Shenzhen, as well as Amazon FBA in the US (and Europe soon) to make sure that it&#x27;s easy for customers anywhere in the world to buy the product.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve sold close to 10k units and the the only clones I&#x27;ve seen were made by a student in Iran for personal use.')
