They way these things work there will probably be chips and boards available in another 12 months.<p>The VIU75 core was also just announced as available for licensing. That&#x27;s a U74 plus RISC-V Vector extension (more like SVE than NEON).<p>Obviously ARM has already moved on from the A72 and they&#x27;re up to A78 now with I think the A76 the latest actually shipping in devices (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S20). But RISC-V is catching up pretty quickly considering that four years ago there was no RISC-V chips shipping at all.<p>Also A72 to A78 is just incremental improvements, much like Nehalem to Sandy Bridge to SkyLake in x86. Of course the newer ones are better, but there are plenty of people out there still happily using Sandy Bridge.')
