When there&#x27;s not enough contiguous space to perform a metadata copy (it&#x27;s a copy on write filesystem, no in-place overwrites!) then it returns an error, even if there&#x27;s still some free but fragmented space or some free space in the data block groups. A rebalance when metadata blockgroup total size diverges significantly from actual use should solve this.<p>For small filesystems there also is the option to choose mixed block groups, then there won&#x27;t be the situation where there&#x27;s still free space in the data groups while the metadata groups are full.')
