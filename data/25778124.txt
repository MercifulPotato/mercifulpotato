Item(by='creeble', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610640902, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776052, text='I bought my Tesla with 335k of its 340k miles on it. A bit of an experiment.<p>Not one feature was broken except one USB port, which I was able fix myself. Headlights were replaced once before I bought it (HID, not LED) and the motor was replaced under warranty in its first year.  I had the front sway bar link replaced because it made a little clunk. It still has the original brakes on the rear (which I&#x27;m about to replace, myself, they&#x27;re readily available outside Tesla). This is a <i>third year</i> Model S, remember. They&#x27;ve come a long way since.<p>There are places where the fit of the carpeting could be better; looking at new Model 3s, all such fit and finish issues seem far ahead.  Still, mine&#x27;s better by and large than my 2006 Jeep.<p>There are plenty of Tesla owners that have problems with their cars, and Tesla&#x27;s customer service experience varies widely between service centers. But to say that someone else has had more problems with their Tesla than any other brand is just an unlucky Tesla owner. Or one that has never owned an Audi or a Land Rover or a Jeep or a Cadillac or a Jaguar or a first-gen Kia or a lot of other cars.<p>That Tesla could even make <i>any</i> brand-new car, in America, in the 21st century, is miraculous. The fact that it is a revolutionary car only adds to what you call a distortion field.<p>(Edit: cutesy naming? It uses [until Model 3] an AC synchronous motor, invented by Nikola Tesla. It couldn&#x27;t be a more appropriate name, imho.)')
