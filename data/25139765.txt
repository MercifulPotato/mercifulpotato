I did not say that they were not serious. I said, and maintain, that non-one was going to seriously suggest restarting the war or act on such suggestion. No if you tell me that the SK&#x27;s military command was seriously <i>advising</i> to restart the war then I would tell you that either this is BS or that some generals should have been sacked (and perhaps they were).<p>This is not normalcy bias. This is keeping lucid and realising, as said and repeated, that war in Korea is not a realistic prospect, instead of going all Dr Strangelove after watching to many movies.<p>Again, the Korean War was painful for all involved at the time. Today war is simply not possible anymore by any assessment of the situation.<p>The worst thing that could realistically happen in Korea is a collapse of North Korean regime. This could trigger a limited civil war but everyone would have an interest in limiting the fallout, and this is why people tend to be very cautious about any suggestion of effecting &quot;regime change&quot; in the North.')
