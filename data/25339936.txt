Is that enough to disqualify you from JetBrains criteria, do you think?<p>In email from travis support it was expressed as:<p>&gt; Project must not be sponsored by a commercial company or organization (monetary or with employees paid to work on the project)<p>To me, that seems to say if someone commits code while on the clock, that is employees paid to work on the project.<p>That definitely disqualifies a huge number of open source projects, probably the majority, right?')
