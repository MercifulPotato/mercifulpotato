Our office is closed on Fridays, so we&#x27;ll have to schedule that call for Tuesday, because one of our suppliers is closed on Mondays.&quot;<p>Sounds like your company&#x27;s bus factor is too low. This is such an obtuse and presumptuous observation. How do companies open 7 days a week exist when the work week is 5 days?! Just because your employees only work 4 days doesn&#x27;t mean the company is only open for business 4 days. You can shift your employees in such a way as to avoid these pitfalls. Use your imagination a bit.')
