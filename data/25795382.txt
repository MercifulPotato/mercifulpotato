I say “was” because the circumstances have changed and there are much better alternatives around.<p>Circa 2000 or so, if you wanted to stick a simple, self-contained language in your app for extensions and scripting, Lua was one of the <i>very</i> few reasonable choices. There are a ton of reasons why you might not want to stick TCL, Guile, or Python inside your application.<p>So Lua was used not only in the WoW UI but in a bunch of other apps from that era, and gained a lot of social traction that way. Among other things, if you were making a game, Lua let your level designers and UX people write a little bit of code without having to get their hands dirty with C++ (which nobody wants). The language is very off-putting otherwise.')
