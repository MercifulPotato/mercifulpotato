Range has not been an issue since 2015, and the marginal increase in consumer demand won&#x27;t go up much if a $150k 500 mile electric hits the market.<p>The real issue for electric is that a 300 mile electric costs more than $35k because the world wide battery production capacity is limited.<p>If solid state batteries are easier to produce and the price comes down faster than lithium ion then there might be a crossover point by 2030.  Until then, this probably means cooler high end sports cars (formula E?)')
