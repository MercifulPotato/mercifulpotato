The pricing was originally a huge block for me.  I emailed them (elitan here on HN) to talk about pricing.  He took my feedback and ended up giving me a big discount on a single project. Overall I was very impressed with the attention and customer service I got.<p>I don&#x27;t really use Nhost for anything currently, but I&#x27;m definitely rooting for them. The product is really well made, and is exactly what I was looking for at the time (a completely managed Hasura instance). For their sake, I wish they didn&#x27;t have to compete with the insanely generous free tier of Firebase, as that&#x27;s nearly impossible to compete with as a new company. I think the Nhost pricing model becomes much more reasonable as you scale in size.<p>I hope to have the need to use Nhost again in the future. Would recommend.')
