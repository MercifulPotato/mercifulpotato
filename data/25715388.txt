The big social platforms are *Private Companies*, NOT public utilities. They can do whatever they want.<p>On the other hand, these platforms have amplified voices that would otherwise not even attain local coverage. Being coldly objective, they also make it possible for State Actors to punch way, way above their weight in an information warfare perspective (see Russia).<p>It&#x27;s also very important to remember that social media and modern 24 hour WWF-style &quot;Journalism&quot; WOULD NOT EXIST without near constant levels of conflict content to drive engagement. So there are entire very large business domains where there is existential threat were there to be regulation of content.<p>Net-net, the best possible outcome of all of this would be the demise of platforms like FB, Twitter, FoxNews, CNN, BBC, et. al as they really only serve to rapidly diminish the IQ&#x27;s of the electorate&#x2F;culture.... Of course that won&#x27;t happen because culturally we are beyond weak and have long since surrendered our future to a small group of people with the wealth to supersede most if not all Government controls (including the UK of course, I mean do you really think Boris Johnson has the stones for doing <i>anything</i> other than running his pie-hole like Trump has for the last 4 years??).')
