If there <i>is</i> a documented style rule, follow it. If there is <i>not</i> a documented style rule, you cannot block <i>this PR</i> with the style objection.<p>This avoids really annoying issues of &quot;I don&#x27;t like how this is written [for style reasons]&quot; in PR feedback. I&#x27;m not a mind reader, I don&#x27;t whether you prefer for..in over Array.foreach or whatever, my PR shouldn&#x27;t be blocked because of that. If you want new rule, go propose one and we can discuss &amp; vote on it later but it doesn&#x27;t apply to <i>this</i> PR.<p>This avoids the issue of &quot;style rules are determined by whoever has the greatest capacity for argument &amp; is willing to block PRs over it.&quot; It goes to a discussion &amp; vote and everyone can agree once then stop talking about it. :)')
