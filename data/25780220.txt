Virtually a 25 cents to him - .000086<p>Adelson spent something like $500mm over a decade and he probably has 75% or more of the &#x27;credit&#x27; for changing pro-Isreal policy.<p>Bezos and the rest of them could put a few billion into treasuries and still not lose any basis just use the dividends politically.<p>In addition if they stopped following shareholder primacy Bezos could direct Amazon to repatriate profits continually and pay the tax. Stop relying on legal &#x27;loopholes&#x27; to lower tax % and just pay in &#x27;best faith&#x27; and stop pitting local governments against each other in a race to the bottom.<p>Hell they could even send a check to Treasury but spending only a billion $ lobbying for new laws would be more effective and longer term.<p>--<p>Personally I&#x27;d like to see something like a sovereign wealth fund that benefits social security&#x2F;healthcare and directly supports the bottom 40%. Look to Alaska as an example.<p>Each &#x27;bailout&#x27; the taxpayers should get a % of shares for their investment, basically free money from the Fed which is supposed to make its money back anyways. Fannie&#x2F;Freddit&#x2F;TARP is an odd example something more like UAE, Norway but passive and only US companies<p>Go further and make it part of taxes for the mega corps only. 14% profit + a small % of shares annually.<p>We don&#x27;t have to turn into CCP with control over Corporate direction. Simply hold the shares passively.<p>Have to figure out something where corps have no dividends. Maybe a set yearly sale %.<p>I think about how beneficial it would be to give $1600 cash right now and match another $1600 to each individual in basically a retirement index fund that is only accessible in ___ years or ___ first time homebuyer etc circumstances like a new type of IRA. Hell the government could take a cut in ___ years and it would pay for itself.')
