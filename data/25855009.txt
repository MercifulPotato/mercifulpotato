I have seen plenty of tech-related fixes and features that come directly from Hacker News comments.<p>But the comment wasn&#x27;t bringing up anything new about GNOME.  There is no information someone from GNOME could get from that post, no matter how it was worded.  It is not a constructive vs. snark situation.<p>&gt; In all I think the best feedback I can give you would have been to include a `&#x2F;s` to indicate sarcasm and jest.<p>It seems like the same argument would have happened anyway, so eh.')
