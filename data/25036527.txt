Why isn&#x27;t there a Firefox CVE on the list from the same time? Was the bug not exploitable in Firefox for some reason, or is this list just incomplete?<p>(Never mind that comparing counts of CVEs is a ridiculous way to compare security of products. CVE counts seem more indicative of the amount of research targeting the product than of the number of bugs in the product.)')
