Product reviews on HN, tech oriented in-detail sites, youtube reviews from gamers, and long term analysts, like Ark Invest, and even github issues&#x2F;comments are much better long term predictors of success&#x2F;failure.<p>Just as an example, I remember reading a lot about AirBnB here at HN when it wasn&#x27;t even known in Eastern Europe. I suggested him to use it to rent out his luxury apartment that he just bought there, and he was the first one to rent out a luxury apartment in the country (also somebody from AirBnB-s management flew there personally)...he made lots of money from rental fees of course, but also AirBnB got incredibly successful. There are lots of other examples of course, this was just the least controversial that I can write here :)')
