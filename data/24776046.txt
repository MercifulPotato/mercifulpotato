So when I seen news of this yesterday I wrote into their support saying I was not pleased with it.<p>Their response was some random canned response about how you can still export your data. I&#x27;m not a fan of lock in, and I&#x27;m even less thrilled about not actually responding to my actual questions and instead giving me some canned BS.<p>I responded back telling them thanks for not even reading my question and responding with a canned response, then asked for instructions on how to delete my account. I haven&#x27;t heard back. For what it&#x27;s worth I wasn&#x27;t rude in any of this, I was straight and to the point, but I was not rude. Now they seem to be simply ignoring me.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not spending my money with this service any more. I used to feel a tiny bit sad for them competing with Apple and their whole complaint against Apple and payment stuff. But after seeing this shitty set of responses from them I just no longer care, it feels like they&#x27;ve brought at least some of this on themselves.<p>As a sidenote, I&#x27;m sort of fed up with customer support in general these days. Snippeted answers are great when they make sense. I.e. a user is asking a simple question, you can take the approach of some personalization sprinkled with snippets to make your life easier and your messaging more consistent. But when you have an unhappy, or upset customer, the last thing you should do is throw in some canned response that doesn&#x27;t even address their concerns.')
