Dell, hp, and Lenovo have a whole bunch of different models for different laptops. They&#x27;re also very customizable, so the model may be slightly different if you want different hardware. But you&#x27;re arguing for less consumer choice. Dell, hp, and Lenovo do not swap models around to try to fool consumers. Quite the contrary; you can search a very old model number and find exactly what you&#x27;re looking for on their site.')
