Item(by='fossuser', descendants=None, kids=[25492265], score=None, time=1608523909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491822, text='Well if there <i>is</i> a spread then you have some other options (second market, third party exercise) and you already have some return. If it&#x27;s valued at significantly greater than when you joined you&#x27;re in a decent position.<p>&gt; &quot;Note that appreciation in the value of Facebook stock between 2012 and 2020 doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Anyone could have bought Facebook stock in 2012 and seen those gains&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t really true - FB is kind of an exception since it went down after IPO, but in the general case regular investors don&#x27;t usually have the ability to get in at the initial price. Also later in a company&#x27;s life employees are more likely to be granted RSUs instead of options. Holding RSUs is different than dumping in money on IPO day as an outsider (even exercising options gives you some buffer that makes it lower risk).<p>I don&#x27;t know what FB&#x27;s 409a was in 2010, but I&#x27;ve had friends at FB, Snap, AirBnB, Slack, Palantir, Tesla all do extremely well from their pre-IPO equity and none (except for Snap) were super early employees.<p>Yes there&#x27;s risk in exercising options, you can mitigate that by choosing well. It&#x27;s worth taking it seriously when evaluating comp.<p>I&#x27;d also argue the opportunity cost&#x2F;downside risk here is not so bad either. Salaries at modern VC startups are pretty good anyway. You can make the bet and just work at your preferred megacorp if it doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>Also - I appreciate the back and forth, the reason I push a little on this issue on HN is because I think it misleads new grads who read these comments into thinking they shouldn&#x27;t value equity, I think the answer is more nuanced.')
