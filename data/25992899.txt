ADHD is, bar none, <i>the</i> mental health diagnosis most amenable to medication. Specifically, stimulant therapy. There&#x27;s no principled distinction between self-medicating and prescriptions here, other than various legal risks, costs, and side effect profiles. Caffeine is particularly poorly suited to this due to adaptation and anxiety, but it&#x27;s certainly <i>something</i>, especially if you aren&#x27;t a regular user. Amphetamine is the first-line treatment choice for a reason, and it makes a night-and-day difference tbh.')
