We experimentally evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of existing techniques, and compared them with our own baseline, a general-purpose, parallel, in-memory Datalog solver (RecStep) built upon a rdbms.<p>&quot;We presented the necessary optimizations and guidelines to achieve efficiency, and demonstrated that RecStep is scalable, applicable to a range of application domains, and is competitive with highly op- timized and specialized Datalog solvers.&quot;<p>vldb.org&#x2F;pvldb&#x2F;vol12&#x2F;p695-fan.pdf (2019)')
