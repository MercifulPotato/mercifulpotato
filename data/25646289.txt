The author also seems to have a bias against the people screaming &quot;inflation&quot;. That is pretty obvious from the title. To show real inflation, I like using the Burger King whopper as an example. In the early 90&#x27;s I remember being able to buy 4 whoppers for $1. With the advancement of farming technology, transportation technology, preservation technology, etc.... Why do we see the whopper cost over $7 now?')
