It took every bit of 15 minutes to get usable locks and data. It probably took longer. Sometime I&#x27;d be at work before the map started moving.<p>I have a little clip-on geotracker I bought in 2010 that I use for cross-country train trips. It takes at least 10 minutes to lock on, and since it can only be either &quot;on&quot; or &quot;charging,&quot; but not both, there are long gaps in the tracks on the maps.')
