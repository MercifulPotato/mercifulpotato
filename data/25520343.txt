I heard so many stories when I was in the NY office, like facilities not being allowed to do anything about the big gaps along the stall doors in the tenth floor bathrooms until they bought the building for $2B and everything was torn down. Or the two years it took to get approval to place the stupid logos on the outside. They weren&#x27;t even lighted, which would have definitely added extra years. Every month it was a different person&#x27;s turn at the city to reject the application, often for something that had been okay the previous time. There&#x27;s hell, and then there&#x27;s the NYC DOB.<p>The bathroom situation stank (pun not intended), but frankly there are other hills to die on.')
