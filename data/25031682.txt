My intuition suggests that if county size does not span enough orders of magnitude then Benford&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t apply because the distribution might lie in one of the &quot;spikes&quot; of the Benford curves, rather than reflecting the average. For example, if many counties had a population size starting with a &quot;4&quot;, you&#x27;d expect more vote counts to start with &quot;2&quot; (presuming each candidate received close to 1&#x2F;2 of the votes).<p>Hopefully someone with a stronger math background can expand in a more fluent way :)')
