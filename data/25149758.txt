It&#x27;s as if people want their cake and eat it, too. Yes, I&#x27;m aware of questionable practices that YouTube does, such as monitizing off of dead people, but I&#x27;m still astounded that people are upset about this change. Specifically, I&#x27;m referring to the expectation that one can upload a video - for free - and allow it be distributed with millions of views to the world - for free - and without ads. Google&#x27;s revenue model as always been ads so this change shouldn&#x27;t come as a shock to anyone. And judging from Google&#x27;s latest quarterly financial results on YouTube&#x27;s ads success, I&#x27;m personally confused why this wasn&#x27;t done sooner.')
