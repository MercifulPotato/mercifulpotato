This is my #1 problem with DDG and I complain about it in pretty much every DDG thread (while otherwise loving DDG).<p>For few result searches, DDG shows you essentially random stuff even if they have the result I want (which can be tested by searching for an exact sentence from the result page). On the other hand doing the search on Bing gives me the result without neutering my query.')
