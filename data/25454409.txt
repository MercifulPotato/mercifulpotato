It seemed really stupid to me before I learned about it. Why change what wasn&#x27;t broken?<p>Now after learning about it I&#x27;ll never go back to class components if it can be avoided and happily recommend hooks to all my clients who also end up loving them.<p>No idea what this promise chaining thing is that you&#x27;re talking about. Sounds like a bad design pattern that has nothing to do with hooks. No idea why you&#x27;re suggesting Redux has anything to do with hooks. They&#x27;re completely different.<p>This meme is dead. Only a superficial understanding of React, or ingrained bad programming pattern habits, keep this meme alive.')
