The fully-managed cloud-only variant is actually an API skin over Google App Engine. The &quot;for Anthos&quot; (n√©e &quot;for GKE&quot;) variant is Knative[0] in both API and sourcecode.<p>AWS could plausibly do exactly the same thing: provide a skin over Lambda that speaks Knative.<p>I think Amazon&#x27;s and Microsoft&#x27;s reluctance to wade into Knative has been wariness about Google&#x27;s intentions. And maybe 6 months ago I would have said &quot;fair enough, I would be cautious too&quot;. But the recent update to Knative&#x27;s governance model largely resolves the problem, in my view. I would very much like to see AWS and MS involvement.<p>[0] &quot;Knative&quot; is the correct spelling, FWIW.<p>Disclosure: I work for VMware, which participates in Knative development.<p>I also, like, wrote a book about it.')
