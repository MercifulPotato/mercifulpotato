I think it&#x27;s a bit wonky compared to the newer designs but it seems to work ok.<p>I&#x27;ve been upgrading parts the last few weeks, like adding a BLTouch for bed leveling and proper leadscrews instead of the threaded rods it came with. So far I&#x27;ve spent more time printing parts for the printer than anything else, haha.<p>Funny you mention the coffee hopper, I tried designing and printing a new wider holder for my Aeropress! It came out a good size and shape but the walls weren&#x27;t thick enough, and the whole cylinder detached when I tried to take it off the bed. Gotta get back into Blender and make some changes before I reprint it.')
