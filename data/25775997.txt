I&#x27;ve since forgotten much of it, but I was able to easily follow this &quot;uneducated&quot; accent.  At times I found myself not even needing to read the subtitles. I had forgotten some of the meanings, but I could pick out the words and structure. Compare this to when I was learning French: most of the spoken material was in a more modern accent and was spoken much more quickly (as is <i>de rigueur</i>). I wonder if some of these older accents may be useful in teaching.<p>Similarly I&#x27;ve been learning Spanish the past few years, and the most comprehensible accents are those from Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras--some of the poorest Spanish-speaking countries. I cannot for the life of me understand a heavy Mexican or Chilean accent, but I can easily follow Guatemalan. It&#x27;s interesting from a socio-linguistic perspective if nothing else.')
