The P README says:<p>“<i>P is a language for asynchronous event-driven programming. P allows the programmer to specify the system as a collection of interacting state machines, which communicate with each other using events. P unifies modeling and programming into one activity for the programmer. Not only can a P program be compiled into executable code, but it can also be systematically tested using Model Checking. P has been used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone. P is currently being used extensively inside Amazon (AWS) for model checking complex distributed systems.</i>”')
