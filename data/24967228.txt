Or it is data that was never mine in the first place. Plus, my google data is stored in 3 places: Google, Dropbox and local system. If 2 of them fail, I still have the other.<p>As to who can access that data, well, that&#x27;s a question for everybody isn&#x27;t it? If I would run my own server on the internet that would also be the same question.<p>So yes, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s MY data. I&#x27;m also protected by EU laws.')
