They&#x27;d worked with complex well designed systems that they hadn&#x27;t really understood and were reproducing a weird facsimile of it.<p>This is a very concise summary of most of the crypto&#x2F;blockchain projects out there. Ideas are cheap, and calling out that you understand the CAP theorem and basic distributed systems theory doesn&#x27;t mean you will be able to effectively solve problems as they practically arise.<p>However, it makes a lot of sense if you consider who the target audience of such whitepapers is. (I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not engineers.)<p>I also don&#x27;t think this generalization applies to all projects out there, but at this point, it seems like it&#x27;s become more than a full-time job to see beyond the cargo culting, shiny landing pages and jargon-filled &quot;whitepapers&quot;.')
