So you might dislike one person for certain attributes, but there‘s this other person you like with the same negative attributes, but in this case you don‘t weight them that much, it‘s easier to overlook them, because other positive attributes outweigh them.<p>So, what I‘m trying to say with this? I don‘t quite know, just a bit of a brain dump. Perhaps you‘re getting some hints for other podcasts.')
