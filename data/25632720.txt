We&#x27;d need to move ~60 full time in-house employees, ~10 remote contractors who aren&#x27;t on other comms channels, ~20 infrequent freelance contributors who may not check messages often, ~5 custom bots and apps, and ~15 3rd party integrations (of which some won&#x27;t support any given choice of alternative).<p>This is not to mention the fact that half our staff aren&#x27;t hugely technical, so have actively _learnt_ how to use Slack and it&#x27;s features around notification control (things that may come &quot;naturally&quot; to the tech-savvy crowd on HN), @-things, bots, etc, and they would need to re-learn a new tool that is going to work in a different way.<p>This would be a substantial effort for us, and we&#x27;re a small company. Are there ways to materially minimise this cost?')
