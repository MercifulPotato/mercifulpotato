In college, I was a sub-3 GPA student with not-so-great internship experience, although I did cofound a startup. Yet I was able to reach out to some of the &quot;privileged&quot; you mention at the top of the totem pole - firm partners, founders, etc. Heck, I literally connected with MBB partners simply by shooting an email to them to meet and chatting with them. I don&#x27;t even know what one guy even saw in me, but he even persuaded me to apply and referred me for an interview (which I was able to crack thankfully), which is a big deal considering they have to give clear reasons as to why they are referring you. And this was not in a backwater with a few guys but a major global financial center. I got my first good internship and subsequently my first job in private equity because I was an idiot who decided it would be a good idea to wait outside an office building an entire day so that I could show an MD the financial models I had built (after shooting an email obviously). And this was in white shoe finance, so I&#x27;m sure the barriers are much lower in tech.<p>Edit:- Apologies if I sound like I&#x27;m using a lot of anecdotal evidence&#x2F; grand-standing, but I had to disagree with that comment, and the best evidence I had was my own, although there are a lot of similar stories in the Street.<p>Edit 2:- I should add this too, since it is highly relevant to the linked topic. The people who referred&#x2F;hired me later mentioned that a key reason for them taking me on was my startup experience, which was what the original link&#x27;s author would call a &quot;side project&quot;.')
