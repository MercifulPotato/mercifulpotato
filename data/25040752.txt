You can basically use the same techniques as the one you&#x27;d use on the PICO-8, just with an added dimension.<p>Polygonal 3D is a huge step compared to 2D engines. You can&#x27;t just create assets with a simple bitmap editor, you need to learn 3D modeling and it&#x27;s a huge can of worm. And then you need to learn to animate your models...<p>With voxels you can just sculpt your models minecraft-style, it&#x27;s a lot more intuitive I think. And animations could be done like for sprites: you just key your animations with different 3D voxel models.')
