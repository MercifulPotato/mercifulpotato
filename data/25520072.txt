Look, for example, at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tc39.es&#x2F;ecma262" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tc39.es&#x2F;ecma262</a> (the JS spec) and try to jump around the page: you&#x27;ll notice that it takes quite a bit of time for some things to render simply because the document is absolutely humongous. BUT, once it does load completely, you can insta-search it with ctrl+f, it reflows&#x2F;wraps correctly in a mobile browser and and if you throw your iphone&#x27;s accessibility feature at it, it&#x27;ll read the document for you. Being able to google the thing in the first place is also due to ability to programmatically crawl the document and analyze its contents. These are important features that are usually forgotten by the people proposing that everything should be a thin bitmap buffer on top of raw hardware.')
