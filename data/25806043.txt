As anyone acquainted with high-performance networking code in Rust has seen (remember the Actix fallout?), it&#x27;s very hard to do a great many things without unsafe Rust. I&#x27;d much prefer a deeper discussion about a) how many of these bugs are actually important in practice and b) how a few of them would be solved by idiomatic, safe Rust. This article doesn&#x27;t do either and doesn&#x27;t answer the question in its own title.')
