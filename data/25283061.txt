(Same question for your other examples.)<p><i>&gt; (Assuming no interference by non local authorities.)</i><p>You must be joking. Without support from non-local authorities, local bosses would simply be laughed at if they tried such things. Where you see such things going on in localities, it&#x27;s because of support from non-local authorities.<p><i>&gt; This example is contrived, but has happened often enough in human history</i><p>Please give specific examples. I&#x27;m not aware of <i>any</i> case where local bosses got away with such things without any support from a non-local, higher-level government.<p><i>&gt; if you can outline a credible method for the unarmed citizenry...</i><p>In the historically default situation, <i>the citizenry is not unarmed</i>. Having large numbers of citizens unarmed is a recent and historically aberrant situation, and <i>requires</i> a huge level of support from higher level governments to even make possible. Local authorities in a society where higher level governments do not exist or do not provide such huge support for disarming citizens simply won&#x27;t have unarmed citizens to play with.')
