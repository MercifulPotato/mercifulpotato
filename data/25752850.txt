For the comparison to hold true it&#x27;s more like we let them knowingly drive there while we&#x27;re 100% aware where they are at that moment. So we could have acted on it but didn&#x27;t and watched them do it.<p>Threats, slander and misinformation where never part of free speech and never will be. Invoking &quot;free speech&quot; here is disingenuous.<p>To go back to your comparison, if Parler - or anything similar - was like the highway we wouldn&#x27;t know about what was going on. But we do, and it&#x27;s inciting violence so it&#x27;s basic human decency to stop it. Even apart from anything that a government would say. I don&#x27;t get it, why are we still talking about this on HN.')
