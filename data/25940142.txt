But there was great analysis on this post a few hours ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l6n4ay&#x2F;the_biggest_risk_we_face_and_why_its_nothing_to&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l6n4ay&#x2F;the_...</a><p>Assuming it (like others) gets taken down, here&#x27;s a copy+paste with some cleanup:<p>&lt;snip&gt;<p>Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it&#x27;s not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for &quot;hate speech&quot; (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).<p>&lt;snip&gt;<p>Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Donald_Newhouse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Donald_Newhouse</a>). Fortunately, Newhouse&#x27;s family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family&#x27;s money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office&#x27;s CIO (details here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.institutionalinvestor.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;b1g6j2tztzpb3t&#x2F;A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.institutionalinvestor.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;b1g6j2tztzpb3t...</a>) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.<p>&lt;snip&gt;')
