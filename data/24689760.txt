It costs money to maintain it.<p>Example: We pay for looker. One day I thought to myself I&#x27;ll spin up Metabase and try it out for myself against our prod database. It worked very well, fast and easy to query my data unlike Looker.<p>I haven&#x27;t used it in about a month and today I try to access it but the app just doesn&#x27;t load. Now I need to spend time to look into why this app isn&#x27;t loading. Nevermind that I have zero Java experience or devops experience.
