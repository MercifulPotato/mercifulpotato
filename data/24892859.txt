This is distinct from social liberalism which is what &quot;liberal&quot; commonly means in the US, which mostly overlaps with what could be called &quot;progressive politics&quot;.<p>&quot;Classical Liberalism&quot; is confusing in the modern context, so it is rarely used execpt by people trying to confuse people (eg, right wing commentators who claim to be &quot;classical liberals&quot;). The biggest exception to this is the (right-wing, conservative) Liberal party in Australia, which was founded on the ideas of &quot;Classical Liberalism&quot;<p>There&#x27;s also &quot;liberal&quot; in the &quot;liberal democracy&quot; sense. This is where multiple parties contend for power under known, written down rules.[2]<p>And then there is &quot;left-[wing]&quot;. Left wing can refer to a social view, where it is used as a close-synonym for social liberalism or progressivism. Or it can refer to an economic view, which is much more context (and country) specific.<p>In the context of US politics the Democratic party is the most left-wing major party in both an economic and social sense.<p>In terms of media sources, the NY Times is definitely a proponent of &quot;liberal democracy&quot;, but in a social and economic sense it is fairly centerist (despite the claims to the contrary by populist).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Classical_liberalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Classical_liberalism</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.mcgill.ca&#x2F;~rwest&#x2F;wikispeedia&#x2F;wpcd&#x2F;wp&#x2F;l&#x2F;Liberal_democracy.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.mcgill.ca&#x2F;~rwest&#x2F;wikispeedia&#x2F;wpcd&#x2F;wp&#x2F;l&#x2F;Libera...</a>')
