Eventually someone had to take the other constraints seriously. We made LZO and friends but the results weren&#x27;t that exciting, and I think a lot of people wandered off for another 10 years to work on other things, until bandwidth became a bigger concern for producers than consumers.<p>For containers, I&#x27;d love to talk to some mainframe OS designers about how much of containers and The Cloud are merely democratizing techniques that were proven out on big iron 30 years ago.  I suspect the answer is &quot;a lot&quot;.')
