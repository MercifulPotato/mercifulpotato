I don&#x27;t see how that applies here, you can&#x27;t decide on a draw&#x2F;action strategy at the start of the game and then decide as you go which cards you&#x27;re going to use for it. I guess you can, but it seems like a bad idea.<p>To be successful you&#x27;d need to start by studying the card offer and seeing if draw&#x2F;action strategy is possible and advisable. To do that you need to understand all the possible ways to build an engine(if any) from the available cards and how they might interact with other cards that are available. That seems like strategy to me.')
