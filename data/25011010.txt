There are far more direct, practical, and expedient alternative paths to get there.<p>Importantly, the number of people who were perfectly capable of doing a PhD but chose not to (because, frankly, it&#x27;s a very bad deal) vastly dwarfs the number of people who stuck around in academia and obtained one. Additionally, my observation at several major tech companies is that PhDs have a bent of mind that is roughly orthogonal to the pursuit of real business value.')
