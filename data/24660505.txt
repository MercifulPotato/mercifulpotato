One pattern I noticed is that a lot of developers from TCS, when they don&#x27;t know the answer to a question, just answer a different question. Another Indian that I did hire, explained that this is a product from Indian culture where not knowing something is seen as a weakness, so people don&#x27;t want to admit they don&#x27;t know something, and hide it by answering something else and hoping for the best. I really strongly prefer developers who know and are honest about their limitations. Nobody knows everything, so it&#x27;s fine if you say you don&#x27;t know. That makes it a learning opportunity. That opportunity gets closed off when you pretend to know something you don&#x27;t.<p>This makes it really hard to hire people from TCS. I did eventually find two good ones, fortunately.')
