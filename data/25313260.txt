I would argue things are considerably worse for the average American since then<p>Based on what metrics?<p>&gt;If every American had healthcare and access to quality education, housing, and food, it would not matter to me how wealthy Jeff Bezos gets<p>These aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive though...<p>&gt;Snore. If you really want to reduce things to personal jabs, that&#x27;s cool I guess. I was using myself as a stand-in for an average person - feel free to substitute any name that makes your heart warm.<p>If you&#x27;re arguing on HN you&#x27;re most likely <i>not</i> the <i>average</i> person.  Even then, how would you quantify how much political &quot;power&quot; someone should&#x2F;could have?<p>&gt;Sever the links between money and political power. Limit private ownership of news organizations. Take away the tools that are being abused.<p>Sure.  You&#x27;re just going to run into problems trying to define &quot;tools&quot; and &quot;being abused&quot;.  And I&#x27;m saying that as someone that agrees there are problems with abuse of power.<p>&gt;otherwise I would have linked more specifically<p>Yes, cause otherwise you&#x27;ll link to something and when I do &quot;ctrl+F taxes&quot; it wouldn&#x27;t lead me to something that argues against your point ;)<p>It doesn&#x27;t say there how much revenue it generated.  Do you have something you trust showing numbers for the revenue targets and how much it made? I find conflicting information.<p>&gt;Slavery was propagated by the concentrated wealth of the southern aristocracy. They rebelled when they felt that their wealth was threatened. Similarly, in Europe, World War 1 was a war of prestige and conquest fought between a bunch of wealthy (largely related) families who had built huge empires.<p>You can have both slavery and wars without a &quot;concentration of capital&quot; as the driving factor.  I&#x27;ll say sure, its a factor.  So is the &quot;ability to own land&quot; and half a million other things.<p>&gt;You mocked me a bit and told me I should have the answers, but I didn&#x27;t see any clear examples.<p>I linked to the wiki page detailing how a FTT pretty much destroyed swedish financial markets and did the opposite of what it intended to do.<p>&gt;Talking about a Swedish wealth tax from 1990 is a joke.<p>...? Literally everything you have mentioned is several times older than something from 1990.  Also... it was introduced in 1984, 1990 is when they <i>reversed it</i> because it was so bad.')
