I commit constantly when hitting a natural stop point or when taking a break and push up to my branch&#x2F;pr. I hate having code locally that hasn&#x27;t been pushed to the origin.<p>But doing this means I have many commits that don&#x27;t mean anything or are unfinished and in an uncompilable state.<p>So I git rebase and massage the history to make more sense.')
