Item(by='thisisbrians', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611683812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25917345, text='&quot;Personhood&quot; seems a very arbitrary (and not at all clearly defined) qualification here. &quot;Understanding&quot; arises from thinking, not from &quot;personhood&quot;. And surely, there are non-person minds that understand less complex things. That they can evolve to achieve person-caliber capabilities incrementally and over long periods of time is well-accepted.<p>As an aside, we can&#x27;t communicate very well with the smartest animals, so we don&#x27;t know how much they can understand. It could be more than most of us think.')
