Their drivers are independent business operators, because they own the relationship with the riders. Uber drivers not only don&#x27;t own the relationship with riders, but they&#x27;re forbidden from owning it, which is what makes them employees. It&#x27;s literally against the terms of service for Uber drivers to act as independent business owners, despite the expensive PR campaigns they run for regulators and the general public.<p>The CEO of Uber was literally fired for getting caught on camera berating an employee who was complaining that Travis had lowered the amount of money he was earning after the employee had taken out a huge car loan. If this driver wasn&#x27;t an employee, he would have been allowed to set his own prices, so that conversation never could have even happened.')
