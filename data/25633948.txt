His public statements about his work always seemed childish and petulant. It probably does bias me somewhat against his work. I&#x27;m generally supportive of bringing information to light, but Assange himself doesn&#x27;t seem to do much besides host the data and he doesn&#x27;t even do that well since he leaked the unredacted cablegate. And given that MSM sources have exposed far more and it don&#x27;t more responsibly and faced courts over their actions, it makes me think that he&#x27;s not much of a hero. I&#x27;m not sold that his actions wrt to cablegate were espionage, but I&#x27;d very much like to hear about what he discussed with Roger Stone and Guccifer 2.0.')
