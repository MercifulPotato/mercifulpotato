This has been going on for a while, but has gained a new dimension with cloud providers. For example, with their &quot;Nitro&quot; system, AWS can more or less run their Hypervisor entirely on the NIC and completely offload the network and storage virtualization from their servers. This development is likely to continue. FPGAs are going to play a significant part in that because they allow the customers to reconfigure this hardware according to their needs.')
