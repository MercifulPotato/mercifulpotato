Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25458179, 25458307, 25458336, 25459606], score=None, time=1608227336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457577, text='There is a notional standard &quot;best price&quot;, the NBBO, that a broker-dealer has to meet; you can&#x27;t take payment to route an order somewhere that doesn&#x27;t meet the NBBO.<p>But the NBBO captures pricing from all kinds of traders. Retail traders are cheaper to trade with than institutional traders, because retail traders aren&#x27;t moving gigantic blocks of stock that are going to blow up the market makers that are facilitating the trading.<p>Everybody knows that retail traders are cheaper to trade with, and everybody knows where the retail trades come from: the retail broker-dealers. So market makers cut deals with retail broker-dealers: they chop up the cost savings between themselves and their customers, who get prices <i>below</i> the NBBO. That&#x27;s called &quot;price improvement&quot;.<p>What happened here is that Robinhood claimed in its marketing to be obtaining the best available prices for its customers. But it wasn&#x27;t living up to that claim. Its upstream market makers made it clear to them that they could get more price improvement for their customers, if they took less in PFOF rebates.<p>The SEC filing suggests that Robinhood was offered 80&#x2F;20 price-improvement&#x2F;rebate, and instead took 20&#x2F;80. The two big problems here: first, 20&#x2F;80 is worse than other retail brokerages (virtually all of which do PFOF, because none of them are especially competent at actually executing trades) --- even if you factor in the lack of trading fees, and second, Robinhood had claimed in its own marketing that they did the opposite.')
