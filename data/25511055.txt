You can tell the Silverhand character that he&#x27;s a whiny narcissist with over-simplified views that blames everyone for his own problems. I&#x27;d argue Silverhand and Yorinobu are not the heroes, but it ultimately depends on how you play and what decisions you make.<p>You can also make fairly pragmatic decisions to do what makes the most sense in context. I wouldn&#x27;t call it &#x27;optimistic&#x27; sci-fi since the world is pretty gritty, but the techno-futurism, ability for people to upgrade themselves is pretty interesting, and achieving immortality for everyone is pretty optimistic even in that gritty backdrop.<p>It&#x27;s worth playing to check it out, I&#x27;d ignore most of this over-intellectualized writing about it and just play it for yourself if you want to.')
