The unauthorized sessions had to be turfed, and the clearest way of being sure that all unauthorized sessions are turfed is to delete all the sessions.<p>Of course, some those with unauthorized access will also try to log in to resume that unauthorized access, but presumably there is some trap laid for that.<p>Maybe for the accounts suspected of having been breached, there will be a mandatory password recovery procedure or whatever. Or they will monitor for suspicious logins from different IP addresses.')
