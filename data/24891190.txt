The black (and Latino) swing toward Trump, for example, is apparent in every single poll I&#x27;ve seen. As mentioned elsewhere in this discussion Nate Silver&#x27;s discussed it, but little else other than the odd article like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-macho-appeal.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-macho-a...</a> (which basically attributes male Latino support for Trump to the same machismo that ruined their ancestors&#x27; countries). Same with the increase in black Trump support from 2016%&#x27;s 8%, even though it&#x27;s pretty clear from history that no Democrat can win the White House without at least 85% of the black vote.<p>&gt;At this point my estimation is Trump-Biden 55-45, for the simple reason that people tend to vote for economic issues and Trump has a better &quot;perception&quot; on this issue. &quot;It&#x27;s the economy, stupid.&quot; as James Carville put it.<p>Indeed, Gallup reports that 56% of Americans believe that they are better off than four years ago (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;gallup&#x2F;321650&#x2F;gallup-election-2020-coverage.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;gallup&#x2F;321650&#x2F;gallup-electio...</a>).<p>My model is simpler. If Trump wins every other state he won in 2016, he only has to win <i>one</i> of MI, PA, WI, MN, or NH&#x2F;NV. The first three he won in 2016 (and, as you say, Biden&#x27;s views on fracking may very well cost him the state); MN Trump lost by 1.5%, so the state is only sightly behind the rest of the Midwest bar IL, and half of Minneapolis being torched this summer probably pushed the state over.')
