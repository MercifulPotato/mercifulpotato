Item(by='falcolas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611170395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25850522, text='1) IEMs can be custom fit to your ear, for half the price of this pair of cans.<p>2) Comply comfort tips, in an appropriate size, have worked for everyone I’ve ever chatted with about IEMs. Those who don’t like IEMs never tried to change the tips (and honestly, most people don’t realize you can; defaults and all that).<p>3) A strong seal <i>does not imply</i> a vacuum. IEMs are not hermetically sealed; air is allowed past.<p>4) IEMs are used by musicians of all shapes and sizes, which kinda puts lie tot he statement on how they’re unforgiving.<p>5) Based on some impromptu research (walking down the streets of NY), the most popular headphones are actually earbuds. IEMs are a lot closer to earbuds than cans are. In fact, if we’re looking at, say, AirPods pro, an IEM is barely different (though you get more choices in tips).')
