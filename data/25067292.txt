Higher spec models will take a surprising 64gb of ram, and run ESXi nicely. Extra nics can be achieved with a USB dongle if wanted (a little gross) and the units fly. The higher end model has 6 cores and runs ESXi free. Licences for home usage a free for ESXi 7, although braving their website takes nerves of steel. Itâ€™s awful.<p>For any VM that needs a GPU the NUC8 is considerably better than the 10, but has less cores. With m2 drives they fly. Bulk storage can be achieved with network storage or USB attached storage.<p>This is all a rather dirty solution but I love my setup.')
