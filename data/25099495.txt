And this week I am back to browsing cybersex type chats which were out of the picture for 5 years and I thought I kicked the habit. I am not even stimulated by them.<p>I hope I will deeply understand how useless all this hiding is and get back to social life.<p>But with ADHD meds you get into this loop.<p>Also covid messed up the sport my Vilks score dropped from 1370 to maybe 1200 and it’s just soul crushing<p>I am 37 and no kids, no girlfriend just a semi-failing startup. If not for the parents I think I’d be seriously considering the S-word, but I just can’t to this to them.<p>I think the problem is that I just don’t really care about myself - I eat only because I am clinging on to gym performance and knowing something is doing damage to my body or my personality doesn’t really matter. We are all just dust. I sometimes envy people who actually put their ego first and care about themselves so much.<p>Hell I quit smoking only because I wanted to win this girl, the most beautiful one, the queen.
