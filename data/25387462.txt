Remember that a lot of these headphones now have CPUs in them, and they&#x27;re integrating into a moving spec. The iPhone 6 mentioned here only supported Bluetooth 4, while the iPhone 12 supports Bluetooth 5.0, plus some other addons like LE and A2DP. And that&#x27;s before we consider any protocols that manufacturers add on top of that, like Airplay.<p>Even Airpods aren&#x27;t &quot;fire and forget&quot; devices nowadays. Apple is still shipping firmware updates for Airpods. It&#x27;s fair to say that long term support for these will be much less costly than an old iPhone, but it&#x27;s not <i>free</i>.<p>&gt; Also, why not make it so that they can be used passively? What&#x27;s the downside?<p>The simplest answer is probably &quot;Apple customers don&#x27;t want it&quot;. If you really care about using your headphones passively with a wire 20 years from now when the battery is dead and Apple won&#x27;t service it, you were pretty unlikely to be buying Apple anyways. There are tons of available headphones on the market to serve that set of requirements. And since Apple <i>really</i> values clean lines, removing a jack that they don&#x27;t think many of their customers will use is a no-brainer for them.')
