TBH a smart idea anyway, because in the first few months after a move to a foreign country you are likely spending more time on learning language, culture, dealing with bureaucracy, etc.<p>Also interesting that you are not able to self-employ as a foreign student. This is how I worked most of the time while studying.<p>Anyhow, spending money carefully is kinda implied with the numbers above. But we were mostly discussing money spent compared to the US, here is an example. Let&#x27;s assume you want a BSc in Computer Science. According to [0] tuition alone is around ~25k USD for an affordable Uni in the US, while 870 EUR monthly expenses [1] TOTAL * 36 months around = 37930 USD for a BSc. And this is comparing a rather low tuition with average total cost of living in Germany.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geteducated.com&#x2F;online-college-ratings-and-rankings&#x2F;best-online-bachelors-in-computer-science&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geteducated.com&#x2F;online-college-ratings-and-ranki...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicum.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;studentenleben&#x2F;geld-finanzen&#x2F;lebenshaltungskosten-studium" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicum.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;studentenleben&#x2F;geld-finanzen&#x2F;lebens...</a>')
