In the UK it is more expensive running old cars because there&#x27;s an annual &quot;Ministry of Transport test&quot; (which is broadly just referred to as &quot;MOT&quot;) with really strict regulations. If your car fails it then it&#x27;s not road legal.<p>I remember from my trips to America that even some of the well maintained cars there wouldn&#x27;t have been legal in the UK. For example some didn&#x27;t have orange indicators, instead using the red break lights as an indicator.')
