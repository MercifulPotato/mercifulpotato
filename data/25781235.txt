That’s when they cross a trust boundary.<p>So a db server with local storage: single trust boundary around db and storage. But! But! What about the kernel!?<p>At this point it becomes important ask to another question: does the current abstraction level of the model help you think better about risk? It depends. Perhaps not if the db is part of a larger infrastructure with a global CDN, loadbalancers, webservers and some in memory caching layer.')
