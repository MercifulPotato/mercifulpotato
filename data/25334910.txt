None of it ever clicked with me and for exams (&quot;Explain why this poem is great&quot;) I would just regurgitate various points teachers and books had told me about the poems. I didn&#x27;t typically agree with any of it, and didn&#x27;t care about it either.<p>Regarding art, I never studied it but I have two books. One is a collection of photos taken by Francesca Woodman, and another is on about Art Brut. I quite like the philosophy behind Art Brut and had never heard of it before buying the book.
