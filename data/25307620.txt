Good for me is the one I enjoy using. Even if I didn&#x27;t have a problem with Solarized&#x27;s lower contrast, I would still think that its colors are hideous.<p>The problem for many with low-contrast themes is that they often aren&#x27;t focusing on keeping contrast high. They&#x27;re mostly focused on keeping contrast low. They aim to avoid being &quot;too contrasty&quot; without targeting being &quot;goodly contrasty&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>color blindness?</i><p>Color blindness is its own set of problems. To the best of my knowledge I&#x27;m not colorblind. I just can&#x27;t easily read poorly differentiated text unless I really crank up my screen&#x27;s brightness or make the text much larger. The problem I think is mostly one of pupil physics relating to the impact of external light on pupil dilation and how that affects both focus accuracy (pinhole cameras focus perfectly without lenses) and also the amount of light entering the eye (smaller aperture means less total light, less light means less difference between light things and and dark things). Neural color perception is another issue that is related but only sort of. Or maybe there&#x27;s an analog to colorblindness that we just don&#x27;t talk about that deals with sensitivity to luminosity variations. IDK.')
