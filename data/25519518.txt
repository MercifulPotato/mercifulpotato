Every year or so I reinstall the Swype keyboard and it works great. But after about a month or two it &#x27;learns&#x27; from my jokey misspellings or starts learning a lot of my more obscure vocabulary and starts muddying up the very basic level of Swyping I actually want it to do.<p>It works great when it types out phrases as I swype and I go back and edit in whatever jokes, memes, or 10 dollar words I want to include. It starts to suck when it starts trying to include those into its predictions.<p>There&#x27;s like a sweet spot of machine learning beyond which the machine gets more annoying than helpful.')
