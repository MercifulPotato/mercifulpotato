In other words: it wouldn&#x27;t make financial sense to farm in the EU without subsidies. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the same in the US, but I might be completely wrong. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>Hence my conclusion: if farming wasn&#x27;t subsidized in the Western world, it wouldn&#x27;t exist in the Western world and it would all move to low income countries that aren&#x27;t as regulated and have cheaper production. Just like the production of the vast majority of the rest of our goods I guess?<p>&gt; Most Western countries (with the possible exception of the US, I don&#x27;t know) aren&#x27;t agriculturally self-sufficient, nor it is a goal for them to be.<p>?? This looks pretty self-sufficient to me? <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;capreform.eu&#x2F;trends-in-eu-agricultural-self-sufficiency&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;capreform.eu&#x2F;trends-in-eu-agricultural-self-sufficien...</a><p>Or at least enough production to survive a war or other crisis.<p>Being from The Netherlands I know that we export a ton of food (a tiny country that is the second biggest exporter in the world behind the US). We also heavily subsidize food production.<p>If self-sufficiency of food production (in case of crisis) wasn&#x27;t a goal of the Western world then I have no idea why we would have any internal production at all? Why would you subsidize food production within a geographical region for any other reason than food security?<p>&gt; In case a war broke out, energy supplies would be a much more pressing concern, especially for Western Europe.<p>Ah? I would think that both (food security and energy security) are dependent on each other, equally essential and pressing? I mean: you can&#x27;t have one without the other in times of crisis.<p>It&#x27;s a bit off-topic, but I can&#x27;t think of many policies that are geopolitically dumber and more dangerous than European energy policies (with perhaps France being the only exception). Example: Germany is in the process of making itself voluntarily completely dependent on Russian gas for the vast majority of it&#x27;s average energy consumption ( &gt; 60 %) and for more than 90 % of it&#x27;s base load production (when there&#x27;s little wind and sun).')
