Item(by='Monroe13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602990098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812586, text='&gt; IV is either a research institution or a patent troll or both, depending on your perspective, but either way, they don&#x27;t generally commercialize the ideas they come up with, they just license them.<p>That’s not exactly accurate. IV creates spin-out companies that commercialize particular inventions created by IV inventors. Photonic Sentry is the commercialization vehicle for this mosquito zapper that was invented by IV inventors. Other examples are Kymeta, Terrapower and Echodyne.<p>IV does not typically commercialize inventions (patents) that it purchases — but the patent purchasing piece of the business is distinct from the invent and commercialize piece.')
