People, it seems, are forgetting their personal responsibility in interactions with police, as well as pretending that police authority is some made up flexible concept they can bend at their own will. That is the mindset of a lawbreaker, that people who are now otherwise law breakers fall into the trap of, directly as a result of these fabricated narratives of &quot;police brutality&quot;. The worst case is they try to use the law and procedure they don&#x27;t act like they respect, against the police to try to get loopholes for their own bad behavior, and then cry foul when that same law and procedure is used on them, by people given the duty to do such. Unsmart.<p>If you don&#x27;t wish you be in situations where you are subject to police force, don&#x27;t put yourself in such situations, and if you end up in such situations, comply with all police orders. Anything less than full and willing compliance, will raise more questions and the officers will register you as a potential threat.<p>It&#x27;s not the time to show your anti-authoritarian streak, it&#x27;s not edgy or cool in that context. It doesn&#x27;t prove you are strong or smart, it just proves you are stupid. Your only instinct should be legal and physical self-preservation. If you don&#x27;t act in your own interests, and then blame police when things don&#x27;t go your way, you&#x27;d be better off learning to blame your own stupidity.<p>Everything here relates the present time, not the past, and to Westernized or rule of law countries, like China. If you are in a place where police are unfortunately corrupt, and likely to frame you or target you because of your background, or to extract a bribe, or as a favor to someone else, then leave those places immediately, and if you can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t have any advice for you. Hopefully the guidance here helps some people avoid bad consequences.')
