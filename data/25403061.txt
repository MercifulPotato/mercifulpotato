That&#x27;s very few people. If that makes you feel better for whatver reason.<p>Like every other internet hustle (say instagram &quot;influencers&quot;), so many people are hustling and maybe being taken advantage of and making very little.  Who does make serious money is some combination of luck, business sense, aptitude, and lots of work.   Some women get rich being models too (and this is of course a kind of modeling, or at least that&#x27;s part of it), but it&#x27;s not like any woman can just decide to become rich by modeling.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re alarmed about, but if you are foreseeing a future where all women choose to pursue no career but onlyfans, which seems to be literally what you are describing being alarmed about, I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about that, so perhaps you can sleep better.<p>Also not sure why we&#x27;re talking about this on a post about Facebook security vulnerability and their bounty program, but ok.')
