This is not the kind of relationship you want to have with someone providing critical functions.&quot;<p>When you are doing something important you want your interests to be aligned with your provider.<p>If you pay for every bit you store, your provider will <i>enthusiastically enable you to store as much as you can</i>.  Your interests are aligned.  If you&#x27;re paying flat-rate unlimited, the relationship is an antagonistic one and the provider will do all manner of sneaky, underhanded - even outright hostile - things to stop you from storing more bits.')
