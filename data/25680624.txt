For better or worse, QBO etc formats are the standard for importing a statement to reconcile and there&#x27;s extra friction each month to import a CSV.<p>Misleading -- Tea Room (for us) does almost nothing which was advertised:<p>- Treasury was marketed to be available to everyone who isn&#x27;t taxed as a sole proprietor. We&#x27;re a non-profit, and found out after moving all our money that we weren&#x27;t eligible. I asked support to clarify this, and it looks like they&#x27;ve removed &#x2F;all&#x2F; information about eligibility from the site which is a small improvement I guess.<p>- There don&#x27;t seem to be any startup deals for Tea Room members. There isn&#x27;t anything on the page on the site for Tea Room.<p>- We haven&#x27;t gotten any tea. (I don&#x27;t actually care about that, but come on, it&#x27;s in the name.)<p>We moved to Mercury because Treasury would have been immensely useful to us. In all other ways BofA is &#x2F;fine&#x2F; and we would not have moved if it were advertised honestly. I think it&#x27;s deceptive because none of this was obvious to us before we planned out a migration and wired the $270k over to get access.')
