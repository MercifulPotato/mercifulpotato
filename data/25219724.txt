To me FrontPage looks weird and &quot;disconnected&quot; - the editor even is a separate program - and the hierarchy it makes feels unintuitive.<p>I&#x27;ve used simpler programs.<p>FrontPage Express is basically the editor (though i <i>think</i> it is actually a separate program that uses the same name but i&#x27;m not 100% sure) so it doesn&#x27;t handle a full site, but for very simple stuff it is fine (e.g. [0]) Adobe Page-Mill is another alternative from the time that has some form of site support. I actually use that sometimes for very simple pages - and it also happens to create very clean code (e.g. [1]).<p>IMO iWeb is by far the simplest and easiest website builder i&#x27;ve used. I haven&#x27;t used anything that approaches it - other builders, even some that claim to be alternatives, do not have the full WYSIWYG element (ie. you&#x27;re not editing articles inside the page itself but you use a separate editor). Its biggest issue was that it created pages that were a bit &quot;heavy&quot; (...though nowadays i&#x27;ve seen much heavier sites) and that the themes were almost hardcoded (there were 3rd party themes but the program never seemed to be designed to allow that). I didn&#x27;t use it much myself, though i have an old page made with it [2] (note that the links do not work).<p>Two other programs that i found easy to use though both were too &quot;raw&quot;, with very blatant missing features and bugs are WebsitePainter and RocketCake by the developer of the Irrlicht (and later CopperCube) 3D game engine. RocketCake is basically WebsitePainter but with a more restrained editor for making &quot;responsive&quot; sites. Both can be found at [3] and [4], though i only played around with them a bit. I wanted to buy WebsitePainter, but it was too buggy and the author seemed to be focused more or RocketCake, which i didn&#x27;t like as much, so i never used any of these for anything i actually uploaded anywhere.<p>For a more &quot;modern&quot; take, one very easy tool i found is Publii [5]. This is a bit more restricted in that it is mainly for blog and blog-like stuff (it says it is a CMS but realistically, this feels like how people used blogs years ago instead of CMSs because blogs were popular). TBH i am not a big fan of its output or theming since i find both practically impossible to customize, but it is easy to use and does provide a WYSIWYG editor (for content, you still need to build the site to see how it&#x27;d look in a browser). I&#x27;ve used it for [6] but only because i haven&#x27;t found anything simpler that still provides WYSIWYG editing and graphical site management.<p>As a sidenote, i see most technical people complaining about the code these tools produced, but for me that is completely missing the point - one would use such a tool so they do not have to mess with the code at all. The produced code doesn&#x27;t matter (and never mattered to me when judging these programs), it is how the final result looks and behaves in a browser that matters.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;gopher&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;gopher&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;bugs&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;nikwideluxe&#x2F;old&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;nikwideluxe&#x2F;old&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ambiera.com&#x2F;websitepainter&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ambiera.com&#x2F;websitepainter&#x2F;index.html</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ambiera.com&#x2F;rocketcake&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ambiera.com&#x2F;rocketcake&#x2F;index.html</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getpublii.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getpublii.com&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;devlog&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;runtimeterror.com&#x2F;devlog&#x2F;</a>')
