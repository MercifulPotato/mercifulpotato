Expecting vegitarian meals to be the default wont happen for a long time.  People like meat for a lot of reasons.<p>However, lots of wonderful resturants and chefs are creating vegitarian and vegan food that in no way immitates meat based food.<p>I also think, though, that if we can create lab grown meat that is identical to meat but doesn&#x27;t involve suffering or enviornmental harm, that&#x27;s a win.  Most vegans I have polled would eat it, as long as their stomach could handle it.')
