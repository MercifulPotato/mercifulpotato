But it&#x27;s not the only aspect.<p>The very same sorts of people with the very same views are <i>also</i> in government institutions in abundance, as we&#x27;ve seen in recent years with the descent of the various left-wing elites into conspiracy theories about Russia - theories that were then used to try and effectively block implementations of public votes, on the belief that <i>surely</i> the public could not possibly reject their enlightened governance unless they were being manipulated.<p>This isn&#x27;t purely a US thing.
