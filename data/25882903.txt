(Think $500K-$1500K each for small ones vs $35K-75K for pistons.)<p>Cape Air passengers arenâ€™t willing to pay enough to let Cape Air operate B200s or Metros.<p>The mostly business owners flying themselves privately in support of their business have more money to spend on tools to run their business than Cape Air pax or banner tow advertisers. They went turbine because turbine engines have incredible dispatch reliability.<p>Believe me, if turboprops cost anywhere near the same, the piston airplane market would evaporate overnight.')
