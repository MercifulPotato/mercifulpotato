Given the use of variables and a few other similar simple techniques, I dare say many programming languages are <i>more</i> amenable to hand-authoring static config objects than most static config languages.<p>I think the real issue is reproducibility; and that boils down to purity.  Fully fledged languages all come with lots of apis and features to interact with the rest of the world, and it&#x27;s quite unclear which apis have such dependencies and which do not - and it&#x27;s seductively easy to do something actually useful in a &quot;real&quot; programming language that will make the whole configuration process unwieldy later - like, say, reading parts of the config from disk, getting some services public key off the internet, embedding a timestap, or even writing some computed config like a random key to a bit of storage for a later config process to consume.  And once you do that, then the whole thing gets flaky, fast.<p>If you can rigorously avoid that, there&#x27;s not too much advantage to a static config language.')
