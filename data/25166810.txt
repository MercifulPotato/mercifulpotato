If you are fluent with Java, their templating engine and all the other funky stuff it&#x27;s a powerful tool - but i.e. their REST-API is bad. List all users including groups? That&#x27;ll be an additional HTTP call for every user.<p>Their tools solve complex problems and are free to use - so I&#x27;m thankful that they exist - but I can&#x27;t help but think that there is some lack of elegance&amp;design that causes lot&#x27;s of complexity - there is no &quot;unix philosophy&quot; to abuse different tools or components to solve problems - it&#x27;s more like either you&#x27;ll use the high level APIs with certain non-obvious assumptions (i.e. worked for us, good luck :) or feel free to hack on it if you grok our complex low-level frameworks and libraries... went after a NetworkManager bug once and it was a tour de force between c, glib, dbus with zero documentation. systemd and Keycloak feel very similiar. Powerful if you fit their usecase - horrible if need to tinker with it. But to be honest I&#x27;ve got no idea how to solve these complex problems otherwise. It&#x27;s probably the best we can do at the moment. Or are there any non-cloud&#x2F;non-sass solutions that actually have all the features?')
