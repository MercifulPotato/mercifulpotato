Last week I picked up <i>Philosophical Logic</i> by W.V.O. Quine for $8 or so. At some point in the past couple of years I must have picked up George Kennan&#x27;s <i>Russia Leaves the War</i> from Second Story for $9.<p>Now, Second Story will sell you antiquarian books at prices that would cover a sound used car, and I see the occasional university press paperback priced in the $40s. But mostly, in my experience, American used bookstores price reasonably.')
