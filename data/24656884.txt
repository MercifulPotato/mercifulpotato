I watched lots of silent movies as well as historical footage growing up, and the jerky motion and slow frame rates gave them a cartoonish quality that I still find artistically endearing but which makes history less real to the viewer. For historical figures one admires, it confers a sort of mythic aura, and for ones you don&#x27;t it makes them seem clownish or misshapen. This impacts written history too, where it&#x27;s already hard to separate our posterior knowledge of how things turned out from the historical figures of whom we have a visually distorted mental image.<p>I watched a  historical series on WW2 where the imagery was colorized and somewhat stabilized&#x2F;cleaned up a year or so ago and was struck by the different perspective it offered without all the &#x27;emotional blurring&#x27; that occurs due to the technical limitations of the time. It was much easier to relate to events, both good and bad, through a &#x27;happening now&#x27; frame of reference that would have been closer to what people experienced at the time, when newsreel footage offered immediacy and accuracy that was new and modern.<p>No doubt in the future there will be debates over whether HD and 4k footage of today and the recent past should be given the full VR treatment, allowing people to experience current events from the point of view of the participants and so forth.')
