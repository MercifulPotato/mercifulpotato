I&#x27;m a broken record on this but automotive gasoline engine is basically toast after 5000 to 8000 hours. That more than anything else defines the lifespan of a car.<p>Electric motors and fixed gears can go 25,000 to 50,000 hours before they need a rebuild. And they can be rebuilt multiple times. And the industry is talking about EV batteries that will last a million miles.<p>Factor that into the capital cost of owning an EV and it changes everything.<p>Now consider that the usual finance term for car is about a third it&#x27;s expected life. Typical car lasts 15 years, typical finance is 5 years. If an EV&#x27;s expected life is 30 years, vs 15 above. Then the reasonable finance term can double to 10 years.')
