The little money that comes in is spent on server costs basically. I spent 3 years building it, spending too much time on trying to build &quot;perfect&quot; Apple apps, instead of quickly going online with an MVP and validate first. Besides that there are a lot of VPN&#x27;s out there and competing with the &quot;big boys&quot; with big marketing budgets is hard, especially when they can provide things like Netflix US streaming. I can keep it online forever this way, it&#x27;s &quot;bootstrapped&quot;, so no screaming investors who want to see money, but I stopped working on an Android and Windows app, I see it as a lost case and these days I&#x27;m focused on my webhosting: joostwebhost.nl and secret future projects. ;-) (And I&#x27;m available as a freelancer) I learned a lot from it though, more then I ever learned at an employer. I&#x27;m pretty sure I can apply the knowledge to a future successful project.')
