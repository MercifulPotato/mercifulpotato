He was a dishonest, backstabbing snake, and it reached a point where I was quite fed up.<p>I told my company that I was fed up and the only way I would continue in that situation is if I was given a sizable raise because I wasn&#x27;t paid enough to put up with him.  They gave me the raise rather than having me walk.  I worked there for several more years after that.<p>I never issued an ultimatum before or since.  Maybe there are people issuing threats all the time, bug it seems to me that people usually do that if they&#x27;re frustrated but they want to stay at the company.  For IT folks with desirable skills it&#x27;s far easier to just get another job.')
