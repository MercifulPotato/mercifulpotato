There is no &quot;Pakistan = bad&quot;. The reality is more like &quot;India = bad, Pakistan = bad, China = bad, USA = bad &quot;. Everyone is bad.<p>As someone who has suffered financially, emotionally, socially because of this &quot;ban&quot;, I can confirm things will not be forgotten and I suppose people affected by these &quot;laws&quot; wont either.')
