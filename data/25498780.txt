I immediately began looking into alternatives, completely discounting Stream as a viable production OS, a perception shared by many commentators around the web.<p>But then I actually tried out Stream, and thought deeper about it. I don’t really need to exactly match RHEL’s point releases. I don’t need 100% binary compatibility with RHEL. My installs don’t break between point releases or errata updates, why would a rolling release change that? I just need a rock-solid OS to run my applications on, and Stream seems to fill that need. Just ‘cause the update model was changed doesn’t mean the OS is unstable.<p>I agree with the authors claim that 95% of CentOS users will be perfectly happy with Stream. Of course, there is that remaining 5% gap, where I understand the frustration of those in that situation.<p>I already roll several other Red Hat upstream projects in production, including AWX (Ansible Tower) and oVirt (RHV). I’m sure RH would love for me to pay for support, but I don’t really need it. The upstreams serve me well enough.<p>The one thing I can’t get over though, is the decision to roll out this change in the middle of CentOS 8’s lifecycle, trimming out what, 8 years or so of support. That seriously stung. This decision should have been made a year or two ago, before CentOS 8 was released.')
