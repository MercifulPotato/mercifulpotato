Perhaps this has been building for a long time and now it is time for a change for you, but perhaps it’s all being made orders of magnitude worse by timing. COVID, contentious elections, right down to midlife crises can all collude to make life seem more dreary and negative than otherwise they’d appear. If you’re not already, I’d recommend talking to a good counselor or therapist who can help you put things in perspective, and possibly plan your future outside of tech, or not. Good luck!')
