It&#x27;s not really great to disadvantage them in school and then flip the disadvantage after graduation.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s worse to fix the one disadvantage without the other, which is tempting because it seems like the less-intractable one. Wage and job disparity is deeply ingrained; &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot; has long been poorly compensated because women are seen as wanting to do that work. We lump a huge amount of effort under &quot;homemaker&quot; and don&#x27;t pay for it at all. We then heap even more effort on women working outside the home, for which we don&#x27;t even have a single name -- cleaning, note-taking, emotional labor, etc. -- unpaid and often marking one as less valuable.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good answer to this, and resist fixing the &quot;easier&quot; problem that puts girls at a disadvantage.')
