I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t give you a satisfying answer even though I would like to because even I&#x27;m not sure why VIM acted as a catalyst for me.<p>What I think it did for me is two things:<p>- the splits allows me to have multiple files (aka buffers) open at ones time and this might decrease the number of times I have costly context switches.<p>- the vi way of manipulating text is faster and more efficient in terms of steps needed to complete an edit. I believe this reduces the cognitive load of mundane tasks and lets my mind stay focused on the actual problem I&#x27;m solving.<p>VI may not help everyone obviously. But I think it opened a flood gate for me.<p>Also the initial lower productivity wasn&#x27;t really that bad so I don&#x27;t think it had too much of an impact.')
