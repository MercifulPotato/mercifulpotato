You can argue that they were just doing it wrong. But the point is that, if even they are doing it wrong - and getting nothing in return for the millions they&#x27;re spending on ads - then it&#x27;s very likely most others are in the same situation.<p>You are right that this doesn&#x27;t mean _all_ advertising is useless, there are absolutely profitable usecases. But the larger points still stands: most money being spend on advertising right now is likely not returning anything.<p>We now have some strong precedents being set. I believe this will cause more major companies to run the ultimate experiment: turn off all ads and see what happens. It&#x27;s too early to tell, but it&#x27;s not impossible we&#x27;ll see adspend drop significantly across the industry once everyone finds out they&#x27;re just burning money.')
