Sorry.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nNo sir, Google bought over Pizza Delight last month.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nOK. I would like to order a pizza.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nDo you want your usual, Sir?<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nMy usual. Do you know me?<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nAccording to your caller ID data sheet, the last ten times you called, you have ordered an extra-large pizza with three cheeses, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and meat-balls on a thick crust.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nOK! That&#x27;s what I want ...<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nMay I suggest that this time you order a vegan Pizza with ricotta, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes and olives on a whole wheat gluten-free thin crust?<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nWhy a Vegan Pizza? I detest vegetables.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nYour Cholesterol levels are not good, Sir.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nHow the hell do you know?<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nWell Sir, we cross-referenced your Mobile phone number with your medical records.  We have with us, the result of your blood tests for the last seven years.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nOkay, but I do not want your rotten vegetable pizza! I already take medication regularly, for my cholesterol.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nExcuse me sir, but you have not taken your medication regularly.  According to our database, you purchased     one box of 30 cholesterol tablets only once in the recent past, at Drug RX Network, 4 months ago.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nI bought more medication from another drugstore.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nThat doesn&#x27;t show on your credit card statement, Sir.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nI paid in cash.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nBut you did not withdraw enough cash, according to your bank statements.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nI have other sources of cash.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nThat doesn&#x27;t show in your last Tax Return, unless you bought the Tablets using an undeclared income source, which is against the law.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nWHAT THE HELL!!<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nI&#x27;m sorry, sir, we use such information, only with the sole intention of helping you.<p><i>CALLER:</i>\nEnough already !!  I&#x27;m sick and tired of Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and all the others.<p>I&#x27;m going to a remote island without any Internet, Netflix, Cable TV, where there is no Cell phone service and no Big Brother to watch me or spy on me.<p><i>GOOGLE:</i>\nI understand Sir, but you need to renew your passport first.
