I mean they can claim otherwise, but they don&#x27;t apply the criteria they use in this instance to instances where the speech is done by their political party. It is clear what is going on here.<p>Maybe that is working fine for you, it isn&#x27;t working fine for me.<p>The ask of companies under section 230 is that they be allowed to publish libel, publish slander, publish copyright violations, publish content that violates laws against discrimination, publish threats of violence, publish posts by terrorists coordinating their attacks, publish all this with no liability whatsoever.<p>That is a huge ask. The question is, what do we get back for allowing them that privilege? Increasingly, in my opinion, we get negative value back for that.<p>It&#x27;s not working just fine for me, it&#x27;s time to amend section 230 so that the law advances the policies it advocates or abolish it altogether and let internet content providers live by the same rules that print content providers have lived by.')
