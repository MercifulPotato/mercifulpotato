As you stated yourself, colonisers are often colonised themselves by later colonisers. The success of mankind as the dominant species on the planet literally depends on groups being displaced by other groups, otherwise everyone would have stayed in Eden - being the fertile parts of Africa where Homo Sapiens Sapiens evolved. Some groups got displaced, moved into neighbouring territory and displaced or enslaved whatever group of people happened to live there. Fast-forward a few decades or centuries and the process was repeated, the former colonisers now get &#x27;colonised&#x27; themselves. At this moment in time it gets hard to decide who is the &#x27;oppressed&#x27; and who is the &#x27;oppressor&#x27; since both groups will have done their share of &#x27;oppressing&#x27; and both will have undergone &#x27;oppression&#x27;. If you only look at one specific groups as being the &#x27;oppressors&#x27; the way people like Ibram X. Kendi and Robin diAngelo do you end up with a distorted view of history where you assign &#x27;victim&#x27; status to oppressors and ignore potential &#x27;victimisation&#x27; of the designated oppressor, a good example here being the many African tribes who partook in the capture, transport and sales of slaves to Arab and western slave traders being assigned &#x27;oppressed&#x27; status versus the Irish who were enslaved themselves being assigned &#x27;oppressor&#x27; status. Since the &#x27;oppressed&#x27; status has been turned into a form of social currency lending speaking rights and preferential treatment to those who carry it while those who carry &#x27;oppressor&#x27; status have to stand back in line and provide for those with &#x27;oppressed&#x27; status this system often leads to more injustice and with that an increase in social tension and a decrease in social cohesion. In other words, it breaks up society.<p>We do not want to break up society. Those who <i>do</i> want this should state their goal honestly and go to the elections with this stated purpose, if enough people vote for them they can get their way. Those who want to break up society by means of force have to accept that the majority of the population opposes their intentions and that the force of law can <i>and should</i> be used against them, just like it should be used against any other group which commits violence.<p>And that, in a nutshell, is why the <i>need to &quot;un-settle&quot;, to question the orthodox histories</i> - in other words why deconstruction according to Critical Theory - does not work. The cake is too thick, too much mixed up to say which layer is the most tasty. Better have the cake as it is and make a note to tweak the recipe so it comes out better next time.')
