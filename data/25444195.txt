For example we know that human gametes have longer telomeres and only half the chromosomes, we know chimeras can have different sets of DNA and we also have a microbiome that exceeds the number of human cells. Did projects try to sequence cell DNA from many parts of the human body and conclude there are no significant variations?<p>I mean it seems a bit too convenient and it’s hard to prove a negative. Based on what we have found in other areas of bioinformatics can’t we expect the situation to be a lot more complex than previously assumed?')
