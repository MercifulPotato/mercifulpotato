Which is why I really disliked your comment, because your primary sentence includes two lies where you take some words out of context, but hey it must be true because you provided links.<p>1. Going to your own link, Newsweek did <i>not</i> call &quot;GME investors &quot;far-right extremists&quot;&quot;. The article clearly states that far-right extremists were instead using the &quot;stick-it-to-the-man&quot; ethos driving a lot of the GME investor chatter to recruit. There is a huge difference.<p>2. As other&#x27;s have pointed out, WaPo published an Op Ed, this was not something under their Editorial Board or a news article. Saying &quot;The Washington Post is comparing the situation to the Capitol riots&quot; is deliberately misleading.')
