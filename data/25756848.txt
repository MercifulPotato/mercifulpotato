To sum up:<p>1. dictionary is impossible<p>2. cannot keyboard it. forget about typewriters<p>3. impracticality of using pictures to represent verbs, adjectives, etc., anything but nouns with visual manifestations. (not that people don&#x27;t try)<p>4. no past tense, no future tense<p>5. there are a million English words. Imagine a million icons. (You can&#x27;t.)<p>6. copyright law means everyone invents their own unique icons<p>7. the overwhelming number of icons need a cheat sheet, because the picture isn&#x27;t obvious<p>8. the graphic for icons tends to get simplified over the years (where have we seen that before?)<p>9. takes more paper to write the same text<p>10. slow to draw them by hand<p>11. hopelessness of OCR<p>12. takes years longer to learn than an alphabet<p>To sum up, please repost your comment using icons only.')
