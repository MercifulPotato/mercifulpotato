The changes proposed are this:<p><i>&quot;H1B applicants will need to be earning a salary equivalent to the 45th percentile of their profession&#x27;s salary if they&#x27;re an entry-level worker, rising to 95th percentile for higher-skilled workers. In the past, the boundaries were set at the 17th and 67th percentiles respectively.&quot;</i><p>Does anyone feel it was the right thing to do to bring foreign laborer into the domestic market at the 17 percentile? In my opinion, that is exploitative and clearly not fair to the international worker nor any domestic worker potentially displaced.')
