Item(by='gwbas1c', descendants=None, kids=[25335475], score=None, time=1607365239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332797, text='&gt; It&#x27;s just not feasible to heat a home using electric in these areas<p>I live in Massachusetts and the cheapest source of heat is an electric, air-based heat pump matched with solar panels.<p>Without solar, electric air-based heat pumps are cost competitive. You have to do the math, though. (How much BTU per therm of gas or gallon of oil; reduce by efficiency, then convert BTU to kwh, then divide by the COE of your heat pump.)<p>At my old house in Massachusetts I paid $0.12 per kwh, my gas price was equivalent to paying $0.04 per kwh to run a resistive heater; a heat pump with 3.0 COE would be &quot;break-even&quot; with gas.<p>At my current home my solar loans are estimated to cost about $0.04 cents a kwh. Obviously, I went with a heat pump instead of a gas furnace!')
