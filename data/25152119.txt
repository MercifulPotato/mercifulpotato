You pick 1435708800.  Trouble is, that Unix time applies to both 23:59:59Z <i>and</i> 23:59:60Z on that particular day.<p>You can&#x27;t target it beforehand or after.  It&#x27;s just... gone.<p>It&#x27;s not a problem from the point of view of programs, since they just got whatever time_t value they got, and they don&#x27;t know the bigger perspective.  It&#x27;s more of a mapping from outside-&gt;in problem.<p>Put it another way: try writing a program that&#x27;ll call clock_gettime() and will say a message at a later time you select.  You can&#x27;t put in 23:59:60Z because there&#x27;s no way to represent it, and indeed, you won&#x27;t even be able to tell when the time comes unless you special-case it and notice _that particular second_ repeating itself... or reach into the kernel to look at the leap bit, or worse.  It&#x27;s a real time in meatspace, but you can&#x27;t target it with the tools at hand.  That&#x27;s the problem.<p>Regarding the 17 second thing, that&#x27;s because someone decided to switch off the thing which (correctly) applies the adjustment factor to GPS time to make it NTP time.  There was a 17 second difference at the time (GPS to NTP), and with it off, we were shipping GPS time to hosts as if it was NTP time.<p>In theory, any regression of the clock long enough to not let the actual passing of time push it past the sanity check time point in the lock stuff would have caused this.  The thing is, a small-scale time step (from ntpd, say) normally happens at boot up, not later, and it&#x27;s on a system by system basis.<p>The 17 second excursion happened on hundreds of thousands of machines all at once, and, yeah, it was noticed.')
