BDDs grossly cut down on the storage requirements of your variables and their possible &quot;true&#x2F;false&quot; states... while almost all SAT-based math (union, intersection, etc. etc.) remains efficient.<p>BDDs aren&#x27;t the only datastructure (ex: a B-Tree could beat a HashSet in a Database). But BDDs are a very, very good data-structure for SAT.')
