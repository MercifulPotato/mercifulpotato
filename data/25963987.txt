It has afforded me the opportunity to live in a corner of the world that I truly love: a quiet and remote 20+ acres property in rural Colorado.<p>In my experience, the key is to work for a company that is remote-first (or even remote-only), because it will be structured accordingly. I&#x27;ve never worked on a team that&#x27;s partially remote - I can imagine that could cause friction and a certain degree of alienation.<p>I would also add that there is definitely an advantage to being on-premises and in a tech hub for an engineer that is at the beginning of their career: easier access to mentoring and learning opportunities, creating a professional network, meeting friends, etc.. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.')
