Tech types use it already, as well as many people who try to be &#x27;cool&#x27;. However, the chances of Linux ever beating out Windows for casual users, older people and teens who just need their PC to play games and watch movies, are infinitely small. It&#x27;s the same problem as people trying to recommend their favourite new obscure app - it&#x27;s good and it works for a subset of people. But the rest will just never bother with it, no matter how amazing it is. Linux would need to be dumbed down and simplified to a staggering degree before it catches on like Windows did. Besides, Windows has a ton of money and push behind it.')
