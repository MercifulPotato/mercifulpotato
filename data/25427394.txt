When I visited New Orleans the experience was similar to the Paris description in many ways, because the french quarter had like no ventilation with the narrow streets and just reeked of trash and rotting seafood due to all the haphazard dumpster locations in that part of the city. Just poorly laid out and it absolutely reeked, especially when the humidity just lingered in the air.')
