For example, there might be a purchasing department with a complex approval process. Getting rid of that process can cut costs and improve efficiency.<p>2) There might be opportunities for outsourcing nonessential internal roles into organizations who specialize in those, and can do them at better quality and lower cost.<p>3) There might be efficiency gains by combining or breaking up units which grew up organically.<p>... and so on.<p>Once you come up with a good structure, there&#x27;s a question about how to transition:<p>1) Good people tend to leave during layoffs, which is the opposite of what you want. How do you protect critical units?<p>2) People who leave don&#x27;t necessarily want to train their replacements.<p>3) Some people just don&#x27;t want change.<p>... and so on. You want to minimize morale hit. A lot of that is in the details of how transitions are handled. In some sense, in a best-case, if you&#x27;re, for example, outsourcing IT to a company which specializes in IT, your top IT employees will seamlessly transition to that company. Your lower-tier IT employees will have some path out which leaves them minimally disgruntled about being laid off, but no opportunity to do damage on the way out.<p>Think about it. You&#x27;re a competent, qualified executive who grew a 10 person company to 10,000 people. It&#x27;s no longer competitive, and you realize you need 7,500 people to compete.<p>Would you know how to do that? Or would you like to work with someone who has done it 50 times before, day-in-day-out, and seen things go right and wrong?<p>That&#x27;s the selling point. How much value does it add? I&#x27;ve seen it go both ways.')
