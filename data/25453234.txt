But reading books has never suffered from parenting for me.<p>I wake up at 6AM and spend a while reading on the sofa, before our child wakes up.  On an average day, pre-covid19, I&#x27;d spend time doing the morning routine (eating breakfast, getting dressed, taking the child to daycare), then I&#x27;d sit on a tram&#x2F;bus for 30 minutes to head to the office.  That time would be spent reading.<p>Lunchtime I&#x27;d usually read a book while eating a sandwich, then again reading on the bus&#x2F;tram back to the house.<p>Before sleeping I&#x27;d read for 30-60 minutes too, unless I was watching a film with my wife, going to the pub, or doing something else.<p>But even on very busy days I&#x27;d always have around and hour of commute time, on public-transport, to read a book.')
