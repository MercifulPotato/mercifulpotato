You may not like how our democracy chooses presidents but that doesn&#x27;t change facts.<p>I was not referring to the popular vote, by the current vote count Biden wins enough electoral votes to be the next president.<p>&gt; In 2016 the other contestant had conceded.<p>Curious, conceding also has no constitutional bearing on who the next president is. But, that&#x27;s sufficient to you, as opposed to all of the votes having being counted and it being clear who the winner is.<p>&gt; Videos of ballot fraud and sworn affidavits are evidence.\n&gt; The bias is insisting that there is no evidence when there is evidence.<p>Where is this evidence and why has it not shown up in any of these court cases. Rudy and Powell just had an absurd press conference, claiming all sorts of voter fraud. The trump campaign&#x27;s lawsuit in Pennsylvania, that Rudy personally argued, was just dismissed, let me quote the Judge:<p>&gt; In other words, Plaintiffs ask this Court to disenfranchise almost seven million voters. This Court has been unable to find any case in which a plaintiff has sought such a drastic remedy in the contest of an election, in terms of the sheer volume of votes asked to be invalidated. One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption, such that this Court would have no option but to regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens. That has not happened. Instead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.<p>It is not bias to say there&#x27;s no evidence, when time and time again, it&#x27;s shown in court, that there&#x27;s no evidence.')
