The laptop will probably end up being 10 years old by the time I upgrade...<p>- crappy webcam,\n- no built-in SD card reader (a 1TB SD card is ~200$, and my music does not need to be stored on an expensive SSD)\n- magsafe.. if this was the only downgrade, I&#x27;d upgrade, but TBH I love magsafe on my mac and I would miss it if I upgrade.')
