Item(by='xiphias2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606235821, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198492, text='I&#x27;m from Hungary, my first car was 7 years old when I bought it, I used it for 10 years, my second car was 6 years old when I bought it and used it for 7 years. I don&#x27;t see any valid reason for buying a new gas&#x2F;diesel car, even if it&#x27;s a cheap one. Now that I have enough money I feel that I can do something for the environment (and my lungs), that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying a new electric car, otherwise I would go for a used gas car again.')
