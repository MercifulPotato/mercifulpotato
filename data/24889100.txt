I think maintaining old golang code will not be a major problem in the future for example. The garbage collector make things a lot simpler too.<p>The dependencies management is not great compared to npm&#x2F;crates&#x2F;rubygems&#x2F;... but it&#x27;s still better than the Java world and it exists and it&#x27;s being used.<p>I wish generics were already there, and I&#x27;m not a fan of the interface{} keyword. I&#x27;m also sick of the if err!=nil everywhere, I wish it could have a better error management like Haskell&#x2F;Elm&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;...<p>I use Rust in my latest personal projet and while I prefer Rust, it&#x27;s a bit too complex quite often and I spend more time thinking about rust things than thinking about the problem I&#x27;m solving.<p>This is not the case with Golang. It&#x27;s not a fun programming language but it does most jobs very well.')
