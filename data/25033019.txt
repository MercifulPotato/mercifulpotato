Everyone is optimizing for &quot;engagement&quot; which essentially equates to &quot;controversial content&quot;. You can&#x27;t find any genuine advice because Google has been gamed to the point where top 50 pages for any query are affiliate pages.<p>Forums and the communities they fostered are dead. Their replacement, Reddit, has a structure that favors the hive mind.<p>There are ads everywhere and they swing between downright creepy (ads about what you were searching for an hour ago) to completely awful (semi-pornographic Taboola&#x2F;Outbrain ads). When they&#x27;re neither of these things, they are just plainly deceptive (sponsored content).')
