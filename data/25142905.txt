Item(by='mintone', descendants=None, kids=[25143066], score=None, time=1605736312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142357, text='If you&#x27;re not using components (react&#x2F;vue etc.) then you can use @apply - I think the secret with that is to blend inline tailwind and the applied style so you might say..<p>.button {\n@apply rounded-md bg-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-300 text-white;\n}\nand then inline you might use class=&quot;button px-2 py-4&quot; or similar to create specific styles. Of course these could be abstracted again to .big-button .small-button etc.<p>Tailwind has changed not only how I write CSS but how I think about writing front-end code completely - it&#x27;s really great once it clicks.')
