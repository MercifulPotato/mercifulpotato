Every one has subsequently walked it back and provided unaligned access support in hardware.  Even RISC-V, which is as orthodox a RISC as it gets, supports unaligned access in hardware.<p>So that&#x27;s got to be the baseline for deciding how much additional work must be performed when supporting something new: Any memory instruction may touch two pages, but the vast majority of them won&#x27;t.')
