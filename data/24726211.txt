Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=[24726852], score=None, time=1602211387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725957, text='&gt; It&#x27;s hard to imagine any particular reason why a function would need to have &quot;java&quot; in its name in order correctly calculate the maximum of two numbers.<p>That&#x27;s not the full scope of it&#x27;s function, at least in a technical sense. It&#x27;s also meant to be a utility system-level method and in Java standard library utility methods follow a certain organizational scheme so as to designate their system-level status. This status implies certain aspects of behavior not codified in the API name. Therefore this sort of organizational scheme can be argued to be <i>of necessity</i> and not merely an arbitrary <i>design decision</i>.<p>I think the common gap in many comments here (not necessarily yours, but in sibling postings of your original reply to me) is of an understanding between engineers that mostly use APIs and ones that write them. I&#x27;m in the latter category, so my perspective differs. APIs do have explicit contracts that are reflected in their parameters, names, etc. They also have an implicit contract, equally critical to their <i>actual</i> functionality, which needs to be accounted for when in use. Many aspects of organization, etc are firmly in this category and I believe no experienced API author can credibly argue otherwise. Thus behavior like this<p>&gt; a set of automated UI tests written against TurboTax would also work with H&amp;R Block&#x27;s app<p>is <i>of necessity</i> to a properly functional API satisfying an implied API contract. A better example would be H&amp;R Block and TurboTax disputing their workflow for a particular tax form because the workflow is a commonly practiced one by accounting professionals. The software workflow codifies an existing practice. By the <i>Baker</i> standard that appears to me not to be a copyrightable item. API code, in my view, is not dissimilar.<p>Judge Thomas had an interesting exchange re football playbooks with one of the lawyers. In his example, wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to state that the proper protection for a football playbook and its associated techniques to be a patent and not a copyright? The truly valuable creativity is embedded in the practice of football tactics and not in the markings of a manual.')
