Maybe it&#x27;s everywhere? If you dig up some dirt and sequence the genome, you find tons of DNA and RNA but for most we have no idea about what it does. Likely once we find the first pre-cellular life (if it exists), we&#x27;ll figure out what to look for and then suddenly it&#x27;ll appear everywhere.')
