If we admit that our ideas of estimation have come from management, we should also admit their conflicts of interest in the matter and the various management fads that come and go. I think as humans we all search for patterns and try to generalize rules to solve our problems, even when we have an incomplete view of things to begin with.<p>Finally, even with a generalized rule we should realize how different people are team-to-team. I haven&#x27;t worked on two teams where the same exact processes worked for everyone. The best teams and managers I&#x27;ve had will observe a team over time and tweak the various processes according to what works at that point in time. The worst managers were the ones who idolized a specific style or person and copy-pasted their opinions into their workplace without listening to the team.')
