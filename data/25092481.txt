This is core, protected speech in the United States. But it was deemed defamation under Austrian law.<p>This reminds me of the reporting done regarding Larry Pozner[0], a father of a Sandy Hook shooting victim that was subjected to constant accusations, doxxing attempts and death threats from conspiracy theorists for years and decided to take legal action.<p>Fundamentally, I believe that everyone has the right to not be subjected to death threats and systemic harassment from hate and conspiracy groups, especially those who&#x27;ve lost children to such senseless and brutal killing. American individualism so often deflects the responsibility of dealing with such trauma on those who are subjected to this kind of harassment because it&#x27;s not impacting the vast majority of the population (&quot;not my problem&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s clear that much of the Western world have had much stricter free speech laws than the US does for decades, but somehow they don&#x27;t devolve into the Orwellian nightmare that we always fear when we talk about limiting free speech. In fact, has there been another Western democracy more tested and compared to Orwell&#x27;s 1984 in the last 5 years than the US?<p>I don&#x27;t know what the exact solution to these problems is, but I truly people need to be responsible for what they post online. We as a society also have a responsibility to demand that of our peers because big tech has already shown us that they&#x27;re not up to this challenge. The worse that harassment gets online, I believe the more segmented and walled off and commercialized the internet will become.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thisamericanlife.org&#x2F;670&#x2F;beware-the-jabberwock&#x2F;act-one-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thisamericanlife.org&#x2F;670&#x2F;beware-the-jabberwock&#x2F;a...</a>')
