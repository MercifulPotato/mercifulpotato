It&#x27;s pockmarked by enough differing opinions that you can feel like it&#x27;s a good representation, but the US has 320 million people in it, and it&#x27;s hard to find concrete stats but it seems there are around 30-45 million US reddit users. Only some of them would comment on any particular topic, so what you&#x27;re reading is a curated voice of a particular demographic self selecting their participation in various topics.<p>As a microcosm of this, checkout the Motorcycle subreddit. You&#x27;d be fooled into thinking everyone rides with full leathers and helmets on, and that the entire motorcycle community feels really strongly about it, and that it&#x27;s a rare sight to see someone without gear on. But it&#x27;s extremely common to see people riding without full gear in the real world.<p>That&#x27;s why all these big political shakeups take that bubble by surprise. Reddit didn&#x27;t think Brexit could happen, they didn&#x27;t think Trump 2016 would happen, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what your political flavours are, my conclusion is that Reddit as a hive mind doesn&#x27;t really have that good of a grasp of reality.')
