Apparently CSPAN&#x27;s coverage of the US election was far more even-handed, but people want to watch Fox or CNN because they&#x27;re drawn to the smell of blood from the tribal war. People love to band together with their tribe to hate other tribes. It&#x27;s sad because when you look at the basic needs of all people, they&#x27;re the same. And when you put a reasonable Democrat into a room with a reasonable Republican, ban any talk of party affiliations and just discuss those  basic needs they&#x27;ll agree more than they disagree. The internet is a marvel, but humans didn&#x27;t evolve the ability to stay rational in large numbers, so ultimately I think we&#x27;re better off without it.')
