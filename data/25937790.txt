When corruption inevitably occurs, the average person is much more likely to recover some of their data off of simpler filesystems than complex ones. &quot;We saved 80% of your family photos by running FatFileFinderPro, that will be $250,&quot; is better to a consumer than, &quot;Bummer, our highly advanced diagnostic tools say the drive is toast.

I don&#x27;t actually worry about bitrot too much because I assume there&#x27;s some sort of propietary error correction mechanism at the firmware level. I expect my data is either going to read out flawless, have gaping holes in it, or have the whole disk unit fail.
