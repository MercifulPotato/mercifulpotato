This property makes it more likely that the build products do indeed depend only on their explicit dependencies and not implicit dependencies.<p>The problem with caching just on package name and version is that there are many different possible flavours. For example, multiple different versions of the sourcecode may have the same given version number. Things such as target architecture, optimisation level, and optional features confuse things further. Nix therefore uses a hash of all the inputs as the cache key.')
