I&#x27;ve bought and rebought multiple media versions of the same thing due to changes in technology: cassettes, records, CDs; Betamax, VHS, DVD&#x27;s.<p>Your argument is tired and irrelevant because technology will obsolete it one way or another.<p>And if you really do like watching crappy old VHS on your new 75&quot; 4K tv, then god bless you, because that would make my eyes bleed. (Seriously, if you do, then none of my comment should apply to you, because you are keeping the flame of old tech alive, and my props to you.)<p>Side note about technology - I have old 3.5&quot; hard drives that just aren&#x27;t worth keeping around too, and are too hard to securely erase, so I destroy them physically. (I just tried to securely erase an old 50GB external spinning disk two weeks ago and it was painful. I decided a ball peen hammer was a better approach.)')
