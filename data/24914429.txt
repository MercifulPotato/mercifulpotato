Item(by='koopuluri', descendants=None, kids=[24915151], score=None, time=1603852535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24912325, text='I believe users don&#x27;t actually care about the Native only features, and rather they care more about producing great designs, through a delightful process, in effective collaboration with their teammates. As opposed to focusing on how Sketch tackles these bigger picture user goals, they talk about their love for Native apps, with contrived examples: what percentage of users actually care about using the OSX dictionary while working? They took out a bunch of space to show a user using the dictionary for the word &quot;reading&quot; - a use case that likely doesn&#x27;t resonate with 99.9% of their users.<p>A common ego-driven thinking mistake I catch myself making: I subconsciously push myself to believe a false narrative that supports my previous decisions so that I don’t appear stupid in front of my peers and so that I don’t throw away previous work. I think Sketch is making this mistake.<p>It&#x27;s tough. When you&#x27;ve raised money and have so much external pressures to succeed in the way you said you would when you raised money - it&#x27;s tough to own mistakes and honestly, objectively analyze your work.<p>I sincerely hope Sketch does well in the coming years, their work has benefitted me tremendously, but I feel their focus is off at the moment.')
