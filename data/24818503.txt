I only see speed talk on this page and nothing about accuracy.<p>Musk needs like 99.9999% accuracy at near zero latency over several hours of operation. I think Tesla currently is at maybe 99.995% from driving my car. The last 0.005% results in phantom braking etc. It&#x27;s actually a very hard nut to crack and I don&#x27;t expect them to achieve the full self driving in all conditions for another 10-15 years maybe. The edge cases are just too many.<p>I like the trash idea though (or a Q&#x2F;A robot at a factory etc).')
