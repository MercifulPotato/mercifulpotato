The area <i>off</i> the coast of California constitutes the California Coastal National Monument. The actual land mass involved there is a mere 8800 acres and nobody lives there. The other national monuments in California add up to 2.5 million acres. BLM&#x27;s total holdings in California are about 15 million acres, of the state&#x27;s 105 million acres. Most of what the BLM holds aside from national monuments are grazing lands that they lease out.')
