Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611093141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837022, text='Well, all I can say is that you passed the test for internet literacy in the current era - you did not just believe what you read, choosing to ask yourself what expertise the writer brought to the article other than the knowledge how to get it out there on the &#x27;net. This is a legitimate question, one which should be asked more often. The answer does not lie in only trusting &quot;experts&quot; since they are often wrong, the difference being that they&#x27;re (hopefully) so from drawing the wrong conclusions after having studied the subject matter in an honest way. So, instead of trusting random &quot;experts&quot; and distrusting &quot;non-experts&quot; I&#x27;d suggest trusting things which come with a chain or net of proof, in this case that proof would have been a number of references to reliable studies on the spread of SARS2 in waiting rooms or similar environments versus the risk of being subject to one of the side effects from these new vaccines. I see no such proof here, only assumptions. I can go look for this proof myself but it would be better if the author did so, preferably from a diversity of sources (that is, countries in different geopolitical regions). Just like the web of trust can lend credibility to PGP keys, so can such a net of proof lend credibility to a claim.')
