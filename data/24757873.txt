I wish gdb and lldb pick on up this quickly and that it doesn&#x27;t need you to specify anything explicitly.<p>It drives me nuts when I compile code with &quot;-ggdb -gdwarf-4 -O0&quot; and gdb <i>still</i> reports some symbols as &quot;optimized away&quot;. I hope the bullet point above refers to this.')
