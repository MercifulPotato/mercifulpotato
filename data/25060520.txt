Makes sense: why burn resources to help a few thousand people when a few hundred thousand are suffering. The metro response team told us to prepare for 30 days without support, especially electricity (we were ALL on well water) or accessible roads.<p>We formed a dozen smaller neighborhood teams that met regularly to identify elderly people who would need check-ins, medical needs, resources people were willing to share. This was in addition to family prep: water, first aid, food, batteries, etc. We even did an emergency rations taste-off (they all suck, btw) and bought a community cargo container that we filled with community supplies (I had left the hood by that point).<p>It was surprising that about 10% of the people in each area refused to participate. Most were pissed that we even had their names on a spreadsheet, even though they were older and might need assistance. They felt we were intruding on their privacy and they didn&#x27;t need our help. However, we included them in the calculations for emergency resources in case they decided to come around after a disaster happened.<p>TL;DR: city recommended rural folks be prepared for a max 30 days on your own.')
