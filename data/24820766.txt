None of it is secret.<p>There are regulations in place that enforce specific agenda under the guise of AML, fraud, sanctions, etc. For banks and MSBs type businesses that typically are covered under BSA. But even if you think you are not covered by BSA, there is always FinCEN, where OFAC&#x27;s strict liability is a pretty big stick.<p>That was high level, but during a more recent conference I participated in ( ages ago now, but on that particular subject ), the discussion of AML professionals suggested something along the lines of &#x27;we can already identify those illicit transactions, why can&#x27;t we just stop them&#x27; ( and to a large degree it is true; your credit card, your bank, your msb knows to large degree what you are buying and what you may be into based on those purchases ). That particular conversation was about CBD products, which at the time were on a weird legal ground.<p>I want you to think about it. Your bank is already capable of deciding a specific type of product is bad for you. Has been for a while and there are people would like to have a say on what is bad. And they are gaining ground.<p>My point is, there is already sufficient amount of control each gate keeper has. All it really needs is a request from government to start gate keeping.<p>Hope this answer the question. There are obviously things I should not be talking about on a public forum and company specific info I can&#x27;t talk about.')
