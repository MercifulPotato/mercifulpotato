What happened in the 1990s was a major consolidation of all retailers, including bookstores.<p>This created limited shelf space, which, in turn, put pressure on publishers to consolidate their authors into a few mega best-sellers, whom they then were completely reliant on. One Stephen King or James Patterson was enough to pay for 9 underperforming titles.<p>Major publishers also consolidated, from many into the so-called Big Six, which then became the Big Five. Five major publishers own the whole industry. Most publishers you&#x27;ve heard of are an imprint of one of those, or else it&#x27;s a small press with very limited distribution.<p>All that consolidation has an effect. It narrows the gates, and gives rise to an industry that grows reliant on gatekeepers.<p>Why did the great consolidations happen? Why is everything trending towards a multi-national mega-conglomerate? I think I know, but that&#x27;s a story for another day.')
