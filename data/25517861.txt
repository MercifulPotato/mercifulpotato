A slightly more expensive dell monitor with good thunderbolt&#x2F;usb-c support basically replaced my $300 dock, and it only cost about $100 more than the cheaper 4K monitors. Mine takes thunderbolt input, provides one usb-c port, and 4 usb-3 ports.  Daisy chaining is supported, but note that you can&#x27;t run 2 4k@60hz monitors with peripherals on a single cable - see details below.<p>----<p>Your setup needs will also depend on whether you plan to run two monitors with 4k@60hz.<p>I was trying to run a setup that would give me two secondary displays plus peripherals on a single thunderbolt cable, but the unfortunate reality is that it&#x27;s just not fast enough.<p>Thunderbolt gets you ~40gb&#x2F;s.  A 4k@60hz monitor needs ~19gb&#x2F;s, and a usb-3 hub will need another 10gb&#x2F;s.<p>Two monitors + a hub means you need ~50gb&#x2F;s and the connection just doesn&#x27;t support that.<p>In windows things will almost always gracefully degrade (one monitor will drop to 4k@30hz).  In linux... it&#x27;s a bit of a grab bag depending on the order the devices are detected - Sometimes one monitor will fail to be discovered at all, sometimes usb devices will never be powered up, in some cases you&#x27;ll see one (or sometimes both) monitors come up but no longer offer the correct resolutions.<p>---<p>Once I realized I was hitting the throughput limits on the cable, I caved and moved to a setup that used two thunderbolt cables plugged into the laptop.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate that my work and personal machines both have two thunderbolt ports (mac work work, xps 13 for personal) and they can both be charged from the same cable.')
