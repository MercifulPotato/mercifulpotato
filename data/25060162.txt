The idea of &quot;humanity&quot; of animals doesn&#x27;t exist in christianity, judaism or islam. It&#x27;s really a modern concept that animals should even be treated humanely at all.<p>&gt; There is often room for improvements, including reducing pre-slaughter stress, but when done right kosher slaughter is among the most humane forms of killing an animal.<p>A shot to the skull is. It is instantaneous. Not 10 seconds of gasping for blood as the cow bleeds out.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever read the bible, there is nothing there about the ethical treatment of animals. The concept simply didn&#x27;t exist back then. Kosher is simply about what a group of people thought was &quot;icky&quot; animals&#x2F;food and draining blood out of the animal.')
