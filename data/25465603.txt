If ads are less targeted then the cost of impressions is going to fall, and so &quot;small business&quot; will be able to buy more ads for the same price.<p>If there are constraints in supply (ie, not many places to show ads) then I&#x27;d be wrong and the price would go up. Maybe someone on HN who knows more than me can project this.<p>But in any case it certainly isn&#x27;t entirely obvious to me that &quot;small business&quot; will necessarily suffer. It&#x27;s not like ads can no longer be targeted; they just can&#x27;t be _microtargeted_, meaning the very big spenders (like political parties) are going to spend less. But I struggle to see how this will significantly impact traditional, product based advertising.')
