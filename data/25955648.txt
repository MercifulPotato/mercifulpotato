Sure - that is a great way to learn, but it&#x27;s not discoverable.<p>Now, what would probably get a little closer is if `:&lt;tab&gt;` opened a list if commands in an fzf-style list  also listing their descriptions and maybe grouping them by some other way than just alphabet sort order.<p>(If anyone can tell me what is up with those &#x27;{&#x27; I would greatly appreciate it)')
