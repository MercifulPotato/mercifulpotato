MySpace was already a thing, several other social media sites but today they&#x27;re mostly dead while FB is not. Luck does have a lot to do with it. I feel trying to quantify luck though will get us no where. Trying to &quot;correct&quot; for it, even more so.<p>I think this is a fundamental feature a winner take all&#x2F;most market. FB beat out myspace and happened to win, but if not them it would have been someone else. 5 billion internet connected social animals is the value, not the app that facebook built.<p>&gt;Do you think they should be? I cannot think of a reason... but I do understand what you mean.<p>I don&#x27;t think they should be because I don&#x27;t think billionaires should exist. But I do think the value they created was much bigger than the value Zuck created. They were better at creating value than capturing it.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t see how the two are related though. There were a lot of things different about back then vs today. I would like to see the focus be on rent and CoL as I see those as way more of a problem than if Jeff Bezos has $50b or $100b. (his wealth has fluctuated like crazy with covid and divorce).<p>The two are fundamentally related. Gdp per capita is higher now than it was in the 60s, yet the median person is no better off. That can only be explained through how the wealth distribution has changed between now and then. Whether Jeff Bezos is worth 50B or 100B doesn&#x27;t matter too much. The issue is that the wealthiest are capturing a larger percentage of income now than they did 60 years ago. I don&#x27;t view our age as being more innovative than a time where we invented the atom bomb and went to the moon and other cool shit. And we paid for it with taxes! Jeff Bezos isn&#x27;t more innovative than those guys, he is just having his workers piss in bottles to squeeze out every last cent. It is a return to the bad old days of Rockefeller.<p>&gt;I would consider that beyond a straw man.<p>Did not realize that Yang supported it, learn something new everyday. Would like to hear his reasoning beyond the short blurb on his website as he has always struck me as deep thinker.')
