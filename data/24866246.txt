In exchange I fund many of their students and the professor themself gets a sweet consulting gig with my company at exorbitant rates (and equity) to supplement their income. Not only that, but they almost turned us down, it sounded like they had their pick of industry projects and wanted to only do things that were highly paid in compensation and equity for their work.<p>That is to say, professor salary can be only part of the story.')
