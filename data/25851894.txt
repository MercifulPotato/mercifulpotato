We don’t play games with people’s lives.<p>Lettuce has to be hydro cooled right after harvest..45 minutes after harvest. In Salinas etc, it’s done right on the field. It never gets out of refrigeration until customer buys it from store. There is enormous food wastage. Almost 40% of harvest is wasted even with top notch cold supply chain systems.<p>When the public doesn’t trust the food they are playing dice with every mouthful of food. That’s just not acceptable.<p>The risk from the farmers side is entirely different from how you consider food risks.')
