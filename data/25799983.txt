I get put on a rapid-file bevy of small projects rather than a single long-term project that grows into a large team. Time-to-MVP and rapid iterative redesign as the problem domain gets mapped out are the priorities in my projects, and light, non-prescriptive frontend frameworks work well for that in my experience.<p>I think it makes a lot of sense to define different best practices for one-pizza projects than projects where 25 developers can be described as &quot;only 25&quot;. There are a ton of developers at both ends of that spectrum, enough that I wish the broader web developer ecosystem would embrace that distinction.')
