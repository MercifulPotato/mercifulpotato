I&#x27;ve had cables getting lose multiple times, I&#x27;ve had several disks dying[1], I&#x27;ve had unstable SATA controllers (hello JMicron) and plenty of unexpected power losses and hard resets.<p>Yet ZFS has sailed through it all with my data intact. Sure ZFS ain&#x27;t bulletproof. It can get messed up. But for the most part it takes a lot of beating without a dent.<p>[1]: As a matter of fact, I just finished resilvering a RAID-Z1 pool in my NAS after a WD Red 3TB died after almost 7 years of 24&#x2F;7 operation (barring a few accidental power outages).')
