From there, the toxin remaining concentrates mostly in organs which can be discarded, rather than the meat. Each step in the food chain acts as a filter. You do not want to consume the crop directly and have buildup in your organs.<p>Also, eating food irrigated with waste sludge is a great way to catch e-coli. Treated waste is aerated and anaerobic pathogens like that largely neutralized, but it could still happen. If a hog is sick&#x2F;dies, it&#x27;s not as big a deal as a human.')
