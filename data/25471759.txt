Deciding that random things and certain language are &#x27;problematic&#x27; and declaring undesirable thoughts as &#x27;problematic&#x27; has the exact same effect. Banning drugs has made drugs more desirable, raising the smoking age makes smoking cooler. Calling trump a nazi and saying that the UK leaving the EU is xenophobic did nothing but strengthen peoples opinions.<p>It&#x27;s the same behaviour from the same people, from banning words to polarising politics, that fails over and over and over again and they still fail to see it.')
