For example, if I get into a book or story, at some point it&#x27;s like I stop &quot;reading&quot; and start &quot;watching&quot; it unfold.  I day dream a lot.  I&#x27;ve got an internal monologue running almost constantly while awake.  But I&#x27;m definitely a hermit, and I never feel lonely.<p>I&#x27;ve been working remotely since March and not seen anybody socially since December last year, and frankly it&#x27;s been great.  In a normal year I only meet up with my friends once or twice anyway.')
