We can&#x27;t separate the observations and reporting of it from the humans involved in those.<p>I am not being rhetorical. It is a genuine question which I am highly interested in.<p>Even though I don&#x27;t believe in the existence of completely unbiased news but I do believe that there is a scale here on which we could rank news for bias(or some other more appropriate term).
