Win 10 Chrome does &quot;lag&quot; if you resize the window. It&#x27;s very noticable, but people seem to accept it.\nWindows explorer is almost perfect. But even that one sometimes draws the old sized content if you resize the window.\nSublime seems perfect, Visual Studio stutters quite badly.<p>I use a Vulkan Swapchain, to get a swapchain image, you <i>have</i> to say for which window and must use the current size, then you can do all the drawing and present. If the compositor decides to update inbetween, it will show the old swapchain image with the new window size.')
