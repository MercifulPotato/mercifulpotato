I see renewables and storage mentioned every time this topic comes up. It seems like we&#x27;ve got the solar panels and wind turbines figured out, but I&#x27;m skeptical on the storage part. I tried doing some research myself, but everything I find reads like a press release from a company that is attempting some kind of storage. As far as I can tell, there is no actual large-scale storage operating anywhere, other than pumped hydro, which we&#x27;ve known about for a long time, and can&#x27;t be scaled unless we start building mountains.<p>I mentioned I&#x27;m skeptical, but I&#x27;m genuinely asking, because I&#x27;ve never seen anyone ask about it.')
