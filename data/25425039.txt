She&#x27;s not an idiot - she knew that there was little chance of it going well for her, career-wise, when she did so. Everyone who&#x27;s saying &quot;She should have expected to lose her job&quot; is missing that she did.<p>The question is why she felt she needed to make one anyway.<p>In particular, she was hired into effectively an adversarial role: to note when Google was engaging in unethical practices. This is not particularly uncommon in business: internal audit teams do this in their own way, for instance. Or security teams, or legal teams, or whoever. All of them have the job of occasionally telling the company &quot;Don&#x27;t do this.&quot;<p>If an internal auditor (or security engineer, or counsel) says, I feel like I am unable to do my job under the terms you&#x27;ve set and if you don&#x27;t change those terms I see no choice but to leave, it&#x27;s worth asking why. It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that the auditor has an unreasonable view of how to do their job. But it&#x27;s also entirely possible that the company is intentionally preventing the auditor from being able to do their job because they have something they don&#x27;t want seen, that upper management wants to do something that they know their audit team won&#x27;t agree with.<p>An ethicist is much the same.<p>It would be one thing if she was fired by her boss. She was not, and her boss was blindsided. She was fired by her skip-boss on the orders of her skip-skip-boss, neither of whom are on the ethics team, but who <i>are</i> in the larger Google AI organizational unit.')
