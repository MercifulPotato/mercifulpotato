This would be much more interesting to me. I disable turbo boost and undervolt my CPU on every laptop because it really drives me nuts that when I&#x27;m compiling something suddenly I can&#x27;t use my web browser because my CPU has clocked to 800 Mhz. I rather have a little longer compilation time and ensure my PC is still usable in that time.')
