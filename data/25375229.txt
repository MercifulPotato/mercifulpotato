And information for how to fully implement dual stack with ipv6.<p>As for other current best practices there&#x27;s really a very great variety of disciplines involved in ISP operations, depending on what type of ISP it is. What&#x27;s relevant for a GPON FTTH last mile provider might not be as relevant for a colocation&#x2F;dedicated server ISP. Or for a WISP. My recommendation on that would be to pick the subject to research and make inquiries in the special interest groups dedicated to that (for instance, two way satellite, or automated billing&#x2F;provisioning systems for hosting companies, or CRM systems, or whatever).')
