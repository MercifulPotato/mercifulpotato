With just a picture of a QR code, anyone can transfer money to you, via their smartphone.<p>No more need for a fancy credit card swipe terminal. No more credit card insecurity. No need to use the credit card chip which often doesn’t work.<p>No more worrying that some company got hacked, and your credit card number is floating around out there, just waiting to be harvested, and your identity stolen.<p>Since it was you, that authorized the purchase with your smartphone. And you get immediate confirmation of the transaction.<p>The processing technology of Alipay got offloaded to your smartphone, and the internet, specifically 4G cellular technology.<p>And plus, the credit card companies, Visa and MasterCard, are just leaches anyways. They get to charge an insane 20% APR, which is far higher than mobsters can charge, and the credit card companies are legally allowed to do so. If the mafia was smart, then they should just start a credit card company, instead of breaking some poor schmuck’s arm for repayment.<p>Credit Card companies are the epitome of a debt trap. Once you get stuck, you forever fall into their quicksand, with fees, late fees, over draft fees, etc. And here is the screwed up thing: all of it is legal. It’s absurd that Congress allows these credit card companies to exist. Oh wait, who am I kidding. The bozos in Congress own stocks in these credit card companies, that’s why they allow this highway robbery to exist legally.<p>The fact that credit card companies charge 3%, just means that everything is 3% higher.<p>The cash spenders are subsidizing the credit card swipers. And the cash back rewards programs are a complete gimmick. Since you’re totally paying for the rewards itself just from the increased 3% fee on everything.<p>Anyways, the sooner that something else comes along to eliminate these dinosaur credit card companies, the better off the world will be. But who am I kidding? That’ll never happen.')
