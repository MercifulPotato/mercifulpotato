I have a sony BT noise-cancelling headset (in fact two), and they work just fine with my Linux (pop_os) laptop. No noticeable difference with my android phone. The mike works fine, too (it&#x27;s a tad low but it&#x27;s not better with Android, it&#x27;s this headset).<p>I&#x27;ve just checked with pavucontrol and it uses A2DP automatically by default, no configuration needed. And the microphone works with Skype and other VC programs, no configuration needed either. So well, anecdata vs anecdata.')
