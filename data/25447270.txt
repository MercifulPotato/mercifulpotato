This is unrelated to your rhetorical question, but I think your exasperation at &quot;yet another OS&quot; is a bit undeserved here.<p>This fills a specific need for &quot;enterprise&quot; customers, specifically, being very slow and very stable. It&#x27;s not supposed to be a consumer OS for doing normal desktop activities on, although there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from using it as such.<p>This isn&#x27;t yet another slightly tweaked fork of Ubuntu or Arch Linux or some such, where maybe that attitude is more deserved.')
