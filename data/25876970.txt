Who&#x27;s going to pay for this? Really?<p>In Europe some retailers have this, sure, for 2 or 3 parking spots.<p>If the demand is there, I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;ll expand it, even as a paid&#x2F;loyality bonus. I don&#x27;t expect them to offer superchaging but 50-60 km&#x2F;h charge would be more than enough.')
