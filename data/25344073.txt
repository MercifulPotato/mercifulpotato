I have for example a travel health insurance that only requires me to send a fixed amount of money to their bank account, instant insurance.<p>Long story short: your travel insurance has all those complicated things, and you pay for it. And you also pay for the convenience of not seeing that complexity.<p>The cost of explicitly covering only costs incurred on accidents, like in the shipping industry OP case, would give you a much much lower cost on your travel insurance (technically no longer an insurance).
