He left the &#x27;94 World Cup testing positive for drugs in what was a national embarrassment. His career as a manager was a disaster that existed purely off his prior fame. It&#x27;s an embarrassment that we are unable to move on past things that happened four decades ago.<p>As a human being, he lacked morals, never recognized his uncountable illegitimate children, had no care for his body or self beyond the most infantile of desires, and his irrelevant words on a myriad topics were taken as gospel in an astounding display of hypocrisy.<p>I did not live to see his plays in the 80s. I remember his infamy of the 90s, along with the infamy of many, <i>many</i> public figures of Argentina of that time (along with the coked-up failure of a president Menem and the parade of similarly dubious public figures, all good friends of his too).<p>I remember being in elementary and my classmates emulating, respecting and excusing the horrible aspects of his character, and I certainly remember how that made dents in the morals of a generation that excused cheating as long as it got results done.<p>Having later on lived in more developed countries where that stuff just didn&#x27;t fly, I&#x27;ll go out on a limb and ascribe at least part of the failures of Latin America to these kinds of attitudes.')
