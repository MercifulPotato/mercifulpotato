Item(by='jkaplowitz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604106943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947367, text='The Supreme Court rulings didn&#x27;t say whether race quota systems are racist since that&#x27;s not a concept known to the law - they merely judged legality. The set of racist things includes both legal things and illegal ones (e.g. in the US calling someone a racial slur is usually racist but not itself illegal); so does the set of non-racist things (e.g. explicitly refusing to hire people over age 40 is usually illegal but not itself racist).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not as if most of the tech industry cares about strict adherence to the law in other areas, such as Uber running roughshod over many jurisdictions&#x27; pre-existing transport-for-hire legislation, Airbnb doing the same for short-term rental&#x2F;hotel legislation, and the whole &quot;gig economy&quot; bringing their gig workers close enough to the definition of misclassified employee that many rulings say they&#x27;re past the line.<p>If this one case of powerful tech companies ignoring the law is working in favor of hiring more suitably qualified members of minority demographics than they otherwise would, then I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;re doing it as long as they&#x27;re generally willing to violate laws for worse purposes.')
