I shrugged off cordless tools for years, but recently went back. With Li-ions, it seems that the battery packs should be easily rebuildable.<p>I&#x27;ve got too many corded tools, so my decision isn&#x27;t generally choosing between cordless or corded, but rather deciding whether adding a cordless version will help me. My metric is that cordless tools are useful for short jobs where reducing the setup time helps (eg pick up a driver and use it). Corded tools take less maintenance and are adequate for jobs where you&#x27;re already setting up a work area... which is most things involving a jigsaw. Not having to manage the cord during long cuts would be nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem like it would make any task significantly easier. Then again if I didn&#x27;t already have 2+ jigsaws I&#x27;d probably feel different.')
