The large majority of software in the world is still deployed traditionally.<p>&gt; So the &quot;quick security updates&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to justify the high maintainability cost of shared libraries<p>A good number of large companies think otherwise. Also, people working in security.<p>&gt;&gt; I want the binaries properly packaged with metadata, documentation, manpages to keep the host secure and tidy.\n&gt; You&#x27;ve just invented containers.<p>No, these are OS packages and predate containers by many decades. This is getting silly.')
