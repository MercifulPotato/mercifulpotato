E.g.: adding aluminium and titanium, not 50 new raw materials that inter-convert into each other in absurd ways -- loops even in some mods!<p>E.g.: One thing that feels &quot;not fleshed out enough&quot; in the vanilla game to me is the infrastructure related to nuclear power. The centrifuges have no use other than nuclear enrichment and related processes. The heat pipes can only be meaningfully used with nuclear reactors. Etc... Similarly, you never <i>need</i> to use circuit networks, the back-pressure from the belts alone is sufficient to achieve the desired throughput.')
