It&#x27;s so much easier if you just make all the paths relative to the root of the project, but people have to either over-abstract or under-abstract everything or both.<p><pre><code>   $(CC) -o ..&#x2F;build&#x2F;foo foo.o $(BARDIR)&#x2F;bar.a ..&#x2F;bletch&#x2F;bletch.o $(BAZLIB) etc..\n</code></pre>\nwhy not just:<p><pre><code>   $(CC) -o $ROOT&#x2F;build&#x2F;foo foo.o $ROOT&#x2F;build&#x2F;bar.a $ROOT&#x2F;bletch&#x2F;bletch.o $ROOT&#x2F;baz&#x2F;baz-2.0&#x2F;bazlib.a\n</code></pre>\nthis goes for all sorts of things.  Yes, you might build a directory from somewhere else or might, might might.  But why not make it clear what you are doing, not unclear depending on what you might do?')
