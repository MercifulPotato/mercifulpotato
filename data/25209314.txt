It&#x27;s simply portion sizes. Just look at McDonalds meals. It&#x27;s shocking how much they&#x27;ve grown. It&#x27;s been a while since I looked it up, but a normal meal in the 50s was what is today a kid&#x27;s meal. Hamburger (1), small (!) fries (that might not even be sold anymore), and a small drink (250ml).<p>Want to eat pancakes? Eat a small amount. With butter. It&#x27;s fine. Don&#x27;t eat a stack that is shown in ads.<p>Want fries? Eat two normal potatoes fried in beef fat. Not potatoes the size of a human head.<p>It is conscious work to retrain your stomach, but it is possible. I&#x27;m saying this as somebody who just ate 2 slices of bread (1 sandwich) and now feels like I can&#x27;t move, where before I&#x27;d easily eat 6 slices. That was my breakfast (at lunch), I haven&#x27;t even had an earlier meal.<p>No bodily exhaustion, no pain, no excessive time commitments, no money (you even save money!), no feeling the need to punish and taking revenge on yourself, just being conscious.<p>Works well with alcohol consumption, too. Ask me how I know how those big red wine glasses which fit 25% of the bottle are bullshit, same as pints. Those are two portions, easily. Look at old photographs: The glasses are tiny.')
