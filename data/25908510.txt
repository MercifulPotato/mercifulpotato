Only you never saw it.<p>Biden, his cabinet, and tons of both Dem and Republican senators and other officials were arrested. Proof of their vast crimes was shown. They were court martialed and found guilty.<p>However, it was decided this was too much for the American people to accept. Overturning the election and showing the crimes of these politicians could lead to Civil War.<p>So an agreement was reached: Biden and other deep state elements wI&#x27;ll be allowed to move freely and serve their terms. President Trump would &quot;concede&quot; and leave office. But this is all for appearances.<p>Behind the scenes, Donald J. Trump is still President. This plan, known as SHADOWPREZ, was seen as a last resort. But it worked.<p>Anything that happens in the next 4 years is actually President Trumps doing.')
