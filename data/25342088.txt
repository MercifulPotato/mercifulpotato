Sometime before I was a teenager my mom found Chuck Yeager&#x27;s autobiography at a garage sale and thought I might be interested in it. Who would&#x27;ve guessed that the Edwards AFB test pilots flight adventures would pale in comparison to their off base antics at the local bar&#x2F;brothel. Apparently not my mother.<p>RIP Mr. Yeager, I learned more about life from you than I expected to.')
