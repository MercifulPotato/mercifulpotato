IMO, traditional fish ladders are often a poor solution as they don’t divert enough water down them, but scale things to 10+% of average flow rates, and dams can coexist with large native fish populations.  Notably discharge rates that high significantly reduce the amount of hydropower generated, but don’t need to be maintained year round.<p>However, most small and mid sized dams should be removed as they harm wildlife and are often a safety issue for the general public.<p>PS: In terms of supporting evidence.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0925857416305936#bib0215" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S092585741...</a>')
