How are they meant to make that determination?<p>Let’s put it another way, say someone requests a revocation issue to malicious actor or some such. And Apple then futzes around going back and forth through email to make sure revocation is intended. The headline would be “Apple tried to stop me revoking my signing certificate”<p>&gt; CRL vs OCSP\nOCSP is fed from a list the CA manages.<p>Whether you’re downloading a list of revocations ahead of time or getting individual responses is moot.')
