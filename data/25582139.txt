They simply need to change numbers in a spreadsheet<p>The &quot;borrowing&quot; you&#x27;re referring to is not a transfer of physical assets. The money doesn&#x27;t &quot;go&quot; anywhere, because they only exist as abstract representations in a spreadsheet<p>The government of the UK has chosen to only spend an amount equal to the one removed from selling bonds, but there&#x27;s is literally nothing preventing them from doing it without that step<p>If the government want to spend more money than they get in through bonds and taxes, they can just do it<p>If they wanted to remove money from circulation they would simply issue bonds and not have an equivalent spending at the same time<p>It&#x27;s two independent operations, that seems connected if you have a mental model that a government runs a household budget<p>That the UK base economic decisions on that assumption does not change the underlying mechanics of the transactions or invalidate MTT as a model for describing economical systems')
