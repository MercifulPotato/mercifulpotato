These hosting services, and also clients, are quite intentionally targetting the raspberry pi. More specifically, they do target Debian running on Raspberry Pi. I don&#x27;t understand the confusion. I mean, is it also hard to understand why AWS users pay for ARM instances running Amazon&#x27;s custom linux distro? In both the Pi and Graviton you can run nginx, nodejs, Python, ssh... So, what&#x27;s the problem again?')
