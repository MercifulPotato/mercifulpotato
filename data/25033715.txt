Different side of same coin.<p>They&#x27;re not even interested in moving the web forward instead crying at Google for increasing the capabilities of the web browser instead improving Firefox. Users like chrome. I like chrome. There&#x27;s no reason to use Firefox except for the ideological one. It&#x27;s the inferior browser.
