Thus we have a false positive like Wyoming, which shouldn&#x27;t be a state with its minuscule population, and we a false negative in Puerto Rico, which is anachronistically governed like a colony .<p>Wyoming met the requirements when it was admitted, but its population hasn&#x27;t grown as much as other states (e.g. no gold rush, etc).  If you think this is somehow an incorrect result, what you&#x27;re really arguing for is the abolishment of established states or periodically &quot;redistricting&quot; them in a way that would do more harm than good (given that states are more than just subdivisions for representative purposes).<p>&gt; and we a false negative in Puerto Rico, which is anachronistically governed like a colony.<p>They&#x27;ve had many referendums on that question, and I think they voted against statehood until recently.')
