Nobody paid me anything to write this paper. In fact, it cost me money, because I had to take time off to work on it.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what to take with a pinch of salt: allegations that the authors are taking money from vested interests. We are not.<p>Rather than searching for spurious grounds to discredit the authors, I recommend you read the paper for yourself. With the help of my co-authors, I searched the literature meticulously to investigate every aspect of the review, and we have cited our sources in the usual way - 255 previous papers, mostly peer-reviewed. By all means, read critically. Take all the research in this field with a heaped spoon of salt, because there may be bias in every direction. But there&#x27;s no escaping the need to read the research literature if you want to assess the evidence for yourself. I hope you find it as intriguing as I did.')
