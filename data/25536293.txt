A hundred years ago we didn&#x27;t really have the ability to even get into orbit much less imaging visiting another star. Today we can imagine ways but they are insanely expensive and likely to take dozens of years or even centuries at best. Assuming constant progress in technology we might be able to get there faster by waiting decades than by leaving now. Even the absolute limit of light speed, while impossible to imagine today, might turn out to be less of on obstacle in some future understanding of physics. It&#x27;s hard to predict the future since all you have is today&#x27;s knowledge.')
