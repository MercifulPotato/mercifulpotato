Got laid off, was unemployed for 2 months, recently just started a new job. I went through the same leetcode humiliation as well. My only advice as far as the job search goes is to &quot;git gud&quot;. Really, what else can you do? Keep grinding and doing as many problems as you can. Interviewing is a numbers game, and eventually your stars will align where you&#x27;ll either get problems you&#x27;ve seen before or can solve reasonably well on the spot. But the important thing is to keep doing those problems.<p>Aside from that, you need to take care of your mental health. Being unemployed and getting wrecked in every interview was seriously depressing. Develop a strong support network of friends and family that you can vent to. I didn&#x27;t have friends to refer me to companies but I had friends who would listen to me whine and complain about how life was shitty. And that helped me  a lot. Exercise every day, eat clean, get a good night&#x27;s sleep. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got for you. Now get back to leetcoding.')
