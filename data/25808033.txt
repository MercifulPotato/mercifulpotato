It is tied to configuration as code.<p>It is certainly a different mentality from straight out coding everything.<p>I think it is important and will grow bigger in time, because low code is a type of metaprogramming.<p>You don&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; to use low code stuffs or do metaprogramming, but if you know how and learn it well you can get much more complex things done quicker than coding everything.<p>The stuff you are objecting to is due to Spring and such seeking to be a type of generalized metaprogramming instead of focusing on custom DSLs. A custom DSL will have less verbosity, not more.<p>In a good low-code setup, all your logs should go to the &quot;log&quot; module, and there should be very simple configuration indicating where the logs go.')
