For example: you could boot from the USB device and access the local storage if it&#x27;s not encrypted.<p>EDIT: I meant to say &quot;if you have physical access without Bitlocker enabled&quot;. Bitlocker is protecting the contents of the storage, if you can bypass the lockscreen on a Bitlocker protected computer you&#x27;ve evaded this protection.')
