Banning it would be extremely difficult politically and drive many conspiracy theories and further erosion in trust.<p>- The Supreme Court, and courts in general, have been packed by Republicans and have enough libertarian-leaning and originalists that doubt the centralized state, I&#x27;m unsure if a ban would be upheld constitutionally.<p>- In 1934 people were simply less educated than they are today with the internet at their finger tips, and news spreads fast. I doubt the gold ban would be possible today given the legitimate outrage vs. 1934.<p>- Crypto is far easier to store and use surreptitiously than gold is, and on a massive scale. Furthermore, offshore exchanges are extremely popular and are accessible globally. I&#x27;m not sure you can ban Americans from using every crypto exchange except US-regulated ones.')
