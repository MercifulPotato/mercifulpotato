It&#x27;s in the second sentence:<p>&gt; George R.R. Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures”<p>* In interviews and writing outside of the books GRRM has made a number of claims about the reality of life in medieval Europe. He in particular made claims about the prevalence and nature of sexual violence (as a defence for the content of his books) which were roundly rebuked by historians. In the article:<p>&gt; he has stated this outright as a defense of his work that this is how it ‘really was’<p>* Finally Game of Thrones is probably the most important and influential piece of modern media depicting something like medieval Europe. Though it is fiction, it undeniably has a massive impact on people&#x27;s perception of the time period, and for a lot of people their perception of &quot;what the middle ages were like&quot; will be shaped in part by Game of Thrones. So it&#x27;s worth criticising for that reason.<p>As an aside, I find it weird when people object to the very <i>idea</i> of critiquing these components of a piece of media. When this blog had posts about the armour in game of thrones I found it informative and tonnes of fun: I got to learn a little about battle tactics, got to see where the show&#x27;s designers took their inspiration, and got to notice funny things like how Jamie Lannister is clearly wearing a biker jacket with some paint on it for much of the 5th season. One of the best things about the show (and books) is <i>meant</i> to be how they&#x27;re grounded and seem &quot;real&quot;, despite the dragons and whatnot. Pointing out bits that don&#x27;t make sense is good, especially when those bits can actually perpetrate harmful misconceptions more generally.')
