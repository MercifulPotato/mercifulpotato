My objection wasn’t that they didn’t include static types, but that there’s also a strong tradition of these languages including a prominent headline about static types, which gets my hopes up that this one is bucking that trend, only to have my hopes dashed. It’s so much a general expectation that a lisp will have a dynamic type system that it’s safe to assume and could go without saying.')
