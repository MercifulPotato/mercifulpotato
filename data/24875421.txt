The story behind it all is actually pretty fascinating.<p>One big thing I did notice though after a hiatus browsing there and going back. Watkins did something to that site.<p>It was always pretty bad, a lot of the people there were pretty awful, but there wasn&#x27;t an organized right wing presence pushing Nazi ideals and anti-Holocaust propaganda.<p>Most of the people there just tended to be misfits who didn&#x27;t even fit in on 4chan. A lot of people I remember talking to in those early days were pretty normal people who just liked the idea of a censorship free anonymous community.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there were definitely some pretty deplorable people and posts back then, I mean they were the people that got banned from 4chan after all, but it wasn&#x27;t the same. I even remember a few threads where hotwheels came on and joked around and stuff. Overall it had a more harmless, if a bit sociopathic and hateful, vibe to it.<p>Fast forward a few years to just a few months before it got shut down, I remembered it existed and went and checked it out again. It was fairly different. Every board got constant spam from white supremacists and Nazis, the content was 99% race baiting type stuff, there was a huge  MGTOW presence on there. The hate towards women had sky rocketed. Everyone on there was just angry and totally hateful towards society.<p>Jim and his son would pop on and off spouting nonsense, the nazis would regularly go unbanned and were allowed free reign.<p>I&#x27;m fairly convinced Jim and Ron purposely led the site that way. Whether by their own decision or maybe even government persuasion.<p>The fbi had an active presence on there by that point<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20201868" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20201868</a><p>And were even caught out instigating what ended up being and active shooter.<p>The whole community there and all this saga around it has always kind of fascinated me. The people there came from all places and walks of life with more beliefs and ideals you could shake a stick at.<p>And it&#x27;s surprising the kind of actual heartfelt stuff you could find on there filtered between all the shit if you looked.')
