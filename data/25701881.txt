I use it for tracking tasks, marking accomplishments, and to back up my decisions. I have a really poor memory so I do little mind dumps multiple times a day. So it&#x27;s sort of a log of your day.<p>It&#x27;s pretty bare bones right now. You can write logs in markdown, tag them for easy lookup, and mark your favorites. This weekend I&#x27;ll probably release a new feature for adding task lists to logs. I have the backend finished and have started in the front end implementation.')
