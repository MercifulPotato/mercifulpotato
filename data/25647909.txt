People don&#x27;t like to find out they are wrong and modern media platforms make it very easy to surround yourself with content which re-affirms your existing beliefs.  It&#x27;s also extremely easy to unintentionally trap yourself in an echo chamber.  The content feed algorithms on most popular social media platforms are basically designed to trap people in echo chambers in order to maximize engagement.<p>All of the groups you mentioned maintain their limited popularity by capturing their members in information echo chambers.  The thing is, people can only be released from echo chambers by exposing them to alternative sources of information.  Giving any organization the power to restrict free speech is dangerous because you essentially give that organization power to legally enforce echo chambers.<p>Personally, I feel safer having fringe groups like QAnon and anti-vaxxers running around than relinquishing that sort of power to any organization.')
