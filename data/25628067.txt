Anyways, for the work for home setup, we are using NoMachine, which doesn&#x27;t feel any different from the PCoIP boxes - unless if using the MacOS client, which is much laggier than the Windows or Linux versions.<p>Actually, I went ahead and tried installing Nomachine on Google Cloud and Amazon AWS CPU only instances, and got the same responsiveness of my studio setup. No fancy setups or gpu encoding&#x2F;decoding.<p>So if you have a Nuke license, you can do some pretty heavy 2D vfx for about 1USD&#x2F;hour on a 96vcpu machine (performance similar to an AMD 32core) and 196GB of RAM, even without any GPU acceleration.')
