I&#x27;ve caught teachers from established institutions in mistakes hundreds of times in my life, and often just as defensive. And I&#x27;ve found &quot;random blogs&quot; on the internet that explain things far clearer than the school recommended book. The only thing that is important is the quality of the resource, not where it came from.<p>Strang&#x27;s free videos <i>are</i> great. That&#x27;s the important thing to share.<p>(I edited to clarify which part of the parent comment I took issue with).')
