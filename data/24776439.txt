My SO is more into Netflix. But for someone like me who’s a bit older, I open Netflix and am overwhelmed with the amount of shows on the screen. It’s way too much for me to figure out what I should watch. Recommendations, trending, etc.. where do I begin watching a show?<p>I think what I’m getting at is Netflix is just putting original content on their platform to see what sticks, however I don’t know what they want me to watch? How do I decide what to watch because obviously there’s a lot to offer.<p>This is just how I see it. The app sits idle on my TV for me and I hardly use it.')
