We have many diseases among us that are harmless in childhood and much worse later in live, but they are much more harmless both because people are exposed to them starting in early childhood, allowing them to build some immunity; and because vaccination is an option. That&#x27;s a much more harmless situation than the initial outbreak ripping through a population that has never seen the virus.')
