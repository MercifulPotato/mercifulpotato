You don&#x27;t know that they user didn&#x27;t look at a quick text message on his phone, or adjust the music volume, or go to the bathroom, or take a call, or had a network issue, or your images didn&#x27;t load quickly, or the dog didn&#x27;t bark suspiciously, or a loud C-130 just flew overhead, or any other of a million things. I highly suggest disregarding that feature.')
