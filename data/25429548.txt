Item(by='msiyer', descendants=None, kids=[25431322], score=None, time=1608034483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429109, text='The labels &#x27;genius&#x27; and &#x27;gifted&#x27; look convincing until you read about &#x27;accidental genius&#x27; - genius acquired after a serious illness or injury.<p>&#x27;genius&#x27; is just a particular configuration out of millions or billions in which a brain can form. Brain&#x27;s real estate is malleable like a city&#x27;s. So, no reason why one cannot configure it to one&#x27;s liking. Now, the procedure to do so might not be as easy.<p>I also think that there is not much difference between an alcoholic (any addiction for that matter) and a workaholic genius. The reason is that both do not know what drives them.')
