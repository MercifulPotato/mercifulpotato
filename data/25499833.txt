Socialized. (Medicare, Medicaid, VA). Medicare is socialized medicine.<p>&gt; Americans pay less for food than anyone else and more for medicine than anyone else.<p>Is your point then that food is cheap because it is socialized at a 100% rate as you want healthcare to be? Or that your references to socialism are all red herrings?<p>Poor people can get free healthcare the same ways they get free food, Govt programs and charities. Food banks are private charities, by the way.<p>You are not defining coercion properly. It means force or threats of force.<p>Freeways are not a necessity of life, though we are certainly coerced into paying for them. At least they aren&#x27;t as expensive as that Army you mentioned. Apparently you define all government spending as socialism, making the only other possible form of &quot;govt&quot; anarchy itself?')
