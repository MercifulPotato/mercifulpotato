They have a visual component, but also a vague auditory component, a motor-experience (feeling of movement) component, etc., and all of those feel equally important. And most of all, there is a &quot;felt experience&quot; component that actually feels like the primary element of it; emotion is the core element of that, but a better description is &quot;the lizard brain&#x27;s interpretation&quot; of what&#x27;s happening in the dream, that feels like the central element of the dream.<p>The visual part is also not in full colour generally, in my case, it&#x27;s like early movies during the transition from black-and-white, with slight colour tints generally towards the bluish colour regions.<p>I&#x27;m curious what others&#x27; dream experiences are like, and in particular whether it&#x27;s the case that most people do experience them as primarily visual.')
