Hakims experiments into CSS, HTML and JS have always been a source of inspiration for me and got me curious about the possibilities of CSS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hakimel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hakimel</a> &#x2F; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hakim.se&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hakim.se&#x2F;</a>). I also have a common interest in exploring the possibilities of Markdown so I&#x27;ve followed Slide and reveal.js with keen interest. For a while it was my number one choice for deck building. Super easy to use and great UX and probably the best Markdown to slide deck option out there.<p>If you want to code something similar though, my approach has been using Svelte.<p>Svelte is a framework for building user interfaces that uses a build step to compile your code. The syntax and API is awesome to work with and the first proof of concept took me from Markdown to a working slide deck in maybe 30 minutes. The pages are mostly pre rendered HTML with a small chunk of JS on top. Not the same great UX but... I will get there.<p>Have a look at my own experiments with Markdown to slide decks here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fictionboard.com&#x2F;demos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fictionboard.com&#x2F;demos</a> where I show how decks can be used for storytelling and immersion in TTRPGs.<p>I&#x27;ll probably finish a demo of markdown based interactive fiction and RPG character sheets this week. And I&#x27;ll expose the syntax :-)')
