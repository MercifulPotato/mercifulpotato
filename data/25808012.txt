I had faced similar issue with cellular networks. I was working on sending accelerometer readings every few seconds for an earthquake detection project. While I was doing that, the Internet connection would stop working every night at 10pm and it required restart of the connection. There was no option but to write a daemon script thatâ€™d check health of the Internet connection and start the application required to establish connection again.')
