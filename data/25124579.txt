With something like HN where there may be buttons that only make sense for 2 users and there is basically nothing a &quot;normal&quot; person could ever do to make them enabled, hiding them is the appropriate thing to do.  A less clear HN example is the down arrow.  When I first came on I didn&#x27;t realize anybody could downvote and was super confused when I would see people complaining about downvotes.  It led me to believe that there must be a ton of moderators out there doing controversial things.  Would have been totally cleared up with a disabled down button with a hover text saying, &quot;You need 500 karma points to down vote.&quot;<p>The example of a user who isn&#x27;t logged in however, I think that case is mostly fine to hide things, so long as it&#x27;s clear that you <i>can</i> log in.  It&#x27;s quite intuitive to have things be read only or dashboard mode without authenticating.<p>But of course some of these rules go out the window depending on the audience.<p>So long story short, I agree with you completely, there&#x27;s a lot of nuance.')
