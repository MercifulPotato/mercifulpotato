If I knew it was fake, and all the people involved in the massive anti-war movement (in the UK at the time) knew it was fake then it wasn&#x27;t much of a stretch for educated in the know journalists of the NY Times or other major media outlets to know. WMD, yellowcake, links to 9&#x2F;11 etc. Completely fabricated propaganda was spread and promoted by the MSM.')
