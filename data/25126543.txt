Item(by='qppo', descendants=None, kids=[25128743], score=None, time=1605634057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25125900, text='Language designers are pretty clever people and understand a great deal about the successes and failures of languages. I think if you look at a lot of what Rust is doing today (and C++ yesterday, for better or worse) you&#x27;ll see a lot of inspiration and influence from the successes and failures of C. Particularly when it comes to safety and generic programming.<p>Objective-C, Java, Swift, and C# have become massively successful as application programming languages because C is&#x2F;was terrible at it. They learned a lot about how painful it was to do basic higher level programming tasks when you are restricted to C&#x27;s semantics and memory model.<p>C is great but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth romanticizing since history has shown that C isn&#x27;t that great for writing anything but systems code. Which is a restricted domain to begin with, and isn&#x27;t even that attractive for it anymore.<p>The one thing C has over anything else is interop. The language of FFI is C. There&#x27;s no inherent reason for that other than history, and it&#x27;s not super broken so we&#x27;re not going to fix it.')
