Is life something that happens to you, or is life something you are creating?<p>The good news is that you really could create that for yourself if you put enough effort into it.  Further, if you work hard enough and you are respectful enough, the people at the world-class places will collaborate with you.  Just read what they are doing, ask competent questions, and offer them something, even if it is that you do the reading they ask you to.  If you are a strong enough coder and you keep showing up and doing the work, a grad student at a world-class place somewhere would likely be willing to collaborate with you.<p>You can even go to classes at famous places even if you are not a registered student and the faculty will help you learn.  What they care about is that you are putting in the effort, which is what you would have to do if you were a student there anyway.  It is really up to you.<p>If you behave like you are world-class, others will start to respond to you as if you are.  One day, someone will call you up and say they have some research apprenticeship or some opportunity you never even thought to apply for.  I&#x27;ve had people invent jobs and research initiatives just so I could apply for them.  The world moves according to how you act every day.  You are creating your world.<p>If you are afraid, just ask yourself this question: &quot;how long am I going to be dead?&quot;  Goethe: &quot;Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it; boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.&quot;')
