I&#x27;m talking about HAM radio definitions of &#x27;long distance&#x27;, where one of the shorter hops is ~150 miles.  I might as well stick with Part 15 as use U-NII.<p>That&#x27;s the problem - hn regularly has threads talking about how decentralized infrastructure is so important. Having a (dialup speed) p2p network that is built on long range connections would be insanely reliable and would probably revolutionize what we think of as the Internet.<p>- ISPs would be optional<p>- access to the internet would be the one-time cost of the hardware<p>- a totalitarian government trying to shutdown the internet would have to hunt down portable repeaters over hundreds of square miles<p>- the infrastructure would be in the hands of the people, not megacorps like verizon and comcast.<p>But that requires encryption, and spectrum allocations that can cover the distance.')
