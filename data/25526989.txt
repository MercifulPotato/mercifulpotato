These options are intended to mirror Word&#x27;s review features, but it also fits the idea of a &quot;Start Editing&quot; button, in my opinion.<p>There&#x27;s times where I really like editing right away, but also being sure that I won&#x27;t do any accidental edits. So yeah, I definitely agree that accidental edits are at the root of the problem for this.')
