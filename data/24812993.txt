Facebook <i>is</i> manipulating the reach of some news sources over others but their methodology is completely opaque. The choices about how the news feed works can&#x27;t be entirely free of a subjective understanding of how the world works so the question isn&#x27;t &quot;is the new feed biased?&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;how is it biased?&quot;. Without transparency, speculating is the only route we have to ask that question.<p>At this point we know that Facebook has the potential to significantly influence political discourse with the choices it makes. The fact that those choices are hidden is a problem but a bigger problem is the influence itself. No privately held company should ever be allowed this level of (potential&#x2F;actual) influence on political discourse.')
