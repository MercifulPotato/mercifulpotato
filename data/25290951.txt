Item(by='camgunz', descendants=None, kids=[25291513], score=None, time=1607014226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290626, text='I&#x27;m just gonna skip a bunch of steps here, which may be unwise but whatever.<p>Your argument is that if you&#x27;re fit and healthy, you shouldn&#x27;t have your behavior dictated by people who aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;ve made poor choices, they&#x27;re the ones who should bear the consequences. You further argue that the low per-capita positive tests indicates that COVID-19 doesn&#x27;t deserve the response we&#x27;ve (so far) given it.<p>Here&#x27;s why you&#x27;re wrong:<p>- Fit, healthy people do die from COVID-19. They can also suffer long-term effects.<p>- There are people with high vulnerability to COVID-19 through no fault of their own. They can have autoimmune disorders, or simply be old. You acknowledge this. However, you generally can&#x27;t choose to transmit COVID-19 only to the obese and not the old (for example).<p>- Further, you broadly can&#x27;t choose to contract COVID-19 and not transmit it to others. It&#x27;s possible to be asymptomatic and shedding for days. To be clear: you can have COVID-19, not know it, and infect dozens of others who can do the same.<p>- Tests are a poor measure of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. They do lend themselves very well to manipulation and motivated reasoning, which I would guess is why people who are motivated to diminish the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic like using them. The only stat that matters is death count per capita.')
