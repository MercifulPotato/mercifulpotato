Nothing about what Amazon is doing is fun for me anymore.<p>I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of unused echos, chromecasts, etc. I haven&#x27;t had a prime subscription for over 2 years now because every time I order something its a 50&#x2F;50 that I will get a shitty ripoff from China. I am desperately looking to get off of their cloud offerings too.<p>I wish more would recognize the convenience of Amazon for the dystopia that it truly is <i>and then act with their wallets</i>. Shopping at 3 different online retailers vs 1 isn&#x27;t that much of an added inconvenience, and I personally find that when you order direct from the manufacturer (when possible) that your success rate on getting high quality, non-fake stuff nears 100%. AWS is a harder sell because of how wide the feature set is, but there are options for any scale.<p>This isn&#x27;t even scratching the surface on how they treat many of their employees. Who is working in an amazon warehouse right now and actually having a good time of it? Amazon could easily automate away many jobs they never wanted in the first place, but sacrificing lower-skilled humans do the last mile of messy pick &amp; place turns out to be more friendly to margins.')
