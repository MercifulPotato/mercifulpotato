Even before covid, TFL took over chunks of the overground and no one batted an eye lid. Where do people get this nonsense from?<p>Overground is run by Arriva i.e. Deutsche Bahn who are fully owned by the German government. &quot;TfL&quot; Rail is run by MTR who are majority owned by the government of Hong Kong.<p>&gt; And even if it were true, why not just apply the rules less strictly to ourselves like you say everyone else is!?<p>Because respect for the rule of law is one of the greatest strengths of the UK, both for our international reputation and for its own sake. If joining the EU means following rules that are written for Italian-style legal systems, staying out is a lesser evil than turning into Italy.')
