Also called hypocrisy, double standards, the usual.<p>The reality is most political conservatives align with immoral and&#x2F;or factually incorrect ideas, therefore they&#x27;re rejected and filtered out because they attract anti-intellectuals that you can find on any youtube comments section about the coronavirus. The number of people that claim they &#x27;do their own research&#x27; and then claim the &#x27;virus is a hoax&#x27; is representative of the kind of people you attract when you allow those kinds of people.<p>The fact that places like youtube and Facebook even allow it to exist demonstrates how little &#x27;conservstives&#x27; are censored. You can find plenty of conservative channels that advocate for all manner of immoral, factually incorrect and Ill intent to people.')
