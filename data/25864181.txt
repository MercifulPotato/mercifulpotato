So the practical expectation of a blue message is at least the content is not going one or more carriers.<p>So it is obvious when texting with someone that the content is flowing unencrypted over sms, and easily read by the phone company, let alone a request from LE.<p>The problem with this service is it makes the conversation look like it is over iMessage. And while your comments about the factual trust level of the user or their choices around iCloud backups and password protection is always the base consideration—-beeper is being additionally introduced, possibly using a wholly unprotected iOS device along with their own cloud storage of the content.<p>So the attack surface now includes not only the recipient and their trustworthiness and opsec in using the apple product but the entire opsec of this third party service.<p>Dialing it up to, “well prism” or “trust of the other person” deliberately ignores my point which is beeper is being added as a listener in an opaque way to the iMessage user.<p>When I say practical expectation, I am not worried about my contacts copying and pasting a conversation. They might but there would be a reason and I’m not worried about some kind of betrayal.<p>Nor am I overtly concerned about a contact having their iCloud backup stolen and read. There are fairly robust measures Apple takes to prevent this including mandatory 2FA. It would take true determination.<p>However this is marketed as an innocuous gateway for iMessage and it isn’t. As I mentioned above Beeper takes no responsibility for the loss of data and does not bear much reprisal if they leaked data. They can’t because it’s a startup.')
