Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25464412], score=None, time=1608256345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461684, text='&gt; <i>Open Source has nothing to do with Free Software</i><p>I don&#x27;t see how this is a true statement.  Open Source is clearly a subset of Free Software.  Free Software is, largely, Open Source software that also respects user freedom.<p>Unless you are making the claim that the &quot;respects user freedom&quot; part of Free Software is so huge as to make up 90% (or some other large percentage) of the importance of &quot;Free Software&quot;... but I don&#x27;t really agree with that claim.<p>&gt; <i>since anybody can take Open Source and add whatever restrictions they want to its licensing</i><p>Well, no, not really.  Copyleft licenses are free software licenses, but are also generally Open Source licenses.  You can&#x27;t add restrictions to copyleft licenses (in most cases).  And while it&#x27;s true that you can fork and add restrictions to your modifications when the original work is licensed under many of the weaker open-source licenses, that does not make <i>the original work</i> further encumbered.  Someone can come along and take the original work, keep the license, and make modifications under that same license.')
