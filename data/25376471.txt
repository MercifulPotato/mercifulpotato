Keep in mind the formal result of science has this flaw embedded within the correlation or causation number. However the qualitative conclusion is littered with assumptions.<p>Probably the best way to describe our different view points is optimism vs. pessimism. That&#x27;s really it. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s flawed but it&#x27;s the best we have, you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s been remarkably successful &quot;so far.&quot;')
