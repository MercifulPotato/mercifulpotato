Since developing intuition about problems can be increased by seeing multiple examples, can you leverage this speed to generate a specific example from a template and some sample values for a variable each time you interact with a student ? \nIt seems part of the trick is generating good collections of interacting values that are easy to present such as all rational numbers or all integers.  \nArenâ€™t these related to a Hamiltonian circuit of a elliptical values ?')
