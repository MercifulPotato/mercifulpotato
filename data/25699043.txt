The rioters entered a building (which is by the way the seat of the legislative power) and that&#x27;s it. Even if they had killed everyone inside, that wouldn&#x27;t have put them an inch closer to seizing the power, as the power is simply not there. Power is alliances and a chain of command, not being in a room with shiny big buttons.<p>I do agree that Trump&#x27;s position is ambiguous: one cannot deny that he was probably hoping for more. In that case he would be the only one to have imagined a coup, as the rioters were just a few... impressionables.')
