I only use technology that is appropriate for the domain I&#x27;m using it in.  Although, I am hoping this trend encourages better tooling and more modernization of SQL.<p>As others stated, my concerns are primarily that SQL lacks a lot of general-purpose language features (modules, namespacing, composability, no easy way to debug, etc.) which seem to be ideal for writing applications.<p>I would be interested to see a project written with PL&#x2F;Python + PL&#x2F;SQL stored functions in Postgres.  PL&#x2F;Python functions would be the interface between API calls and the database, and SQL would do what it is currently designed to do: straight-forward data manipulation.')
