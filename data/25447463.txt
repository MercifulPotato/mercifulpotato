I spent a month leetcoding and reading Cracking the Coding Interview also. 8 months of focused work on interviewing seems... insane haha.<p>That said I do feel smarter for having refreshed my knowledge  on BST, linked-lists, etc. I don&#x27;t know if there is a better way to interview, the algo&#x2F;data-structure stuff will definitely reveal your ability to stay calm and problem solve though. A tricky tree or graph problem will also reveal how strong your mental context and ability to visualize code in your head is.')
