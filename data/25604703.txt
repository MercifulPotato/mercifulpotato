During the financial crises of 2007 to 2010 about 3 to 4M properties went into foreclosure. I have not looked into statistics of home ownership vs rent for those impacted by covid, but given the number of infected you stated and if there are long term care requirements, could this lead to another large set of foreclosures? Unlike last time though, the housing supply currently seems fairly tight in many areas, so a large pricing collapse downward seems not nearly as likely.')
