Item(by='jetti', descendants=None, kids=[25461048], score=None, time=1608185772, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25451321, text='&gt; - Able to easily modify (and recompile) a function while your code is running<p>I do this all the time with Clojure at work. I will have my application running (web app) with two repls in emacs. One is connected to the ClojureScript repl and one to the Clojure repl. I am able to make changes to both front end code and back end code on the fly by changing a function and then evaluating the function into the repl. I can start the application when I get in to work in the morning and have it going all day a while I&#x27;m doing my work.<p>&gt; Able to sabe the complete running state of the system (the &quot;image&quot; of the system, including state of all variables, data, loaded libraries, compiled functions, etc) into a file so it can be restarted later, just like Smalltalk does.<p>&gt; - Able to inspect any stack frame at will and to restart execution from any chosen stack frame<p>Those are really cool features, are they in the base language or are they libraries that you would need to include?<p>If I may ask, are you using Common Lisp professionally? If so, what kinds of applications do you use it for? I&#x27;ve had this notion, as many others seem to have in this thread, that you don&#x27;t really do anything professional with CL but I realize it is just ignorance on my part.')
