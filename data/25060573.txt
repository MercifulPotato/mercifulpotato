In that entire time, I have not seen a single earthquake that required me to be prepared for (I still do have an emergency kit and we&#x27;re all prepared).   In fact earthquakes of similar sizes happen all over the US.<p>Instead, the following things have far more direct impact on me and my family: driving in traffic, walking on the street, electronics fires in my garage, the food I eat, the amount of exercise I get.  I&#x27;m sure there will be a Big One at some point in the next 30 years, but in terms of risk, the basic prepping procedures handle a wider range of common problems than earthquakes.')
