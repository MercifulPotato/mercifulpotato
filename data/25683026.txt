People feel dependent on their social networks, their apps and even declare to feel  things akin to withdrawal syndrome when they are away from their devices or haven&#x27;t checked their networks for updates.<p>And again, the fact that &quot;other companies do similar things&quot; is not an excuse, less so due to the fact that Facebook has way more reach and uses technology that can amplify their effectiveness infinitely. I don&#x27;t have Starbucks baristas knocking on my door offering me coffee, I <i>do</i> have Facebook listening to conversations inside my house because of my wife&#x27;s phone.')
