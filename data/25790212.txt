So 10ms of fiber transit is closer to 1250 miles. The fact that no two real world internet users are connected by a straight line of fiber optic cabling is going to bring that in even further. If you were relying on round trip latency for some reason, that would cut the distance in half.<p>And that’s just for an idealized communication network. A real world use case would have a lot more latency introduced by routing&#x2F;switching, and all of the typical quality issues you’d expect from ISPs. I used to live within line of sight of the data centre that hosted an online video game that I played, and the lower bound of my ping was about 15ms, it was usually in the 20s. Those factors are why something like this is unlikely to ever provide a high quality experience over even relatively short distances. I’ve just always found it interesting how quickly you start to run into issues with the speed of light when you’re trying to optimize for network latency.')
