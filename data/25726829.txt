But I force myself not to get one. It&#x27;s just stuff. Like a Vinyl Music Player. Yes, it&#x27;s cool on some level, but I sense I may merely want it as a cheap source of dopamine because of .. nostalgia. Nostalgia is a romantic emotion but I am professionally in the business of creating the future, so unless there&#x27;s something valuable to be learned from the past, it&#x27;s not where I want to focus my attention on.<p>(by the way: For the occasional nostalgia fix there are really good and well functioning emulators such as FS-UAE that even simulate the sound of the floppy drive.)')
