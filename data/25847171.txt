If you load an unpacked extension, Chrome will issue an ominous warning (something like “this extension is untrusted, click here to uninstall”) on every launch.<p>One could argue this is for security, but this change was implemented around the same time that Google disabled the ability to self-host extensions that install into Chrome. Really this is a mechanism to shut out independent extension developers from any potential plausible third-party distribution method that doesn’t rely on the Chrome Web Store (which Google controls and aggressively moderates.)<p>Use Firefox.')
