Likewise I know very few people that keep a piano in a flight case when they&#x27;re not transporting it.<p>I actually do have bikes that I only take on circular rides because of their value and I baby the hell out of them but that&#x27;s a false dichotomy.<p>They are not saying you have to treat these bikes as fragile musical instruments.  They&#x27;re just saying that if you do it will incur less wear and tear.<p>A carbon fibre bike frame is probably more fragile than a steel one.  That limits the number of use cases for carbon but doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a practical material for different usecases.<p>As a further example, I have a TT race bike.  I keep mine hanging up in the garage an only take it out to races or for circular training rides.<p>I have a friend that commutes on his TT bike as a form of training.  Mine will last longer than his.')
