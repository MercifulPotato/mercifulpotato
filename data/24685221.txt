Fanbase isn&#x27;t inherently against simplified powertrains (there are many calling for NA engines for example V10s) but they are against spec engines or majority of parts.<p>F1 was always an engineering competition. You can&#x27;t compare it with GT racing where they BoP all the cars to drive around relatively the same.<p>I disagree with your opinion. F1 racing can be very exciting and interesting, but it is similar to soccer&#x2F;football, you get periods of boredom mixed with moments of sheer brilliance. Sometimes you get a great race with many moments of sheer brilliance and sometimes it ends with no goals on either side. Just like in soccer, you could &quot;spice things up&quot; by mixing up the players on the teams and making the teams equal, but that is not really the idea behind the sport.<p>F1 is trying to stay relevant, these hybrid engines are here because of that, but the problem is that costs escalated due to the complexity involved. F1 should focus on reducing complexity while allowing innovation, especially in hybrid&#x2F;EV fields.')
