Had own mortgaged apartment in the end, a car, frugal-ish lifestyle but nothing extreme and no kids. Totally possible on an L4 google pay (200-250k gross), even today.<p>In the states, myeah, you might need L5 to pull the same. But on the other hand there are much more well-paying places to work at besides only google, you&#x27;ll have faster career growth.')
