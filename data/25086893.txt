Any  commoditization of sentient beings is a bad thing.  We don&#x27;t need to, when it comes to a choice (especially in this forum), we can choose to not be a part of that system.<p>&gt; Most of these fad diet folks have this stuff all wrong. We didn&#x27;t eat all fruits and nuts. We didn&#x27;t eat all meat. We ate a steady diet of opportunistic foods, and meat was a supplement to our nutrition.<p>Stopping exploitation isn&#x27;t a diet fad. Some people might confuse it though.  We don&#x27;t need to be opportunistic now.<p>&gt; To be a vegan requires you to use a global supply system for your food, which has its own carbon footprint problems.<p>Sure, and we can do better on many fronts.  But animal exploitation is one of the main contributors to climate change.  We&#x27;re already using a global supply chain for animals, which includes all the growth of food in other countries to ship to them.<p>&gt; It has been asserted, sometimes as a throwaway line, in a number of historical documentaries I&#x27;ve seen, that part of structural classism in the middle ages was denying meat to the working class, leading to developmental delays. Malnutrition made them dumber. Easier to control. &#x27;Course, they gave themselves gout in the process...<p>Historically what we have done should not impact our current ability of choices.  We can live on a healthy vegan diet.  Structural classism also includes the current worker in the meat industry. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livekindly.co&#x2F;slaughterhouse-workers-victims-meat-industry&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livekindly.co&#x2F;slaughterhouse-workers-victims-mea...</a><p>In terms of malnutrition people can live on a healthy diet while vegan.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bda.uk.com&#x2F;resource&#x2F;british-dietetic-association-confirms-well-planned-vegan-diets-can-support-healthy-living-in-people-of-all-ages.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bda.uk.com&#x2F;resource&#x2F;british-dietetic-association...</a><p>There&#x27;s a lot of information here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cowspiracy.com&#x2F;facts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cowspiracy.com&#x2F;facts</a><p>There are plenty of videos explaining stuff about exploitation.
