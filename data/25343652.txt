In either the fact or ethics case you will, when it is not otherwise clear from context, cite the particular rule framework within which you are working, but even then you wouldn&#x27;t say the conclusion or action is justified by the rule framework, though you might say it is justified <i>within</i> the rule framework by the applicable premises.')
