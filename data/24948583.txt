Item(by='sterlind', descendants=None, kids=[24948655], score=None, time=1604109874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948014, text='I&#x27;m in a fair bit of constant pain from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and what&#x27;s helped me is finding support groups of the &quot;life hacks&quot; variety.<p>Everyone in the group has EDS or is a caretaker, so they &quot;get&quot; it. It&#x27;s consent-oriented because people won&#x27;t give you advice unless you post asking for it. It doesn&#x27;t turn into a pity party because the forum is about asking questions and getting answers. The post history has everything from wheelchair tips to relocating joints. Direct medical advice is banned, only suggestions of what to ask doctors are allowed. It&#x27;s nice.<p>Sometimes I really want somewhere I can scream into the void about my pain and degeneration though. I&#x27;m not sure of a psychologically-healthy way to scratch that itch.')
