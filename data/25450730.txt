Especially in tech where it&#x27;s much easier to relocate your business&#x2F;employees.<p>The alternative point of view is that California isn&#x27;t special at all, and they should be grateful to have the valley ecosystem. In which case they should reduce the tax burden and focus on reducing cost of living.<p>I don&#x27;t know which it is for California, but I do think that society would benefit from a system that provides strong incentives for companies to stay rooted&#x2F;contribute back to the societies that they benefit from before they&#x27;re established enough to leverage national&#x2F;international labour.')
