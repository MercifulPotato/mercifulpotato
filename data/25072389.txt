It&#x27;s a qualified phrase.<p>You can be a professional, without being a professional user of all your tools. In fact, for any such tool, there&#x27;s probably only one or two professions that are professional users of <i>that</i> tool specifically (i.e. where <i>that</i> is the tool that constrains their productivity.)<p>Many professions <i>aren&#x27;t</i> constrained by any tools, but rather are constrained by human thinking speed, or human mental capacity for conceptual complexity. These people <i>aren&#x27;t</i> &quot;professional users&quot; of any tools. They&#x27;re just regular users of those tools.<p>So, to sum up â€” when a tool is described as being &quot;for professionals&quot;, what that <i>means</i> is that the tool serves the needs of <i>people who are members of a profession whose productivity is constrained by the quality of that tool</i>. It doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s for anyone who has a profession. Just people who have <i>those</i> professions. They know who they are. They&#x27;re the people who were frustrated by the tool they have now, and for whom seeing the new tool elicits a joy of the release of that frustration. An &quot;ah, finally, I can get on with my work without [tool] getting in my way so much.&quot;<p>-----<p>Programming is a profession that is <i>most of the time</i> constrained by thinking speed. (Although, some of the time, we&#x27;re constrained by <i>grokking</i> speed, which is affected by the quality of the tools known as <i>programming languages</i>, and sometimes the tools known as <i>IDE code-navigation</i>.)<p>Very little time in a programmer&#x27;s life is spent waiting for a build to happen, <i>with literally no other productive tasks that they could be doing while they wait</i>.<p>(Someone whose role comes down solely to <i>QA testing</i>, on the other hand, tends to be a professional user of CI build servers. Faster CI server? More productive QA.)')
