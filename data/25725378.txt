I have an oculus quest 1 and can&#x27;t stand wearing it more than maybe 30 or 40 minutes, it just hurts my face.  I&#x27;ve tried adding weight to the back, etc., but haven&#x27;t found a good solution.  I have a 20th percentile head size (a really big noggin) so maybe I&#x27;m in the minority that wouldn&#x27;t like this... yet.  Maybe some VC could help push to lighter tech.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried the Quest 2, but I hear it&#x27;s lighter.  Also have yet to try a Valve Index.<p>At this point in my experience with video calls, I&#x27;m just happy when everybody&#x27;s wearing headphones so they don&#x27;t get their audio dropped when somebody talks over them.')
