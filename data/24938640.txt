Things are so easy to fact check now, at least compared to the way it was before.<p>Many people talk about the problem of &quot;fake news&quot;. What they may not realize is that falsehood have always existed, but we now have unprecedented tools to debunk them.<p>When I was a kid, I learned loads and loads of bullshit, the glass thing was one of it. The problem was, how could I know it was wrong? Obviously, I didn&#x27;t know enough about material science to figure it out by myself, and I didn&#x27;t know any material scientist. Books were mostly useless for that purpose, searching for the answers would have taken days at best, and I didn&#x27;t have that much time to debunk something that insignificant. Now just searching &quot;glass thicker at the bottom&quot; on the web yields exactly what I need.<p>In fact, I am quite sure, there is much less bullshit going on today, but it looks like there is more because that these are so much easier to figure out.')
