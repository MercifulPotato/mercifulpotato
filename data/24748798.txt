You basically have to chunk it up and try to find a boundary and from what I can tell, they try to find out if they&#x27;re in a quoted block. If they are, they find the end of the quoted block (or EOF, which shouldn&#x27;t happen =&gt; broken file) or ask the user to report the bug. This is more like failsaving, not cheating.')
