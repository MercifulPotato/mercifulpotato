The previous releases under the previous license are still valid, right?<p>If so, then my bet is Amazon will begin to treat ES like they do Aurora, namely, they will run their own fork of ES that from this point forward will be a separate code base and will evolve independently but will be &quot;compatible&quot; with anything that would otherwise expect the server to be a normal ES server (like how Aurora is compatible with MYSQL).')
