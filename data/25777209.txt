But that&#x27;s a pretty &quot;valley centric&quot; view that creating software means creating infinitely scalable money machine and each developer always creates a value much larger than what they are paid.<p>For most us devs, <i>especially</i> in europe where a larger fraction of us developers work, I imagine, in traditional industry rather than &quot;in software&quot;, there just isn&#x27;t a situation where we create this massive value. We create more than we earn, sure, but it&#x27;s not exacly Netflix money. The company I work for, like almost all companies, have a huge number of employees and a profit margin that has looked pretty similar for a lifetime.<p>What&#x27;s unfair is perhaps that there <i>are</i> instances of such companies, where the developers really could and should be rich because they write software that make billions. If such devs were paid better, then I could also be paid better, because I&#x27;m paid in competition with them. More likely though they&#x27;d be paid more and the jobs that aren&#x27;t in that category would be done elsewhere. So in a sense, I&#x27;m also a tiny bit happy that the pay structures aren&#x27;t as widely distributed as they are in some places.')
