Or spend a year traveling the US doing worthwhile projects (fixing up broken jungle gyms in schools) again with people they didn&#x27;t know.<p>It is a little bit less likely that you dislike heartland America when you spent a year working with Fred the Farmboy before you headed to Princeton. Fred could probably swap stories with a kid from the ghetto and may be they would come out with the understanding that they were not quite as different after all.<p>Of course, like any draft it would be a huge violation of the persons personal freedom.')
