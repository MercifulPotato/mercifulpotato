Which gives us 3.6 times as much capacity for the hyperloop, or 3030 passengers per hour per tube.<p>Say you stack 4 tubes, that&#x27;s 12120 passengers per hour between two points compared to 8400 passengers for your ICE case.<p>And that still completely ignores the multi rout load balancing, last mile convenience, small village connection and no waiting time advantages gained from packet routing.')
