From a thing on the side.<p>&gt; I realise that I live in one of those cheap, unappealing parts of the world, but that kinda money would easily cover me and my family&#x27;s rent every month, and then some. Do you realise how much of a mental weight that can take off a persons shoulders? To know rent is covered over and above your day-job earnings?<p>Well yes, exactly that&#x27;s the issue with comparing salaries without thinking of cost of living. I live in a smallish apartment that&#x27;s most likely smaller than the OP but pay 4k usd a month for rent. It changes your point of view of what&#x27;s decent compensation and does mean that to cover the typical expenses, I have to have a much higher salary than in a lot of countries...<p>It&#x27;s all relative, is living in a high cost of living environment nice? Yes, in my case because I&#x27;m careful and still try to save a lot of my income but it does require me to take certain type of jobs and reduces my ability to take risks. It also comes with a probably less enviable work&#x2F;life balance..')
