I do not have to prove majority; the point was that ‘no one in the eu’ agrees with the course of action on immigration. This is plain crap as I do not know any of the people who would vote Agree in the polls you linked. We must move in different circles. Sure I hear of loudmouths whining and making it appear as they are the general opinion. We have it better here than most of the world, so it is bored (as you do not have to work very hard in a lot of parts of the EU to have a nice life) people who sit behind their geraniums crying that their immigrant neighbour has a bigger Prius and need to whine about things (which is very dutch, although apparently we are some of the happiest people on earth according to polls you value so much) while they do not have a solution. They mostly do not want these people to die, but they do not want them shelters next door. I have no different solution, nor do you, so the current way will continue, whining or no whining. People are not massively protesting immigration so the sideline whiners can fill out a poll but otherwise do not leave their house (which they probably got from the state); any protests are a few 100, less than we get against zwarte piet. In the village I grew up in, Geldermalsen, there was an actual riot of a handful of people against immigration to a center there; I saw the videos and pics friends sent via&#x2F;via; I know most of the people and&#x2F;or their parents in the video: all extreme right voters and racists. The dutch biblebelt is no picnic. There were not very many of them though; they just made a lot of noise...')
