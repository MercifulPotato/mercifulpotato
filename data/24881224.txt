However currently the Chinese ruling class is getting away with this horror without <i>any</i>  repercussions. International condemnation from world leaders might be enough to stop this horror, but so far we are not even seeing that from the international community.

We would probably need to see sanctions against the Chinese ruling class and Chinese state owned businesses, and probably we would need to see the Chinese excluded from international cultural and sports events (such as the Olympics).')
