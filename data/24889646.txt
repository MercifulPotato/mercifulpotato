Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603657925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889588, text='&gt; &quot;Convenience&quot; isn&#x27;t a valid justification for fair use.<p>Not specifically for fair use, but convenience is a perfectly valid justification in my book to transform, edit, or save content for personal use.<p>[My body + my electronic devices] is a black box, and nobody has the right to meddle inside the workings of that black box. Once YouTube sends bytes into that black box, the extent of their control is done, and don&#x27;t get to ask what happens inside after that. They don&#x27;t get to know whether content got recorded on an organic brain or on a silicon brain within that black box, for example. The black box is private, and is not open for introspection.<p>They can only require that said black box not re-emit information that came from them, or derivatives of that information, back into the outside world.<p>&gt; number of infringing uses<p>First of all, fair use is enough reason to have a tool.<p>But regardless, I don&#x27;t believe downloading a video for offline personal consumption violates the spirit of copyright, and that&#x27;s all that matters to me.<p>When Youtube, or anyone, sends any content into my personal LAN I can do whatever I want with that content within my private spaces and for my private viewing in any way I wish. If the law suggests otherwise, I don&#x27;t believe in that law.<p>The law also banned women from voting, and colored people from from sitting in the front of the bus, and it&#x27;s because of people who didn&#x27;t believe in those laws that we are where we are today. Sometimes the law is wrong, and I firmly believe the law is wrong to say anything about how I&#x27;m allowed to save or consume content that was legally transmitted to a device I own for my own <i>private</i> use.')
