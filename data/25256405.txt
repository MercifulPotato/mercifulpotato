Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap is ~$200B, while M1 is ~$6000B. Back in the day, Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap was a few million dollars or less. That said, BTC now has a powerful brand in the eyes of many possible buyers&#x2F;holders, which makes a retreat all the way to zero far less likely.<p>I suspect that the only things that could kill BTC completely these days are a compromise of the hash algorithm, a coordinated effort against it by a consortium of governments that must include the US, or a devastating 51% attack by a consortium of miners.   The third is perhaps least-likely, as the miners would stand to lose a lot if BTC imploded.')
