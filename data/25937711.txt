What can you do if a meteor hits? What then! Clearly it is oppressive because there is no other earth for me to back up my beliefs and oppress others!<p>Ultimately you can only do what you can.

Parlor complained but removed left wing content 24&#x2F;7 - no one complained about &quot;free speech&quot; then. Make it make sense instead of being obvious political pandering.')
