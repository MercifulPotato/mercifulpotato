Clearly the time granularity within which you get relative order assurance will be dictated by the order interval.<p>But where this seems to fall apart is if you need very precise ordering (think stock trades), as an unpermissioned chain won&#x27;t going you a high enough block rate. So you move to a trusted node that mints blocks, and at this point you might as well call it a ledger computer, issuing signed receipts.<p>The big unsolved problem is the analogue gap though, and how to get something from the real world into the chain - the person or device making the observation inherently need to become trusted oracles. In the odometer example, you could surely take a photo of the odometer before the joy ride, then submit the old picture once the vehicle is leaving your custody? Client side restrictions this is a live photo don&#x27;t help as they can&#x27;t be verified on-chain, so now the next person gets blamed? Or have I missed something here?')
