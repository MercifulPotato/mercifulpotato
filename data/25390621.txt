The original question was this:<p>&quot;How does a doctor&#x2F;hospital&#x2F;insurer benefit from putting Covid-19 on the death certificate?&quot;<p>My read of this question is that the person was unaware of the extra funding made available to hospitals taking COVID-19 patients. Therefore, I gave a link to a USA Today article which explained the facts.<p>I didn&#x27;t say that there aren&#x27;t ways for hospitals to make more money than they get by caring for COVID-19 patients. My only point, which I&#x27;ll reiterate, is that the government provides additional funding to hospitals that take COVID-19 patients.<p>I haven&#x27;t indicated whether I think that&#x27;s good or bad, and I haven&#x27;t indicated whether I think the additional funding has been abused or not. I just gave information about government funding of hospitals to somebody who asked a question about the subject.<p>&gt; ten covid deaths have even been rumored (falsely) to be worth<p>Is there a problem with the USA Today article I posted?

You&#x27;re still reading things I didn&#x27;t write and then making assumptions about me with no basis. Please stop. Slow down, reread everything I&#x27;ve written. Then reply here without fighting windmills so we can converse.')
