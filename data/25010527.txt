I&#x27;m a relatively recent transplant but my partner has been here for quite a while. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned from her:<p>- Getting involved in local politics. There are many opportunities to attend public meetings and many accessible public programs that most folks don&#x27;t know about — even something as simple as requesting a speed bump to be installed on a neighborhood street with speeding problems or requesting a pickup of illegally dumped trash can make a real difference.<p>- Supporting local businesses, co-ops, urban farms, and folks building the future you&#x27;d like to see. Volunteering at local community organizations is a wonderful way to meet folks on the ground doing real and necessary work.<p>- Creating friendly dialogues with your neighbors and those around you. There&#x27;s occasional violent crime around us, but the neighborhood watches out for one another. Our neighbors selflessly help each other in ways I could never imagine in SF or NYC.<p>- Investing in the community when and how you can. My partner bought and renovated an abandoned house in a less desirable neighborhood and has created a great small community of optimistic tenants and friends. There is a lot of unused and available land in the neighborhood and we&#x27;re actively working on ways to reimagine it — for farming plots, new housing, community spaces and more.<p>None of these are as hard as they sound, and the impact from small actions is huge compared to wealthier areas.')
