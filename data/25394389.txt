But from where I&#x27;m from, we were told that:<p>- it was just only the beginning of a massive sh*tstorm, not just &quot;2 weeks of lockdown and we&#x27;ll be ok&quot;<p>- the lockdown in April was to mitigate as much as possible the first wave<p>- a second wave would almost definitely arrive in the winter (hello! it&#x27;s here! we&#x27;re in lockdown again, pretty much as planned)<p>- nothing will be back to normal before we get the vaccine, and even then, it would take months if not years for it to be a thing of the past, and that until then we&#x27;d have to do our best to follow the guidelines.<p>You can&#x27;t compare scientific proof that something works vs. a government decision taken to &quot;mitigate things&quot;.<p>The spring lockdown helped free beds in hospital and ultimately it saved thousands if not millions of lives worldwide. Period. This is UNDENIABLE.<p>Also, maybe if some people weren&#x27;t so doubtful that these decisions were for their own good and stopped throwing tantrums about their &quot;fundamental right to breathe air&quot;, we wouldn&#x27;t have had a second wave at all.
