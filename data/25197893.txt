I apologize for the misinformation, I misspoke on automatic&#x2F;fully automatic and I know that is a huge issue of contention so it was an unacceptable slip, as well I should have looked up the actual laws name. Again I apologize for misleading information and thank you for clarifying the information for people.<p>I believe that I am level headed (at least I like to believe that I am), because I am first and foremost a pacifist but I acknowledge the logic that if someone is trying to harm you, you have a right to not be harmed. I respect devout pacifist and totally understand their logic, that the principle of pacifism is more important to them than self defense because violence flows from a few wells, fear&#x2F;insecurity, despair&#x2F;desperation, anger and jealousy. They believe to neutralize violence you are not violent against those that are in one of those states, rather one should be merciful on their them due to their torment, and that mercy is show in love for them and all people. I honestly admire that level of pacifism but don&#x27;t know if I can ever get there, I get it, I accept that these are the primary drivers of violence but it&#x27;s hard to be that principled and understanding while standing down the barrel of a gun. As VanZant so aptly put it in &quot;gimme 3 steps&quot;, &quot;Well it ain&#x27;t no fun staring straight down a 44&quot;. I may be able to in a situation involving only myself, but with my wife and kids I just cannot see myself getting there. Thus I only carry a firearm when I am with my family. I used to be anti-handgun when I was young and would have been fine with a ban on them. It was not until later in life that I realized that people will literally, pick up a stick and kill someone else, so while handguns primary purpose is human on human violence, I realize that it is just an object and ascribing the violence to the object only blurs what we all need to fix as humans and that is man&#x27;s inhumanity to man.')
