Item(by='codelord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610159407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691912, text='&quot;He&#x27;s done worse before, why now?&quot; is not a very strong argument IMO. Are we better off without him on twitter? IMO, yes. Then this is a positive move. I also think Twitter&#x2F;Facebook should have clear guidelines for intolerable content that applies to everyone. Encouraging violence could be a good red line. Although, I have little confidence that any of the social media platforms would establish and equally enforce a standard policy. They usually take the path of least business risk which is understandable but not satisfying.')
