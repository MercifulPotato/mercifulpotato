Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605013305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044346, text='&gt; Europe is not Iraq or Afganistan, as a whole, it is stronger than the US.<p>Militarily there is no doubt that Europe is not. The only country in Europe that can really project force is France. (I’m assuming the UK is not getting into a war with the United States).<p>&gt; BTW most of the intelligent and educated(engineers, scientists) people in the US comes from outside the US. Not reasonable to believe they will contribute against fighting their own countries.<p>A lot to unpack behind this weird assertion.<p>First-&gt; many (most?) of these smart people are working at companies like Facebook to hook kids into endlessly scrolling.<p>Second -&gt; your claim is unfounded.<p>Third -&gt; even if it were true, the skills and knowledge to win wars do not have a 1-1 correspondence with the skills of these so called experts. Even then, who is to say given the right opportunity there are plenty of other smart people around.<p>Fourth -&gt; those same smart people have families in the US. You think they’re just going to go transfer some Amex points and hop on a Delta flight home? There wouldn’t even be a way to leave the US.<p>Finally -&gt; the idea that “all the smart foreigners will betray the US” gives ammo to arguing points by suspicious white supremacists. So you probably shouldn’t do that.')
