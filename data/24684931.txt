My timing may be a little tad off because so long ago but here goes.<p>I was a natural tinkerer and enjoyed electronics and taking stuff apart starting around age 8. Read Byte magazine as an interest. Christmas of 1982 (I was 10) my mom had to take out a loan at work to finally get me the new IBM PC that I had been asking for. I took that sucker apart completely on first day I had it when my parents went to the grocery store and boy were they livid when they got home. Two days later I had it completely back together. I spent so much time on that PC - I&#x27;d read the manuals, ask to go to book store every chance I got so I could read more on it and other computer books they had, etc.<p>My spring of 1983 I had heard of modems that could communicate through the phone line to these BBS&#x27;s and I could download cool programs&#x2F;games&#x2F;etc. I asked mom for a modem and again eventually got a new Hayes (my mom was awesome thinking back because all this stuff was expensive at the time).<p>When Wargames came out summer of &#x27;83, I was already doing stuff with BBS&#x27;s but this movie introduced me to the concept of &quot;hacking&quot;. I spent many nights and days mass dialing just like David did in the movie - Until my dad got the phone bill one month and took my modem away for a bit.<p>I just remember always being into tech&#x2F;PC&#x27;s&#x2F;electronics and never tiring of it. It was so cool to download a game and have my friends over to play it. I was the &quot;computer kid&quot; of the neighborhood as everyone else just had an Atari. Used to have <i>One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird</i> tournaments on my PC for us all.<p>As I got older into HS and after I just never let go of my interest into tech. I could easily do it without feeling like it was work. Got into programming&#x2F;installing cell phones into cars in early &#x27;90s to eventually a company that built custom PC&#x27;s for businesses then got into IT support. Have tinkered with it all at different stages all along the way too - Linux, BeOS, Solaris, on and on. That progressed to Network support and eventually Network Consulting and all things tech.')
