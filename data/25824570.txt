I&#x27;m sure there are elite teams at Google, but I very much doubt the average Googler is, and that&#x27;s probably been the case for a decade at this point. The famous Rob Pike quote sums it up quite well:<p>&gt; The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software.')
