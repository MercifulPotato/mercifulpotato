Of course they&#x27;re still stuck installing from the app store. So, demand installing from outside the app store, and they&#x27;re still stuck using iOS. Demand changing the OS, and they&#x27;re still stuck using Broadcom chips and indirectly supporting the CCP.<p>These are all degrees of control, with associated trade-offs. Being able to easily alter and recompile an application is just one degree of control. There are many others you still won&#x27;t have until you can fabricate a device from raw materials. And even then maybe your government won&#x27;t allow you to access the necessary designs and materials (enforced by men with guns).<p>Ultimately, everything is a package deal, and there is really no such thing as &quot;owning&quot; nor &quot;full control&quot;, there are just contracts. For example, no one &quot;really owns&quot; their home; they rent the land from the government and (for most folks) the bank.<p>&gt; my ability to participate in the Information Age is limited<p>Indeed, because that system works for its own purposes, not for you. You must conform to it, not vice versa.
