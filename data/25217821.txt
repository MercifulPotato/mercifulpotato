If you take Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory as the foundation of math, it has a very clear, formal set of axioms.<p>And we do not know for certain that math is objective truth. If we did, there would be no philosophy of mathematics.<p>Reasoning within mathematics is objective, because math is a formal system. But to think that we know anything about anything is frankly pure arrogance. We donâ€™t know why we are here or what our universe even is at a fundamental level. Math is a human-imposed construct that we use to try and make sense of it all.')
