Their liability insurance will deny coverage for damages because they knowingly used a method that had a higher probability of harm than using new plastic.<p>I&#x27;m sure there might be some way to ensure cleanliness of steel and glass, but it&#x27;s probably cost prohibitive versus just using plastic, so it might cause the cost of the product to be too high to compete in the market.')
