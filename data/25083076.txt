That is the question as to whether or not &quot;healthy&quot; activity prevents depression or if depression causes us to reduce our healthy activity (and increase our unhealthy ones).<p>The pandemic has been a great experiment in this and has me starting to think that many of these studies might have the causal arrow wrong. I absolutely spent less time on the screen, ran more often, drank much less and slept better immediately before the pandemic.<p>Running as an example became much harder to do emotionally after the a few months of the stress induced by the pandemic. The lack of other runners out there seemed to confirm that other people were also feeling this impact.<p>I spend more time glued to the screen &quot;doom scrolling&quot; and you can bet my drinking is up as well.<p>But it&#x27;s certainly not like all of these behaviors happened and then stress set in (in this case I wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;depressed&quot; as much as &quot;stressed&quot;, ironically I&#x27;m probably the least depressed that I&#x27;ve been in years).<p>It seems to me much more likely that compulsive behaviors in general, and in this case especially the example of screen time are produced by the depression rather than it&#x27;s causes.<p>Certainly there is the possibility of positive feed backs: depression causes excessive drinking which unchecked can clearly lead to more depression. Same goes for screen time, sleep etc.')
