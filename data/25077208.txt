We were using CyberSource when PayPal approached us for negotiations - they ultimately made an offer we couldn&#x27;t refuse (based on volume) and made the switch. This CC Processor product from PayPal has none of the baggage or horror stories you hear from people using PayPal Express Checkout - it&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re dealing with a completely different company.')
