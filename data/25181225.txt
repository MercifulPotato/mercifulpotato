They never serve me ads on the followup request.<p>Perhaps as a result, I get <i>very</i> few ads when I use YouTube.  Maybe 2-3 ads per week.  I go to a friend&#x27;s house (also Apple TV) and every video they open they have to wait through 2 ads to watch it.  Even with the same videos as the ones I watch.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve found a loophole in the system?')
