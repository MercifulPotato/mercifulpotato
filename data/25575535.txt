However the unofficial chronicles are very detailed about what exactly happened and when. From those chronicles, it was a black people civilization, it was massive, advanced, but didn&#x27;t have any tech in the modern sense, it was on the rise when 850,000 B.C. it suffered the first major cataclysm (this matches with the official timeline when the earth poles got swapped), so I suppose the total lifetime of that civilization was close to 2 million years. For comparison, were only 14,000 years old - toddlers in some sense.')
