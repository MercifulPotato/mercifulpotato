I wonder if Apple paid contributors for M1 support. It is a closed eco-system so basically they have done what Apple should contribute if they think they still embrace developers, so I hope they paid them adequately. On the other hand it&#x27;s a shame that developers spend their time on this rather than other things that could benefit the wider audience rather than just users of M1. It is just my opinion.')
