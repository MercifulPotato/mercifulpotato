I used this exact technique when I wanted to improve my digital drawing skills.  I forced myself to use just a single &quot;brush&quot; to create a complete drawing every day until I had used every brush. (Desktop computer, Wacom tablet, Sketchbook Pro software.)<p>30-60 minutes per day for months.<p>At first I produced some incredible garbage. But after a while, I learned how to take advantage of scaling the brush size, changing the opacity, manipulating color, until I was actually creating pretty cool stuff with the most unlikely tools.<p>By forcing myself to <i>abuse</i> the tools, I gained skills and insights that probably would have taken me years of &quot;normal&quot; use to acquire. And these skills weren&#x27;t just a novelty - they could be applied even when I allowed myself to use the right tool (brush) for the right job.')
