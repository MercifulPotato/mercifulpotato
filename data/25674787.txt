In one city-level referendum I am personally familiar with, both sides of the referendum submitted an argument to be put into the election materials.  The &quot;Yes&quot; side (loosen a safety regulation) drastically misrepresented the status quo, implying that there was no safety regulation to begin with, and that their referendum would create it.  But in reality, the &quot;Yes&quot; vote would loosen an existing regulation.')
