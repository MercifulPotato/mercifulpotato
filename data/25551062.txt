Boca Chica has lots of wind &amp; sun.<p>Desalination can also handle the variability of wind &amp; solar quite well: just use water from a big water tank when both wind &amp; solar aren&#x27;t available.   Expensive batteries not required.  And to a first approximation it&#x27;s always windy in Boca Chica, so not much storage is required anyways.<p>OTOH, piping water from Brownsville to Boca Chica is probably a 9 figure project.')
