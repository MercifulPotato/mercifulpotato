The problem with gas is, of course, that it emits CO2 when burned or leaks methane in distribution pipelines when not burned at a consumption point. For electrical use, you absolutely do not have to revamp the grid. Before heat pump hot water heaters, and even today, there are mechanisms where hot water heaters were&#x2F;are turned on when there is cheap or excess power on the grid [1]. We would do the same today: the hot water in an insulated tank is the battery. We can keep hot liquids hot relatively affordably.<p>For the vast majority of use cases, heat pump hot water heaters are a reasonable solution [2] (unless you&#x27;ve got enormous demand within a short window of time, our heat pump hot water heater holds ~80 gallons at 120F). There is of course still work to be done for use cases where boilers are superior (high rises), but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t solvable. I&#x27;m aware of a lot of folks in row homes in Australia who are successfully using heat pump hot water heaters!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=load+shifting+water+heaters" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=load+shifting+water+heaters</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;energysaver&#x2F;water-heating&#x2F;heat-pump-water-heaters" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;energysaver&#x2F;water-heating&#x2F;heat-pump-w...</a>')
