It&#x27;s just less work than learning the actual software itself by a lot. Learning .NET&#x27;s flavor of the year framework stack is not that bad since there is lots of good documentation, classes, books, and blogs. Your software, at best, has documentation that is as good as .NET&#x27;s. This is highly unlikely though. Learning the product&#x27;s layout and quirks dwarfs learning the latest incarnation of .NET.')
