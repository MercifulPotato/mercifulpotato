With the exception of when hot spares are present the drives in each array are considered equal (unless perhaps you have some arrangement where all parity information is on a subset of the drives). Maybe during the initial build process if you are converting a single drive to an array (for instance by adding a mirror to convert to RAID1) you might call the original drive the master, but this is in the context of a master tape rather than a master&#x2F;slave allusion and even then I think I would have naturally called it the &quot;source&quot; drive instead.<p>The last time I remember referring to a drive as &quot;master&quot; was back when pre-SATA drive interfaces where dominant and you had up to two drives per interface cable.')
