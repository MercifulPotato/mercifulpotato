Twitter&#x27;s application of its policies is outrageously inconsistent, even for high-profile U.S. officials.  Otherwise, how come the many people who openly defend the extra-judicial killings by the U.S. military (from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump) have yet a twitter account?  And I&#x27;m not saying anything about tweets supporting the violent overthrow of several governments worldwide; those are tolerated because they align with U.S. interests.  Twitter <i>is</i> the ministry of truth of the U.S.A. and its main mouthpiece.')
