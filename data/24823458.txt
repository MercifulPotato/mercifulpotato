Rust with LTO on is really good about removing unused code, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt you during runtime<p>Whenever you run anything there&#x27;s millions of lines involved across the OS API&#x27;s directly or indirectly, so in practice it doesn&#x27;t matter what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. In languages with fast compile times like Go and Java people add dependencies without even caring. And I think that&#x27;s how it should be.<p>All our Java backends at work are like 200MB and it doesn&#x27;t matter and nobody cares. It still compiles in less than ten seconds, and all that code barely affects startup time.')
