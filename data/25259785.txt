The &quot;ambient&quot; quality of life in many prominent areas has been fairly abysmal for years (since long before COVID-19) and these well-paid residents simply avoid this by Ubering from one isolated &quot;nice area&quot; to another. I doubt that incrementally less public funding for education, cleaning, homeless, and drug problems is something that most of these well-paid residents would notice. They&#x27;ll just keep paying to maintain their &quot;nice areas&quot; and Uber from one to the next, just like it has been for the last 9 years I lived in SF.')
