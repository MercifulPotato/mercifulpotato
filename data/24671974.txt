Itâ€™s better to watch something a million people love than something 10 million people watched and consider okay.<p>... but the average rating is a measure of popularity :&#x2F;. The best movies I have ever seen are rated poorly, because most people didn&#x27;t understand them or they weren&#x27;t &quot;easy&quot; to watch; if you want to find good content, you need to read reviews and find people whose recommendations matter to you, not work off ratings.')
