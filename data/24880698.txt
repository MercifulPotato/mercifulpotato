I just think about Django&#x27;s `Model` class and how much time that&#x27;s saved me and probably tens of thousands of other people. It doesn&#x27;t even really seem to have any foot guns to speak of, it&#x27;s just a great use of the abstraction to build up database models without mucking about in the stuff you wish was already written.<p>The downside to them is that there is that the base class in the inheritance chain (BaseModel -&gt; Model -&gt; YourModel) has some magic that is difficult to reason about (the upside being the other side of that same token!). Thankfully, it&#x27;s reliable and there&#x27;s rare occasion to dive in.<p>Maybe this is a me problem. I don&#x27;t know how to make a nice abstraction layer like that without inheritance, so I think inheritance is sometimes the answer.')
