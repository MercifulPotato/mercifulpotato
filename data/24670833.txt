Personally, I don&#x27;t like the coroutine alternative because it takes away what is good and adds complexity.<p>Also as @R0b0t1 says, regular state machines are used in embedded:<p>- Draw a diagram<p>- Implement a state machine<p>These feels much more like engineering that messing with coroutines.')
