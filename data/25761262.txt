Put content online, have the students access it at their own leisure. Use the saved time to arrange live QA&#x2F;interactive sessions for the teachers to unblock the students if they need that (it is also a nice excuse to silently check everyone&#x27;s progress). Quit the cheating&#x2F;surveillance arms race, fully embrace open-book tests and oral exams.<p>I&#x27;d also say, try really hard not to go full remote, at least for middle school and below. There are advantages to both approaches, and a completely remote education is much harder to make work.<p>What individuals can do, I&#x27;m not really sure, I guess it depends on what your local school is doing&#x2F;allows at the moment. Fighting the bureaucracy hardly worth anybody&#x27;s time.')
