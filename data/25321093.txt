Item(by='amscanne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607229806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318434, text='&gt; It really is beyond belief that an organization with so many employees can fail to adhere to a uniform vision and standard and focus on correcting details.<p>If you’re not spent time in a huge company, this might seem to be the case. But really, Apple’s uniform standard really is the exception. I’m sure there are other organizational costs for this, such as it being harder to take risks with products or execute quickly.. but gosh they are good at producing a cohesive, mostly consistent set of products. I deeply appreciate their attention to detail and long term commitment.')
