But COVID restrictions have forced millions of people out of work&#x2F;business and into being entirely reliant on the government for money.  When a substantial portion of the population is reliant on the government for money, the government must increase its own revenue, and it will come after those that still have an income for that money.  Taxes will skyrocket, but that is unlikely to cover the shortfall, so we will also have to continue printing money at an increasing rate - devaluing our currency and the savings of those that are lucky enough to have any.<p>Ultimately, having vast swaths of the population reliant on the government for money, food, and healthcare, with oppressive taxes for those who are lucky enough to be employed&#x2F;in business, and a currency that is rapidly being devalued, is a pretty significant step on the road to socialism.')
