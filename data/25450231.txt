I&#x27;ve been on the hunt, since, to find anything as close to i3 for MacOS as possible.<p>I did come close however...there&#x27;s a hidden gem called Yabai[0] (formerly chunkwm) by koekeishiya on GitHub. For anyone looking for as close to i3 functionality as possible in MacOS, Yabai is definitely it. I&#x27;m really surprised I don&#x27;t see more people recommend it as the developer has done an excellent job trying to bring the i3 experience to Mac.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koekeishiya&#x2F;yabai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koekeishiya&#x2F;yabai</a>')
