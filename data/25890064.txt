If I&#x27;m traveling for leisure, climbing is a big part of the agenda. There are many communities for finding people to climb with on Facebook, and I&#x27;ve used them extensively.<p>Without facebook, I&#x27;d more often have to resort to self-belaying, which is much more dangerous (among other reasons, if you&#x27;re knocked unconscious there&#x27;s no one to start a rescue or call for help). Having access to the various regional climbing groups on facebook has put me in touch with so many people, so I have only had to do that on a handful of occasions.<p>There are other examples I can think of, even if none of them have been so drastic. But without access to Facebook, many people would have their lives seriously impacted, and possible lack of access to life-saving resources.')
