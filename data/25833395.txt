For example, I am happy to be rid of Gmail and Photos, but still need to use the online editor features of Docs for the time being. And some I just really like and want to keep using, like Google Music. I wonder if there is any point deleting any of the services if I don&#x27;t get rid of _all_ of them right away? Will just keeping Docs and Music and removing everything else make any meaningful impact on what data Google tracks and stores about me?')
