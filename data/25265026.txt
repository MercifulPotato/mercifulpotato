It requires the -r flag.<p>That is a lot more inconvenient than running `bundle install` and if you use Docker it gets a lot more tricky because a new lock file would get generated on every build which kind of defeats the purpose of it, because ideally you&#x27;d want to use the existing lock file in version control, not generate a new one every time you build your image.')
