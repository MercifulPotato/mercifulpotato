Most folks aren&#x27;t in open source for the returns, and any form of gratitude is uplifting and incredibly motivating. I&#x27;ve got my fingers in so many open source pies that it&#x27;s silly, but I do it because I love it. Yeah, some really big corps use my stuff and a few packages have millions of weekly downloads, but I&#x27;m not doing it for the money. It helps keep my skills and thinking fresh, networks me with a ton of people worldwide, improves my soft skills with every interaction, and makes me a better cooperative collaborator. I receive exactly $5.80 a month in donations (via Patreon) and I&#x27;m just happy that two people thought enough of my work to send me a few duckets from their hard-earned income every month. I&#x27;ll happily take that beer money and the personal development that comes with it as a reward.')
