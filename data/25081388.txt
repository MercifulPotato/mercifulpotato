Sure, there is a large class of programming languages with similar idioms where mostly only the syntax is different. I think the rise of multi paradigm languages makes this even more obvious. Nowaday, an IDE will support you with OOP, module&#x2F;package structures and functional programming.<p>However, nobody has said that the world has to end there. What about, for instance, declarative languages, domain specific languages, logic programming, computational notebooks? We still have special purpose tools for that, something which you typically don&#x27;t see in a standard IDE. (Of course you could argue that IDEs as modular software just integrate all this special purpose stuff)<p>For my perspective, one best works with an IDE if one is d&#x27;accord with all the core principles of the IDE and software ecosystem it proposes. Whenever you want to do something out of the box, the IDE reduces to nothing more then a bulky text editor. That&#x27;s why I think real innovation doesn&#x27;t happen in IDEs.')
