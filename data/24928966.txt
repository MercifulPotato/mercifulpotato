They are still running some machines for patient data management on XP since funding for that software stopped long ago. What&#x27;s especially funny is how the software is .NET based so you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s less likely to break on a Windows update....<p>And I can&#x27;t really agree with everyone solely blaming the attackers. Bad people exist. You don&#x27;t leave your front door wide open when you leave your house either and then act all surprised if you get robbed. I don&#x27;t really let &quot;don&#x27;t blame the victim&quot; count here. A malware attack is not like a natural disaster that just happens. Don&#x27;t build your house on quicksand.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s actually good this happens now and that it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; ransomware. Because maybe it raises awareness and leads to better security. Next time it might be a coordinated attack by a state actor that doesn&#x27;t just have money on their mind.')
