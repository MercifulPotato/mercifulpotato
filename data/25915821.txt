Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611669789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913095, text='I guess many software developers and security researchers tend to have worse system security due to what they do - they are likely to have an experimental environment with code signing disabled, system libraries modified, no root password, and routinely download and run random PoC and binaries for analysis. Fortunately, most use virtualization for that, and it should protect them from most threats (unless it&#x27;s a VM escape 0day), even better is to use another machine in the room (use a VM to access it remotely, since file transfers can be compromised).<p>But one must have the discipline to keep personal, production, and experimental works compartmentalized - never access your home network, personal accounts, or production server from the experimental environment. As time goes by, many usually unintentionally violated the trust boundary for convenience and creates a serious security problem.<p>However, if the attacker&#x27;s goal is to get your 0day code, all of these security measures I mentioned are totally useless. If the experimental environment is classified as an untrusted environment (it is), there&#x27;s nothing to help you if someone compromises it and steals all your exploits. A better compartmentalized environment is possible (e.g. one for all untrusted files from the web, one for personal development, and disallow the exchange of any non-text files between them), but it&#x27;s an order-of-magnitude more difficult to use.')
