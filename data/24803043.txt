There are plenty of both good and bad other scenarios that could lead to a similar result.  Falling in love, meditation, near-death experiences.  Where does your brain go when you take the bumpers off?<p>I think the biggest problem with how many people see MDMA and psychedelics is uncritically accepting the first things that come to mind after taking them, that feel oh-so-true, or that they &quot;give&quot; you insight.  It&#x27;s still you, you&#x27;re not God, you just have a whole lot more feelings for a bit.  (But, depending on what walls you have up intellectually or emotionally, having those feelings take them down for a bit can be very productive.)')
