I have clue about painting artistically but when you want to get a wall paint, or some plastic, you can basically get any color you want. So why is this important?<p>I&#x27;m guessing that maybe most colors I see are a mixture of CMYK or something alike, but if my eye can&#x27;t tell the difference, does making something only reflect a single frequency instead, matter for somebody looking at an object?')
