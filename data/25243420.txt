Even with gas stations everywhere, it&#x27;s a nuisance to frequent them, especially considering most of my trips don&#x27;t really require more than 1-2 gallons of gas.<p>It&#x27;d basically eliminate most of my need to ever fill up from empty, that would become an exceptional circumstance on long distance trips.')
