There is an entire (somewhat) underground industry of people that have ranking in Google down to a science - put exactly this on your page, set up exactly these linking domains with exactly this type of content, satisfying all of these metrics, etc. I honestly think the reason competing search engines are so much worse is just because none of them have tried very hard, or maybe because they just lack funding.<p>AFAIK, the algorithm is still the core of what it always has been (getting PR links to your page) but Google has just added a bunch of layers on top of that which basically check for things to disqualify you completely or make minor adjustments to your position in the rankings.')
