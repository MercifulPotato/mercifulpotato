Responses to the different emotions are culturally coded, hence there is no &quot;correct&quot; way to respond to an emotion. Just because someone feels a certain way does not imply or entitle them to a certain kind of treatment.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to apologize for ultra-masculine culture, but this epistemic argument about the presence or absence of emotions boils down to &quot;their culture is not my culture&quot; and just increases the divisions between those cultures and accelerates the culture war.<p>In the end - if what you actually cared about was people being uncomfortable you&#x27;d think through the economic, social and technical structures that make them feel uncomfortable. IMO, it has overwhelmingly to do with naive adoption of technology, with PC culture being a way for those who benefit from this adoption to cope with the negative results of that adoption.')
