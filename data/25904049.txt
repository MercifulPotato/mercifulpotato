Businesses charge more than what their costs are, the rest is their profit. Beggars request more than what they deliver, everything is their profit. Still beggars seem to succeed worse. I have no problem with that, but there is no reason to &quot;declare&quot; their business model illegal.<p>If you buy an Apple product you bought a status symbol. If you give to a beggar you bought a warm feeling, that it did not harm you and helped them.<p>Disclaimer: I have never bought an Apple product. I hardly ever give money to beggars. But I do give them food if I happen to carry some. Which could be my supremacy that I don&#x27;t want the to spend my money on alcohol.')
