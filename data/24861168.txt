They are extensible, meaning that third-party may define new effects and implement externally the associated effect handlers in order to customize Nickel for specific use-cases.<p>This answers your question about why Nickel is preferable to general purpose programming languages--the side-effects are more limited. Further, it reads to me like the &quot;side-effects&quot; are something that the owner of the runtime opts into by extending the sandbox with callables that can do side-effects <i>as opposed to</i> untrusted code being able to perform side-effects in any Nickel sandbox.')
