A mountainous country or region would technically have a larger surface area.<p>I started thinking a bit about how you would go about calculating that. You would need some sort of topographical map and then run a bunch of surface area calculations (approximations) between topography lines. Sounds like a fun project but I never got around to look into it much..<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;615975703&#x2F;not-my-job-colorado-gov-john-hickenlooper-gets-quizzed-on-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;615975703&#x2F;not-my-job-colorado...</a>')
