If they don&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s just superstition. People will figure it out, and they&#x27;ll stop believing you.

We&#x27;ve had ample time to run proper controlled trials for much of this stuff -- the Danes were able to do so with masks [1], and there was a big study of gyms out of Norway [2] -- it&#x27;s simply pathetic that our governments mostly haven&#x27;t bothered.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acpjournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.7326&#x2F;M20-6817" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acpjournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.7326&#x2F;M20-6817</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.06.24.20138768v3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.06.24.20138768v...</a>')
