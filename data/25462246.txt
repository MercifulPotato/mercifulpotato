They are so annoying, that the language designers <i>extended the language itself</i> to make them tolerable - do notation in Haskell, &#x27;?&#x27; operator in Rust, guard-let in Swift.<p>A plain old for loop has so much to recommend it. You get powerful control flow constructs (break&#x2F;continue&#x2F;return) and obvious performance characteristics.<p>Can you tweak your function to stop filling the first time a zero is encountered? That&#x27;s a simple one-line change with the for loop, but a puzzle for the functional iteration.')
