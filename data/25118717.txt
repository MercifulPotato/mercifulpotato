Given the demographics of Covid victims, it may only have accelerated deaths by a few months.<p>But to me it&#x27;s not even the relevant comparison. Being partisan of Sweden&#x27;s approach doesn&#x27;t mean believing Covid doesn&#x27;t exist. Even a bad flu season will have an impact on year-end mortality stats. The question is rather how much worse did Sweden do vs countries that enforced severe restriction of civil liberties. And not only Sweden didn&#x27;t do particularly bad, but it&#x27;s done better than many major European countries like France, Italy, Spain or the UK.')
