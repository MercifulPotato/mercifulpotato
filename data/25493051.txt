The tensile strength is lower perpendicular to the printing direction, as the adhesion between layers is lower than the continuous filament adhesion. So printing at an angle is better if you need more tensile strength on the Z axis (but then you can rotate it to have that axis flat), but it also reduces the strength on that angled direction.')
