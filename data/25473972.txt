At least TypeScript is statically typed and in Python we&#x27;re using type annotations everywhere. Besides, the bugs I was talking about mostly concern imports (I move file.py from A&#x2F; to B&#x2F; and PyCharm forgets to update `import A.file` to `import B.file`), and renamings (PyCharm suddenly renames some random variable deep inside dependencies like Tensorflow, too, so I end up having to re-setup my entire Python environment afterwards).<p>The thing is: Those auto-suggestions for imports work totally fine and code navigation via Ctrl+click works fine, too. So PyCharm <i>does</i> interpret the import statements correctly and I&#x27;m at a loss as to why the refactoring doesn&#x27;t work then, too. Maybe auto-completion and refactoring are two completely separate systems?')
