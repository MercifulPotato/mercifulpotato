Cold, windless days in winter are the worst case scenario for wind+solar on the grid but hydro should be at its peak around that time.<p>I was surprised to find recently that Portugal is a net exporter of energy in winter and importer in summer[1]. We&#x27;re currently building a bunch of solar and already do quite a bit of pumped hydro. Getting to 100% renewables by 2030 should be fairly straightforward but obviously not all places have the same kind of hydro resources. But maybe the European grid as a whole has what&#x27;s needed and we &quot;just&quot; need better interconnects. HVDC seems promising.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1UTUjhrBF04MP38b4WlQxx7f4JmN7YioE1cmjCOFbK3A&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1UTUjhrBF04MP38b4WlQx...</a>')
