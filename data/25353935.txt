Back in March we (I help out where I can) were all in a panic because we assumed discretionary income spending would immediately dry up due to the incoming recession â€” they are very much working class people, and will be in deep trouble if work dries up.<p>But the opposite has happened, apparently _a lot_ of people decided now is the time to remodel&#x2F;improve their home, and the family business is booked _months_ in advance. Furthermore, customers also assume that business must be low, and are aghast when we tell them that &quot;<i>No</i>, work cannot start next week, does late February work?&quot;. At the moment their biggest issue is finding enough skilled labor to meet demand, and excruciatingly slow permitting process.<p>We&#x27;re still extremely wary with how this economy is playing out, and continue to plan for the worst. I still worry for them a lot because, well Covid, but safety protocols and N95 masks were the norm before the virus took hold.')
