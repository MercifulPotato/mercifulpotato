I can easily spot the birth of a troubled project just by looking if the people who&#x27;ll be using it is represented or not.<p>In fact just last week I saved our customer a lot of money and pain by pushing on a team leader to get involved in their project to switch ERP solution. I was working on the integration between the new ERP and our program and noticed the users of our program were not involved at all, so leaned on the team lead to rustle her feathers. This team is small but performs an essential job for the company, if they can&#x27;t do their job things grind to a halt.<p>After the team leader got involved she quickly discovered another department had gotten a change in which would be a complete showstopper for her team. Undoing this change after it had rolled out would have been non-trivial. Fortunately it was still early days in the project.<p>This is the most recent example, but yeah I see it all the time. The ones where the right people aren&#x27;t involved invariably end up bad in one way or another.')
