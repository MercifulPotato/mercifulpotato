I understand that in the case of 3D graphics if the textures don&#x27;t fit in the GPUs memory, FIFO ordering will cause ALL textures to be ejected every frame as you cycle through the same objects in the same order, whereas reversing the order every frame means just the same batch of overflow textures &quot;at the end&quot; will get ejected every other frame.')
