Item(by='drzaiusapelord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608237576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459608, text='Almost half the things I buy on amazon come with a little postcard thing that tells me I&#x27;ll get anywhere between $10-$30 back as cash if I leave a 5 star review. If I wasn&#x27;t in a slightly comfortable place financially, and not so lazy, I would absolutely do this. None of those products deserved a 5 star review, and perhaps 1&#x2F;3rd were returned by me for poor quality. This is absolutely a real problem. The few review sections where people point this out means I won&#x27;t buy and I probably saved myself a ton of returns by doing that, but now that is no longer an option.<p>Amazon is cultivating a lot of bad will with this. I imagine their sellers will claim they don&#x27;t do this (even when they do), then Amazon feels obligated to pull those reviews to please the sellers and in a conflict between sellers and customers, Amazon will tend to pick sellers in fear of them just moving to Aliexpress and hurting Amazon.<p>and as others have said, these are OEM&#x27;s, this is their product and no one else sells it. Amazon is pretty much a sales portal for Chinese manufacturers, some of whom are shady like this, to get into the states with minimum overhead, hassle, and oversight.')
