Got offers from some FAANG&#x27;s after 2 years-ish of full time work at a smaller company.<p>My route: Linkedin. Just setting my profile to &quot;open to work&quot; or whatever it is has worked in landing me some interviews.<p>After you get an interview (completely luck based) you need to study leetcode. IMO if you can do 200 in 1-2 months focusing heavily on medium, you will be prepared. At that point you need to ace your onsite interview by doing very well in 4&#x2F;5 or so of the sessions (slightly luck based). Then you wait forever until google decides to finally give you an offer :)')
