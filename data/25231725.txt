To be a successful scientist, for example, it&#x27;s not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be both correct and novel. You can&#x27;t publish papers saying things other people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized yet.<p>The same is true for investors. It&#x27;s not enough for a public market investor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot of other people make the same prediction, the stock price will already reflect it, and there&#x27;s no room to make money. The only valuable insights are the ones most other investors don&#x27;t share.<p>You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don&#x27;t want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn&#x27;t — like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers&#x27; floors.<p>Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.<p>But this pattern isn&#x27;t universal. In fact, it doesn&#x27;t hold for most kinds of work. In most kinds of work — to be an administrator, for example — all you need is the first half. All you need is to be right. It&#x27;s not essential that everyone else be wrong.<p>There&#x27;s room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but in practice there&#x27;s a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of work where it&#x27;s essential to be independent-minded, and the kinds where it&#x27;s not.<p>I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid, because it&#x27;s one of the most important things to think about when you&#x27;re deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to do the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently from everyone else? I suspect most people&#x27;s unconscious mind will answer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to. I know mine does.<p>Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than nurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you&#x27;re going to be unhappy. If you&#x27;re naturally independent-minded, you&#x27;re going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you&#x27;re naturally conventional-minded, you&#x27;re going to be sailing into a headwind if you try to do original research.<p>One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about where they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded. Conventional-minded people don&#x27;t like to think of themselves as conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them as if they make up their own minds about everything. It&#x27;s just a coincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers&#x27;. And the independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how different their ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state them publicly. [1]<p>By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart they are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems), because they&#x27;re constantly being tested and ranked according to it. But schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the extent they try to suppress it. So we don&#x27;t get anything like the same kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are.<p>There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where the most conventional-minded people are confident that they&#x27;re independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry they might not be independent-minded enough.<p>___________<p>Can you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This quality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify it, or at least not to suppress it.<p>One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It&#x27;s hard to be a conformist if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re supposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people already are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would probably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and make more effort to find out.<p>It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you&#x27;re surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you&#x27;ll have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to, and to think of more.&quot;<p>This is the exact opposite of my experience. My independent-mindedness happens the most as a <i>reaction</i> to being surrounded by too much groupthink. On the other hand, when I&#x27;m surrounded by people who are already having plenty of crazy ideas, they begin to feel a bit tiresome to me, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to have any of my own.')
