If you&#x27;re surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have. But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you&#x27;ll have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to, and to think of more.&quot;<p>This is the exact opposite of my experience. My independent-mindedness happens the most as a <i>reaction</i> to being surrounded by too much groupthink. On the other hand, when I&#x27;m surrounded by people who are already having plenty of crazy ideas, they begin to feel a bit tiresome to me, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to have any of my own.')
