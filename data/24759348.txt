Though here in NYC I do routinely see heavily armed actual troops (they might be National Guard? not sure), at Penn Station, Grand Central, and airports.<p>No, I&#x27;m not referring to 9&#x2F;11.  However, over the past several decades, there have been several attempted&#x2F;successful terrorist attacks by people on the ground.  At some point you do need someone heavily armed enough to take out an active ongoing attack, like what we saw in Mumbai or Paris.  The odds of it happening again within the next decade are not that small.  Do you really do nothing to even try to be ready to respond to it?  I just don&#x27;t think most voters are going to be willing to accept it.')
