The farm is operated by &quot;Nordic Harvest&quot;, with claims that it can produce <i></i>200 tons<i></i> of products in 2021 on a 7000 sqm footprint. The products would be fresh herbs and salads (the website only displays fresh herbs). So the total output of <i>herbs</i> on year 1 would be more than the equivalent surface of beetroot, one of the heaviest products. The site says the farm uses &quot;no fertilizer&quot; then comes to explain than they only use &quot;natural fertilizer&quot;. The entire thing looks like a byproduct of the windmill industry, which is crumbling because of intermittent surplus of cheap electricity.

Some company builds a &quot;farm&quot; on its roof (with bee hives), advertises it as a totem of some vacant post-carbon strategy, collects fiscal incentives, then the farm never gets to see its 3rd year because it&#x27;s so impossibly hard to even dream of reaching profitability or large-scale production. In Paris, the &quot;largest farm in the world&quot; is twice the size of this dutch &quot;world largest&quot; and actually operated by Unibail Westfield (and produces barely anything): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;press-room&#x2F;press-news&#x2F;world-largest-urban-farm-rooftop-at-parix-expo-porte-de-versailles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urw.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;press-room&#x2F;press-news&#x2F;world-largest-u...</a><p>There are exceptions in urban farming (Lufa in Montreal, some sites in Singapore) but the PR pressure and laziness of journalist coverage is ruining it from the inside.')
