The sine function really has no reason to be anything besides a function. I am not sure, though, that writing the simplest thing possible results in mostly pure functions. In my experience programming is mostly about managing a state. My programming jobs have generally been about tracking what the state of some other piece of hardware and&#x2F;or software is. It seems hard to escape state in that case. In my spare time I have lately been writing a compiler like thing. That seems to be, among other things, about maintaining a stack of all the stuff that has been defined&#x2F;declared previously. If so many things are about maintaining a state, how practical is this &#x27;mostly functions&#x27; thing actually?')
