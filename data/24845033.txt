Yeah, it runs Edge and Office, but none of the closed-source line-of-business software that are baked into people&#x27;s refined-over-20-years workflow.  None of the games with such aggressive and brittle DRM and anti-cheat they break under even official Insider builds.  None of the drivers for obscure peripherals that the manufacturer disowned by 2010.  You still have a sky-high switching risk.<p>The way out I could imagine would be some sort of packaged virtualization, like the &quot;XP Mode&quot; feature on Windows 7.  Your legacy apps spin up in a thin, well-integrated VM which ran a &quot;final&quot; build of classic Win10 designed for minimal disruption.  The VMs, in turn, would be aggressively sandboxed and firewalled to keep it tamed.  I&#x27;d suspect there&#x27;d still be some gaps-- drivers for hardware that can&#x27;t be easily wired to a VM, but I suspect there&#x27;s a mountain of logistics and performance issues that don&#x27;t fit in a two-paragraph post.')
