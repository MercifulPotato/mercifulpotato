Every design decision made in other periods shoehorns in the assumption whichever faction these ahistorically-inserted Assassins are allied to are &#x27;good guys&#x27; who believe in freedom fighting an evil conspiracy very loosely associated with a historical Christian order, as well as assumptions like the opportunity to roleplay Vikings will sell more games than protecting Saxon homesteads (commercial pressures the author is well aware of when discussing other design decisions). I&#x27;m more surprised by the historically inaccurate weapon choices tbh.<p>It&#x27;s clearly an article written by someone with plenty of knowledge about the actual history to share, but still reminds me of an old flatmate criticising the physics of the Simpson&#x27;s Movie!')
