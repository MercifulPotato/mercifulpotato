But I think it&#x27;s probably actually a highbrow vision of (Central) Europe amalgamated into a union where the supposed peace comes from the amalgamation rather than from subversion.<p>The radial &quot;kantons&quot; in the map, for example, have been denoted as having a military presence of various ethnic groups, not just Germanic, and the various ethnic groups maintaining a military presence are all over the place and alternating over each neighbouring sector&#x2F;&quot;kanton&quot;.<p>I also don&#x27;t really think a German propaganda map would include things such as present southern Italy being assigned as part of Greece when Greece was actually neutral or Allied during World War 1 (and invaded by Nazi Germany in WW2, in case you&#x27;d think the map was from Nazi Germany age.)<p>Edit: The metadata also says it&#x27;s from 1920, as the title indicates<p>Edit 2: Most people outside of the British&#x2F;US world probably also wouldn&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s a particular day there. Have a good one, though.')
