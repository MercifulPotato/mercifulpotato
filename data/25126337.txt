And I think that&#x27;s the key point: the main git porcelain was hacked together by the Linux kernel team to match their workflow.<p>Now, I have strong disagreements with GitHub&#x27;s semantics. I want code reviews to be per commit, not per branch, and I want an easy way to stack up a bunch of commits, make changes each of them as I get review feedback, and then merge a whole range at the bottom of the stack as I they are accepted.<p>Right now I do this by living in git rebase -i, putting a little tag in each commit message to name what remote branch it should be pushed to, adding an exec command in my rebase -i that extracts that branch and does the push, and then working with wiring together all these remote PRs on all these remote branches.')
