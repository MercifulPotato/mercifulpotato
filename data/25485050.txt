More cores are very useful for servers, but Apple&#x27;s primary concern is to demonstrate good performance under desktop workloads.<p>The 4 high performance cores and 4 low performance cores of the M1 should give more than enough performance for regular desktop tasks, writing emails, browsing, desktop publishing etc.<p>But as a desktop user you have special use cases where you really need performance. A lot of people who use Macs use them for video editing or image editing. These are demanding tasks and it makes sense that Apple has made special hardware to deal with these tasks. A MacBook Air with M1 e.g. can now encode video at less than half the time of the most expensive high end iMac ($4000). That means that specialized hardware really pays for itself.<p>General purpose cores are no different than ASICs most to the time, as neither one will be needed for most common workloads. In a regular day to day usage you are never going to need say 32 cores working constantly.<p>As a software developer I can see a benefit for more cores to do compilations, but most people are not developers and anyway Apple is planning 32-core M chips.<p>Anyway for the kind of work I do now my 2013 model Mac Pro is still more than fast enough. But I do do video and audio work at times. Here those special coprocessors would really benefit me as well.')
