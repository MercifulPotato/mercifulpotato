Given BLM was protesting mistreatment and institutionalised racism (especially in the police), do you not think it’s at all plausible that the police response would be racially-charged in how they respond to the protests?<p>2. The headline it’s literally says “one authors <i>controversial</i> view...”: it is entirely reasonable to entertain an idea for the purposes of analysing it without actually advocating it.<p>3. “In defence of destroying property”: this is inherently ideological I think, I for one place human lives above that of mere materials, and if people need to smash some windows in order to make their voices heard that is ok: we can repair windows, we can bring unjustly-murdered people back from the dead. Maybe a better way of framing this particular one is in reverse: “why is a window shop-front more valuable&#x2F;important than someone’s life and human rights?”<p>Edit: Twitter thread: conflating “we wish to overthrow the government and kill our opposition” with “please stop killing us; we will make these protests more uncomfortable until we are heard” is disingenuous at best, and a flat-out mischaracterisation at worst.   Nelson Mandela spent time in prison as well: does that mean nothing he said has any value?')
