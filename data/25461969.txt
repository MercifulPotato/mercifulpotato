I put 180g red lentils in my pressure cooker with 500ml water and 400g frozen broccoli. Done in about 10 minutes. Very filling, tasty and healthy. I usually eat it with rice. Add whatever spice you like but I recommend turmeric, cumin, cayenne, mustard seed, and black pepper. But it also tastes good with just salt!')
