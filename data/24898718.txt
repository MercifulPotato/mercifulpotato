In an ideal world, I could run a torrent client at home and have it proxy though my vps so it doesn&#x27;t leak my home IP.<p>The other way I can see it working is being able to add a torrent to both my vps and server at home, and have the torrent client at home only ever talk to the single remote box so I still end up with the torrent at home without leaking my home IP and without having to download the finished files as a second step.')
