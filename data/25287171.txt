Considering that we were able to somehow run the web (and messaging and mail and apps) 20-30 years ago with much, much less capable computers. It&#x27;s almost as if computers have become way too powerful, so we had to invent atrocious web apps to offset any performance advances. Similarly, F&#x2F;OSS was too ubiquitous so we had to invent &quot;the cloud&quot;. I can&#x27;t help to see anything other than a self-serving power end game in this, with a few monopolies grabbing everything left, and a legion of developers having a vested interest to keep the hamster wheel spinning.<p>Regarding the implementations of http&#x2F;2 and up you speak of, I know only a single F&#x2F;OSS one (ng-http2) actually used in server-side production.')
