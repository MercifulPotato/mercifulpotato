You’re not seeing the affect and effects it’s having in day to day life.<p>I’m a white guy. Last week I went through a grocery store after forgetting my mask in my car. I needed to use the restroom badly and didn’t realize I had forgotten the mask until I was mid-stream. That’s when I understood why people were looking at me like a potential threat with fear in their eyes. They probably assumed I was “yet another” anti-masker there to threaten and attack them verbally or worse. (I quickly left to the car and got my mask.)')
