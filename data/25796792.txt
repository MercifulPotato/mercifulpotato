A spreadsheet works just fine for this.  Keep group meetings short and to the point. Spend time working with project&#x2F;product managers to decide on tools, training and R&amp;D initiatives to maximize productivity, utility, profits and new business opportunities. They know what&#x27;s not working. Good luck with your journey.')
