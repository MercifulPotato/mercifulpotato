I had no need for that before corona virus, I do need one now.</i><p>I&#x27;m not questioning that you really do need a LTCF, but with COVID and the protests and the election suddenly <i>everyone</i> &quot;needs&quot; a gun.<p>So there&#x27;s reduced capacity + HUGE surge in demand + severe budget shortfalls. It&#x27;s not a conspiracy. It&#x27;s just queuing theory.<p><i>&gt; Bucks county is issuing it in 15 minutes. Philly does a whole interview process which goes beyond a basic NICS check and they have chosen to be poorly staffed for a very long time.</i><p>Allegheny is far less onerous than Philly but also has long wait times.<p>Also, these super long wait times are a relatively recent development. I expect Sheriff&#x27;s offices will do what they can to address the problem in the new FY.<p><i>&gt; Anyway, it&#x27;s all really arguing something that should be moot - A persons right should not depend on the government service choosing to open its office.</i><p>Again, priorities. Tell that to the people waiting in jail for far longer than constitutionally permissible for hearings because of delays in the courts. Should we reallocate cash from judicial processes to CCW processes and have those folks wait in jail an extra few months so that folks who got all jittery a few months before the election can forget to show up to their CCW appointments?')
