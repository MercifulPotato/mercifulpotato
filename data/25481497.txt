That&#x27;s huge.<p>The alternative is advertising - for now - Apple doesn&#x27;t go after that.<p>Many businesses to not run on huge margins - if you could eke out a 5% margin living under Apple&#x27;s 30% cut, and switch to ads (assuming same revenue&#x2F;gross margins), then you&#x27;d 5x your revenue.<p>Of the monopolizers, Facebook is the least worst - nobody needs them, and they&#x27;re not a primary source for anything.<p>Apple&#x27;s closed system is the worst, followed by Google&#x27;s incumbency of search, propped up by their control of Android, Chrome etc. Thirdly is Google&#x27;s abuse of Search to screw over competitors in near fields.')
