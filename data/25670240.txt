I&#x27;m just saying that Wire&#x2F;Signal&#x2F;Threema&#x2F;etc. having better encryption is in my opinion only important when you use Wire&#x27;s&#x2F;Signal&#x27;s&#x2F;Threema&#x27;s servers. If you can <i>and do</i> host your own, especially if you host it at home, then in practice there is no difference.<p>Since most people don&#x27;t do that, Signal&#x2F;Wire&#x2F;Threema&#x2F;Matrix are of course the better options than PGP+email, but PGP+email is still an improvement over the status quo.')
