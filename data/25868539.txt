Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25868551], score=None, time=1611292254, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868475, text='I think the proposed Alexander article hurt the NYT&#x27;s reputation among a cohort of potential readers who firmly believe in Crichton&#x27;s Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect and have weird ideas about journalism to begin with. I don&#x27;t think it cost them meaningfully. I am certain that the way Alexander handled the situation more or less ensured that his name would be on the tips of lots of people&#x27;s tongues --- that&#x27;s the infamous &quot;Streisand Effect&quot; in action.<p>I don&#x27;t so much care about Alexander. I won&#x27;t use his real name, because there&#x27;s no upside to it for anyone here or on HN. I do care about the idea of Reddit norms infecting journalism; that sounds horrible, because Reddit is atrocious at journalism.')
