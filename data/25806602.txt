Should the application logic be coupled to a http REST API (and thus map application errors to status codes etc), or does that belong in the controller?<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that it&#x27;s more practical, initially, as you&#x27;ve described it. However, I think it&#x27;s important to point out the tradeoff rather than presenting it as purely more efficient. I&#x27;ve seen this approach result in poor separation of concerns and bloated use cases (`DoTheActualThing`) which become tedious to refactor, albeit in other languages.<p>One predictable side effect of the above, if you&#x27;re working with junior engineers, is that they are likely going to write tests for the application logic with a dependency on the request &#x2F; response as inputs, and asserting on status codes etc. I shudder to think how many lines of code I&#x27;ve read dedicated to mocking req&#x2F;res that were never needed in the first place.')
