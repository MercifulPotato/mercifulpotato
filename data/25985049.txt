Item(by='podiki', descendants=None, kids=[25985164], score=None, time=1612148412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25985023, text='I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll eventually ease up (there&#x27;s always a crunch with new GPUs and consoles, plus all the factors of 2020&#x2F;21), but I don&#x27;t take AMD&#x27;s word for much as their early PR on launch availability was hardly good. This was after what we saw happen for Nvidia&#x27;s launch too.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s blame to go around, and these days I&#x27;m more inclined to look at how poorly retailers handle it. There are few (or none) backorders or queuing, and sometimes easily gamed systems. Either way they get their money, but it&#x27;s not a good look. (It is not the end of the world, but annoying and doubly so when so many of us are stuck inside. Certainly much worse problems to have, I know.)')
