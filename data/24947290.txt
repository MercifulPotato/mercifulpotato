Just because they are seemingly replaceable doesn&#x27;t mean it would be a good idea to replace them with third party repairs in a highly minutarized device.<p>The items being tied is a red herring. Changing the camera for example has security implications (consider that the camera module is e.g. forced to light a led when on, so that you&#x27;re not recorded without knowing, and that&#x27;s a hardware feature tied to the secure enclave. A changed camera module can also have implications for face id. And whose to guarantee that the third party &quot;repaired&quot; iPhone is still waterproof to the rating Apple provides?')
