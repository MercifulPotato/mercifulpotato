Item(by='user5994461', descendants=None, kids=[25234190], score=None, time=1606519493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25233407, text='&gt;&gt;&gt;  The points in the post are reasonable provided there&#x27;s fair equity for the employees (which I believe is disclosed prior to joining - I have no knowledge about dilution, preference etc).<p>That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t understand. Long story short, employee&#x27;s equity is worthless because it will always be reduced to nothing by dilution&#x2F;preference and even if the company grows a hundred fold.<p>There are only two people who benefit from a (very) successful company, the founder and the investor.<p>The first point of the article, that the founder expects employees to care about the company as much as him, is delusional. Folks here understand that because they&#x27;ve been burned before.<p>There&#x27;s no reason for employees to care so much about a day job because they will get nothing beyond their regular salary. If anything they are risking quite a bit by working for a smaller company.')
