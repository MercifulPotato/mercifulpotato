If you mean the return value, that depends on the semantics&#x2F;ABI of the language, but if it would result in an allocation, that can be eliminated by another round of inlining. Functional compilers typically have to deal with the tradeoff between code size and compile time (from lots of inlining) and runtime allocation.')
