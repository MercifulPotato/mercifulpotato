Still, it&#x27;s 360uA per MHz, counting the two 125MHz M0+ cores as 250MHz total.  That&#x27;s pretty power hungry compared to other Cortex M0+ products which tend to be in the 100uA&#x2F;MHz range.  I think the real product here is the RP2040 SOC and the Pico board is described as a breakout board for it.  I like to think the RP2040 will find its way onto future RPi Linux boards, to give them some analog and realtime capabilities.')
