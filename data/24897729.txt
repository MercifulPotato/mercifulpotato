I don&#x27;t know if it was that the devs were not good, the communication loop was bad, they were supporting too many outsourcing customers at once, or what.  But, on multiple occasions I&#x27;ve seen it not turn out well.  That ship sailed long before the pandemic.<p>So, the question is, will it work any better in Michigan?  Quite possibly; the timezone and language differences are much less.  Plus, if you worked for Microsoft or Google, you probably wouldn&#x27;t try to also work for 2-3 other employers at the same time.  But, if the issue was simply that remote work impedes good communication, the results will be similar.<p>My guess, it will sometimes work.  I guess we&#x27;ll find out soon.')
