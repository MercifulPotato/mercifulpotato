This is why this article exists in the first place - it highlights the fact that Americans (and other undeveloped nations) basically follow nature. If someone is unfit to survive in their environment, then they will eventually end up being absorbed back into nature. The fallacy that I can&#x27;t live with, is that some people try to pretend that there is a safety net.<p>I&#x27;ve got a 2 year old who is deaf &#x2F; blind and has serious cognitive issues. Since me and my wife both do well in the game of capitalism - we are entitled to none of whatever &quot;safety net&quot; exists.<p>If you can survive without showing your disability, that&#x27;s what works best in America. There are horror stories of people losing entire careers and there way of life - because they told their superior about the burdens of raising disabled children. Its better to hide these truths, everyone will have a better chance of survival.')
