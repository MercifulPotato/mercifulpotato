Its not necessary at all, and diminishes the idea of natural selection.<p>Creatures&#x2F;species don&#x27;t get selected because of what they want. The ones that behave to avoid early death (before reproduction) are represented larger in the population. The makeup of the population shifts over time. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s about all. No need to imagine an urge.<p>Further, some (many) creatures die during reproduction. They have no urge for survival at all - just the opposite.<p>To go on, plants are subject to selection. Do they have urges too?  Insects can hardly be attributed complex emotions - more like little robots. They are subject to selection, with no need for urges.<p>No, its all a game of dice and happenstance.')
