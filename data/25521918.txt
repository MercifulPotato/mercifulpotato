The &quot;good&quot; news is that elderly, mildly conservative people are more prone to get vaccinated, so at least, if the vaccines are as efficient as hoped in the long run, it should release some pressure on the hospitals. Which might make it possible to release some of the restrictions, which might just calm people down a bit and let everyone have a cooler debate, possibly in a year or two.Then, we&#x27;ll have a presidential election and(no kidding) a referendum about making the constitution talk about climate change. It will be less profitable to spew conspiracy theory about vaccines, so laymen will take their shots, and we&#x27;ll get crazy and insane about something else. Maybe a world cup or something ?')
