I&#x27;m glad OP found a solution that works for them, but I hope too many people don&#x27;t start using this technique.<p>A user could comment using any fediverse account, including Pleroma, Friendica, PixelFed, etc. Summing that up with &#x27;mastodon account&#x27; is damaging to the whole idea of the fediverse. Non-technical people might not realize that they can choose to use the other platforms.<p>Also, I hate that the mastodon API has become the de facto standard for interacting with any fediverse platform. The other platforms implemented the API to maintain compatibility with mastodon clients. Now this not-quite-standard API is controlled by a single person who doesn&#x27;t care about compatibility with other platforms.')
