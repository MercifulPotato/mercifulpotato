We have the words &quot;marron&quot; (which is literally the colour of a chestnut - in French is it obvious whether it is the colour that comes from the fruit or the reverse) and &quot;brun&quot; (same origin as brown) which are equivalent, one or the other being preferred depending on the region.<p>&quot;Couleur café&quot; is most often used to refer to skin colour, and mostly for poetic or literary purposes.')
