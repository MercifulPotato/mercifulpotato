Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607112094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303329, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t find cold places to be as unwalkable as hot ones. You get used to the cold, the snow&#x2F;ice are generally cleared after a few days.<p>&gt; If anything, walkability is frequently about how a place looks and winter time can look quite nice with all the snow.<p>Why do you walk? Is it to go for a purposeless, leisurely afternoon stroll? Or to on a daily basis, go to your job, the grocery, to the dentist, the hairdresser?<p>In order for a place to be walkable, you should be able to safely, and predictably, with 99% confidence, be able to <i>purposefully</i> walk to that job, that grocery, that dentist, and that hairdresser, at <i>any</i> time of day - not just on a sunny weekend afternoon, after all the snow has been shoveled.<p>Any place with snow on the ground for 4-5 months out of the year is a misery of walkability. Maybe your job starts at 7 am, and walking to it sucks, because the snow hasn&#x27;t been shoveled yet. Sometimes, you need to avoid patches of black ice (Good luck when you&#x27;re carrying heavy bags of groceries). For weeks, at the start, and the end of the season, you are dealing with absolutely atrocious slush, that has a habit of freezing over-night.<p>I don&#x27;t really care about the cold - I can solve that problem by putting on more clothes. I do care about all the other problems of walking in snow.<p>I now live in a mild climate, where snow isn&#x27;t an issue. I can, with full confidence, walk anywhere I want on any day of the year, any time of day, and predictably get there at a good pace. I couldn&#x27;t say the same for when I lived in a cold climate.')
