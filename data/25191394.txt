(The images don&#x27;t have legs, but that part is cropped so it is not weird.)<p>&gt; <i>Scarring is not just about aesthetics. It&#x27;s about pain and swelling and limited movement and things like that.</i><p>In some images I notice the scar and though: &quot;<i>More symmetric is better, but that means an additional surgery. I don&#x27;t like surgeries unless they are absolutely necessary.</i>&quot; I don&#x27;t remember what I selected, but it was a difficult choice because the question in the survey and my preferences have a different answers. I probably answer half following the instructions and half my opinion.')
