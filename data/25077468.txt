After 13 years of this I just find it really hard to care that much about X startup or tech company. My daily work is basically the same no matter where and what industry I&#x27;m at. Given some baseline of company quality. There is probably some upper echelon that I&#x27;m not smart enough or hard working enough or care about enough to break into - because it would require sacrificing too much of my personal life. And I don&#x27;t mean your run of the mill FAANG corporations.<p>The quality of my work is better than ever but my caring is at an all time low. I still study new technologies and learn better soft skills and it&#x27;s easier than ever with great resources and the perspective from experience. I&#x27;ve had my share of lottery tickets in startups and grinding away at bigger companies and what I truly want is like a 3 or 4 day work week.')
