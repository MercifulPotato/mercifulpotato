Raw HTML and CSS do the job.<p>That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. \n```<p>So often people forget not everything sitting on the web has the same needs. saying &#x27;you don&#x27;t need a framework&#x27; ignores that, maybe i do infact need one, because otherwise i&#x27;d have to write it myself.')
