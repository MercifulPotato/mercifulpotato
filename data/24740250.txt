My friend on pakistan can connect to my openvpn server, but after the vpn connection established no packet ever made it to the server. This happened suddenly since last month. The same person also said my wireguard vpn server doesn&#x27;t work, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to configuration issues on their end or blocking as I don&#x27;t have log on that server. If it&#x27;s true it seems to be utilizing some deep packet inspection stuff,  which means the Pakistan government is really serious about policing their citizen&#x27;s internet access.')
