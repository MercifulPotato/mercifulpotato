The shortage of accountants could be due to some combination of:<p>1. There are not enough people with the physical &#x2F; mental &#x2F; psychological capability to be accountants in the US<p>2. People with the physical &#x2F; mental &#x2F; psychological capability to be accountants are choosing other jobs; perhaps because they pay better, or are more fun, or have better work&#x2F;life balance, or whatever.<p>#1 is a reason to steal^W import capable people from other countries; but I doubt very much that&#x27;s the source of accounting&#x27;s problems.  It&#x27;s almost certainly #2.  In which case, if accounting firms want more accountants, they should make the job more attractive: pay more, have better hours, etc.')
