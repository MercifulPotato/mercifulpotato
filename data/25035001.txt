As for meditation it never really worked for me unless I&#x27;m already calmed down - so it&#x27;s only helping after exercise. At the moment green tea seems to have some effects but I gave up on thinking I can fix this myself (trying on&#x2F;off without much lasting success for more than 10 years..)  and now looking into getting a diagnosis and maybe try meds if the doctors they that it might help.')
