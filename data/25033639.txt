Imagine an itch that won&#x27;t go away no matter how much you scratch it. The male urge to mate is very strong, but goes away the instant the act is completed. Sex does indeed mean everything to men some of the time, but it means very little most of the time. Without that relief and absolute end to the act it would be more like a never ending drug addiction than something worthwhile pursuing.')
