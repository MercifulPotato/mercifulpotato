Item(by='DavidPeiffer', descendants=None, kids=[25652651, 25659681], score=None, time=1609887299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651567, text='&gt;You&#x27;re implying &quot;worrying about&quot; or wanting to know what the monthly payment is on a loan is a bad thing and I don&#x27;t understand why.<p>I stopped into a car dealer to look at a vehicle a couple years ago. I liked how it drove, could pay cash, but wasn&#x27;t opposed to taking out a loan if I could get a better price overall (sometimes possible with fees banks pay to used dealers for getting a loan originated).<p>In my experience, they brought out a sheet of paper with a range of what the monthly payment would be. I asked about interest rate, and the sales guy had no idea what interest rates the payments equated to - but he could get me an exact payment after doing a hard pull on my credit. They resisted negotiating on the total cost of the vehicle, but were very willing to extend the loan out to make the payment exactly what I wanted&#x2F;could afford.<p>I could see it wasn&#x27;t going anywhere, told them to call me if they get serious about reducing the price, and left. I found a great car on the private market a short time later.')
