I will try, and probably not do a great job; I&#x27;m still digesting it.<p>The world is both &quot;nebulous&quot; [1] and patterned; observed patterns aren&#x27;t really out there so much as a combination of &quot;there&quot; and in our mind. Some of these patterns are incredibly useful. One pattern is &quot;the rational &#x2F; modern world view&quot;, which lets science work. It is very good, but not complete.<p>Post-modernism noticed that no pattern is a perfect fit on the partially-nebulous world, and went nowhere with that, and ended up in a nihilistic, bad place. That isn&#x27;t good.<p>The goal is to see patterns as useful, conventional truths, not ultimate truths.
