I&#x27;ve been thinking of making my own bookmark storage&#x2F;sorting thing as others didn&#x27;t quite match my exact needs&#x2F;preferences. But a key problem that I have, which I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m unique in, is that I&#x27;m often too lazy to even bookmark - I just open things in new tabs and leave them there until I get around to going back or forget the relevance and close a pile of windows&#x2F;tabs to save memory...')
