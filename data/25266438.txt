Our long term mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives - we want to understand biology so well that we can fix most things that go wrong in our bodies. Among other awesome folks, Yoshua Bengio is one of our advisors, and helps our ML team come up with novel ways of tackling these problems.<p>We’re looking for:<p>* Senior Data Scientist, NGS Assay Development and Bioinformatics (SLC, UT): Strategize in collaboration with biologists and data scientists on the right NGS-based assays to complement Recursion’s multi-petabyte-scale cellular perturbation and imaging platform<p>* Machine Learning Scientist, Chemistry (Anywhere): Looking for a highly experienced senior&#x2F;principal-level Machine Learning Scientist who wants a challenging problem, lots of rich data, and knowledge that their breakthroughs will seriously help people. No bio background needed.<p>* Senior Data Scientist: Come analyze experimental results, develop best-practice analytical methods for a field that has none, and build the computational tooling required to fuel Recursion’s drug-discovery engine.<p>* Senior Machine Learning Scientist, Computer Vision (Anywhere) : You&#x27;ll design state-of-the-art neural networks and train them on our massive in-house biological image datasets<p>* Data Scientist, Drug Discovery (SLC,UT): Bring your unique approach and innovative thinking in developing scalable solutions in drug discovery that immediately impact decisions.<p>* Senior Infrastructure Engineer: Contribute to and promote a DevSecOps culture at Recursion.
