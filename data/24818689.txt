However for people who considered OpenWRT, there are few equivalents... pfsense but it seemed I would have just moved sideways and the lesson of the CVE was to align with desktop type distros that have infrastructure teams and more eyes.<p>This has two mini PCI cards for wifi, one for 2.4GHz and one for 5GHz, they don&#x27;t reach comparable speeds but it is very reliable.  It also has 128GB msata SSD mini PCI.<p>Once Linux was installed, I was surprised nmcli + firewalld is really powerful now, I could set up a multizone AP with two mini PCI cards and Ethernet routing in a couple of hours googling, and it worked stably and just how I intended.  For anything else, it&#x27;s a normal Linux box with the kind of normal storage and packages you don&#x27;t get on commodity routers.')
