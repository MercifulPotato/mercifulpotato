These other departments can flag any visa for additional scrutiny.<p>When excessive delays like this occur it is often a security flag, because then it has to go back to the origin agency and even the department within that originally created the flag to decide if it is a valid match to this individual (and or the facts are correct).<p>Keep in mind that the other departments handling this, it isn&#x27;t their primary responsibility. They&#x27;re dealing daily with e.g. terrorist threats, drug trafficking, or similar threats&#x2F;violations. Nobody is interested in prioritizing State&#x27;s visa processing (of which they receive many).<p>Plus the people or department who created the original match could no longer exist&#x2F;work there, and now the request is bouncing between different departments with nobody wanting to take responsibility for it.<p>PS - Just to be clear I&#x27;m not defending this. It is a giant mess and hugely dysfunctional. But to understand why something can get stuck in &quot;administrative processing&quot; for years, you have to realize how deep this rabbit hole goes.')
