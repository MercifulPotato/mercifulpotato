Weekly church attendance by Christians in Poland and the US are both 41% (actually another source shows ~55% attendance in Poland), given that Poland has comparatively more Christians, weekly attendance overall is higher too. Catholicism places a greater emphasis on weekly mass as compared to the informal daily prayer more common in protestant, and specifically in US Evangelical, Christianity. I&#x27;ll admit that Hungary is less, their church attendance is lower.<p>&gt; As to what Democrats would do—we already have examples. FDR-appointed Supreme Courts interpreted the Establishment Clause to create a “wall of separation” prohibiting, for example, things like optional religious instruction in public schools, or public support of religious schools. These things are quite common in Europe.<p>I made a major edit to my prior comment, which I&#x27;ll summarize here: the two nations you cite have constitutional callouts for state sponsorship of religion and state religious education. So this comparison isn&#x27;t apt. The constitutional axioms in the US and Poland or Hungary are totally different. They aren&#x27;t secular nations, and the things you describe aren&#x27;t common in secular nations in Europe.<p>And there was understanding that the establishment clause banned state support of public schools in the 19th century. McCollumn wasn&#x27;t a particular leftward shift, it was an enshrinement of longstanding practice.<p>&gt; Abortion is another example.<p>What changes would you expect to Abortion policy? I&#x27;d expect to see things continue roughly in line with Roe. Again, your contention was <i>changes</i>. I&#x27;m asking about changes.<p>&gt; mass amnesty<p>Polling suggests that between 80 and 90% of Americans support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the US. This number has been relatively consistent over the past 10 years. Search &quot;over a period of time&quot; on this page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;1660&#x2F;immigration.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;1660&#x2F;immigration.aspx</a> (there&#x27;s, admittedly, weird effects based on the specific question, but the gist is clear).<p>&gt; Also entrenchment of public unions<p>I&#x27;ve seen very limited (and only very particularly targeted) support of public unions from the left. Consider that police unions are not particularly loved at the moment.<p>&gt; Liberals deem “race blind” approaches like those taken in France to be “racist.”<p>Only contextually. I&#x27;d expect, for example, that a race blind application process in France would be less (or, at least, differently) racially biased than a race blind application process in the US.<p>&gt; Countries like Germany have moved slowly on areas like adoption by same-sex couples.<p>This seems to be a matter of it being perfectly legal (with some issues around surrogacy), but bias&#x2F;conservative sentiment among bureaucrats in charge of administering the process that leads to it being slow. Still bad, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to prevent a gay couple from adopting. And of course, France and the UK are already well ahead of us.<p>The crux of this line of argumentation (and your general lines of argumentation when we have similar discussions) seem to be that we should take Poland and Hungary, and other ex-soviet nations as examples of how the US should legislate. I don&#x27;t get that. Do you think there&#x27;s <i>anyone</i> in the US, Republican or Democrat, who thinks &quot;yes, our jurisprudence and social norms should be modeled on two ex-Soviet states one of which is so unstable that it had its constitution rewritten a decade ago, and the other had a constitutional crisis in 2015 and has been called a &quot;failed&quot; democracy as a result?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t understand why you keep pointing to those nations as <i>good</i> examples of anything. Like, when you describe things this way, my takeaway is &quot;the us would continue to be socially moderate among western european nations, and more liberal than eastern european ones&quot;. That&#x27;s, well, yes. And sure, there&#x27;s some particular cases where the US is exceptional: guns (I note you didn&#x27;t mention these), abortion, church taxes. But so what?')
