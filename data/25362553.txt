There are two &quot;models&quot; of reality, that explain the two viewpoints on this.<p>One, I&#x27;d call it the <i>libertarian model</i>, is that people are rational, more information is always good, videos only contain information, and that all information should be available to everybody.<p>The other, let&#x27;s call it the <i>fascist model</i>, is that people are not rational, people can easily be emotionally manipulated en-masse (e.g. Hitler), masses of emotionally manipulated people are a risk to democracy, and therefore any functional system requires punishing and suppressing misinformation.<p>People in the first came make a bunch of meaningless comments &quot;This is censorship and encroaching on my rights!&quot; and the second camp says &quot;Boy we&#x27;re lucky, and it&#x27;s crazy how much of the US didn&#x27;t understand Trump lost. Yikes.&quot; Neither comment convinces anybody.<p>The only way to move people over, would be to present evidence that the <i>libertarian model</i> is true, or the <i>fascist</i> model is true. Everything besides evidence is mere drum-beating.')
