Item(by='kjakm', descendants=None, kids=[25078297], score=None, time=1605218621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25074804, text='&gt; I think the problem is that people generally don’t know when they’ll return to a tab, so they leave it open, and that creating a bookmark is asking too much commitment for something potentially ephemeral.<p>Safari&#x27;s reading list is my solution to this. CMD+SHIFT+D adds the current tab to the reading list which is visible on a new tab page or in a side panel. Syncs across devices too. You just right click &gt; delete to remove the item from the list when done.')
