Things that are routinely done in many places around the world, like universal healthcare, free education, and schools without shootings, are routinely declared &quot;impossible&quot; in America. Whenever you suggest even the slightest societal behavioral change to fight some public problem, you have hundreds of thousands of people simply dismissing it because &quot;Americans won&#x27;t do it, or the law won&#x27;t allow it, or Wall Street doesn&#x27;t like it, therefore it&#x27;s completely impossible.&quot;<p>This is from a country that fought the British Empire, helped turn the tide in WW2, put a man on the moon, and made many scientific and technical achievements in the 20th century. But somehow, now, we can&#x27;t seem to accomplish anything.')
