A dead man&#x27;s switch that asks you every, I don&#x27;t know, three.to six months - via email even - &quot;you good for this repo still?&quot;. You answer with a click &quot;yup&quot; and that&#x27;s it - a signal on a repo on github or whatever that says &quot;still alive&quot;. Otherwise &quot;uh oh - we need help&quot; and then a mechanism there to immediately offer alternative forks with a good enough signal &quot;strength&quot;. It&#x27;s like a pinky promise instead of actual repo activity.')
