You haven&#x27;t sold me, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve sold other people reading this thread. I read your two cites as well. I have two small points in response.<p>First: I ran tech operations (as employee #2) at what became Chicago&#x27;s most popular independent ISP, in the mid-to-late 1990s, and had a similar &quot;front row seat&quot; to that sector. And I&#x27;ll say right now that the claim that &quot;deregulation killed the independent ISP&quot; does not at all ring true. Economies of scale is part of it, but so was consolidated billing, coax Internet, &quot;triple play&quot; packages, and wireless. Also, the market just consolidated; even among the indie ISPs, by the end of the 90s, everyone was doing roll-ups.<p>Further, while I loved my time in independent ISPs, I&#x27;m confident that as a consumer, I&#x27;m far better served by AT&amp;T than I was by <i>any</i> independent ISP I&#x27;ve used. My service is faster, more reliable, less expensive, and simpler than it was in the &#x27;90s in Chicago and San Francisco, or the early 2000s in Ann Arbor. Honestly: even Comcast did a better job than most of the indie ISPs I used.<p>Second, while the additional detail you&#x27;ve provided here is interesting, you really haven&#x27;t engaged Rayiner&#x27;s central argument, which is that however many billions of dollars you&#x27;re saying telcos were &quot;given&quot; to build fiber, you&#x27;re just counting dollars in their prices that you think are unreasonable. Which is not what people people on HN typically mean when they cite this &quot;200 billion dollar scandal&quot;.')
