Small companies cannot afford creative accounting which then finances an army of lawyers and grease for politicians. If  a small company pays e.g. 30% of tax it is unacceptable that big boys can wiggle out if it through offshore contraptions. If a company suddenly is in position to game the system and obtain unfair competitive advantage it is when it should be split. Every business should have equal chances and we let companies like Google, Facebook or Amazon abuse their position. It&#x27;s time to stop it. They need to be split and pay the right tax.')
