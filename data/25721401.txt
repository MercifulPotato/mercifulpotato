But to interpret &quot;Enter opens the current selection&quot; as anything other than <i>the current selection at the time the Enter key event was received</i> is definitely in the realm of rookie mistake if not worse.<p>If getting the current selection of a UI control somehow needs to be done asynchronously, then something is seriously wrong.<p>As a long-time Win32 programmer, the manifestations of these bugs are definitely hard to conceive.')
