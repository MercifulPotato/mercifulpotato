Item(by='JoshTriplett', descendants=None, kids=[25355906, 25355745], score=None, time=1607473559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25353168, text='&gt; With DoH, there are publicly accessible servers that accept requests over plain HTTPS<p>Which is a good thing <i>for end users</i> on balance.<p>The Internet is going 100% encrypted and that&#x27;s a good thing. This helps towards that goal. Relying on unencrypted traffic will no longer work. Networks must not have the ability to intercept device traffic unless the device administrator (<i>not</i> the network administrator) configures it as such; any such mechanism completely breaks the security properties this is trying to achieve. Ultimately, your choice with uncooperative devices is &quot;block the device or don&#x27;t&quot; (in addition to isolating it on a separate network), along with &quot;replace it with a cooperative device&quot;. Stop telling people they need to stop using encryption so that your local network interception will keep working, because your local network interception is indistinguishable from other people&#x27;s local network interception.<p>This feels like the geek version of DRM fallacies or the fallacies that governments believe about encryption. Somehow, there continue to be threads full of arguments that amount to &quot;It should be possible for &#x27;good&#x27; network admins to intercept traffic from devices that don&#x27;t trust them, but &#x27;bad&#x27; network admins shouldn&#x27;t be able to intercept traffic from devices that don&#x27;t trust them&quot;. That&#x27;s fundamentally not possible; any mechanism usable by &#x27;good&#x27; network admins can be used by &#x27;bad&#x27; network admins. (Leaving aside that &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; are relative.) And worse, people get so invested in their local network interception that once it becomes clear that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> possible, some will start arguing that their local network interception is more important than general Internet security.<p>There are enough <i>outside</i> opponents of Internet security; let&#x27;s not start holding back security <i>ourselves</i> because it makes our own hacks stop working. We have enough work to do fighting for the ability to keep the Internet secure against real adversaries. We absolutely need full control over our own devices, but many of the people most capable of fighting for that control got complacent about it because a subset of people could hack around it with local network interception stunts.')
