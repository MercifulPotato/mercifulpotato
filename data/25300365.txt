Paired with an i7-6600U CPU and 8GB of RAM, it got 10–13 hours of real battery life when it was new a few years ago—at the time, I think that was not far off being a record for <i>any</i> type of laptop.<p>I am never going back to 1920×1080. I’m sceptical even of 2560×1440 on a 13″ display. 15″, I’m certainly not going to accept anything meaningfully less than 4K.')
