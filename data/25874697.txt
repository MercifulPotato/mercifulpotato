Item(by='ccarterlandis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611341185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871480, text='When I made my comment above, I didn&#x27;t know Valinor was from LoTR, and I do see now why that would be kind of weird to some people. That part of comment was overly aggressive, and I should have done more research into the community and the name before I made my comment. My apologies for my tone, and for not doing my part to be informed.<p>However, personally, I still don&#x27;t think it makes sense as an argument, for a few reasons. For one, I doubt he came up with that name - hell, unless I missed something, I don&#x27;t even know if Scott actually likes LoTR. In most cases, the name of the housing community would not even be a consideration I would make when determining to live there, as the cost&#x2F;amenities&#x2F;location are far more important, so even if he is a LoTR fan, I highly doubt that the name was a factor in why he lives there. Maybe Scott&#x27;s priorities for housing differ, but I&#x27;ve not seen anything that would indicate that.<p>EDIT: Not sure how to do a strikethrough on HN, but I just found out &quot;Lorien&quot; is also from LoTR, so I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that Scott is a LoTR fan in some regard, and did probably have a hand in naming the housing community, and that my assumptions in the above paragraph are incorrect. I don&#x27;t want to delete them, for context, so I&#x27;ll just leave this edit here. However, I still don&#x27;t think that matters; what matters (to me) is his professional competence.<p>Second, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me where my psychiatrist lives. They&#x27;re a psychiatrist, not a real estate agent. I also don&#x27;t think my psychiatrist liking LoTR would a bad thing. All I care about is that they do their job well, and while I understand your concerns about it being a &quot;hipster&quot; housing community and the possibility of it signaling my psychiatrist&#x27;s values, extrapolating their professional performance from their housing choice seems like a bit of a stretch in this case.')
