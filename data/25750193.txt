The reason why it&#x27;s impossible for anyone, even the single greatest programmer on the planet, to not create bugs, is due to the high complexity of the software we write. It&#x27;s not so much that you&#x27;ll make a mistake when creating a new program. It&#x27;s that over time, as you make more and more changes, it&#x27;s impossible to actually trace out the exponential complexity that arises from your changes.<p>The purpose of unit tests is to catch these, and yes as you mention lower down even those aren&#x27;t 100% infallible but they greatly help. That&#x27;s why even with some of the greatest programmers and extensive testing, we still constantly see major bugs from every single top tech company. I don&#x27;t think there exists a single completely bug-free software of non-negligible size out there.')
