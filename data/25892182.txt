If it&#x27;s Audio CDs the problem is kinda solved in that you can make sure you extract a bit-perfect copy by verifying the checksum with the checksums of other people who extracted the same CD. Even though the Audio CD format tried to make it &quot;hard&quot; to rip in a bit-perfect way, it&#x27;s done precisely like that since years and years.<p>There&#x27;s a community of people ripping Audio CD to flac file and making sure all their rips are bit-perfect.<p>I&#x27;ve ripped my own collection and used, as far as I remember, &quot;whipper&quot; on Fedora Linux (for whatever reason I couldn&#x27;t make that software work on Debian back then).  After ripping a track&#x2F;CD the software would automatically verify the checksum with an online DB of rips.<p>You say you can&#x27;t use proprietary solution: as far as I know there are several free rippers on Linux and the online DB of checksum isn&#x27;t proprietary either (?).<p>In case you rip with an error, it&#x27;s near impossible that someone else who ripped the CD would have read exactly the same error and end up with the same checksum.<p>Now: for all the audio CDs I tried there was at least one other person who had already ripped it but it&#x27;s not always the case.  For example I&#x27;ve read about some collection of classical music CDs coming in pack of 300 CDs (!) and nobody had bothered, at home, to rip them &#x2F; to share the checksum.<p>But it can already help for all the &quot;common&quot; CDs you own.')
