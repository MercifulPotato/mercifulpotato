It&#x27;s a bad idea to give them notice before your cliff date for an end date after your cliff date.<p>Read your stock option plan agreement.  Typically, you have 90-days after parting ways to exercise your vested shares (some more progressive companies have increased this exercise window).  Read up on what your tax obligations will be before you exercise, and factor that in when deciding whether to exercise, and how much (it&#x27;s not a decision between exercising none or exercising all; exercising some is very valid).  Soon after you leave, and way before exercising, find out if there&#x27;s a private market for your stock options.  In your modeling to decide how much to exercise, make sure to consider the scenario where the options end up being worth zero (you will still be liable for tax this year even if you can deduct the loss later; your upfront expenses can be high).
