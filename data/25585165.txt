Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609357275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569856, text='&gt; I think youâ€™re confusing strong&#x2F;weak with static&#x2F;dynamic. The former happens at runtime, the latter at compile time.<p>Strong typing usually describes the combination of compile and runtime typing; Haskell code doesn&#x27;t have types after compilation, so there is no runtime enforcement of typing, but no one calls it weakly-typed, because the static typing prevents any of the conditions which would display weak typing behavior fromm happening.')
