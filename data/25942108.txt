We live in an age of widespread hedonism and much of the way people live is unhealthy on an individual and societal basis. I fully reject the &quot;be yourself, do what makes you happy&quot; mindset of today because the ideal day for a young person now is sleeping in, eating sugar for breakfast, smoking weed, playing video games and watching porn all day.  Most people don&#x27;t take it to that extreme, but too many people, in my opinion, go in that direction instead of the direction of moral productive work and rearing children that actually advances the human race and improves their life outside of momentary feelings of pleasure.')
