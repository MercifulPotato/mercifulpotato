I&#x27;m always amazed at the depth that these investigations go into.<p>Some other recommended episodes, in no particular order:<p>* The Gimli Glider<p>* Hudson River Runway - this one also got turned into a Hollywood movie, which I enjoyed, but I prefer the less-dramatized version presented by Mayday.<p>* Grand Canyon Disaster - mainly due to the age of this accident and the changes that stemmed from it.<p>* Nowhere to Land - the pilot of this flight has an incredible story.<p>* I&#x27;m the Problem - this wasn&#x27;t a technical problem, this was a human problem.<p>* Falling from the Sky<p>There are so many incredible episodes.  I don&#x27;t have cable anymore and this is one of the few things I miss.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mayday_(Canadian_TV_series)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mayday_(Canadian_TV_series)</a>')
