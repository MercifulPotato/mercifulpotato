Curiously I&#x27;m now working through Mehrling&#x27;s course, too.<p>Another one I&#x27;d recommend if you enjoyed those two, although in a very different vein is Bloom&#x27;s Moralities of Everyday Life, which is supposedly a psychology course, but really goes into comparative culture questions that IMO make it closer to an anthropology course. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;moralities" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;moralities</a>')
