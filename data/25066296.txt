And this is even more true if you are expecting a level of usability quality at parity with commercial OSes. My take is that you have to adjust your expectations and accept that you&#x27;ll spend a few hours doing tweaks to address the things that annoy you. Once done however, you&#x27;ll be left with a great operating system experience that you can just leave as-is.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve had a very positive experience with Linux Mint in conjunction with the MATE desktop. Most hardware-accelerated GUIs are slow on my old T500 which I use as a hobby machine, but MATE (being based on GNOME 2) runs well on the integrated graphics chip.<p>Barring that, Ubuntu is probably the most well-rounded for modern hardware. If you still encounter problems, try one of the LTS releases designed for stability.<p>One last comment, there will always be certain things in the Linux ecosystem that will never work the same way as other OSes (the XFCE &quot;panels&quot; bar comes to mind), and no amount of tweaking will leave you completely satisfied. Again, one learns to accept things and focus on the merits of Linux rather than it&#x27;s weaknesses :)')
