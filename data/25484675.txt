Screamed at, but mostly questioned\n(not giving leave to urinate is another detail that makes me think Orwell was writing cathartically about his public school days. See &quot;Such, Such Were The Joys&quot;.)<p>Part 3, Chapter 3: restrained. a &quot;dial&quot; of unclear action.\nscars of unknown origin (and we know that Smith already suffered from varicose lesions well before)<p>Part 3, Chapter 4: mention of dentures (but had he lost teeth from torture, or from his poor living conditions beforehand?)<p>Part 3, Chapter 5: failure to be tortured by rats<p>That&#x27;s a lot of alleged hours of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s time, which presumably would be spent (as O&#x27;Brien, unlike Smith, got excellent marks on his A levels, thereby getting into the Inner Party) doing something of value for Oceania, rather than enabling Smith&#x27;s narcissism. It&#x27;s obvious Smith doesn&#x27;t have any useful information to give up. How much of an example &quot;pour encourager les autres&quot; could Smith possibly be, considering the oh-so wide, expansive, nature of his circle of friends and acquaintances? The O&#x27;Brien of Part 3 is also cardboard, and reminds me of nothing so much as Johnny Hale from &quot;Such, Such Were The Joys&quot;.<p>Consider also:<p>No sensory deprivation, no waterboarding. Nothing that approaches even Korean-War-era physiological-limit techniques.')
