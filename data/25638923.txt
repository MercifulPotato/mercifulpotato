In my experience, a lot of problems can be solved with sheer brute force, or by merely using the language built-in data structures and memoization tricks.<p>I think algorithms per se don&#x27;t necessarily give you much of an advantage. For example, LIS[0] is fairly frequently-run algorithm if you work with web stuff, but nearly no one in that specialization knows how to write it from memory (and knowing about it doesn&#x27;t translate to being able to write other algorithms)<p>Where I think leetcode helps is in giving you an opportunity to practice the skill of putting together various building blocks in a semi-realistic fashion (e.g. having to use a memoization trick to get under the run time threshold is something that is similar to real life performance work, despite the exercise itself being completely unrealistic).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Longest_increasing_subsequence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Longest_increasing_subsequence</a>')
