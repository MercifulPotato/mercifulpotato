When it gets down to -25 here (thankfully not all that often in Southern Alberta) I just don&#x27;t spend much time outside... although -25C still isn&#x27;t cold enough to necessitate plugging in the truck. It gets truly, bitterly cold in places like Saskatoon, Edmonton or Winnipeg... -40 is not altogether uncommon.<p>My house of made of Insulated Concrete Forms and has an amazing r value. A hot fire in the wood stove can quickly heat the whole place up to 22C, even when it&#x27;s -20 outside.<p>It can snow 50cm over a 12hr period, though, and that&#x27;s always fun to deal with. I&#x27;ve gotten badly stuck in my own driveway twice this year (it&#x27;s 40 feet long &amp; annoying to clear), and both times the snowblower conked out and I had to take the thing apart and fix it before I was able to go into town to get groceries. Clearing the driveway with a shovel is simply not possible unless you plan to spend an entire day doing it.<p>Anyhoo, all this to say is - dealing with that kind of weather requires some preparation, and I can see how it would cause mayhem in a place where that&#x27;s unusual. Hopefully when air travel becomes abundant again I can travel to Spain to enjoy its warmth :-P')
