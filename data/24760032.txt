I do my side projects for personal development and enjoyment. It&#x27;s my opportunity to grow in whatever direction I like, and I&#x27;m not going to let my job dictate what kind of side projects I&#x27;m taking on.<p>If that results in skills useful at work, or for finding work, that&#x27;s a nice but entirely secondary benefit. The more important benefit is burnout prevention - because I too &quot;don&#x27;t get paid to do the interesting things that first attracted&quot; me to software, or science and technology in general.<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m just boggled at how many people appear to find it unimaginable and unrelatable that a technologist likes technology enough to mess with it for fun, even after work.</i><p>Me too. I sometimes wonder if I&#x27;m not missing out, but try as I might, I don&#x27;t enjoy the &quot;normal&quot; stuff as much as I enjoy intellectual stimulation. I also sometimes wonder if this isn&#x27;t because my eyes just don&#x27;t get tired from screens. I can look at computer screens 16 hours straight, and my eyes don&#x27;t get dry or itchy. I had co-workers who had to use saline drops at work, and I can understand if they didn&#x27;t want to look at any screen when they got home.')
