You cannot use the same flow in English to construct natural-sounding Japanese sentence, and vice versa. The amount of supplement information alone is different.<p>A quick example is that my mother tongue doesn&#x27;t have tense, and I still misuse tense all the time in English when I am careless simply because I am not used to incorporating time information during sentence creation when the time information is not an important information.<p>It does not necessarily change your cognition or world view, but it does change what information you are actively looking for&#x2F;collecting.')
