Im not much of a writer but would love to improve on my writing skills.  I personally have the most problem with 3 and the only way I could get more productive brain dumps is to record myself talking freely instead, then rewrite it. But this is a time consuming process and was wondering what kind of exercises&#x2F;drills I could use to ease the brain dump constipation. To me there&#x27;s something that blocks me when I attempt to write something down freely but I feel that that the right exercises would ease it. I feel like Im making a wrong step somewhere that makes me become self conscious at the wrong moment.')
