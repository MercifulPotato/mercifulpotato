I guess it is nice that it is held up to a separate higher standard and captivates the minds of some people willing to help it get there.<p>Some people here mentioned a standard about merchant adoption, even to that, so what? thats the least interesting use case, the M0 money supply is small in exchange systems people choose to respect, its panned out the same way in crypto but people decide to make a separate standard of &quot;hey a lot of this is used for speculation! I don&#x27;t consider that a use case, is it because I&#x27;m ignorant of how fiat currencies work, no, can&#x27;t be&quot;.<p>There are various services for merchants that shield the merchant from knowing crypto is being used, and various services for consumers (like debit cards) that shield them from needing to directly use crypto. That exists, not a lot of fanfare is needed, if you want to use that you can and don&#x27;t need to write a whole blog post about it. Its not an <i>interesting</i> use case, no matter how much you felt you needed to quantify its use in that way in order to feel better about it.<p>It also works, <i>shrug</i>, onchain (+tx eventually settled onchain) transaction volume is at all time highs and it doesn&#x27;t even make international news because its not news, as it should be.')
