But thanks for letting ne know.<p>Just in case something changes. I already have a B1 visa, which I needed when I worked in Big Pharma where I built a laboratory workflow&#x2F;ELN product 100% based on open source tech (except for the oracle drivers) initially for oncology therapeutic area and later on all other therapeutic areas including animal health.<p>Experiment throughput was increased by integrating devices like barcode scanners and orinters, rfid scanners, balances, HPLC&#x27;s, ...<p>And numbers of animals was reduced by using RFID chips to avoid mixing them up between exoeriments and animal groups, and also combining multiple experiments into one animal.<p>And it wqs super compliant. We generated even on the fly reports when the government guy checking animal welfare laws was dropping by unanounced. Before my software someone had to distract the guy, walk with him through labs, and invite him to lunch while staff was hastly aggregating data from excel sheets. With our software, the guy could consider himself lucky if he had time to drink a coffee LOL')
