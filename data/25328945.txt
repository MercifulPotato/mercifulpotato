Granted, it&#x27;s not Mozart, but then, if music were easy, someone would have solved it and put the whole industry out of business. But the examples you posted - which, granted, were apparently the cream of the crop - sound decent enough. I think this voxel fellow is going to hard on you. If you filtered it to only capture the decent stuff, it would be fine to have in the background while the player was focused on the game. Though I suppose whatever you get someone to compose for you will sound that much better.<p>On that basis, I would definitely grant the implied generalization of the title: if the audio samples in this post aren&#x27;t good enough for you, then procedurally generated music won&#x27;t cut it. On the other hand, if you want procedurally generated music, and you could see yourself living with the music from this post, it would definitely be workable.')
