So my mind wanders. I need nudges to get back on track. Like a reverse pomodomo. I used to have a remarkable internal clock (always know time of day, track elapsed time, without looking at watch). Well, no more.<p>Example 1: An inactivity timer. Like the builtin reminder to standup and stretch. Once or twice a day, I just have to sit down. I&#x27;ll pop some pain pills then veg until they kick in (30-45 min). I never remember to set a timer, alarm. I want my phone to notice I&#x27;ve been vegging for an hour and remind me to start moving.<p>Example 2: Time to stop. I&#x27;ll start doing a mindless task, usually physical. Like weeding or picking up litter. It&#x27;s super gratifying. But then I&#x27;ll overdo it. I want my phone to notice I&#x27;ve been stuck on the same task for too long.')
