Item(by='freetime2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606324801, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209001, text='This article seems to imply that the wealthy don&#x27;t have any stake in the culture war, and stand to benefit most by maintaining the status quo. But that seems to ignore the fact that two of the issues at the heart of the culture war are taxation and government regulations - and one side&#x27;s stance on these issues is far more beneficial to the wealthy than the other&#x27;s.<p>One of the few major pieces of legislation that Republicans actually passed while in power over the past four years were tax reforms which were very beneficial to the wealthy. And the Trump administration changed several of the EPA&#x27;s environmental policies to be more business friendly (and less friendly to the environment).<p>Democrats, on the other hand, are in broadly favor of increasing taxes on the wealthy. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in particular had some policy proposals that would have taxed the wealthy quite significantly. Democrats in recent history also passed the Dodd-Frank act, which imposed a number of regulations on the finance industry (and was partially repealed by Republicans in 2018).<p>These issues are front and center in the culture war. Remember Joe the Plumber and &quot;Drill baby, drill&quot; in 2008? Or Trump&#x27;s vows to save the coal industry in 2016? And how many times did Pence bring up the subject of fracking in the 2020 vice presidential debate?')
