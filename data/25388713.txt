Item(by='chimen', descendants=None, kids=[25388765, 25388754, 25388783], score=None, time=1607710192, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388535, text='Mid range studio quality with active noise cancelation, great build quality, good BL codecs (aptx HD+ || LDAC)? Name that pair please. Those 8y Bose QCs are not even close to being a mid-range studio quality and are worst than a sony xm2 or xm3 in terms of ANC, built entirely of plastic also.<p>You people are so quick to bash on this company for no reason.<p>The only headset that I consider on par with this one is the recently released (at 800 euro) bang and Olufsen n95. The price is not always the sum of parts.')
