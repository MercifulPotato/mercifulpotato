With themselves? They compete with Windows (and to a degree Linux, though few care for that), and with Android. They&#x27;d compete with Windows Phone too if MS wasn&#x27;t incompetent.<p>But they didn&#x27;t do anything to preclude others from making their OS&#x2F;hardware and selling it to customers. In fact, they have nowhere near a monopoly in either the desktop (10% or less) or the mobile space (40% or less).<p>Whereas MS for example, had 98% of the desktop (home and enterprise), and abused its power to threaten OEMs to do its bidding against Linux etc.')
