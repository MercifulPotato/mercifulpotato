(The exception might be that one could generally test out of up to a year of calculus since some people don&#x27;t consider calculus a freshman course - e.g., business majors, etc.)  It was a cheaper option at some universities than the AP exams were for students that had taken AP courses, although AP courses were not required to test out of a course.  The testing out option enabled high school students that had taken advanced courses to start university more in-line with their backgrounds rather than having to repeat courses for no reason.<p>--------------<p>Edit: that was decades ago - don&#x27;t forgo an AP exam thinking you can test out unless you already have admission and have verified the availability and costs of testing out of a course.')
