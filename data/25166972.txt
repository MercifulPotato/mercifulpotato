(this was not an optimized setup, I was such a noob at the time, just trying to wrangle our developer tools)<p>The only reason I moved to docker years ago was I wanted a tighter reproducible workflow (ie docker-compose up) for all other developers, turns out vagrant has (at some point in the last 5 years) solved this problem too, with packer (I didn&#x27;t know about this 5 years ago for whatever reason)<p>Makes me long for going back to that. At least once you built your base image, it was <i>done</i> and you could just make fast linked images from there. I bet with Alpine you could get a vagrant up in a few minutes tops, then it boots in seconds.<p>Never liked Ruby as a config language, but doing complex things like setting up shared networks and folders was a breeze comparatively I felt.<p>Never used vagrant in a production capacity though. Everywhere I ever worked always deployed to bare metal or essentially we bought our services (cloud functions, semi-managed containers etc)')
