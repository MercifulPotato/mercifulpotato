I imagine you got here from some path other than Twitter. Therefore, you reading this reply to your comment comes irrespective to Twitter deciding what is allowable on their platform.<p>If the moderators of this site decide my comment is out of line with the standards this site tries to uphold, does this make me unable to communicate entirely? No, I&#x27;m still able to write whatever nonesense on plenty of other websites. Or I can host my own website where I can freely post whatever nonsense I choose to post. All the way up to the point where no ISP will offer me an internet connection or all the regional number organizations refuse to give me even a single IP address.')
