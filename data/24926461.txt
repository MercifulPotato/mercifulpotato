It might be when the team decides to rewrite it it might be immediately after initial development push or at a different time. The same thing happens with your car. One day you just stop commitment to keeping it alive and it becomes &quot;legacy&quot; car. One that will start failing and one you will now be looking to replace.<p>When people stop seriously updating the codebase they might be thinking &quot;maybe all that effort is not really necessary, we just need to keep it alive for couple more years&quot;. Yep, we are now officially in legacy territory.<p>Legacy has a bunch of symptoms. Technical debt start accumulating with no real commitment to ever be paid. The team typically looses knowledge of the app when original developers leave, causing &quot;better not touch unless absolutely necessary because I have no idea what I am going to break&quot; syndrome. Management might be thinking the same way and restrict funding or just simply stop caring enough, further exacerbating the problem.<p>Anyway, nothing to do with tests. Lack of tests might be one of syndrome (why write test if I don&#x27;t care and nobody will use it anyway?) But there are legacy apps with good test coverage (typically another can of worms) and there also projects in rather good shape without tests (ever heard of Linux kernel?)')
