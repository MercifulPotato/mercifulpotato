Item(by='deanmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=[24753196], score=None, time=1602451636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746469, text='My portfolio is split 50-50: I have $2M in common Vanguard index funds (VTI&#x2F;VXUS&#x2F;BND), and $2M in private illiquid equity from a startup I worked for in the past, via options I exercised.<p>Every now and then someone contacts me interested in buying some shares of that company, which I promptly sell and immediately buy index funds with the proceeds. I liquidated about $1M of those shares already, I wish I could sell the rest, it is so “painful” having so much of your net worth locked up into an incredibly illiquid, risky and unpredictable asset.<p>I don’t invest in nor own anything else (except a few months of living expenses in a savings account): I’m a happy renter and don’t own a car.')
