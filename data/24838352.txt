Facebook&#x27;s shameless support of the Trump admin may likewise be viewed as one of many of Zuck&#x27;s poorly thought out moves.  Unlike Obama, who credited Facebook&#x2F;Google with his 2008 victory, and opened a revolving door between Google&#x2F;White House, the appearance of that would be absolutely toxic in the present climate.')
