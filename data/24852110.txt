I don&#x27;t know if the morning flights are sold out, or are currently not running, but they presumably exist.  The train is £77 off peak (which matches the flight arrival time), or £166 peak (assuming there are sold-out morning flights).  Even this late the day before, it&#x27;s still possible to book onto a particular train, which is about £60-70.<p>Train times and ticket costs for tomorrow: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traintimes.org.uk&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;london&#x2F;06:30&#x2F;tomorrow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traintimes.org.uk&#x2F;edinburgh&#x2F;london&#x2F;06:30&#x2F;tomorrow</a>')
