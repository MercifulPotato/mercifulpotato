That laptop was verified by no one. The media wasn&#x27;t even allowed to access it.<p>Yet the story was able to spread like wildfire through the US.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it was authentic or the origins of it, and no credible media source was able to verify it. Frankly, the story of where it came from was absurd.<p>So did that story help bad actors or good actors? I would say bad actors because the people pushing the story seem to be playing fast and loose with verifiable facts and truth.<p>This is tearing the US apart by the seams. We are now in a situation where the president is openly attempting a coup on the popular vote, and using massive amounts of unverified information that is mostly false to push his agenda of destroying democracy.')
