Other than in this one phrase completely ignores that poor white people are also affected.<p>When it does this, the New York Times creates a separation in the narrative between White people and people of color <i>who are facing the same problems</i>.<p>This is a divisive. racist narrative, and is a reflection of institutional and systemic racism being perpetuated by the New York Times.<p>I am not white.  Racism is widespread  in America.  Black people are disadvantaged by racism in ways that are historical <i>and</i> present and are different from people who are not black.<p>But none of that excuses the New York Times when it divides people by race in pieces like this.<p>Sophisticated racism like this is worse than crude racism, because fewer people see it for what it is.<p>You don’t get to be anti-racist by painting racist pictures.<p>Racism can only be defeated by <i>both</i> being honest about what people have in common <i>and</i> being able to face the historical inequities which persist into the present.')
