Nothing to confess. Before the HTML5 set of standards (circle 2008), there were certain things you just couldn&#x27;t do in the browser with JavaScript. That&#x27;s why there was space for plugins like Applets, Flash, ActiveX, RealPlayer, etc. I did quite a bit of Flash&#x2F;AS3 development back in the day.
