Item(by='kaycebasques', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608778390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524234, text='Tooling Report [1] also goes into detail about which build tools provide the most bang for your buck, in terms of features for optimizing your website code.<p>So, to circle back to your comment:<p>&gt; I wonder what the appeal of having the build tools written in JS is, as performance is key here.<p>Yes, performance is key. But we&#x27;re presumably talking about two types of performance: performance of the build tool itself, and performance optimization of the website (enabled by the build tool). That could be a key tradeoff. Theoretically there&#x27;s probably no reason why a feature-rich build tool for the web could not be written in something other than JS, but realistically does it exist right now? (I don&#x27;t know much about this space so it&#x27;s a genuine question.)<p>Also, it seems natural to me that, if you&#x27;re writing a tool for web developers, you&#x27;re more likely to be able to build a community around that tool if you write it in a language that web developers are familiar with. Since web developers have the most skin in the game to make that tool great. That&#x27;s probably a trite&#x2F;obvious argument, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning nonetheless.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bundlers.tooling.report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bundlers.tooling.report&#x2F;</a><p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m on the same team as the Tooling Report people.<p>P.S. if any of the esbuild people are here, I believe Tooling Report is open to getting other build tools on the site (you would have to write all the tests). I could be wrong but it&#x27;s worth reaching out to them.')
