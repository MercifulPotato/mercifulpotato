I missed that.<p>Before HSTS &amp; key pinning was a thing, most people who visited gmail still browsed to gmail via http which redirected to https. Because the original query wasn&#x27;t secure, someone at defcon did a silent MITM of gmail by catching the insecure http requests and not redirecting them to https. Then they caught people&#x27;s credentials that way and proxied the real gmail, with all the images flipped all the images upside down so people knew something was up.<p>Its interesting to think about web redirects as a kind of chain of trust. The earlier insecure request destroyed the security of the secure context established later.')
