It was great, but lately has been unbearably slow and frustrating to the point where we&#x27;d stop watching TV in the living room all together.  Not a great experience.<p>To try to remedy the issue (knowing it was slowed down by the disgusting ad platform), I installed a Pi Hole in the house to see if that would alleviate the problem.  The TV felt a bit less clunky but Pi Hole seemed to have some issues with some of the installed apps - primarily Hulu, so I needed another solution.  The Pi Hole statistics were terrifying at around 12,000 blocked Samsung requests per day (around 6-7 hours of shared TV usage).<p>I researched Amazon FireSticks, Roku&#x27;s, etc.  I needed something easy for my family and kids to use (they are not as techy) and I wanted an interface that was buttery smooth.  While I am very much not an Apple fan, last night I picked up the 4K Apple TV to test and so far it seems to be decent.  There are some things I would change with the platform for sure, but it is overall pretty intuitive so my family can just pick up the remote and go.<p>I factory reset my Samsung TV and completely removed the network from it.  It was sad to see how responsive the TV was again after the reset.  You can be sure I will not be buying another Samsung TV!')
