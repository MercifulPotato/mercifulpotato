For example:<p><pre><code>  seqA = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\n  seqB = [2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20]\n</code></pre>\nYou could argue that seqA is simpler because it follows a regular pattern: the range of ints from 0 to 20, inclusive. Or you could argue that seqB is simpler because it contains fewer numbers.<p>Go seems like seqB to me. It is simple in that it provides a limited set of features, but to me it ends up feeling fractured.')
