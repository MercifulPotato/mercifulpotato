It&#x27;s not necessarily extremely sophisticated, but having a &#x27;quantitative view&#x27; of your code can help a lot.<p>I remember many many years ago developing a sudden interest in algorithmic complexity (and what quadratic meant..) after having used a bubble sort to sort  polygons in my 3d engine. Needless to say,  log  became a fairly interesting function after reading a bit more on sorting!')
