To see why, just look at Haskell and Lisp.<p>When a Lisp user looks at Haskell, they are sure they&#x27;re looking down, because Haskell doesn&#x27;t have macros.  But when a Haskell type (pun intended) looks at Lisp, they are <i>also</i> sure that they&#x27;re looking down, because Lisp doesn&#x27;t have a decent (Hindley-Milner) type system.<p>This situation - two languages, each sure that they&#x27;re above the other - shows the problem.  <i>You cannot rank languages on a one-dimensional axis called power.</i><p>Another way of getting there is to ask:  Power?  Power for what?  For writing programs.  What kind of programs?  General programs?  I&#x27;ve never written a general program in my life.  I&#x27;ve written a bunch of specific ones, though.  What I care about is power to write <i>this</i> program - the one I&#x27;m currently trying to write.  (Why do I care about a language&#x27;s power to write a program that I&#x27;m <i>not</i> trying to write?)<p>Instead, think in terms of yak shaving.  What are the yak shaving aspects of the program I&#x27;m trying to write?  Think of that as a vector in a multi-dimensional space.  Think of languages as branches on a tree.  Which branch extends farthest in the direction of the yak-shaving vector?  Use that language.<p>But you have to have kind of an expanded idea of what &quot;yak shaving&quot; means.  In particular, if you pick a &quot;non standard&quot; language, training your team becomes part of the yak shaving.')
