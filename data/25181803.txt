I don&#x27;t know, due to lack of experience, but I assume this is beneficial to one&#x27;s career. Presumably benefiting careers is why they&#x27;re doing it.<p>And yet, it feels like sexism to me. Women get an explicit benefit that men don&#x27;t. Women are also explicitly privileged in the hiring process and higher ups are rewarded based on the number of women they employ, hire, and promote. This isn&#x27;t a conspiracy theory but an explicitly articulated and documented process. Even before that, in college, we had events for women who code, women in STEM, career opportunities for women, etc.<p>I get that these things are all because women are underrepresented in tech and surely there are challenges for women and sexism against women. However, the examples above still feel like sexism to me. I am not all men, so the fact that men have better representation in upper levels is meaningless to me as an individual. The fact that my female peers have a monthly meeting with higher-ups to discuss how they get promoted and I don&#x27;t get that isn&#x27;t as meaningless.<p>On top of all that, I also know that if I were to ever suggest this was sexism or wrong in any way using my real name or at work, I&#x27;d fully expect to be fired and reviled by my coworkers as a deplorable sexist.<p>My point in writing all this is just to say that I would much prefer my company stay dispassionate and neutral and try to treat everyone fairly. I don&#x27;t really support the company taking up political, social, or ideological agendas and using them to make decisions about what happens at work.')
