This then can result in using way too much force.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that this is true at all, but it still points to major systemic flaws in how police are managed throughout the country.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t permit or accept a first-year medical student to perform open heart surgery, nor a first-time flight student to pilot a commercial plane full of people, but throughout the country, we&#x27;re seeing brutal violence being carried out by people who lack the training, and in many cases, the emotional intelligence to do a job that very clearly requires it.<p>Such failure warrants massive overhauls to the system, regardless of whether it&#x27;s a training issue or something more sinister. &quot;Lack of training&quot; is, frankly, a really piss-poor excuse when you&#x27;re seeing videos like George Floyd. How much training do you need to know not to kneel on someone&#x27;s neck for almost 9 minutes?<p>The culture and management of policing is far too opaque and if the lack of training is the number one issue, the various systems of police training programs need to be brought to light and people need to be fired across the board.')
