In my lab, where everyone is a researcher or research student and most people have tech skill and are building software, it&#x27;s clear everyone has a &quot;thing&quot;. One person was good at analyzing data and produce top-notch visualizations, few guys are good in ML, one person at was in her best game when designing experiment, one is the blockchain guy, some are very good technically, we are two good (or willing to) write documentation for newcomers, etc. Of course, all those people have a broad variety of skills, yet everyone have a special thing, and a smart strategy is to collaborate with them when you need the best on a particular point.')
