So it is a huge hit and miss. Sometimes it works, because I guess I just happen to value the same things that the majority of people do, other times, I might watch an hour long very in-depth video about a topic, then YouTube for a week or so tries to get me to watch 5 minute, rather shallow introduction videos that are way more popular. There is nothing wrong with those videos per se, they are often really well made, but it is not what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Other times it picks stuff up from the long tail that seemingly gets into a feedback loop, suddenly reaching millions of view, with practically zero relevance to me.<p>Then there are some personal tastes of mine, e.g. that I can&#x27;t stand the, I guess I&#x27;d call it the &quot;Youtube Voice&quot; where creators go completely over the top instead of talking like a normal person.<p>I wonder what metric could be used as a proxy to get better recommendations? Or if a better approach would be, to just build a better custom search so I can tweak it to what I&#x27;m looking for at this moment in time.')
