The general consensus seems to be that any system that doesn&#x27;t have automatic updates running is de-facto insecure (which, since every update mechanism I&#x27;ve heard of can introduce new code (ie new security vulnerabilities), means any system whatsoever is insecure).<p>(I don&#x27;t quite disagree with the tacit assertion that actually getting things right on - if not the first try - then at least one of the first thirty or so is a extremely, maybe even unreasonably high standard, but it manifestly <i>is</i> a standard that basically all existing nontrivial software projects fail to meet.)')
