A road that handles heavy traffic generally has a lot of commercial activity to support it. A cul-de-sac that has 6-10 homes, means only 6-10 tax payers. And it&#x27;s not just roads, it&#x27;s pipes, copper&#x2F;fiber, EMS, etc. Even if the maintenance cycle is 2x longer, the tax base isn&#x27;t there to pay it.')
