We are currently working on reducing the price to make it more affordable for everyone.  As for the risk, we do care for our driver and would not put them on any risk.<p>I&#x27;m very sorry about your feeling on middleman. As for our drivers, they have the ability to make significant amount of money from one library pickup. For example, if there are 20 orders to be picked from one library this can generate significant amount of pay in one library stop.<p>Local libraries around the US don&#x27;t have the budget or capacity to start delivery service for the entire county. Our tax money doesn&#x27;t stretch that far when it comes to library services. However, there are libraries that do have delivery service, but its only for patrons with permanent disability or other limitation.')
