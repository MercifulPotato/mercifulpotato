Vaccines effective in animal models of SARS were developed based on this approach starting around 2004:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;101&#x2F;17&#x2F;6641" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;101&#x2F;17&#x2F;6641</a><p>The article continues:<p>&gt; The win-win here, however, is that the more we develop a universal vaccine platform, the more we can have the best of both worlds – fast plus safe and effective. But this also means we need public buy in, which requires reassuring the public about the process and the strategy. It also means reassuring the public that the process has not been politicized, and that objective experts are driving (something the TA did poorly).<p>The MRNA approach requires an understanding of viral vulnerabilities and a lot of animal studies prior to the synthesis of a vaccine candidate. Again, that seemingly fruitless work with SARS more than a decade ago was the key to the success of Moderna and Pfizer today.<p>It&#x27;s a lesson that should not be forgotten but probably will.<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that the Pfizer and Moderna approvals represent the first ever large-scale use of MRNA vaccines in humans. That substantially lowers the barrier to entry of new vaccines based on the same platform.')
