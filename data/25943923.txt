I don&#x27;t know if it is productive to make this about free speech. The purpose of life isn&#x27;t just to emit speech, and indeed the purpose of WSB is for people to exhort other people to action and that action is to buy and sell certain stocks, so that a subset of participants can profit and other people lose their capital. &quot;Speech&quot; is not the central issue or the most interesting one to me about this case, it is rather more interesting to see how mobs can be formed and influenced to take action.')
