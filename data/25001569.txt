I was a fan of Javascript and Python a couple of years ago, and I strongly (and still do) hated Java for its verbosity. I really have to admit that, especially with large teams, a strongly typed language is definitely the way to go.<p>I don&#x27;t feel confident when I program in Python, nor in Javascript exactly for the lack of proper typing. One could argue that if you know exactly what you are doing, types can even be ignored, which is kind of true - but they&#x27;re there to help the developer and his team. I don&#x27;t see any good reason to use Python over Golang, for example, if we only consider the language itself and the confidence that you get from using a statically typed language.')
