That said...<p>&gt; Its just LPDDR4. HBM is a different thing.<p>Hmm, Apple refers to it as High Bandwidth Memory. The Register[1] refers to it as &quot;High Bandwidth Memory&quot; and also:<p>&quot;This uses 4266 MT&#x2F;s LPDDR4X SDRAM (synchronous DRAM) and is mounted with the SoC using a system-in-package (SiP) design.&quot;<p>Which implies to me that some kinds of LPDDR is indeed HBM and that what&#x27;s on the M1 isn&#x27;t something which can be replaced by drop in RAM.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not the advantage.<p>Hmm, again quoting The Reg here because I think it&#x27;s a fairly independent source on Apple hardware.<p>&quot;In other words, this memory is shared between the three different compute engines and their cores. The three don&#x27;t have their own individual memory resources, which would need data moved into them.&quot;<p>Maybe I didn&#x27;t express this clearly enough above.<p>&gt; AMD &#x2F; Intel have been connecting L3 caches to their iGPU solutions for over a decade now.<p>My point above wasn&#x27;t that Apple invented this idea. It was that the idea <i>doesn&#x27;t scale well</i>. Who invented it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;apple_m1_high_bandwidth_memory_performance&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;apple_m1_high_bandwid...</a>')
