It&#x27;s still useful to determine a theoretical &quot;worst case&quot; that could occur due to usage of promises here. Further test cases are performed that explore more &quot;realistic&quot; cases. The point of a microbenchmark is to condense what is being tested into a small block of code, which is done here. Through this test, it&#x27;s possible to determine purely the overhead of the promise on the function, as there&#x27;s no modified blocking behaviour of IO calls, etc.<p>The point isn&#x27;t about promises being used to perform calculations, it&#x27;s about functions that are marked as async because a child function is marked as async.')
