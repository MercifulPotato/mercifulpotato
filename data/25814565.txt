I like the part of the HN guidelines that refers to something in particular being &quot;a semi-noob illusion&quot;.  The fragility of the web is like that: a semi-noob illusion that people come away with because they don&#x27;t understand the layers underneath, or who&#x27;s responsible.  The web has robustness and forward compatibility baked in.  TC-39 in particular, which is responsible for defining &quot;JS&quot;, even operates with the unofficial motto &quot;don&#x27;t break the Web&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m also fond of this comment from Roy Fielding:<p>&gt; As architectural styles go, REST is very simple.Â¶ REST is software design on the scale of decades: every detail is intended to promote software longevity and independent evolution. Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency. Unfortunately, people are fairly good at short-term design, and usually awful at long-term design. Most don&#x27;t think they need to design past the current release.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roy.gbiv.com&#x2F;untangled&#x2F;2008&#x2F;rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roy.gbiv.com&#x2F;untangled&#x2F;2008&#x2F;rest-apis-must-be-hypert...</a>')
