Taking the time to make your entire environment just perfect, with good music and some whisky is part of the enjoyment for a slow relaxing evening.<p>But i guess it&#x27;s just me there could be a market for instant immersion. I have second dev version of oculus at home, never used it much. I also went to a VR venue in London and it was great fun. From my perspective VR would work great in venues, as a night out alongside bowling, karake and similar options. I can&#x27;t imagine using it reguralrly at home.')
