Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606582059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237618, text='&gt; The surgical mask with a beard is kind of like walking around with my hand held a half inch away from my face.<p>Yeah, but that&#x27;d still be better than nothing, too. (As would be a face-shield worn without a mask.) In both cases, the main goal of getting regular people to wear masks isn&#x27;t to <i>contain</i> exhaled droplets, but to lower the <i>forward velocity</i> of exhaled droplets, so they don&#x27;t slam right into other people&#x27;s mucous membranes, but rather have time to get caught in HVAC systems or dispersed into outdoor air.<p>The faster the droplets are moving when they exit your mouth&#x2F;nose (e.g. a sneeze or a cough), the <i>less</i> they&#x27;re going to be able to &quot;turn&quot; to get out the sides of your mask. Masks are <i>very good</i> at stopping sneezes&#x2F;coughs from contaminating the air, even when badly fit.<p>That, and masks&#x2F;face-shields&#x2F;your own hand&#x2F;etc. also protect you when someone sneezes or coughs directly &quot;at&quot; your face. Like the sneeze-guard at a buffet. It&#x27;s not complete protection — the particles, once airborne, can drift &quot;around&quot; the barrier and come in — but it <i>does</i> appreciably lower contamination compared to having nothing there (presuming that people <i>will</i> be sneezing&#x2F;coughing&#x2F;breathing directly &quot;at&quot; your face&#x2F;the buffet. Not a concern for most people; but this is why people in hospitality are wearing the face-shields.)<p>&gt; All the air is going in and out that half inch.<p>Out, almost certainly (except for forceful expulsions, as above), but if you&#x27;re breathing through your nose — and the mask is shaped to surround your nose — then even if it&#x27;s a half-inch from your nose, at least some of your <i>inhaled</i> air will be coming in through the mask. Even if it <i>feels</i> like all of it&#x27;s coming in through the gap in the mask. So there <i>will</i> be some fractional protection from that.<p>Also, I believe high-grade masks are somewhat <i>adsorbant</i> — airborne droplets just like <i>sticking</i> to them if they rub up against them, rather than staying airborne. So a good mask can &quot;passively&quot; scrub the air you&#x27;re breathing in, even if that air is coming in &quot;around&quot; the mask instead of &quot;through&quot; it! (This is only a <i>small</i> effect, though, and shouldn&#x27;t be relied on. I&#x27;m trying to list the reasons mask-wearing is better than nothing, not trying to justify intentionally wearing your mask less-well-fitted than you could.)')
