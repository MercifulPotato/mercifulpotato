Yes, what you say is true - that isn&#x27;t the point of an academic degree.<p>But no, because the way students (and parents) think about it is &quot;go to college so you can get a good job&quot;.  And many, many employers require a degree or they won&#x27;t look at the candidate.  In the real world, academia is functioning as a job training program.<p>Or at least as a gateway to the good jobs.  But if it&#x27;s going to be a gateway, but not do any training... that&#x27;s pretty inefficient.')
