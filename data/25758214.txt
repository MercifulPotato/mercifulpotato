It infected a smaller percentage of the world population than Covid is likely to, despite much less significant public health countermeasures, and a tremendous increase in medical knowledge in the past half century. It was likely significantly less contagious.<p>Death estimates in the USA are in the 100k range, vs. Covid which has already killed more than 400k (if we count using a similar estimation method) and will likely kill at least 200k more before it is through. (US population has more than doubled in the mean time, but we are talking about at least 5â€“8x as many deaths.) The difference in hospitalization rate is dramatic.<p>If you want a summary or some numbers about the current pandemic, try <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COVID-19_pandemic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COVID-19_pandemic</a><p>It is really tragic that the abject failures of the US federal response have made partisans so heavily invest themselves in the claim that Covid is no big deal and we shouldn&#x27;t worry about it.')
