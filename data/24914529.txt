I don&#x27;t understand it.<p>Well, on products at least, I have a theory: there used to be &quot;Google Labs&quot;, an interesting selection of experimental projects that you knew were experimental and perhaps not permanent.<p>Then they killed off Labs, and it&#x27;s like everything that would previously been housed there is now released as if it&#x27;s a fully fledge and supported service, only Google knows it&#x27;s really just a &quot;Lab&quot; experiment.<p>As a result, when those things get killed, it&#x27;s much more against expectations, so it hits harder. Though perhaps not as much anymore now that we all expect it.<p>This leads to an adoption problem: previously, a Lab that got enough attention might see a true release or be merged as a feature into an existing service. You could use it, not rely on it, and root for it to succeed. Now it&#x27;s all reversed. You don&#x27;t want to try a new thing out, you can&#x27;t ever rely on it, you have no way to distinguish a fully backed initiative from a spaghetti-hits-wall approach.<p>Basically, Google should resurrect Labs so people know where they stand on using these things.')
