Current RT implementations are faster at intersecting the mesh <i>along the ray direction</i> than sphere tracing (which require the expensive lookups or evaluations).<p>The distance to the surface is independent of direction, it is only a function of position (as all SDFs are).<p>The depth map is the distance from ray origin to intersection only, not how close that ray came to the surface at any point along it&#x27;s segment.')
