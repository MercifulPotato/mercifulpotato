From the (little) notes I kept, the corruption occurred with restic version 0.9.3. I had also tried restoring with the latest code from git master, but I didn&#x27;t make a note of the exact commit (it didn&#x27;t make a difference anyway).<p>The commands that triggered the corruption were the following. I tested the restore around the 10th run of this.<p><pre><code>    repo=sftp:chenxiaolong@&lt;ip address&gt;:&#x2F;home&#x2F;restic\n    restic -r &quot;${repo}&quot; backup -x &#x2F;home\n    restic -r &quot;${repo}&quot; backup -x --exclude &#x2F;stuff&#x2F;Android&#x2F;AOSP &#x2F;stuff\n    restic -r &quot;${repo}&quot; forget --keep-last 3 --prune</code></pre>')
