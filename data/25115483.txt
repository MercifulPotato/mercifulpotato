Even Sweden, which tried to avoid lockdowns, still saw an economic impact because <i>people will avoid going out during a pandemic</i>.<p>The fact that businesses are forced to close, or in the other case, that people would have been forced to work during a pandemic for fear of being homeless is a public policy failure.')
