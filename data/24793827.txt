Historically we have relied upon intuition, heuristics, and a network of trusted authority figures (usually a network of trusted institutions).<p>The modern condition (post Enlightenment) can be understood as the elevation of rationality over all else and hostility towards heuristics and intuition. Heuristics and intuition come from listening to your grandmother and from sources like the Bible and old folktales.<p>Furthermore the networks of trust and the institutions are completely and utterly corrupt, inhabited and headed by the worst (morally speaking) and dumbest people (intellectually speaking) in society. Think Harvard and The New York Times.<p>The typical modern person (including the vast majority of people on HN) are almost completely hopeless when it comes to what we would traditionally define as &quot;not being stupid&quot; (aka &quot;not being a sucker&quot;).<p>In your own life if you think of the stupidest people you know they tend to be the most &quot;intelligent&quot; (software engineers, PHDs, doctors, lawyers, etc). That&#x27;s modernity.')
