I know the design is often brought up but most vulnerabilities are implementation errors and bugs, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any mention of security (advisories, etc) on the Wayland web site nor does a web search bring up anything that woudl indicate there&#x27;s any active security focus.<p>What I&#x27;d expect to find is some description of the security guarantees they provide, and some active work (such as fuzzing with hostile clients), and tracking of found &amp; fixed vulnerabilities.')
