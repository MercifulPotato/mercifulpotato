Specifically, I bet him a steak dinner that Instagram would not have more users 12 months from now than it did today, this was right around the iPhone 4 times when Instagram was like, 100K users.<p>I believed at the time that filters was a flash in the pan gimmick that was making Instagram the fad of the day but they didn&#x27;t have any deep engagement loops that would drive long term return usage after people got sick of seeing someone else&#x27;s sunset with moire on it for the 200th time.<p>I wasn&#x27;t exactly alone at the time about this either.')
