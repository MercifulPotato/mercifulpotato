Rallying against &quot;cancel culture&quot; is as pointless as waging a war on drugs. There is no such thing as a &quot;culture&quot; of cancelling; it&#x27;s just a reaction people have, justified or not. People who rally against &quot;cancel culture&quot; seem to just be rallying against vaguely progressive beliefs they disagree with.<p>From the comments in this thread it seems the context is that the ACM started requiring an ethics section on papers. Hardly has anything to do with cancelling itself if you ask me.')
