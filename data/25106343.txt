I assume you just mean there are a lot of Republican apointees.<p>Part of the job of the Senate is to represent the minority. They typically aren&#x27;t the starting place for major legislation, but often slow down or heavily amend it.<p>You could argue that the minority should have no power at all, I suppose. Democrats used a similar argument to remove the judicial filibuster, which was a great idea right until they became the minority in the Senate.<p>That&#x27;s really the big lesson that people never seem to learn about democracy: you&#x27;ll be in the minority at some point, so get protections&#x2F;obstacles in place while you&#x27;re in the majority, or you&#x27;ll regret it sooner than you think.')
