Your language is an expression of your culture. So much of my personality, how I speak, words I use, etc has been formed by what I watched and listened to growing up. By the time you&#x27;re 20, it&#x27;s past the time to form that same experience. The difference between this speaker and someone who has learned to speak perfect English in their 20&#x27;s is that the former shapes the language as it continues to evolve while the latter simply learns (though that&#x27;s not to say that late learners don&#x27;t shape language.)')
