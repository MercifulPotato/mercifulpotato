Item(by='lioeters', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602787587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786624, text='I don&#x27;t know about &quot;practically harmless for youth and young adults&quot; - but as they say, I believe in your right to express your opinion.<p>Seeing the downvotes, I suppose the majority here disagree with the statement. But at least the comment is still readable&#x2F;visible. I think it&#x27;s healthier for public discourse to have differing sides and points of view expressed, to argue in a good sense of the term, by logic and evidence, to hopefully arrive at some common understanding.<p>&quot;Fact checking&quot; and judgements of &quot;misinformation&quot; are necessary, I can see, but a question remains - who checks the fact-checkers, and judges the censors?<p>I don&#x27;t trust Google to be a neutral party in such decisions - maybe in this particular case they&#x27;re right, but we shouldn&#x27;t depend on a for-profit corporation to be a trustworthy judge of anything in general.<p>Do they have the right to ban whatever they see unfit on their platforms? Yes, I think so.')
