No more NAT traversal wackiness caused by needing <i>both</i> a TCP connection <i>and</i> a UDP connection.  I still can&#x27;t figure out why SIP didn&#x27;t use TCP-over-UDP for the low-bandwidth control packets.<p>QUIC has protocol-level support for running both a reliable (TCP-like) and datagram (UDP-like) substream over the same QUIC connection.  Cannot wait for SIP-over-QUIC!')
