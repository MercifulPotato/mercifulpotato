It&#x27;s 55&quot; 4k but no HDR.  It was ~$850 CAD.  At the time, LG&#x27;s equivalent (spec-wise, as far as I could tell) &quot;consumer&quot; smart-tv was ~$1000.<p>The model I linked here, is $1000 CAD on amazon.ca (through 3rd-party sellers), but I don&#x27;t know how it compares.<p>Again that&#x27;s a few years ago so the market may have changed. And annoyingly, LG seems to have different products for Canada vs the US.')
