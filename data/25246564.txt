I miss the ugly comet cursors, the crummy MIDI tunes, the bad HTML, the encouragement to make new friends, and the ability to reach people without paying thousands in garbage ads.<p>I miss dating online without bribing some shitty algorithm. It used to be that I could click &quot;browse,&quot; find a cute girl&#x27;s profile, say hi, and set up a date within a few days. Modern social media is cold and hostile. Stay in your friend group. Avoid strangers: They&#x27;re all scary and bad. Don&#x27;t trust anyone (except for us, the tech company. Give us all your data for free.)<p>The internet used to be bohemian, weird, creative, tacky, and friendly. It was my favorite place to be. Where did that joy go? What have we become in the last 8 years?')
