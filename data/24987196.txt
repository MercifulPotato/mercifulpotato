It&#x27;s fine under thin acrylic sheet.<p>Yeah, the toner transfer method[1] produces superior results, but when it&#x27;s gear for my own use, I cant be bothered with the faffing around.<p>Sometimes I print photos too, just to have them around. With me it&#x27;s &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot;, so I like to have the physical object as a reminder of something.
