They have a nice app with auto-uploading of pictures, they dump them into a single folder with zero modification, preserving all metadata. Creating a photo album to share is as simple as putting all the jpegs into a folder and choosing &quot;share&quot; in their UI. You can create share links with the usual expected gradients of public accessibility, or you can share them with only specific authorized Dropbox users.')
