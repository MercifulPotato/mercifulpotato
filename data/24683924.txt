Winning an F1 race requires a huge amount of data processing, both for the operation of the race car itself, as well as for the simulations of race strategy in realtime.<p>The teams bring enormous amounts of equipment to each race. Obviously a lot of that equipment is wrenches, screwdrivers, and related machinery. But every team is bringing essentially a portable datacenter to each race:<p><i>The car has around 300 sensors and the SECU monitors over 4,000 parameters. During the course of a typical race the car will transmit around 3 GB of telemetry data as well as around 4 GB of logging, however this is just the seed for computation. When processed and combined with other sources such as audio and video analysis it can mean a team leaves a typical race weekend with over a terabyte of valuable data â€” data that is drawn on again and again before and during future events and seasons.</i>\n-- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eetimes.com&#x2F;the-importance-of-electronics-in-formula-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eetimes.com&#x2F;the-importance-of-electronics-in-for...</a>')
