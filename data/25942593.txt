The difference is, once that the HFT market maker <i>holds</i> the stock, they can get rid of it more easily (i.e. they can <i>close</i> the trade) because (the assumption is that) the retail flow is &quot;noise&quot; (uncorrelated with future price movements) as opposed to professional&#x2F;institutional traders (e.g. other hedge funds executing their strategies), where a big problem is negative selection (i.e. you&#x27;re more likely to execute a trade with someone that has better information than you).')
