What would be the next steps from admitting that the election was fraudulent?<p>Given the above, I&#x27;m not sure it matters. Of course that scenario is still possible, if evidence is produced. The institutional incentives align towards keeping the results as is. Proceeding from there, what can be done to restore trust?<p>*Disclaimer, please do not misread this as an assertion of evidence existing, not existing or the validity of it.')
