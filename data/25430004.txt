Also most of the world is on DOCSIS 3.0, so any older than that is DOCSIS 2.0 which would be max 50 Mbps which is not ... nice, and that&#x27;s DSL territory (VDSL2 does up to 100&#x2F;30 Mbps).<p>Being able to use your own modem would fix a lot of problems I have with DOCSIS ISPs, but sadly there&#x27;s no regulation for it. So yeah, you have to use theirs.')
