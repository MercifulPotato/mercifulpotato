The fact that it has extra platform features does not slow down the initial port.<p>I am also not sure what &#x27;additional goodies&#x27; you are referring to, for which specs are available (you can currently only use the neural engine through Apple&#x27;s framework)? The fact that it&#x27;s the first CPU (AFAIK) that is ARMv8.6-A?')
