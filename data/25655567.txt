Item(by='dehrmann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609919937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25653737, text='IANAL, only in Massachusetts, and it&#x27;s somewhat narrow:<p>&gt; We also conclude that Uber&#x27;s terms and conditions did not constitute a contract with the plaintiffs.  The app&#x27;s registration process did not provide users with reasonable notice of the terms and conditions and did not obtain a clear manifestation of assent to the terms, both of which could have been easily achieved. Indeed, a review of the case law reveals that Uber has no trouble providing such reasonable notice and  requiring express affirmation from it sown drivers.Here,in remarkable contrast,both the notice and the assent are obscured in the registration process.As a result, Uber cannot enforce the terms and conditions against the plaintiffs, including the arbitration agreement at issue here.')
