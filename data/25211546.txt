I mention it tangentially in this other comment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25211083" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25211083</a><p>I sense that some vegans give the impression that it&#x27;s totally OK to eat plants, and there are no repercussions. Or maybe that&#x27;s what meat eaters think vegans are saying. In my experience as a vegan, it&#x27;s not about plants versus meat. It&#x27;s about <i>let&#x27;s be more aware about the impact of our daily actions and strive towards optimal decisions</i>. (As I mention in the other comment) when I consider the health, environmental, ethical, and maybe even spiritual benefits of veganism, it clearly seems like a more optimal general strategy, both for myself and for the world.')
