Who is doing this kind of research into candidates? When I interview people I don&#x27;t have time to check out their entire social media history. There are also plenty of people that complain that their interviewers don&#x27;t take the time to check out relevant things like github so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in this. If your interviewer has the time to waste checking out your entire Twitter feed then that sounds like a possible sign of a dysfunctional workplace.')
