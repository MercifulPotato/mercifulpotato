It seems in practice the sole determining point for if you get marketed as a dictatorship or a shining beacon of democracy is how much the US State Dept likes you.<p>Another novelty of propaganda is we&#x27;ve been heavily indoctrinated for decades that dictatorships are inherently evil, yet ironically the one in Myanmar seems like pretty nice leaders.  Of all the dictatorships to topple in a military coup, it seems a shame to topple one that&#x27;s actually pretty nice folks.')
