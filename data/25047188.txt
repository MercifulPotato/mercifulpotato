Not great but I&#x27;m thankful to get more than the three or four I got for middle school nights due to the multitude of projects in which I was involved at the time - I ended up drinking five or six cups of coffee a day at the age of 13 and kept it up for a couple years. The knowledge I gained from all those sleepless nights (among other things I taught myself enough networking to make a public Minecraft server and made scripts for its upkeep, plus I learned a ton of shell so I could use Linux to squeeze out all the performance I could get from the spare laptop I had set up as a server) was worth it. My development might be a bit shot but I never did illegal recreational drugs in my childhood so it could always be worse.<p>But my thoughts? School would be much easier if we didn&#x27;t waste so much of students&#x27; time. Half the classes I took in middle school and elementary school were redundant. That&#x27;s the million dollar problem in education; how to tailor education for each student to make each succeed within their abilities, within the means of current school systems (which are underfunded, underutilized, and often manned by terrible human beings - fortunately that last point doesn&#x27;t apply to the high school from which I write this comment).')
