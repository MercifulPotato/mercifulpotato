We&#x27;d love to allocate to any provider we think is going to do the most for the climate. I&#x27;m happy  to forward they money to Stripe as well if they have better strategies for  this.<p>It seems fine to forward it to the team that Mark Robber and Mr. Beast put together (assuming they have done proper due diligence given  Elon &amp; Tobi have donated 1m respectively), until we find better strategies.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teamtrees.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teamtrees.org&#x2F;</a>')
